			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Plans for peace summit of political leaders revived in S Africa Plans for a peace summit of South Africa's main political leaders have been revived amid fears that the new state of emergency in Natal may not be able to contain violence, Patti Waldmeir and Michael Holman report in Johannesburg. Top politicians - including African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, President F W de Klerk and Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi  -appear to have discussed the meeting when they attended an Easter Sunday church service in northern Transvaal. Mr Mandela said afterwards that the peace summit, which was to have taken place last week, would be held on Friday. The death toll in Natal province since the state of emergency was imposed on Thursday stood last night at 61. In one of the worst weekend incidents, nine people, including a baby and five children, died on Saturday when a gang fired on a rural home near Port Shepstone. The family were said to be ANC supporters. South African defence forces were deployed in Natal since the imposition of the state of emergency in the province. A combination of the Easter holiday and a quiet response to the move by Chief Buthlezi, chief minister of KwaZulu homeland and the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini may have helped eased tension. Mr Mandela said last Thursday that he expected the controversial KwaZulu police force to be confined to barracks but the 4,000-strong force has been allowed to continue normal duties. The chain of command remains unclear and security force chiefs have referred the question back to Pretoria. Meanwhile, Chief Buthlezi's Inkatha Freedom Party appeared to be picking up support in Natal, according to the last public opinion poll allowed before the general election on April 27-29. A poll for the Johannesburg Sunday Times suggests that, if Inkatha had not boycotted the election, it would have been neck and neck with the ANC for control of Natal. The poll was conducted before the imposition of the emergency. National support for the ANC had fallen from 40.9 per cent last November to 31.9 per cent in March, the poll reported. Backing for Inkatha had risen from 18.7 per cent to 27.5 per cent. The paper suggests Inkatha's advance may be due to the entry in the political arena of the Zulu king with a demand for recognition of the Zulu nation.</p>

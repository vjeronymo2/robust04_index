			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Property: The 'forgotten county' of Herts and flowers - David Hoppit finds that average perceptions can be misleading A COUNTY bisected by railways and trunk roads, with serviceable rather than grand churches; the pioneer, flower-filled garden cities; and acres of glasshouses producing much of the capital's salads - that, at first glance, is the average perception of Hertfordshire. It is, according to John Lewis of estate agent Strutt and Parker, 'the forgotten county.' Hertfordshire is the bridge between London and the Midlands and the north, host to much of the creeping eczema that has been dubbed 'Subtopia'; a place to pass by. There is, however, the other face of Hertfordshire: the maze of lanes and sudden villages, with cricket on the green and real ale after evensong; the Hertfordshire so loved by the writer George Bernard Shaw. He lived at Ayot St Lawrence, choosing the village after spotting an epitaph on the grave of a 70-year-old woman proclaiming 'Her time was short.' Shaw decided that a village where a life of 70 years was considered short was the right place for him. He died there at the ripe old age of 94. It is true that the churches in the county are not so flamboyant as those in nearby Essex and Suffolk; the abbey at St Albans was not endowed with great wealth, so worshippers have to make do with tiny spires - known as 'Hertfordshire spikes' - instead of the grand affairs that dominate East Anglia skylines. Hertfordshire is not blessed with durable building stone. Much of it is dominated by the eastern humps of the chalky Chilterns. Village houses often are thatched; they tend to be half-timbered, and weatherboarding is common. A few are built of 'wichert,' a mixture of chalky marl and straw. Some are decorated with pargetting, found more commonly across in East Anglia. The Romans built their Verulamium (St Albans), one of their soldiers named Alban becoming Britain's first Christian martyr after his execution in AD 303; but Hertford, the fine county town well clear of the main roads, was a settlement long before the Romans came. Hertfordshire has far more large houses than Essex. Most notable is Hatfield House which was built in 1608 by Robert Cecil, the 1st Earl of Salisbury and secretary of state to both Queen Elizabeth I and King James I. The proximity to London and excellent hunting in the beech forests meant many other Elizabethan and Jacobean mansions were built; but it is the villages that provide the county's charm - places like Aldbury with its duck pond, whipping post and stocks (last used to punish a drunken villager in 1835). Hambro Countrywide, with a national total of 484 offices, reports a long-awaited buzz of activity in the county's housing market, especially among first-time buyers and people seeking new homes. Small houses cost about the same as in 1987. Among the larger houses, Strutt and Parker reports a 'patchy' market. Lewis has some fine temptations at present but says buyers remain extremely nervous. He explains: 'The county is divided into two distinct halves, the south being congested and criss-crossed by numerous trunk roads and motorways while the north is relatively unspoilt, with many attractive villages.' Hertfordshire is one of the smallest counties, and also one of the most-densely populated, but its property values are the highest in the country outside London. Before the recession started to bite, St Albans was said to have the most expensive houses of any town in the country except those within the M25 London orbital motorway. Among the exceptional houses on offer from Strutt and Parker is The Lordship at Standon, dating from the mid-16th century. The house, on a bend of the River Rib, was built by Sir Ralph Sadlier, who was appointed by Queen Elizabeth I as custodian of Mary Queen of Scots. It was once regarded as the social centre of the county. Offers of about Pounds 995,000 are suggested, to include the manorial title. In Shaw's beloved Ayot St Lawrence there is Ayot House, a Queen Anne property standing in pleasant parkland. The house has been divided and the major portion is being offered by Strutt and Parker for about Pounds 295,000.

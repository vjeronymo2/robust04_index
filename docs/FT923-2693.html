			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UN study says fuel price could rise by 9% next year WORLD commodity prices are expected to rise about 7 per cent in 1993, while fuel prices could climb 9 per cent, according to a UN study, Reuter reports from Geneva. However, petroleum prices may be constrained by a potential output increase from new capacity and by quota disagreements in OPEC. The United Nations Trade and Development Conference (UNCTAD) said in an annual Trade and Development Report that export prices for primary commodities may rise by about 1 per cent in 1992, after falling about 11 per cent last year, Food prices should prove the firmest, led by higher demand for cereals in central and eastern Europe and in sub-Saharan Africa. Cotton prices are expected to drop sharply because of record output and moderate consumption this year. Although prices of mineral raw materials are declining, and are expected to rise only slightly on average in 1993, non-ferrous metal prices are expected to rise steeply after declines this year. The UNCTAD report said prospects for tin prices appeared 'particularly promising if production cutbacks continue'.</p>

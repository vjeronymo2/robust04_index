			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Lamont presses industry to exploit opportunities MR NORMAN Lamont, the chancellor, today makes a renewed effort towards creating an economic upturn by insisting that British manufacturing performance should be 'a source of confidence and pride'. He is the latest in a line of ministers encouraging British industry to capitalise on the opportunities offered by the fall in interest rates and the change to a floating exchange rate since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism in mid-September. Mr Lamont, attacking those who were 'too quick to run Britain down', says the recession hid positive trends in manufacturing. International comparisons showed British manufacturing well-placed to take advantage of an upturn in the world economy. In a foreword released ahead of the publication of a Tory research department pamphlet on Britain's manufacturing record, Mr Lamont says that the economy abounded in 'self-denigrating myths'. Although manufacturing now accounts for a smaller proportion of national income and employment than it used to, for example, this is not evidence of decline but mainly a reflection of productivity gains. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, condemned Mr Lamont's comments as 'complacent and arrogant' when manufacturing output had been growing more slowly since 1979 than in any other leading industrialised country and 650,000 manufacturing jobs had been lost since the recession started. A survey from Manpower, the employment services company, also shows generally gloomy employment prospects for the first quarter of 1993, but says that job losses in manufacturing have stabilised and predicts that the clothing sector is even set to start recruiting labour. The survey of 2,000 companies found 10 per cent forecasting job increases and 26 per cent expecting further job shedding. The net balance of 16 per cent of employers forecasting job losses is worse than the first quarter of 1992 when the figure was 12 per cent. Banking remains the worst affected sector, with a net 36 per cent of employers surveyed predicting job cuts compared with 23 per cent in the first quarter of 1992. In the public sector, a net 27 per cent of employers are forecasting job losses, up from 16 per cent in the same period in 1992. In local government the net balance is 36 per cent. According to the survey the manufacturing sector is less pessimistic, with a balance of only 6 per cent of employers predicting job cuts. A net 6 per cent of employers in the insurance industry expect to recruit.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edo Zitnik from Strasbourg -- recorded] </F>   [Text] [Zitnik] President Kucan warned the Parliamentary  Assembly [of the Council of Europe] that greater Europe's  expectations following the fall of the Berlin wall have bumped  against big problems which gave rise to fundamentalisms of all  colors.    [Kucan] I am not worried by the revival of Bolshevism, at  least not in the countries that I know. However, I am worried  by the populist movements of all sorts, especially those that  are trying to place the demanding tasks of resolving difficult  issues that some nations are facing on others by constant  xenophobic search for enemies and an atmosphere of perennial  threats.    [Zitnik] The Balkans is a part of Europe and its divisions,  too. For as long as there is no peace in the Balkans, according  to Kucan, peace will be endangered everywhere on the old  continent:    [Kucan] The Serbian national question is the nucleus of the  Balkan crisis. It is as legitimate as all others, however, just  as with the others its resolution demands and permits only the  use of legitimate means and ways. A solution imposed by war  cannot be legitimate and thus not acceptable. Lasting peace  cannot be won by wars.    [Zitnik] President Kucan could not circumvent the Italian-  Slovene dispute, with which the Concil of Europe is well  acquainted even though, just like Brussels, it refuses to speak  out openly about it.    [Kucan] Slovenia would perceive the closing of the EU doors  as a new historic injustice. Because of some decisions that  have been made over the last few months such sentiments of ours  are justified. I do not believe that any country would like to  prove its strength and influence within the EU by obstructing  Slovenia's membership and making it conditional to its selfish  interests.    [Zitnik] President Kucan finally emphasized that Slovenia  expects special understanding for its position which is as  unique as the position of any other European country.</p>

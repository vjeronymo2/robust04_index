			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Strong dollar to dominate markets - Currency Markets A strong dollar will dominate foreign exchange markets this week after Friday's tightening of monetary policy by the US Fed caused a sharp rise in the US currency. Focus will now shift to the Bundesbank to see how the it responds. The D-Mark lost more than 3 pfennigs to trade on Friday evening around the DM1.76 level. The Bundesbank has recently been under pressure to cut rates, but the strength of the dollar will have made it more difficult to ease policy. Although the D-Mark weakened against most ERM cur-rencies on Friday, it may benefit this week from a flight into quality as investors respond to the greater un-certainty by abandoning some of the weaker ERM curren-cies such as the Spanish peseta. Analysts cautioned that markets should not get too bearish about the prospects for European currencies after the US move. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ, said conditions in Europe remained very disinflationary, and there was still scope for these countries to ease monetary policy. The market has recently responded positively to rate-cuts in Spain, Belgium and Denmark. Mr Hannah said he felt the market had been too pessi-mistic in its reaction to the US news. Interest rate futures in the UK, Germany and France all fell sharply on Friday's news. The June contracts in the UK and France, for example, both fell by seven points. Attention will switch back to the US on Friday for the release of the important Producer Price figure. If it is low, it will show that the Fed has acted in a pre-emptive fashion and that raising rates is a real tightening. Less bullish for the currency would be a high PPI number suggesting that the Fed was responding to inflationary pressures. Also in the spotlight will be the Canadian dollar, which plummeted on Friday after Mr Paul Martin, the Canadian finance minister, said their interest rates might go lower than those in the US. Traders said the central bank was forced to intervene to stabilise the currency. Observers said there was a real prospect of the Canadian currency going into free fall this week. Another area of attention will be Japan/US relations with President Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, scheduled to meet for trade talks in Washington on Friday.</p>

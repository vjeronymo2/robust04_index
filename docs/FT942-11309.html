			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Conservatives hurt in London suburbs Conservatives suffered unprecedented setbacks in London last night as both Labour and the Liberal Democrats won control of a series of councils, many of which were previously thought impregnable. The most wounding results were in the suburbs, with the Conservatives losing overall control of Bexley, Harrow, and Redbridge. They also came within one seat of doing so in Bromley. Labour also came within one seat of taking control of Havering, which was previously hung. Labour took control of Ealing, Enfield, Croydon and Hillingdon (which had already fallen in a by-election) from the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats enjoyed their strongest ever showing in the capital, seizing Kingston upon Thames and making double-figure gains in Bromley and Harrow. The Conservatives also failed to take overall control of Brent, where they had hoped to exploit memories of previous Labour administrations. Labour's problems with a generalised 'London effect', with voters punishing so-called 'loony left' councils, appeared to be at an end. Instead, this effect was limited to Lambeth, where Labour lost overall control after a succession of scandals, and Waltham Forest, where the party also lost overall control. Mr Tony Travers, head of the Greater London group at the London School of Economics, said that London had over recent years been moving 'further and further away from swingometer politics'. He added: 'London is beginning to break into a kind of new politics of a number of different two-way battles. It's the way the local electorate is coming to terms with a two-party system when it wants to have a three-party system.' In Enfield, Labour won 10 seats, overturning a Conservative majority of two. The borough, where Treasury chief secretary Mr Michael Portillo is an MP, had been Conservative-held for more than 25 years. Liberal Democrats were not a factor. Ealing was particularly humiliating for the Conservatives, after they had confidently predicted victory in the borough on the back of memories of past Labour administrations. Instead, they lost about 20 seats, including that of their leader, and Labour was able to crow that it was now trusted in a way that the Conservatives were not. But the 'London effect' seemed alive and well in Lambeth, where the Labour council has been accused of making unlawful payments of more than Pounds 20m. Early results showed the Tories had gained three seats from Labour, including that of the Labour leader, Mr Steve Whaley. The council seemed set to be hung. But in Kingston upon Thames the Liberal Democrats took control after a straight fight with the Conservatives. The Conservatives took limited solace from retaining Wandsworth, which has been lauded by the national party as a 'flagship' council for its policies for more than a decade. However, losing it would have been almost unthinkably humiliating for the Conservatives, and Labour campaigners had been careful to discount any suggestion that they could win the borough. In Tower Hamlets, much attention focused on the far right British National Party. The first result involving a BNP candidate showed a substantial increase in the far-right party's support since the last municipal elections 4 years ago. Although he did not win a seat the candidate achieved 653 votes compared with the party's 93 in 1990. But British National Party councillor Mr Derek Beackon, who won the far-right party's first-ever council seat in a Tower Hamlets council by-election last september, was defeated last night. He increased his vote from 1,480 to 2,041 but three Labour candidates in the Millwall ward all polled more than 3,000 each after a powerful campaign involving national Labour party figures. Tower Hamlet council's majority Liberal Democrat group, badly divided over the ramifications of the BNP by-election win, lost control of the council to Labour.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        THE RECORDS SET TO FALL  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lowest Tory share of vote in a nationwide election Tories to control lowest ever number of councils Record number of councillors for Lib Dems Labour at highest share of vote in nationwide election since the formation of SDP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

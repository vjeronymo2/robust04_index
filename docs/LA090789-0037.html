			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: EXIT LINES  </P> <P> Nugzar Ruhadze, the first Soviet journalist to work for a television station in  the United States, has completed a four-month stint at WXIA-TV in Atlanta and  is heading home with one major impression of Americans: their eagerness for  peace between the two nations. The message that he takes with him, he says, is  that "it is high time for us to be in closer touch, to be cooperating and to be  seeking love and friendship." While here, he produced stories on such topics as  Memorial Day, U.S. prisons, flag burning and the differences between the poor  and rich in America. WXIA hopes to bring back Ruhadze for six weeks in April,  barring objections from Soviet authorities. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

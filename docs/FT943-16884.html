			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru sells San Antoniode Poto gold deposits The rights to the vast Peruvian alluvial gold deposits known as San Antonio de Poto were successfully auctioned in Lima this week. Vegsa-Andes Corporation, a Peruvian consortium, outbid rival Brazilian and Colombian mining concerns with an offer exceeding Dollars 8.5m for the two deposits and the fixed assets. With the sale, handled by Morgan Grenfell, the Peruvian state rids itself of a huge but low-grade goldfield that it has never been capable of developing. The deposits, located on an inhospitable plateau some 5,000 metres above sea level, have been virtually abandoned for 20 years. Vegsa-Andes says it will commence dredging operations almost immediately, moving 1.5m tonnes of gold-bearing soil next year and 5.4m tonnes in 1996. The company will pay the Peruvian state royalties on all gold extracted varying between 2 and 10 per cent according to fluctuations in the international gold price. Revenue from royalties is expected to total about Dollars 2m a year.</p>

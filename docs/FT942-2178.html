			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / MPs probe Mersey Tall Ships losses Merseyside Development Corporation yesterday appeared before the Commons public accounts committee to defend its involvement in the lossmaking 1992 Tall Ships regatta on the Mersey, and the associated operatic concert. Mr Chris Farrow, corporation chief executive, said the event had been a one-off, and the corporation had not known the extent of the losses until the events themselves. He told the committee: 'I know of no other event in the region which has lost this kind of money.' Carroll Communications, the public-relations company set up to mastermind the events, was, he said, 'totally viable. The projections were viable.' It was not until the events themselves that the shortfall in ticket sales because of poor marketing became apparent. Ticket revenue was between Pounds 470,000 and Pounds 500,000, Mr Farrow said. This left a shortfall at the end of the day of Pounds 375,000. Much of this was met by the publicly funded development corporation. He agreed the promotion and hospitality budget at Pounds 202,000 had been heavily overshot. Mr Andrew Turnbull, the permanent under-secretary at the Department of Environment, told the committee that events such as the Tall Ships regatta would receive more clear guidance in future; that there would be more careful monitoring of expenditure, and that prospectuses would be more adequately vetted. The 1992 regatta, watched by more than 1m people, was the culmination of the Tall Ships Race across the Atlantic and back.</p>

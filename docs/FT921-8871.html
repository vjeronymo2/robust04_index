			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Maxwell stake in Hungarian paper sold MR ROBERT Maxwell's 40 per cent stake in the Hungarian evening newspaper Esti Hirlap has been bought by the Hungarian state-owned Newspaper Publishing Company. The government has repeatedly blamed negative media coverage for its poor showing in polls since the Hungarian Democratic Forum party ousted the Communists in free elections in 1990. The publishing house exercised pre-emption rights to buy the stake, taking its holding to 80 per cent. A few hours after the deal was concluded, Mr Denes Maros, the paper's editor-in-chief, resigned. Arthur Andersen, the administrators of the late Mr Maxwell's web of 400 private companies, declined to disclose the price received. Arthur Andersen is also negotiating to sell Mr Maxwell's 50.01 per cent stake in the morning newspaper Magyar Hirlap, and Mr Maxwell's Hungarian printing interests.</p>

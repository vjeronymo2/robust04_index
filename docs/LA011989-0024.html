			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE KITCHEN CABINET: HIGHER TECH IN IMPROVED COOKTOPS  </P> <P> Slowly, yet surely, the old electric range surface is being replaced in  kitchens all over the world by a sleek-looking cooktop. It's attractively  smooth. No more ugly burners sticking out. No nooks and crannies to clean.  (Remember how much extra time and effort you had to spend scrubbing those  grease-laden coil systems and rusted drip bowls, lest they become an eyesore in  the kitchen?)  </P> <P> The revolutionary, high-tech, smooth top is made of a heat-resistant glass  ceramic surface -- impervious to spills, grease and encrusted deposits. (Don't  mistake this for the old ceramic surfaces that developed instant heat stains  that were difficult to remove.) Today, this new cooking system accounts for  about 60% of all electric range sales in West Germany, 50% in Switzerland and  Austria and 45% in England. More than a dozen U.S. and Canadian appliance  manufacturers are now incorporating this system into their electric ranges.  Also, based on positive surveys, industry experts project an additional 75  million purchases over the next decade.  </P> <P> By now you've probably seen this new cooktop surface in ranges by companies  such as Amana, Dacor, Gaggenau, Caloric, Miele, Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, Maytag,  Modern Maid, Roper, Kitchen Aid, Sears, Tappan, Creda and Thermador. Flush to  the countertop and looking extremely simple by way of its subtle smoothness,  there's more to the system than meets the eye. An intricate ingenuity lies in  both the composition of the glass panel as well as in the heating elements  hidden beneath the cooking surface.  </P> <P> Here's an inside story from the primary supplier of this product: Schott  America, a subsidiary of Schott Glaswerke of Mainz, West Germany. Called the  Ceran-Top-System, the unit consists of the following: a black glass-ceramic  panel; the hidden heating elements and their mountings; a steel frame has a  metallic finish or comes in one of several colors, and the burner controls.  </P> <P> The attractive glass-ceramic panels are translucent, nonporous and available in  several decorator designs with a wonderful variety of cooking zone placements.  But beauty is not only skin-deep; these glossy panels are made to withstand  constant temperatures of more than 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit. Sudden and severe  temperature changes do not affect them and as a result they don't crack or  warp. Another functional consideration is that they are designed to transmit  heat efficiently from the hidden burners directly up to the cookware, with the  rest of the surface remaining cool.  </P> <P> Depending on individual wants and needs, the Ceran systems are available with a  variety of electric heating options. The latest electric cooking systems  include radiant, high-speed, ballast, "quicklight" and halogen, the last of  which is attracting attention as an energy-saving concept. If you like the  instantaneous on-and-off response of gas, the halogen elements uses halogen  light bulbs that glow red when hot.  </P> <P> The beauty of this whole system is that all the heating coils and mountings are  hidden beneath a glass panel and are designed with consideration for safety and  maximum efficiency. The burners range from six to nine inches in diameter, some  designed with dual circuits to accommodate two sizes of cook pots. Temperature  limiters, which prevent the cooktop from overheating and aluminum pots from  melting, are standard equipment.  </P> <P> Speaking of pots, the manufacturer recommends a few simple rules of thumb to  get the best performance:  </P> <P> "Match the cookware and the cooking zone. The base of the pot or pan should be  as wide as the cooking zone on which it's used to get maximum efficiency and  shortest boiling times.  </P> <P> "Use heavy cookware with flat, smooth bottoms. Nothing fancy is required.  Commercially available pots and pans are fine. If made of metal, use thick  gauge. All cookware when hot, should sit flush on the cooking surface. Pots and  pans with flat, stainless-steel sandwich bottoms have produced the shortest  boiling times and maximum efficiency."  </P> <P> Cleaning, of course, is a cinch. Ordinary spills can easily be cleaned with  recommended cleaners applied to a moistened sponge or cloth. Avoid wool and  abrasive cleaners and treat spills that contain sugar immediately. Burnt  deposits can be easily removed with a razor-edged glass scraper.  </P> <P> Many buyers are attracted to this system by the bright red glow of the heating  elements that are visible through the glass-ceramic panel. Combined with this  visible glow, an indicator light that remains on until the surface is cool to  the touch ensures safe operation of the cooktop.  </P></p>

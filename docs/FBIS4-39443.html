			<p>BFN     [Text] The agreement on partnership and cooperation between  Russia and the European Union is "virtually ready to be signed,"  an aide to Russia's Deputy Premier Aleksandr Shokhin told  INTERFAX on Tuesday.    Shokhin is in charge of preparations for signing the  agreement.    As the aide said, the problems, that could hinder the  signing  of the agreement during the EU summit to be held on the Greek  Island of Corfu on June 24-26, have virtually been resolved.    Only the insignificant differences with Greece concerning  privileges for merchant ships remain to be settled. Greece  wants such privileges to be spread to its ships going under the  flags of other countries, such as Panama and Liberia. As for  Russia, it insists that the privileges must be applied only to  the ships going under their own nation's flag.    According to the source, these differences can be viewed as  "technical issues". He said he is firmly confident that the  agreement between Russia and the EU will be signed during the  upcoming EU summit.    Earlier, during a visit to Moscow by France's Foreign  Minister, Alan Juppe, and his talks with Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin, Paris withdrew its reservations concerning  Russia's trade in nuclear materials. It's common knowledge  that, like Russia, France is a major supplier of fuel for  nuclear-power plants in Europe.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> SHAKY 'AFTERSHOCK' VIEWS FAMILY CHASMS  </P> <P> They keep telling us that the "big one" is coming, with a vengeance. It's going  to lay us out flat, kick some tail. The future includes one mean rumbler, and  none of us are really prepared.  </P> <P> Orange County playwright Allison Gappa agrees with the Red Cross and everybody  else who keeps warning us about earthquakes -- indifference is suicidal, and  education and readiness are the ways to prevent disaster. The Red Cross sends  out pamphlets; Gappa wrote "Aftershock," now premiered at the small Way Off  Broadway theater in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> With only the best intentions, Gappa's play tries to do many things, especially  inform us about the dangers while keeping us following the melodrama that is  unleashed after a 9-point-something quake forces a feuding family into an  underground bomb shelter. "Aftershock" is part survival kit, part soap opera  and part religious sampler.  </P> <P> It's also a pretty rough piece of theater. The dialogue often sounds false, and  certain scenes are weak and contrived. There are also a few continuity  problems, the most obvious being the earthquake's carnage -- in the first act,  the McNamara family and assorted in-laws apparently don't want to leave the  shelter because it would be a hellish 10-mile walk to town, but the second act  has them trapped under tons of rubble.  </P> <P> Oh well. These may be mistakes Gappa can correct. It'll take some work, though.  </P> <P> Gappa and set designer Robert Wilson have given "Aftershock" a sense of reality  when it comes to preparedness. The look is right, with bottled water, canned  foods, vats for waste and all the other necessities required to survive the  days following a quake. Gappa, who also directs, said she was counseled by the  Red Cross, and it shows.  </P> <P> However, in trying to make the play a theatrical event, she tends to lose  proportion. The "big one," by all accounts, will be terrifying and destructive,  but Gappa likens it to a nuclear attack. Trees are ripped out by their roots,  the landscape is leveled and characters ask each other what kind of "world"  remains. They seem to think the earthquake has wasted the entire globe, not  just Southern California.  </P> <P> The physical and mental impact on the McNamaras is graphic. Just about everyone  gets hurt, and mother Hilda (Laurel Koelsch) ends up bedridden with a bloody  blow to the head. It's very intense.  </P> <P> The pressures reveal that the three daughters, especially pretty model Melissa  (Denison Glass) and icy lawyer Lenore (Brenda Fogarty), don't dig each other.  They squabble non-stop. Melissa's photographer husband (Tony Reverditto) snorts  cocaine and devilishly snaps flash pictures of everybody. Web (Ron Althouse), a  family friend, takes off his shirt and puts the moves on Lenore. The local  pastor (Brendan Beach) tells everybody to have faith in God. He tells them that  a lot.  </P> <P> But the wildest stuff is left for dad (Thomas Reilly), an ex-Navy man who built  the shelter and has his annoying good sense vindicated by the quake. He screams  at everybody to get with the program. He starts ordering folks around. He gets  red in the face and shakes one of his daughters. In short, he turns into a  subterranean Capt. Queeg.  </P> <P> Way Off Broadway has acquired a reputation for being a little wacky, and this  first act has its wacky moments, all right. It even has a certain cockeyed  charm, especially when Reilly does his thing and Reverditto sasses about.  </P> <P> But "Aftershock" is resigned to have a bittersweet but generally happy ending,  and the second act ties up loose ends in various clumsy ways. All the domestic  battling stops -- the girls start getting along, the photographer says no to  drugs and is nice to everyone and Web and Lenore begin courting. Even dad  mellows out (one character says, "I guess it just took the opening of the earth  to open his heart.").  </P> <P> The aftershocks finally stop. They dig through. There's light outside. The  pastor says a long prayer, and the play ends.  </P> <P> 'AFTERSHOCK'  </P> <P> A Way Off Broadway premiere of Allison Gappa's drama. Directed by Allison  Gappa.

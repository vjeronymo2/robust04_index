			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Wave goodbye to crackly music Anyone tired of waking up to scratchy music on the radio alarm clock will welcome a new product by Bose, the Boston-based sound system manufacturer, writes Victoria Griffiths. The clock radio, the first to make use of 'wave' technology, sounds better than most stereo sets. Wave technology filters the sound through a twisted plastic tube and has inspired the miniaturisation of high-quality speakers. The product was launched in Europe this week, at a cost of about Dollars 500 (Pounds 322.50). Bose: US, tel 508 879 7330; fax 508 872 6541</p>

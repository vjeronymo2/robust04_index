			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Myth of technology and competitiveness Sir, It was most welcome to read Guy de Jonquieres' arguments against the high-tech bandwagon (Economic Eye, July 11). Myths about high technology have become very influential, leading the European Commission, among others, to argue that improved performance in high technology is a central route to increasing competitiveness. This view is not consistent with the evidence. Assessing trade performance in the 1980s on the basis of export shares and the net trade balance, it can be shown that - of the six largest economies - the three with the best trade performance were Japan, Germany and Italy, which had their best performance respectively in high, medium and low technology. The two worst performers, the UK and the US, had their best performance in high technology. The US's competitiveness deteriorated in particular in medium-technology products. Innovation is not the sole determinant of competitiveness - it is not equivalent to R&amp;D, nor is R&amp;D equal to high technology. One of the UK's problems is the managerial failure to translate R&amp;D into innovation rather than too low a level of R&amp;D. At the same time, many small and medium-sized enterprises innovate without doing formal R&amp;D. Not only is competition in high-tech sectors not the key route to competitive success, it is becoming increasingly costly. Increased costs and increased competition equal lower profits. Consequently, since the 1980s, companies have increasingly chosen to collaborate - with many international joint ventures in R&amp;D occurring between US, Japanese and EU companies. One outcome of this is a process of technological levelling, the outcome of which will be a much greater emphasis on factors other than R&amp;D in international competition. These developments pose great challenges for technology policy in the EU and in individual countries - at present these challenges are not being taken up.

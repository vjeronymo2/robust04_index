			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOLIDARITY EDITOR WILL BE PREMIER;  </P> <P> MAZOWIECKI, A LONGTIME ACTIVIST, EXPECTS FORMAL SELECTION TODAY  </P> <P> In a dramatic reversal of 45 years of Communist rule in Poland, President  Wojciech Jaruzelski is expected today to offer the post of prime minister to  newspaper editor Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a longtime opposition activist and a key  Solidarity adviser.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki, 62, known as a soft-spoken conciliator among his Solidarity  colleagues, met for two hours with Jaruzelski on Friday and afterward told  reporters that he expected a formal offer of the post from the president.  </P> <P> "I am ready to accept it," he said.  </P> <P> There was no certainty about when the announcement might come, but a  presidential television message is scheduled for 6 p.m. today, following a  meeting of the Communist Party's Central Committee. Political observers assume  that Jaruzelski will discuss his move with the party's leadership before making  it public.  </P> <P> "We had long talks with the president, which were very fundamental, concerning  all important issues," Mazowiecki said. "I think there will be solutions very  soon."  </P> <P> Mazowiecki (pronounced mah-zoe-vee-ET-skee) spoke in his customarily calm  manner with a crowd of journalists trailing him through the parliament building  as he arrived for a meeting with Solidarity's leadership. He was asked when he  expected to name a government.  </P> <P> "I wish I knew that myself," said the editor of the Weekly Solidarity  newspaper. "There is great social impatience, but this is to be a government  formed on a completely new principle, and I need some time."  </P> <P> The new principle is the nearest approach to a parliamentary democracy in  Eastern Europe since the region was politically colonized by Soviet dictator  Josef Stalin at the end of World War II.  </P> <P> The acceptance by Jaruzelski of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa's plan for a  government led by Solidarity appears to spell the end of another principle  dearly held by Communists: the leading role of the Communist Party in the  affairs of the state.  </P> <P> "This is definitely the final nail in the coffin of the leading role of the  Communist Party," said Janusz Onyskiewicz, the Solidarity spokesman. "This is  the end of the whole concept."  </P> <P> In Kennebunkport, Me., where President Bush is spending a summer vacation,  White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater held out the possibility that  greater U.S. assistance for Poland might follow a change in the government  there.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Added U.S. Aid Now  </P> <P> But for the time being, he said, "it is really premature" to think about  increasing U.S. aid to Poland beyond the approximately $100 million that Bush  pledged during a visit there last month.  </P> <P> "We don't have a lot of money to offer," Fitzwater said, referring to the  federal budget deficit. But, he said, "It is something we would have to  consider down the road."  </P> <P> Beyond expressing encouragement for a shift to a non-Communist government, as  officials have done in the past, the White House spokesman declined to comment  on the prospects for change in Warsaw, saying formal White House reaction would  await an official announcement there.  </P> <P> Among the parade of Communist officials calling on Jaruzelski on Friday was  Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, the new Communist Party chief, who has lately been  exhorting rank-and-file Communists to respond boldly to what he calls "a  struggle for power" in Poland.  </P> <P> However, it seemed unlikely that Rakowski or other party hard-liners would be  able to derail the Mazowiecki nomination. Under Polish law, Jaruzelski, who  recently stepped aside as Communist Party leader to assume his duties as  president, must submit his nomination for prime minister to the Sejm, or lower  house of Parliament, for approval.  </P> <P> With Solidarity's forces in the Parliament augmented by two new coalition  partners, the United Peasants' Party and the Democratic Party, the election of  a Solidarity candidate is virtually assured. The Solidarity alliance now  controls the Sejm by 264 to 196.  </P> <P> It was Walesa and his envoy Jaroslaw Kaszynski, a Solidarity deputy in the  Sejm, who negotiated the coalition with the United Peasants and the Democrats,  persuading the two minor parties -- with 103 votes between them -- to abandon a  40-year-old partnership with the Communists and come over to the Solidarity  side.  </P> <P> The switch by the two parties was the keystone in Walesa's shrewdly calculated  drive to back the Communists into a corner with his campaign for a  Solidarity-led government -- a move he decided on himself, even though his key  advisers had been saying for months that Solidarity was not ready to form a  government.  </P> <P> Amid mounting speculation over whether there should be a Solidarity government  -- and whether Walesa himself, with his enormous prestige in the country, would  head it -- the designated prime minister, Czeslaw Kiszczak, was unable to  recruit a Cabinet. He announced Monday that he was ready to give up the  attempt, which was the point at which Walesa's forces came together.  </P> <P> Walesa's comments throughout the last 10 days suggested that he would be  willing to serve as prime minister, but Solidarity members say it is now clear  that he had no intention of taking the post. But by keeping open the  possibility, he ensured that the drive for the coalition would be accepted both  by Solidarity's Sejm deputies and by the United Peasants and Democrats.  </P> <P> Walesa met Thursday with Jaruzelski, who accepted Walesa's plan along with his  choice for prime minister.  </P> <P> Solidarity officials said after the meeting that two other names beside  Mazowiecki's were mentioned: Jacek Kuron, a blunt-spoken and sometimes  controversial opposition activist, and Bronislaw Geremek, a cerebral professor  of medieval history who heads Solidarity's Sejm delegation. But Mazowiecki,  insiders say, was the choice Walesa conveyed to Jaruzelski.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Skilled Mediator  </P> <P> Among Mazowiecki's qualifications for the job, colleagues say, are his skills  as a mediator and a thoughtful tactician. However, some colleagues say that  Mazowiecki was more suitable to Walesa than Geremek, whose bolder style and  ambitions could one day conflict with the Nobel Peace Prize winner's.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki has been a close adviser to Walesa for years, and his credentials as  an opposition activist are impeccable. Unlike both Kuron and Geremek, who were  once members of the Communist Party, Mazowiecki, closely associated with the  Roman Catholic Church, has never been a member of the party.  </P> <P> He joined Solidarity at the outset, circulating a petition among intellectuals  in support of the shipyard strikers in Gdansk in August, 1980. After the  martial-law crackdown in 1981, he was jailed for a year. But he was back in the  shipyard, at Walesa's side, in the strikes of April, 1988, the first walkouts  by the union since its banning in 1982.  </P> <P> "There are huge troubles," Mazowiecki said Friday. "But I believe we can  overcome them. If I didn't believe, I would never have taken this up. I am a  believer, and I believe that Providence takes care of us."  </P> <P> He said he had hope that "people will feel things can be better."  </P> <P> History, he said, "has shown in several moments that Poles can strive for new  solutions, unusual and innovative ones. I hope that such a psychological moment  is arriving now, that people will feel that there is a situation in which our  future depends on us."  </P> <P> Times staff writer James Gerstenzang, in Kennebunkport, contributed to this  story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE MARCH TOWARD POWER  </P> <P> Key events in the history of Poland's free trade union movement:  </P> <P> Aug. 14, 1980 -- Lech Walesa leads workers in occupation of Lenin Shipyard in  Baltic port of Gdansk amid strikes over meat price increases.  </P> <P> Aug. 31 -- Gdansk strikers and government sign accord allowing free trade  unions and the right to strike.  </P> <P> Dec. 13, 1981 -- Communist leader Wojciech Jaruzelski declares martial law,  interns thousands of Solidarity figures, including Walesa.  </P> <P> Oct. 8, 1982 -- Parliament passes bill officially dissolving trade unions,  including Solidarity.  </P> <P> July 22, 1983 -- Jaruzelski lifts martial law.  </P> <P> Oct. 5 -- Walesa is awarded Nobel Peace Prize.  </P> <P> Sept. 11, 1986 -- Government amnesty frees 225 political prisoners, including  Solidarity leaders jailed for clandestine activities.  </P> <P> April, 1988 -- Government price increases spark beginning of first major labor  unrest since martial law.  </P> <P> Feb. 6, 1989 -- Solidarity starts talks with Communist authorities aimed at  pulling Poland out of economic and political crisis.  </P> <P> April 5 -- Solidarity and government negotiators sign agreement to amend 1982  trade union law to legalize Solidarity.  </P> <P> June 4 and 18 -- In first partly free elections for Parliament in 42 years,  Solidarity wins 260 of the 261 seats it sought.  </P> <P> July 19 -- National Assembly elects Jaruzelski president of Poland by narrowest  possible margin.  </P> <P> July 25 -- Walesa meets Jaruzelski and proposes creation of a Solidarity  government.  </P> <P> Aug. 2 -- Czeslaw Kiszczak is appointed prime minister.  </P> <P> Aug. 7 -- Walesa calls for Kiszczak to make way for non-Communist government  grouping Solidarity with two small parties.  </P> <P> Aug. 14 -- Kiszczak abandons efforts to create Communist-led "grand coalition"  government with Solidarity as junior member.  </P> <P> Aug. 15 -- Walesa says Communists can keep Defense and Interior ministries in a  Solidarity-led government.  </P> <P> Aug. 16 -- United Peasants' and Democratic parties bolt coalition with  Communists to join coalition with Solidarity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> POLAND'S TOP TWO JOBS  </P> <P> A comparison of powers and duties of president and prime minister:  </P> <P> PRESIDENT  </P> <P> Office of presidency was restored this year after 37-year absence. Former  Communist Party leader Wojciech Jaruzelski now holds the office. Chosen by  joint vote of Sejm and Senate, president serves six-year term as head of state  and may run once for reelection. President also:  </P> <P>  -- Is commander in chief of armed forces, may declare state of war or state of  emergency when he judges that security threat exists and may rule for up to  three months without consent of Parliament.  </P> <P>  -- Must ratify international agreements; appoints and recalls ambassadors; may  veto legislation passed by Parliament, subject to two-thirds majority override.  </P> <P>  -- May dissolve Parliament and call new elections in limited circumstances,  e.g., if Parliament fails to choose government or pass budget within three  months of being seated, or if Parliament passes laws curtailing president's  powers.  </P> <P> PRIME MINISTER  </P> <P> Prime minister is head of government, serving for four-year term of Sejm, lower  house of Parliament, unless recalled by president and voted out of office by  majority of Sejm. This official is nominated by president and elected by simple  majority of Sejm. Prime minister also:  </P> <P>  -- Assembles Cabinet to direct government's activities and runs ministries  that control Poland's state-sector-dominated economy. Cabinet must be approved  by lower house.  </P> <P>  -- Is responsible for day-to-day actions of government; drafts and proposes  laws to Parliament, as well as annual budgets and national plans for economy.  </P> <P>  -- Leads weekly Cabinet meetings and controls all important government  personnel decisions.  </P> <P> Source: Associated Press  </P> <P> SOLIDARITY'S MAN: Key union adviser "a moralist, not a politician."

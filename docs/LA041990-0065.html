			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: CABBAGE SALAD RECIPE CHANGED TO REDUCE FAT AND CALORIES  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: This salad is one I have enjoyed many times in the past; however,  I am now on a low-fat diet. As you can see by the ingredients, one cup of salad  oil does not meet low-fat standards and the amount of sugar seems high. Do you  think you could modify this recipe and still leave it tasting about the same?  </P> <P>  -- ELIZABETH, Orangevale, Calif.  </P> <P> CABBAGE SALAD  </P> <P> 1 head green cabbage, thinly sliced  </P> <P> 1 bunch green onions, chopped  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds  </P> <P> 1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds  </P> <P> 1 package instant Soba noodles, cooked and drained  </P> <P> 5 tablespoons sugar  </P> <P> 1 cup salad oil  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons MSG  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 7 tablespoons white vinegar  </P> <P> Combine cabbage, onions, sesame seeds, almonds and noodles in large bowl. Set  aside.  </P> <P> Combine sugar, oil, MSG, pepper and vinegar. Pour over salad and mix  thoroughly. Refrigerate, stirring every couple hours to marinate. Makes about  12 cups.  </P> <P> Note: Salad is best made 1 day ahead.  </P> <P> DEAR ELIZABETH: I had to go to several markets to find the noodles, so if you  don't have an Oriental market or a nearby large market with a well-stocked  ethnic food section, you might want to experiment with some other kind of  noodle such as linguine broken in short pieces and slightly undercooked, then  well drained.  </P> <P> The changes I have made substantially reduced the calories from fat, yet still  retained the flavor range that makes this salad so delicious. Dark sesame oil  instead of sesame seeds and apple-juice concentrate instead of sugar both  worked beautifully. I deleted the MSG since it is not necessary and I prefer to  avoid MSG in all recipes.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE  </P> <P> HEALTHY CABBAGE SALAD  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped raw almonds  </P> <P> 1 (8-ounce) package instant Soba noodles  </P> <P> 1 head green cabbage, thinly sliced  </P> <P> 8 green onions, chopped  </P> <P> 1/2 cup frozen apple juice concentrate, thawed  </P> <P> 1/2 cup rice vinegar  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons dark sesame oil  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> Toast almonds at 350 degrees 8 to 10 minutes until golden brown. Watch  carefully since nuts burn easily. Set aside.  </P> <P> Bring 6 cups water to boil, add noodles and boil 2 minutes. Drain thoroughly.  Combine cooked noodles, cabbage and onions in large bowl. Set aside.  </P> <P> Combine apple juice concentrate, vinegar, oil, salt and pepper, mixing well.  Pour dressing over salad and mix thoroughly. Refrigerate several hours,  stirring occasionally so all ingredients are thoroughly marinated.  </P> <P> To serve, place 1 1/2 cups salad on large plate and top each serving with 1  tablespoon toasted almonds. Makes about 12 cups, or 8 (1 1/2-cup) servings.  </P> <P> Note: Salad is best made 1 day ahead.  </P> <P> Each serving contains approximately:  </P> <P> Original Recipe:  </P> <P> Calories: 505  </P> <P> Cholesterol: 0 mg  </P> <P> Fat: 34 gm  </P> <P> Sodium: 200 mg  </P> <P> Revised Recipe:  </P> <P> Calories: 283  </P> <P> Cholesterol: 0 mg  </P> <P> Fat: 11 gm  </P> <P> Sodium: 196 mg  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> No Decision by USDA: No decision has been made on how to squeeze $2 billion out  of farm programs to meet federal spending goals, but analysts are looking at  all possibilities, Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter said. "We'll find a  way to do so, because that's a requirement of the (budget) process," Yeutter  told reporters. About $2 billion will have to be whittled from programs in the  fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Those cuts were not specified in the budget  proposals submitted by the outgoing Reagan Administration in January and were  left open to be negotiated with Congress. Options for cutting USDA farm program  spending include further reductions in target prices for major crops, including  wheat, corn and cotton. Those are prices used in a formula to help determine  federal subsidies to farmers who participate in annual crop programs.  </P></p>

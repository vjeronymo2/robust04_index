The expulsion will include members who supported other  political organizations during the recent campaign and those who  were candidates of political parties with which AD had no  alliances. The National Executive Committee also appointed a  commission to conduct a political analysis of the departments to  prepare for the national convention.    As for the new government, AD Organization Secretary Lewis  Perez reiterated that his party will support all things deemed  positive for the country, even though National Convergence and  Movement Toward Socialism voted against AD leader Carmelo Lauria  in the Chamber of Deputies.    [Begin Perez recording] The AD will support any action or  decision made by President Rafael Caldera that will benefit the  country. We are going to remain critical of and follow closely  the implementation of the government program proposed by Caldera  during the recent campaign. [end recording]    It was also revealed that the National Executive Committee  will hold a special meeting this week for members to review the  country's fiscal and economic situation and establish a solid  position on the measures to be implemented by Dr. Rafael Caldera.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Atsushi Kanda, Defense Agency director </F> general, by unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter on 11 May at the  Defense Agency in Tokyo]    [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] In your first news conference as  Defense Agency head, you stated the government may change its  interpretation of the Constitution concerning the possible use  of collective defensive rights over the suspicion on the DPRK's  (North Korea's) nuclear weapons development. What is your  comment right now?    [Kanda] The use of collective defensive rights is not  allowed in Japan, and the Defense Agency should stick to the  government's current stand on constitutional affairs.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you mean your remarks at the news  conference were just your personal opinions?    [Kanda] No, I do not. At that time, I probably misled some  of you by using inappropriate words.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa also said he  thinks the government should review its interpretation of the  Constitution...    [Kanda interrupting] Everybody has his or her opinion on the  Constitution because Japan is a democratic nation. Even in the  future, various opinions will surface. Yet, the prime minister,  the foreign minister, and other cabinet members met on 10 May to  reconfirm the Hata administration's stance not to change the  government's stance toward constitutional issues.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you think the Japanese Government can  adequately deal with future problems within the current  interpretation of the Constitution?    [Kanda] That is right.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Kazuo Aichi, former Defense Agency director  general, once said the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] Law may be  revised within the framework of the Constitution. Do you have a  definite plan for that?    [Kanda] I am not determined yet. Basically, we think it is  preferable to seek a peaceful settlement by patiently persuading  North Korea to accept inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA].    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Some quarters say, in the post-Cold War  world, Japan should contribute more to the United States to  ensure security in the Far East based on the Japan-U.S. Security  Treaty. What is your opinion on that point?    [Kanda] Some people actually say the nature of the  Japan-U.S. security alliance should be changed to catch up with  trends in the post-Cold War period; however, it is still  uncertain what the global framework for the post-Cold War period  will be. In this sense, I still attach importance to the  Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Are you going to promote the "arms  reduction" policy advocated by former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa?    [Kanda] The future direction of Japan's defense policy is  being discussed at the government's advisory Defense Affairs  Council, and I would like to hear the advisory panel's opinion.  While the trend of disarmament is spreading over the world,  Japan is still under certain military pressures in North East  Asia. I would like to composedly deal with my tasks in view of  various circumstances, rather than blindly going for arms  increase or reduction policies.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] In 1995, the government should review the UN  Peace Cooperation Law. Do you want to unfreeze a ban on SDF  participation in UN peace enforcement forces?    [Kanda] Japan's participation in UN peace enforcement forces  should be discussed as a long-term goal, but Japan must avoid  use of military forces overseas. I personally take a prudent  stance toward the issue.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Hata administration was inaugurated as a  minority government. What are the possible impacts on the  defense policies?    [Kanda] To seek the Social Democratic Party of Japan's  return to the coalition, I would like to leave room for  negotiations.</p>

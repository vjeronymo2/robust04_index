			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Rey Rodriguez] </F>   [Excerpts] Ohn Gyaw, the minister of foreign affairs of  Myanmar [formerly Burma], today expressed to Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina his country's willingness to explore  new channels of collaboration between the two countries. At an  official meeting during the Cuban foreign minister's two-day  visit to Burma, Ohn Gyaw spoke with Robaina about bilateral  relations -- which both termed good -- and about projects of  common interest, which are to be studied. [passage omitted]    Robaina's visit, the first to Myanmar by a high-level Cuban  official, is considered a reaffirmation of the relations of  friendship maintained by the two nations despite the distance  separating them. Today Robaina had several meetings with  government officials and visited several developing communities,  as well as one of that country's universities. Tomorrow he will  be received by the president [title as heard] of Myanmar, Than  Shwe, after which Robaina will leave for Cambodia on the third  leg of this trip through a number of Asian nations.    This has been a report by Rey Rodriguez from Rangoon,  Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.</p>

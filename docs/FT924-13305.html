			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Bush battles to close poll gap PRESIDENT George Bush, struggling to regain ground in the last 19 days of the US presidential campaign, last night strongly defended his trade policy and decried those who favour protectionism. 'Free and fair trade is the answer, not protectionism. We've had tough economic times and it's exports that have saved us,' Mr Bush said in the second of three televised debates with Mr Bill Clinton, his Democratic challenger, and Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate. Answering the same question, Mr Clinton said he favoured more trade but on fair terms. 'The trick is to expand our export base and expand our trade on terms that are fair to us,' he added. Perched uncomfortably on high stools, the three candidates fielded questions from an audience of 209 uncommitted voters in Richmond, Virginia. Although Mr Bush briefly embarked on an attack on Mr Clinton's character and student opposition to the Vietnam war, the audience quickly made clear it was unhappy with the mudslinging in the campaign for the November 3 election. Mr Perot attacked the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) recently negotiated by President Bush with Mexico and Canada, warning that it would open the way for many businesses to transfer jobs to Mexico. 'There will be a giant sucking sound going south,' he said. But Mr Bush said that exports had saved the US during the current global economic slowdown, and said Nafta would not mean job losses to Mexico. The debate came as latest opinion polls showed Mr Clinton still well ahead of Mr Bush and Mr Perot. A CNN/USA Today poll gave Mr Clinton a 15-point lead over the president, based on voter surveys conducted in the three days after Sunday's first presidential debate. It showed Mr Clinton with 47 per cent support to 32 per cent for Mr Bush and 15 per cent for Mr Perot. But another poll, by ABC News, showed that Mr Bush might at last be starting to cut into Mr Clinton's lead, because it showed the Democratic challenger just seven points ahead. The poll, conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday, gave Mr Clinton 44 per cent of the vote to 37 per cent for Mr Bush and 11 per cent for Mr Perot.

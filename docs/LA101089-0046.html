			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN'S BODY FOUND IN CHARRED APARTMENT  </P> <P> A 33-year-old Boyle Heights man who had threatened to kill his mother and "take  out" his neighbors set fire to the bedroom in his apartment, and then shot  himself in the head early Monday, authorities said.  </P> <P> Dwight Manning's badly burned body was found at dawn in the charred bedroom,  which was crammed with old rock 'n' roll records and tapes, paramilitary garb  and weapons manuals.  </P> <P> "There was a bullet wound in his head and a gun was found near the body," said  Los Angeles Fire Department arson investigator John Little.  </P> <P> Although neighbors reported being awakened by a powerful blast that rattled  windows in the area about 2:45 a.m., Little said "there was no indication of a  bomb or an incendiary device."  </P> <P> Instead, Little speculated that the explosion could have been caused by a back  draft of air that ignited when flames engulfed objects in the room, such as  furniture and books.  </P> <P> Manning's mother, Brigitta Manning, 65, blamed the apparent suicide on problems  her son was having finding work.  </P> <P> "He couldn't get a job," she said. "Nobody wanted him."  </P> <P> Neighbors, however, described the tall, lanky man as a short-tempered,  emotionally unstable recluse who occasionally emerged from his room -- dressed  in combat fatigues, black boots and a beret -- to swear at them or deliver  hand-written death threats on their doorstep.  </P></p>

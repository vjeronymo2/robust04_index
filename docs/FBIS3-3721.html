By the end of last year more than three million surplus  farmers had found jobs in rural industrial businesses, creating  6.3 billion yuan in profits and taxes. Some found new jobs  outside the province with the help of local specially  established labor markets, contributing 6.6 billion yuan to the  local revenue.    Nevertheless, Gansu still has more than two million rural  people with not enough to eat and wear, according to local  officials.    To help more rural residents become well-off, the provincial  government designated in 1992 Wuwei and six other counties and  cities to experiment with finding new jobs for local farmers,  with the purpose of promoting the transfer of surplus labor  throughout the province to profitable sectors.    The experimental counties and cities have adopted various  measures, including developing rural industries to increase job  opportunities and organizing rural farmers from remote areas to  find jobs in areas outside Gansu through local labor markets.    Meanwhile, some cities and counties have also built rural  farmers' markets, adjusted the agricultural production structure  and expanded eco-agriculture, which have proved to be effective  in relocating surplus rural labor.    In addition, the provincial government has launched an  experimental job-creation project at the provincial level with  the aim of tapping rural surplus labor.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Part one of three-part article by 'Uthman Mirghani: "First </F> Pictures of Al-Turabi in Canadian Hospital After Attack on Him"]    [Text] On 3 December last year, the trial of the  37-year-old Sudanese citizen Hashim Badr-al-Din ended in Canada.  He was charged with attacking the 62-year-old head of the  Sudanese National Islamic Front (NIF), Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, who  in the world's eyes is considered the spiritual guide and  director of the present government in Khartoum. The verdict by  the 12-person jury declared the defendant Badr-al-Din innocent  of the three charges against him (two counts of assault and one  count of assault causing grave injury). They did so because  support to uphold the case was lacking due to contradictions and  discrepancies in the statements of the prosecution witnesses.    Instead of lowering the curtain on the case, the verdict has  raised more debate. The verdict was received in Khartoum with  further charges that "foreign agencies" had "engineered a plot."  The Sudanese media attacked the Canadian court's decision as  biased and unjust. Criticizing the verdict at a press conference  in Khartoum, Dr. al-Turabi said it was not fair. He noted that  the attack had targeted him not as an individual, but as "a  symbol of the Islamic revival." The Popular Arab Islamic  Conference (a grouping of radical, fundamentalist, leftist, and  nationalist movements that al-Turabi heads), which was meeting  in Khartoum when the verdict was announced, issued a statement  attacking the court's decision.    These reactions agreed in explicitly or implicitly charging  foreign agencies with involvement in a "conspiracy" targeting  al-Turabi and attempting to liquidate him. Al-Turabi was  explicit about the matter in his talk to journalists after the  Popular Arab Islamic Conference meeting. "There is," he said, "a  complete organization behind the attack"--the one that targeted  him in Canada. He indicated that "senior European officials"  were involved, but he refused to identify them.    The charges were a restatement of what Sudanese agencies,  al-Turabi's family, and some Arab fundamentalist movements  linked to al-Turabi's organization said in the first days after  the attack about 19 months ago. The Sudanese media talked from  the beginning about an attempted assassination. Many NIF  proteges wrote in newspapers about how there were hidden hands  and foreign parties behind the case. A few days after the  episode, al-Turabi's family issued a statement signed by Hasan  al-Turabi's son, Sadiq al-Turabi, accusing foreign agencies of  standing behind the attack and hinting that the attacker was "a  tool of other agencies."    The statement leveled a number of charges against the  Canadian authorities. It charged them with having refused to  provide Dr. al-Turabi with protection during his visit, which  included Toronto and Ottawa. The police were said to have  arrived on the scene about 20 minutes after the incident. It  took about an hour to transport the victims to the  hospital--from the occurrence of the incident to arrival at the  hospital. Al-Turabi's family demanded that the Canadian  authorities issue full information about the incident and its  circumstances. They warned that failure to maintain "justice and  fairness in the proceedings of the case would lead to  complications caused by injustice."  <H5>  Conspiracy Theory </H5>   Al-Turabi himself supported the conspiracy theory when about  two months after the incident he spoke at a press meeting about  how more than one agency was behind the attack. He indicated  that two countries were involved, but refused to name them,  saying that "the time has not yet arrived for that." Others  linked to Dr. al-Turabi by family or organizational ties joined  in, though without leveling charges at one particular agency and  without producing proof and documents to support the conspiracy  theory. Al-Turabi himself once talked about "a complete  organization behind the attack." On another occasion he spoke  about the involvement of "senior European officials," and on a  third occasion about "the involvement of two countries."    On the other hand, the Canadian police indicated that they  had found no other suspects in the case and pressed charges  against Hashim Badr-al-Din alone. During the trial sessions, the  defense attorney indicated that his client, Badr-al-Din, had  attacked al-Turabi in moments of anger and excitement. If he had  really wanted to kill al-Turabi, he could have done so while the  NIF general secretary lay covered on the ground in front of him,  unconscious after his head had hit the floor following the  Badr-al-Din's blow that had struck him.    The defense attorney also stressed that his client had not  attempted to flee. Had the episode been planned, he would have  fled. He had an opportunity to do, as it took some time for the  police to arrive on the scene.    Badr-al-Din himself repeatedly insisted that the attack had  been an individual act and that his motives had been political.  He said that he had been at Ottawa Airport by coincidence to say  goodbye to a friend, when he saw al-Turabi and his followers  suddenly enter the airport. One should note that al-Turabi  changed the time of his plane from 1800 to 1900 in the evening,  a change known to only a few of the NIF general secretary's  aides and Sudanese embassy officials in Ottawa.    Badr-al-Din justified the attack as an expression of "a  feeling of injustice with regard to what the Sudanese people  were suffering from NIF rule." He said that he "rejected what is  being practiced in Sudan today in the name of Islam--things of  which Islam is innocent." In questioning, at the trial, and in  his statements to the press, he denied having used karate in  striking al-Turabi. He said that if he had wanted to use a  karate technique, he would have used his foot in the attack, as  most of his strength was concentrated in his foot.    Badr-al-Din, who is a religious man and a Sufi, said he had  been involved previously in heated debate with other members of  the NIF leadership, with which he says he disagrees strongly. He  spoke of a confrontation and altercation between himself and  'Ali 'Uthman Muhammad Taha, al-Turabi's deputy in the NIF  leadership, in New York before a crowd of people and of  altercations with other NIF leaders in other countries, all of  them acrimonious. He said he should have liked to argue with  al-Turabi, had the opportunity arisen for him in Canada.  <H5>  Conflicting Statements by Witnesses </H5>   Argument over motives and circumstances will continue, given  the sharp disagreement of viewpoint and accounts between the two  sides and given the contradictions and discrepancies among the  prosecution witnesses who appeared before the Canadian court  that heard the case. Perhaps the witnesses' contradictory  statements played the greatest part in influencing the decision  of the jury and the court, especially after one of the three  main witnesses, Muhammad Ibrahim Rashid (a Somali who was one of  al-Turabi's guards when the attack occurred) changed his account  several times. In his statements after the incident describing  the attack to the police, Rashid said that Badr-al-Din had  attacked him also, just as he had attacked al-Turabi and Ahmad  'Uthman Makki (one of al-Turabi's close aides who helped arrange  the trip to the United States and Canada). During the trial,  Rashid changed his account to say that he had been in the second  car that accompanied al-Turabi to Ottawa Airport the evening of  25 May 1992 (the evening of the attack). He did not see the  attack, because he entered the hall of the airport a few minutes  after al-Turabi and Ahmad 'Uthman Makki, at which time he saw  al-Turabi stretched out on the floor, bleeding, while  Badr-al-Din stood near al-Turabi shouting hostile political  slogans.    Under intense cross-examination by the defense attorney,  Rashid admitted that he had not seen the attack on al-Turabi and  that Badr-al-Din had not hit him personally, but had only tried  to do so. Faced with the defense attorney's insistence, his  pressure, and his demand for an explanation of the discrepancy  in Rashid's statements, the witness admitted that his first  statements had not been correct, and he told the court that  Ahmad 'Uthman Makki had suggested that he make such statements.    It was clear throughout the court sessions that the strategy  of Badr-al-Din's defense attorney was based on showing  discrepancies among the statements of the witnesses. He also  concentrated on uncovering any gaps in the testimony of the main  prosecution witness, Ahmad 'Uthman Makki. Therefore the most  heated court sessions were those that witnessed sharp  confrontations between the defense attorney, Gary Barnes, and  Makki, who is also considered an NIF leader. He has been  responsible for NIF publicity and for coordinating NIF  activities and contacts in the United States. The defense  attorney demanded clarification of the motives for al-Turabi's  visit to Canada and whether it had taken place in the name of  the Sudanese Government or in the name of an international  Islamic organization. He also insisted on knowing the agency  that had funded the trip. He rejected witness Makki's assertion  that "a friend" whose identity he did not reveal had arranged  the funding.    In a rapid-fire exchange of questions and answers, the  defense attorney asked witness Makki about Dr. al-Turabi's  position in the current government in Sudan--whether he was the  real ruler or had influence in the government--and in what  capacity he had visited Canada. Makki replied that al-Turabi was  a noted religious figure and that he had visited Canada in that  capacity and had discussed many general issues. As for the  extent of his influence on the present Sudanese Government, he  said it was a matter of debate and individual opinion.    However, the defense attorney insisted on obtaining a more  exact definition of al-Turabi's position. Makki replied that  al-Turabi presently holds the position of general secretary of  the Khartoum-based Popular Arab Islamic Conference. Taking up  the same thread once more, the attorney asked whether this  organization was part of an international Islamic organization.    Attempting to prove his claim that al-Turabi led an  international organization, the defense attorney went on to ask  Ahmad 'Uthman Makki about his personal position and current  source of support, why he divided his residence between Sudan  and the United States, and about his organizational ties with  al-Turabi.    During the discussion about his residence in the United  States, Makki was forced to withdraw his previous statements to  the court that the reason for his presence in Chicago had been  to obtain a graduate degree from the university there. About his  source of support, he said he was drawing a salary from the  Islamic Call Organization.    Replying to the defense attorney's questions, Makki  mentioned  that he was not working in the present government, nor had he  worked in previous governments in Sudan. He said his relation  with al-Turabi was one of friendship, not a party relationship  between a leader and his follower. He denied being a member of  the Muslim Brotherhood, saying that he had left the organization  65 years ago because of disagreements over certain matters.  <H5>  Member of Parliament </H5>   When the attorney insisted on knowing whether the witness  was  a member of any political organization, Makki said he was  connected only with a cultural, religious, and social  organization--the NIF, which he refused to call a political  party. However, the attorney returned to continue his questions  on another occasion and asked Makki to inform the court whether  during the now-ended democratic period he had ever become a  member of the Sudanese Constituent Assembly (Parliament)  representing a particular body. Makki answered affirmatively,  saying that he had won as an NIF candidate.    As for his present job and capacity, Makki said he was an  Islamic missionary in an international Islamic organization  called "Islamic Call." When the attorney during one session  asked about the capacity in which he had stayed as a guest of  the Sudanese charge d'affaires in Canada during his visit with  al-Turabi to Ottawa, Makki replied that it had not occurred  because he had a governmental capacity, but only because he had  been a friend of the charge d'affaires since their student days  together at Khartoum University. The attorney then questioned  before the court how Makki could say that he and al-Turabi had  no official capacity when he had already mentioned that the two  had informed the Sudanese charge d'affaires of the tenor of  their conversations with Canadian Government officials before  heading to Ottawa Airport, where they were attacked.    The defense attorney also got into an intense argument with  Ahmad 'Uthman Makki over his description of the attack at the  airport. Because Makki's testimony was vital to the progress of  the case, the attorney tried to cast doubt on it or demolish it  completely by proving the existence of contradictions or  discrepancies in it. For example, when Makki mentioned that he  tried to intervene to protect al-Turabi by throwing himself on  him while the general secretary was stretched out motionless on  the floor because of Badr-al-Din's blow that had struck him, the  attorney intervened to say that the witness's version was  inexact and that there were witnesses who could appear in court  to say that the witness had quickly retreated when Badr-al-Din  struck him and had taken refuge in the area behind the airport  escalator. Makki rejected the attorney's assertion and said he  would be surprised if any witnesses said he had hidden behind  the escalator.    The defense attorney also contested Makki's testimony that  the defendant Badr-al-Din had tried to escape after his attack  on al-Turabi. Attorney Barnes said that a number of witnesses as  well as policemen had stated that Badr-al-Din remained in his  place inside the airport until the police arrived 20 minutes  later and arrested him.  <H5>  Al-Turabi, Looni </H5>   During the questioning in court, the defense attorney  indicated that al-Turabi had used an alias while in Canada. He  referred to this name as Looni (Martin Looni, according to some  sources). The defense attorney asked Makki whether he and  al-Turabi were traveling under their real names. Makki replied  that he himself had entered Canada under his real name, but he  indicated that al-Turabi may have traveled under the name of H.  'Abdallah. (Al-Turabi's full name is Hasan 'Abdallah al-Turabi).  When the attorney asked Makki whether he knew a person named  Looni and whether al-Turabi had used the name on his trip, the  witness replied in the negative.    Regardless of the name that al-Turabi used on his trip, he  certainly used an alias when he arrived in Ottawa. For this  reason, airport security officials, who did not know that  al-Turabi was in the airport on that day, became confused. It  should be noted that they were trying to wait for him in order  to provide him protection.    The available information indicates that Canadian  intelligence sent the Ottawa police a warning about possible  danger to al-Turabi, especially after the protest demonstrations  that confronted him during his European and American tour and  after he reached Toronto. But it seems that an error occurred  because of technicalities in the Canadian system: instead of  informing the Gloucester police, who have jurisdiction over the  airport, intelligence directed its information to the Ottawa  police.    An inspector named Phil Lockett from the Gloucester City  Police, which has jurisdiction over the airport, informed  AL-MAJALLAH that they learned of al-Turabi's arrival at Ottawa  Airport only at a later time, the morning of the day he arrived  to meet officials in the Canadian Foreign Ministry. He indicated  that the information they received from intelligence came late.  Lockett added: "The error came about because we were not  informed of the alias under which al-Turabi was traveling. Thus,  when we looked for al-Turabi's name in the airport records, we  did not find it."    Similarly, no one informed the airport of the change in the  scheduled departure of al-Turabi's plane from Ottawa to Toronto  the evening of 25 May. The security men waited half an hour at  the airport. When al-Turabi did not arrive, they left the area,  thinking that he might have changed his schedule.    Al-Turabi in fact arrived about 20 minutes later, and the  confrontation and attack then took place.  <H5>  Questions About Medical Report </H5>   Other questions were raised during the trial, particularly  regarding al-Turabi's state of health immediately after the  attack. The medical report submitted to the court, as well as  the testimony of the physician Vasco da Silva, who supervised  the treatment of al-Turabi, revealed that the NIF general  secretary suffered a slight concussion to the brain and light  swelling on the left side of the back of the head. Swelling was  visible on his upper lip and some blood in his nose when he  arrived at Civic Hospital in Ottawa the evening of 25 May after  the attack on him.    The report indicated that al-Turabi spent his first night in  the hospital's intensive care room. He was breathing normally.  His blood pressure and heartbeat were also normal. Dr. da Silva  told the Ottawa court that when al-Turabi was brought to the  hospital, he responded to the verbal instructions he heard, but  his replies to questions were not clear or logical.    Da Silva said that al-Turabi was moved the next day (26 May  1992) from intensive care to the brain surgery ward. He  mentioned that he allowed a Sudanese physician to examine  al-Turabi at the request of the patient's family and that the  physician advised using certain drugs in the treatment.    A deterioration in al-Turabi's health became visible after  the third day in the hospital. Surveying and mapping operations  indicated a larger concussion to the brain. Al-Turabi completely  lost the power to speak and appeared severely fatigued and  dizzy. He therefore had to be returned to intensive care.    According to the physician's report, about a week after his  admission to the hospital, al-Turabi developed a reaction to one  of the drugs given him. The defense attorney at the trial  questioned why Dr. da Silva had allowed another physician from  outside the hospital (the physician that al-Turabi's family  summoned) to examine al-Turabi and interfere in his treatment.  The attorney also raised a number of other questions about  whether Dr. da Silva knew al-Turabi's medical history. The  doctor denied any knowledge of it.    The subsequent deterioration of al-Turabi's health raised  questions. There was a discussion of whether the blow he had  received during the attack had caused the damage or whether his  head's hitting the floor had caused the concussion.    Al-Turabi remained in the Canadian hospital about 25 days.  Not until 13 June 1992, 19 days after entering the hospital, did  he regain his ability to talk, according to the medical report  submitted to the Ottawa court.    Indications by the physician that al-Turabi may need long  subsequent treatment in a specialized European or American  hospital have raised speculations about the effects of the  incident on him.    [Box, p 22]  <H5>  The Attack </H5>   The attack on al-Turabi took place the evening of 25 May  1992  at Ottawa Airport.    Al-Turabi was trying to catch a plane from Ottawa to  Toronto.  With him were NIF leader Ahmad 'Uthman Makki and a Somali  companion named Muhammad Ibrahim. There was also a Pakistani  with Canadian citizenship named Ziyad Muzaffar, who helped  arrange the NIF general secretary's visit to Canada.    Hashim Badr-al-Din, according to accounts, was at the  airport  saying goodbye to one of the Sudanese who had come from Toronto  to take part in a protest demonstration against al-Turabi in  Ottawa.    According to statements by Hashim Badr-al-Din and  eyewitnesses, when Badr-al-Din saw al-Turabi hurry into the  airport, he ran toward him shouting political slogans in Arabic  and English: "Murderer, murderer! Terrorist, terrorist!"    Ahmad 'Uthman Makki tried to block Badr-al-Din and push him  away, but the latter slapped Makki hard with his right hand,  forcing him to retreat.    Hashim Badr-al-Din says that he struck al-Turabi a single  blow on the face. Al-Turabi fell; his head struck the floor, and  he lost consciousness.    The Somali companion, Muhammad Ibrahim, tried to grab Hashim  Badr-al-Din, but the latter wheeled round and pushed him back;  so Ibrahim withdrew. Ziyad Muzaffar also tried to approach  Badr-al-Din, but stopped when the latter turned to confront him.    Badr-al-Din remained in his place shouting his political  slogans. The police arrived on the scene about 20 minutes later.  An ambulance arrived afterward to take al-Turabi and Makki to  the hospital.    Badr-al-Din revealed in his statements that he was taken to  the hospital for treatment of his hand, which was bleeding. He  said that during the scuffle between him and al-Turabi, the  latter bit him on the hand.    Badr-al-Din was taken later to the police station to make a  statement. He was released two days later to appear in court on  2 June 1992, at which time he was charged with three counts of  assault.    Because al-Turabi made no statements to the police, the only  versions of the incident were those by Hashim Badr-al-Din, Ahmad  'Uthman Makki, Muhammad Ibrahim, and Ziyad Muzaffar, in addition  to a few Canadian eyewitnesses who had been at the airport.    Al-Turabi did not appear in court. The prosecutor said that  the NIF general secretary had informed the authorities that he  recalled no details of the attack.

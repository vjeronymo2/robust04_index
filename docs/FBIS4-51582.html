			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Mon. -- The Royal Malaysian Air Force  [RMAF], which is buying MiG-29 air superiority fighter jets from  Russia, wants a simulator for training to be included in the  package.    RMAF Chief Lt. Jen. [Lieutenant General] Datuk Abdul Ghani  Aziz said today this was a problem because the Russians did not  manufacture simulators to train pilots prior to their flight  training.    "To overcome this problem, we are looking for manufacturer a  of simulators to come up with one for th MIG-29.    "However, we need to deal with the problem of intellectual  property rights as the Russian aircraft manufacturer has to  allow data on the MiG-29 to be fed into the simulator  manufacturer's computers before such a machine can be built."    Abdul Ghani was asked what was holding up the contract,  believed to be worth between RM [Malaysian ringgit] 1.2 billion  and RM1.6 billion, for the jets despite the Russians being early  on the scene compared with their United States' rival, McDonnell  Douglas, in pitching for the supply of new aircraft.    Unlike the Americans, the Russians had been pushing for the  sale of their aircraft as early as 1992 and had even got the  contract drafted out as late as last year.    Abdul Ghani was speaking to reporters after a courtesy call  from his Philippines counterpart Major General Nicasio Rodriguez  at his office at Wisma Pertahanan here.    Rodriguez had earlier called on Armed Forces chief Jen. Tan  Sri Borhan Ahmad.    Abdul Ghani said it was important that the RMAF obtained a  simulator to train its new pilots, especially to deal with  emergencies.    "Some of the crashes involving new pilots are due to pilot  error ... they are not able to handle situations such as  simulated emergencies." he added.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Ground for optimism Investing in ground rents - the small, annual payments made by owners of leasehold property - might seem an obscure way of generating above-average returns. But investors seeking a high, secure income may be interested in the Freehold Income Trust (FIT). This unit trust, which invests in ground rents, announced a year-end income distribution - paid gross - of 10.2 per cent this week. Over the year, the offer price of the units rose by 5.9 per cent. The trust - which has attracted about Pounds 1m of investors' funds - owns the freehold of 1,700 flats and houses in London, the North and Midlands. Its income stems from collecting the ground rents, ranging from Pounds 1 to Pounds 300 a year, from these properties. The income from its portfolio is considered to be secure because, in the case of default, the freeholder ranks ahead of a leaseholder's mortgage lender. But the trust's income will change over time because it is affected by the price at which it buys additional portfolios of ground rents. Based on present property purchases, the trust expects next year's income to be similar to that of the last. Last year's rise in the value of the trust's units stemmed from an upwards revaluation of its ground rent portfolio. It also made a capital gain of Pounds 1,900, as a result of selling the freehold of two houses to their leaseholders. Leaving aside capital gains, the future value of the units is likely to fluctuate in line with the market for long-dated gilts. The FIT is an unauthorised unit trust. This gives it the flexibility of being able to borrow, but it also means that it should not be seen as a liquid investment. Although the trust aims to cash in investors' units on demand, it has the right to postpone payment for up to 12 months.</p>

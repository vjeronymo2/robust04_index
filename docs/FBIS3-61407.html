Raw material and the intellect - these are the basic wealth  of our Fatherland which, at the present historical juncture, are  the only basis of social-economic transformations. Much is said  and written about raw materials. The intellectual resource, of  course, also is of colossal economic potential. If it is not to  be lost...    However we are losing it. Expenditures for science at the  beginning of 1980s were 4.5-4.7 percent of the national income;  in the past and current years they are about one percent. And,  the national income itself has dropped. The technical  armamentarium of national science which, even without this fact,  constitutes just a little more than 1 percent of the U.S. level,  continues to fall. The average salary of a scientist here is  approximately half that in industry; in America the proportion  is the reverse. A substantial number of our more highly  qualified specialists are emigrating. Thus, in the NASA system  alone (USA) more than 100 of our former citizens are engaged in  space-related research. In Israel 90 percent of  military-industrial complex specialists are former Soviet  citizens. In France, 30 percent of mathematics teachers hired in  the universities in the past year are Russian.    All these are merely particular facets to the dangerous  process which is already turning into a catastrophe for Russia.    National technological security is an integral part of a  more  general concept, the national security. A clear definition of  the latter remains to be developed on the basis of a formulation  of contemporary and future national state interests of Russia.  However, the alarm must be struck quickly in the case of an  obvious threat to these interests. Otherwise, no formulations at  all will be needed.    The task of ensuring technological security can be  represented as a system of measures directed toward the  maintenance of the maximally achievable level of the development  of the domestic scientific-technical and production potential  given any development in the international situation. This  refers to a level which would guarantee the survival of the  national economy through our own intellectual and technical  resources, which would guarantee its defense adequacy and  economic independence. The most evident signs of the breakdown  of the countryUs technological security is the disintegration of  the national scientific and technical potential and the  formation of a one-sided technological dependence on the more  developed Western countries. Today Russia is experiencing the  influence of both of these factors. Moreover, there is on hand a  process of intense disintegration of RussiaUs  scientific-technical potential in the form of the erosion of its  personnel component, brain drain, deterioration of the  material-technical and information base of science, the lack of  demand for scientific and technical achievements, etc.    Domestic science and technology, in particular, have been  placed in circumstances in which their further development has  begun to a substantial degree to depend on Western material and  financial assistance. However, even with the outwardly entirely  positive role of this assistance, it even now carries within  itself the anlagen of further disintegration of national  technological security.    Analysis of the forms and methods of the rendering of  financial and material support to Russian science by the West  (the amount of the help, both actually furnished as well as  promised, amounts today to nearly half a billion dollars, or  almost 500 billion rubles at today's dollar exchange rate) shows  that, apart from a large number of positive factors, it also has  definite negative consequences.    Above all, the system of information collection itself,  concerning scientific developments, institutions, and research  personnel for the submission of applications to receive grants  and other forms of assistance from foreign organizations  (scientific establishments, funds, international organizations,  etc.), offers the West the possibility of possessing an  exhaustive notion of the contemporary state and problems of the  development of the Russian scientific-technical potential, to a  degree of knowledgeability that Russian governmental bodies  responsible for the development of domestic science and  technology do not have.    It seems appropriate to point out that by now more than 10  different funds have been established in the West for the  support of science in Russia and the other countries of the CIS.  Among these are the well-known Soros Fund (USA), which has  allocated $100 million to the countries of the Commonwealth for  1993-1994, the National Science Fund of the USA ($25 million),  the McArthur Foundation ($3 million), and the Mitterand Fund, a  general European fund (4 million ECU).    The detailed knowledgeability regarding our potential  enables  the West to identify the most promising lines of research and  the most qualified and productively working scientific personnel  for their later use in one form or another in the interests of  the development of Western science and technology, and economy  as a whole. The financing of the work of individual Russian  scientists and of scientific collectives through the system of  foreign grants and other forms of assistance, the provision of  contemporary research equipment, instrumentation, and materials,  and other forms of aid to the general extent indicated above,  which is also comparable to the extent of domestic financing of  Russian science (680 billion rubles in 1993), have yet another  negative aspect. This offers the West the possibility of  destroying a substantial portion of the scientific-technical  potential of Russia from the solution of urgent national  economic scientific and technological problems confronting it,  thus creating in our country a peculiar sector serving the needs  of the Western economy. In truth, whoever pays the piper calls  the tune.    Moreover, the possibility arises of the closing down of  particular lines of development of Russian science and  technology, even of blocking them, especially in those fields in  which the particular achievements might prove competitive on the  world market for the industrial products prepared on their basis.    Due to the substantial (up to 60-100-fold) difference in the  pay of the Western and the Russian scientist, the West thus  saves a great deal of money for science. On the other hand, the  receipt by Russian scientists and specialists of currency from  Western grants and other assistance leads to social tension in  scientific collectives, and places scientific establishments and  institutes under obviously unequal conditions. In their race for  currency wages, given the acute deficit in domestic investments  in science and technology, many scientists and whole scientific  collectives are ready to sell scientific and technical  achievements abroad for nothing, which in a number of instances  exceed the world level and which constitute a genuine national  property of Russia.    The latter phenomenon is especially dangerous in the sphere  of the military-industrial complex, since it is directly related  to the weakening of the country defense potential. This practice  has become very noticeable recently; however, measures for its  control had not been worked out. In fact, the transfusion to the  West of a substantial portion of RussiaUs national wealth is  taking place without equivalent compensation.    It must be stated, regrettably, that the question of  RussiaUs  technological security has somehow fallen from the field of view  of the countryUs leadership. The blunder that has been  permitted, which is of strategic significance, must be  eliminated as fast as possible, since the process of undermining  the national technological security has reached a limit beyond  which it takes on an uncontrollable character.    From our point of view, the core of the preservation and  strengthening of Russia's national technological security under  the new conditions must be the principle of equal technological  dependence of the partners in international collaboration, to be  formed exclusively under the conditions of international  scientific-technical cooperation.    This principle presupposes the openness of Russian  scientific-technical potential to the outside world, and  rejection of autarchy, which corresponds to the spirit of  economic reform, RussiaUs interests, and the interest of the  international community. We have in mind also the equivalence of  the potential damage to the partners in case of a rupture in  international technological relations. There is a stake in the  guarantee of an even-handed, synchronized technological  development of the participants in international collaboration,  which excludes the possibility of their lagging markedly one  behind the other or of one outstripping the other.    The reality is such that the preservation and growth of the  scientific-technical potential of our country is possible only  given the provision of the optimal combination of internal and  external sources of influence. External factors will probably be  predominant in todayUs conditions. However, Western aid in its  various forms should not simply be welcomed, but the appropriate  mechanism for its most effective acquisition, distribution, and  use in the interests of Russia should also be created.    The viability of domestic science, and consequently, the  technological security of Russia can and must be achieved  through our own efforts, through the mobilization of internal  sources and reserves, above all through broad state support of a  national scientific-technical potential. It is advisable above  all to strengthen the legal foundation. For this purpose a  package of laws should be adopted regarding scientific-technical  policy, the scientific academies of Russia, the academic  scientific institution, the status of the scientific worker, and  the protection of intellectual property, state and other  secrets. An ensemble of legislative and normative acts,  regulating the process of brain drain both from Russia abroad  and from the countries of the former USSR into Russia is also  required.    It would make sense to create a data bank on Russian  scientists and specialists (including undergraduates and  graduate students) who would be able to go abroad for possible  on-the-job training or contract work. A data bank on Russian  technologies of interest for potential foreign partners is also  a practical necessity, with the aim of possible commercial sale  without harm to the countryUs security. It is evident that this  logically presupposes also the creation of an interdepartmental  authority (similar to the existing Gostekhkomissiya [State  Commission for New Technology], but expanding and supplementing  its function) to control the process of the transfer of Russian  technology abroad for temporary or permanent operation, a kind  of Russian COCOM [Coordinating Committee].    It seems advisable to organize on a comprehensive basis the  coordination of the efforts of the international community to  offer assistance for the preservation and development of the  Russian scientific-technical potential. Such coordination would  include also the creation of an international information system  in this sphere, of a unified financial fund or bank, and of an  insurance company. All this would make access to external  sources of financing simpler and socially fair in the interests  of all of Russian science, and not of an isolated portion of it.    From the Editorial Board.

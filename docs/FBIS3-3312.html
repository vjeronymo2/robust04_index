The DPRK Central Broadcasting Station quoted a spokesman for  the atomic energy authority as saying that his country fully  complied with the February 15 accord during the two-week  inspection of seven of DPRK's nine nuclear sites which began  March 1.    The results of the inspection were also adequate to verify  that the DPRK is not developing nuclear weapons, the official  added.    However, the IAEA Secretariat claimed that the inspection  was  conducted only in line with the nuclear security agreement and  did not guarantee the continuity of nuclear security. The DPRK  spokesman disagreed, and said that the IAEA has now made more  unreasonable demands.    Since the DPRK has shown great flexibility by meeting all  IAEA demands, the secretariat's reluctance to air the results,  and threats to call a council meeting, only show that it openly  violated the February 25 U.S.-DPRK agreement on nuclear  inspections and has become increasingly unfair.    The spokesman said that unless the IAEA Secretariat revokes  its unjust decision, it must be fully responsible for whatever  action the DPRK may take.</p>

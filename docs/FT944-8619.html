			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Chemical margin fears Chemicals group Courtaulds fell sharply after a leading agency broker turned cautious ahead of interim figures due next week, highlighting the surge in raw material prices. Spot prices for the chemical used to make acrylic fibre has risen by almost 50 per cent since the early part of the year, and wood pulp, which is the basis for about a third of Courtaulds' sales, has doubled. Courtaulds buys materials on a less volatile contract basis, but James Capel said spot prices are an indicator of the general trend. Analyst Mr David Ingles commented: 'This margin pressure is real and we have to get over that before we can be more positive.' The shares fell 14 to 450p.</p>

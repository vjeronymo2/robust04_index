			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Regulator regrets impact of job on husband's firm An architectural firm run by the husband of Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry regulator, has decided to decline a Pounds 1m contract with British Gas because of a potential conflict of interest. Ms Spottiswoode yesterday expressed frustration that her public role could have such a severe financial impact on people outside her family. She said ORMS - the firm run by Mr Oliver Richards, her husband - might now have to make some employees redundant. 'We did absolutely nothing improper or illegal,' Mr Richards said yesterday. 'It's a problem of public perception and what the press would do with it.' ORMS was invited last May by British Gas to bid for the modernisation of an office complex near Newcastle upon Tyne. It was the third time the firm had dealt with British Gas's property division, which said it was unaware until last Thursday that Mr Richards was Ms Spottiswoode's husband. The first British Gas contract with ORMS was awarded early last year - before Ms Spottiswoode was appointed director-general of Ofgas. It was a small contract for a feasibility study in Swindon. The second, another small contract for work in Poole, was awarded last November, days after Ms Spottiswoode joined Ofgas. She said she had immediately informed the Department of Trade and Industry, which did not object to ORMS dealing with British Gas as long as her husband was not directly involved and the amounts were not significant. Last May, however, British Gas asked the company to bid for what turned out to be a much larger contract. Ms Spottiswoode said the DTI again advised that there was no legal objection. But it suggested she exercise her own judgment, even though she had no direct influence on ORMS. Mr Richards said he and his two other partners looked at ways to ensure that he did not benefit from the contract, including the possibility of giving his share of the profits to charity. But accountants advised them that there was no practical way of doing so, and they decided to withdraw. Mr Philip Kirby, the British Gas executive who dealt with ORMS, said the firm was 'a good architectural practice which won the work fairly'. But he said he wished it had told him of Mr Richards' connection to Ofgas.</p>

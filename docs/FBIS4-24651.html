			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Enterprises in Guangdong Lack 10 </F> Billion Yuan, and the Central Authorities Plan To Pump an  Additional Four Billion Yuan Into Them To Help Meet Urgent  Needs"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 29 May (TA KUNG PAO)--Huang Ting, deputy  director of the Guangdong Provincial Commission for Economic  Restructuring, has maintained that Guangdong is in an  unprecedentedly difficult situation with regard to reform in  1994.    In a public lecture several days ago, Huang Ting said that  the burdens on Guangdong's enterprises have not been lightened  very much. Financial reform is not keeping pace with the needs  of development, funds are lacking, and it is difficult to  proceed with the development of the capital market. At present,  Guangdong has to strictly implement the central authorities'  macroeconomic policy by controlling currency issuance. On the  other hand, however, enterprises are suffering an acute shortage  of circulating funds which is estimated to total 10 billion yuan  or more. This problem becomes much more serious when we  consider that many enterprises in Guangdong have to pool their  own funds, are running deficits, or cannot obtain loans.  Moreover, since the new tax system was put into practice, some  rights concerning tax revenue have been centralized, and some  enterprises no longer enjoy such previous preferential policies  as the delegation of rights to local authorities and tax  reductions. Their losses have therefore increased from 20  percent to 43 percent, and their profits have decreased by 37.8  percent. According to a recent survey conducted by the  provincial government, there are still more than four million  people throughout the province who do not have enough food and  clothing. Guangdong is facing a difficult challenge this year.    Huang Ting briefed his audience on the new measures  Guangdong  plans to adopt this year. In the area of monetary reform, the  main focus will be on developing local financial institutions  and vigorously preparing the establishment of overseas Chinese  banks. The relevant report has already been submitted to the  central authorities. Moreover, foreign financial institutions  will be encouraged to enter Guangdong, and the entry of foreign  insurance firms is even being considered. Enterprises with the  necessary conditions are encouraged to issue B shares abroad.  Moreover, every effort will be made to guarantee circulating  funds for enterprises that have a ready market, produce good  returns, and have good prospects. Huang Ting revealed that the  central authorities have already fully considered Guangdong's  special conditions and are prepared to pump an additional 4  billion yuan or more into Guangdong. Therefore, beginning with  the second quarter of this year, the circulating funds shortage  facing Guangdong's enterprises will probably be alleviated.    On the subject of the fiscal system, Huang Ting maintained  that, although Guangdong will have to come up with an additional  20 billion yuan or more according to the new fiscal system, this  will be conducive to the healthy development of enterprises in  the long term. Moreover, the province continues to allow cities  and counties to be responsible for their own finances, and  enterprises' responsibility contracts can be extended for two  years to help them get through this transitional period. Huang  Ting said that this year Guangdong will not introduce new  pricing measures to curb inflation. As for reform of the  property rights system, attention will be paid to avoiding the  indiscriminate transfer of share rights to foreign businesses.</p>

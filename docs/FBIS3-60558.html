			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Robin Gedye in Bonn and Peter Pallot: ``British </F> Alert Over AIDS Scandal'']    [Text] Blood products made by a German firm at the centre  of an Aids scare in Germany are being withdrawn by the  Department of Health in London and several other countries took  steps yesterday to impound the products.    The department announced that 126,000 units of blood  products  manufactured by UB Plasma, of Koblenz, had been bought by the  National Health Service.    Last year Britain imported 120,000 doses of a product to  boost immunity. Since 1989 the NHS has bought 6,000 doses of  albumin, also made by UB Plasma, to treat severe blood loss.  ``Because of the length of time, it must be assumed that some of  these batches have been used,'' a department spokesman said last  night.    The other countries which have decided to withdraw suspect  blood products are France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria,  the Czech Republic and Greece. At the same time the Greek health  ministry said it would take legal action against the German  exporters of possibly untested plasma.    It is feared that suspect products may also have reached the  Middle East.    Remaining stocks in Britain are being urgently recalled by  Immono, an Austrian company which bought the consignment from  Germany and exported it here, said the department spokesman.  ``However, we are absolutely sure that these stocks were  batch-tested by the National Institute for Biological Standards,  Testing and Control and there was no trace of HIV,'' he said.    The recall was ``purely precautionary and is to ensure total  patient safety''.    Authorities are seeking to establish how many doses of the  immunity booster Gammabulin have been used. People with impaired  immune systems or those travelling abroad and at risk of  hepatitis would have been among those intramuscularly injected.  The other product -- Human Albumin Solution, 4.5 per cent --  would be used in any situation in which blood was lost in  quantity, such as accidents, surgery or a complicated birth. The  spokesman said: ``There is no evidence that HIV has been  transmitted by these two products. We are self-sufficient in  blood and plasma and we do import blood products which are  licensed by the Medicines Control Agency.''    Britain does not import blood -- only blood products. Since  1985, when the risks of spreading HIV were realized, all blood  factors have been heat-treated.    Mr David Blunkett, Shadow Health Secretary, urged the  Government to make a clear statement to allay fears.    Dr Harold Gunson, director of the National Blood Authority,  said: ``British patients can be reassured that this blood in  England and Scotland is the safest that one can have in the  world.    ``We have been fully testing all our blood since 1985 for  HIV.''    But he added: ``We do import some final purified plasma  products.'' He did not know whether any had come from Germany.    British military authorities in Germany urged the small  number of people treated in German hospitals in emergencies in  the past 10 years to have themselves tested if they were  worried. Pentagon officials issued similar instructions to US  Servicemen in Germany.    In Germany, where blood donations are paid for and where a  number of people connected with UB Plasma have been arrested,  there is evidence that the health ministry is uncertain of the  extent of the spread of suspect products.    When the scandal broke a month ago, the semi-autonomous  Federal Health Agency was dissolved for failing to pursue  evidence that UB Plasma had flooded the market with possibly  untested blood products. Then on Thursday it was alleged that  the firm had knowingly released ``slightly infected'' blood on  to the market.</p>

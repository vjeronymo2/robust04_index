			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: Recent monthly figures for UK bank and building society (M4) lending have moved erratically, so it is no surprise that analysts' forecasts for seasonally adjusted M4 lending in May range from Pounds 600m to Pounds 4bn. The consensus forecast of Pounds 1.9bn compares with actual lending of Pounds 500m in April. Tuesday: US trade in goods and services is expected to notch up another significant deficit in April, with analysts' forecasts ranging from Dollars 7bn to Dollars 9.5bn. However, the consensus forecast, at Dollars 7.5bn, indicates no change from the March outturn. Friday: Final first-quarter UK GDP and current account balance of payments figures will be last economic in- formation published before release of the government's revised forecast for the economy on June 28. First-quarter GDP is expected to grow year-on-year at 2.6 per cent, above the 2.5 per cent growth forecast for 1994 by the Treasury last November. The consensus forecast for the current account points to a first-quarter deficit of Pounds 2.2bn, an improvement on the Pounds 2.6bn seasonally adjusted deficit of the 1993 fourth quarter.</p>

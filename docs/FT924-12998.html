			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Current savings at RBS THE ROYAL Bank of Scotland has launched a combined current and savings account in a bid to retain money being transferred to building society savings accounts. The bank, which has 1.5m current account-holders, estimates that 60 per cent of these have building society accounts into which they transfer money regularly. Its 'Balanced Banking' initiative will allow customers an automatic transfer of funds between a choice of two or three accounts. The package combines an existing current account - the Gold Cheque - with two types of savings accounts and a sweep facility to and from the savings and current accounts. The minimum balance requirement of Pounds 5,000 means this is a package with restricted appeal, however, and RBS admits that Balanced Banking is aimed at 'high net worth' individuals - or those earning more than Pounds 25,000 a year. The account works in similar fashion to Midland's Orchard account, which also has a sweep facility. Customers specify a minimum balance which they wish to be held in the Gold Cheque account, as well as a maximum amount. Excess funds can then be transferred into either Gold Deposit, an instant-access savings account, or Gold Ninety, a 90-day account which pays higher interest. The advantage of a dual sweep facility is that if money in the cheque account falls below the minimum, funds will be swept back from the deposit account; thus, there is no danger of going into overdraft. There is no sweep facility from Gold Ninety because it is a notice account. The Gold Cheque account has a Pounds 250 guarantee card, daily ATM withdrawal limit of Pounds 450, and a free Pounds 100 built-in overdraft. Interest is 3.7 per cent gross. But Balanced Banking will be judged in terms of being competitive. The table (top left) shows interest rates on comparable instant-access savings and notice accounts at a cross-selection of banks and building societies. Those of the RBS are below most other rates on savings below Pounds 2,000 but are competitive, if not providing the highest returns, on more substantial sums. Chelsea Building Society's instant-access rates, for example, are higher on amounts above Pounds 2,500 while First Direct's rate of 8 per cent gross on Pounds 50,000 and above beats RBS's 7.85 per cent.</p>

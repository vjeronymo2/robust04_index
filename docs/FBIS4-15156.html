[Begin Yemets recording] Summing up the results today, I  would like to begin by saying that 450 constituencies were set  up for holding the elections of people's deputies of Ukraine.  On election day, 5,609 candidates for people's deputies were  running in the election in these constituencies. In four  constituencies, two candidates were included in the ballot  papers, [words indistinct], from 11 to 20 candidates in 253  constituencies, and over 20 candidates in 37 constituencies.    Some 38,015,205 people were put on the lists of the electors  for the election of people's deputies of Ukraine. Of these,  28,744,296 people, or 75.61 percent, took part in the voting.    The electors were most active in Ternopol Oblast -- 91.62  percent, Ivano-Frankovsk -- 88.47 percent, Lvov Oblast -- 80.56  percent (87.56 percent). Less active were the electors in Kiev  -- 59.74 percent, the Crimea Republic -- [words indistinct].  The elections took place in all the 400 [as heard]  constituencies. People's deputies were elected in 49  constituencies. Among the newly elected deputies, five are the  leaders of collective agricultural enterprises, four are  entrepreneurs, six are employees of councils at all levels, four  are education workers, three are employees of public  organizations, and 16 are people's deputies of the current  Supreme Council.

As far as nationalities are concerned, 41 Ukrainians, seven  Russians, and one Adygey were elected to the Supreme Council.  [end recording]    [Tatarenko] The chairman of the Central Electoral Commission  also reported that in the 400 constituencies where more than two  candidates were running in the election of people's deputies of  Ukraine and none was elected, run-off elections were scheduled  for 2, 3, 9, and 10 April 1994 in compliance with the election  law and by decisions of the district electoral commissions. The  run-off elections took place on 2 and 3 April in 34  constituencies, pointed out Ivan Yemets.    The Central Electoral Commission then considered the issue  of  preparations for the election of the president of Ukraine, which  is to take place on 26 June 1994. Viktor (Pohorilko), deputy  chairman of the Central Electoral Commission reported on the  estimated expenditures for preparing and holding the election of  the president of Ukraine.    [Begin (Pohorilko) recording] There are comparisons  available. The estimated expenditure for the election of  people's deputies was the amount of 1 trillion 154 billion  karbovantsi. This sum has not yet been received in full,  although the financing was taking place, as a whole, within the  appropriate terms. The estimated expenditure for holding the  election of the president are somewhat higher, in the amount of  1 trillion and more, about 600 billion karbovantsi -- 657  billion, or 618 billion karbovantsi according to verified data.  [end recording]    [Tatarenko] Proceeding from the report by Ihor Tseluyko, the  secretary of the Central Electoral Commission, a resolution was  passed on the rules of checking how the requirements of the law  on the election of the Ukrainian president are abided by -- as  far as the collection of signatures in support of a contender  for candidate for the president of Ukraine is concerned.    At the sitting of the Central Electoral Commission, they  considered and approved the text of recommendations of the  commission to district electoral commissions regarding specific  issues of preparing and holding the election of the president of  Ukraine with the provisions of the new election legislation  taken into account.    Having considered the application and other documents  submitted by the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic  Party, the Central Electoral Commission -- in compliance with  the law on the election of the president of Ukraine --  registered them as those who expressed their intention to  nominate their candidate to run in the election of the president  of Ukraine.    Some other issues connected with the preparations for the  election of the president were also considered.</p>

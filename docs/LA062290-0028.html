			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MULRONEY ENTREATS NEWFOUNDLAND TO RATIFY CONSTITUTIONAL PACT;  </P> <P> CANADA: REJECTION WOULD ENCOURAGE QUEBEC SEPARATISTS, HE SAYS. PROVINCIAL  LEGISLATORS VOTE TODAY.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Brian Mulroney made an unusual appearance Thursday in this  fog-shrouded port city to urge provincial legislators to join him in his battle  to amend the constitution and blunt French-Canadian separatism.  </P> <P> "I urge you simply to do for Canada what you would do for your family, by  healing the divisions (and) binding the wounds," Mulroney said.  </P> <P> Newfoundland's legislature has an opportunity to make or break Mulroney's  unifying vision: The House of Assembly is scheduled to vote this morning on  whether to ratify a package of constitutional amendments that would give more  powers to Quebec. Feelings of separatism are on the rise in Quebec these days,  and if Newfoundland's legislators vote against the amendments, Quebecers are  likely to take it as evidence that English Canadians can't accept or understand  them. A slow process of separation might then be set in motion.  </P> <P> The Newfoundland vote is expected to be a squeaker; no clear pattern has  emerged, and a number of legislators were saying even one day before the vote  that they hadn't made up their minds what to do.  </P> <P> In hopes of persuading them to ratify the amendments, Mulroney played up the  fears of Quebec "nationalism" in his speech, describing Quebec separatist  leader Jacques Parizeau as a wolf at the nation's door. Parizeau doesn't hold  any government office, but he leads the main opposition party in Quebec, the  Parti Quebecois. If the current government in Quebec were voted out of office,  the Parti Quebecois would be the only alternative.  </P> <P> "The people who seek to replace us (political leaders) love Canada as much as  we do," Mulroney told the Newfoundland politicians, "with one exception, and  the exception is Mr. Parizeau in the province of Quebec."  </P> <P> He reminded Newfoundland's legislators that the Parti Quebecois has been  gaining ground in the opinion polls over the past few weeks and said that if  Parizeau were to win some future election, he would definitely call a  referendum on whether Quebec should separate.  </P> <P> "He's not going to be cute," warned Mulroney. "He's going to put the question  straight out. 'Do you want to separate? Yea or nay?' "  </P> <P> Quebec already had one such referendum 10 years ago, during a previous Parti  Quebecois government, and Mulroney reminisced about that agonizing experience.  About 60% of the total population voted to stick with Canada, but Mulroney  pointed out that if the Francophone vote alone were considered, the vote was a  mere 50-50 to stay within Canada.  </P> <P> "This isn't an experience that I either enjoyed or that I propose to repeat, if  it can be avoided," said the prime minister, who himself is an Anglophone  Quebecer. "The Meech Lake Accord is designed to avoid any future referendum."  </P> <P> "The Meech Lake Accord" is a name Canadians give Mulroney's package of  constitutional amendments, since they were drafted at a secluded conference  center on the shores of Meech Lake in Quebec.  </P> <P> Mulroney also went to great lengths to assure Newfoundland's House of Assembly  that the Meech Lake Accord is not a radical document. He claimed that its five  central elements have all been discussed for decades and that the powers it  would give Quebec have all been offered to the French-speaking province on  other occasions.  </P> <P> "It's hardly revolutionary," he said. "It's in the tradition of over 30 years  of constitutional discussions."  </P> <P> Mulroney acknowledged that his own standing in the opinion polls is disastrous  and said that a great deal of the opposition to the accord was really misplaced  public anger that ought to be directed at himself and his economic policies.  </P> <P> Newfoundland legislators, who have been increasingly anguished over how to vote  in the past few days, seemed impressed with Mulroney's remarks. They gave him a  standing ovation when he finished his speech, an unusual response from  politicians in a province deeply resentful of powerful Quebec and of federal  politicians in general.  </P> <P> Some of the legislators here seem open-minded to any face-saving reason to vote  in favor of the Meech Lake Accord. While their constituents have been telling  them again and again to vote it down, many of the legislators have seemed  genuinely fearful about doing something that might wreck prosperous, peaceful  Canada.  </P> <P> Mulroney's pitch to Newfoundland may be futile, however, if nothing can be done  to arrest runaway opposition to the accord in another Canadian province,  Manitoba, the only other province that hasn't ratified the accord.  </P> <P> In Manitoba, the lone Indian member of the provincial legislature, Elijah  Harper, has mounted a successful procedural battle to delay all debate of the  constitutional amendments.  </P> <P> Canadians have assumed all along that the Meech Lake Accord will die if it  isn't ratified by all 10 provinces by this Saturday. Some lawyers argue,  however, that a careful reading of the accord shows that legally, there really  is no such deadline. Mulroney is apparently hoping that if Newfoundland does  vote to ratify the accord, Quebec will accept a rollback of the deadline for  Manitoba.  </P> <P> In Winnipeg, Manitoba's capital, about 4,000 Indians, some wearing traditional  headdress and others pounding ceremonial drums, gathered outside the  legislature to celebrate their procedural victory.  </P> <P> The Indians argue that while the accord treats French-speaking Quebec as a  distinct society, it makes no allowances for their own distinctness.  </P></p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Powell Duffryn falls to Pounds 21.6m POWELL DUFFRYN, the dist-ribution, storage and engineering group, said yesterday that its restructuring programme was bearing fruit in spite of the impact of accountancy changes and the closure of two UK railway freight wagon plants. Under FRS 3, the group's pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 35.3m to Pounds 21.6m in the year to March 31. However, the previous year's result was inflated by an Pounds 11.4m exceptional gain on disposals, and the latest figure was depressed by a Pounds 7m charge caused by the plant closures. Stripping out the exceptionals, pre-tax profits increased by 20 per cent, from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 28.6m. Sales grew from Pounds 684.1m to Pounds 697.5m. Net debt fell from Pounds 50.7m to Pounds 29.5m and the gearing ratio was reduced from 31 to 19 per cent. Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said: 'The benefits of the corporate changes of the past two years are becoming increasingly evident in our results. We have good reason to look ahead with confidence to our improved earnings stream.' The impact of recession and another mild winter saw operating profits from fuel distribution plunge from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 5.4m, on sales which declined slightly, from Pounds 369.4m to Pounds 362m. Engineering increased operating profits from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 16.3m on sales which rose from Pounds 229.8m to Pounds 232.7m. The group said its enlarged combustion interests and pump and refuse collection activities had made commendable progress. Port services and shipping increased operating profits from Pounds 3.4m to to Pounds 7.3m, thanks to a full contribution from Tees and Hartlepool. Turnover rose from Pounds 49.8m to Pounds 64.7m. The storage division increased its operating profit from Pounds 4m to Pounds 7.2m. The group said there had been a noteworthy increase in profitability, led by the UK and US terminals, where both cost management and better terms of trade helped the result. Earnings per share under FRS 3 fell from 36.9p to 18.6p. Stripping out the exceptionals, earnings rose from 20.2p to 28.8p. A final dividend of 16p maintains the total at 22.6p. COMMENT It seems reasonable to ignore the effects of FRS 3 on these results, since the exceptional gains and losses largely cancel each other out. The underlying performance is impressive, particularly since the group has had to cope with yet another mild winter while continuing to restructure. The exit from railway freight trucks also elicits sympathy: who could have forecast that a major country would be prepared to build a Channel tunnel, but then not invest in new rolling stock? The shares have had a very good run in the last 18 months, as the City has cottoned on to the new strategy. But forecast profits of Pounds 35m next year put the shares on a prospective multiple of 15.5, only a small premium to the market. Any further advance will be more modest, but the shares still offer a yield premium and further growth prospects.</p>

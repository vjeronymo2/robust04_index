			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart D_Miscellaneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 226.28_Effect on State Laws  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 28(b) Equivalent Disclosure Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 152(e) of the Equity Protection Act provides that the procedure for substituting substantially similar state law disclosures for federal TILA requirements does not apply to state disclosure requirements for high-rate, high-fee mortgages. The proposed amendments reflect this limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart E_Certain Mortgage Transactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments to the TILA (section 129 dealing with high-rate, high-fee mortgages and section 138 dealing with reverse mortgage transactions) layer disclosure and timing requirements onto the requirements already imposed for these consumer credit transactions. The Board proposes to implement these provisions by adding a new subpart E to the regulation: proposed &sect;226.31 addresses general requirements such as timing and format rules; &sect;226.32 contains rules relating to high-rate, high-fee mortgages; and &sect;226.32 addresses reverse mortgages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 226.31_General Disclosure Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 31(a) Relation to Other Subparts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulation explicitly states that the requirements and limitations of Subpart E are in addition to_not in lieu of_those otherwise provided in other subparts of the regulation. For example, creditors offering closed-end, variable-rate loans that are secured by the consumer's principal dwelling and have a term greater that one year must generally provide disclosures at the time of application and prior to consummation, according to the requirements of Subpart C. If these transactions are also high-rate, high-fee mortgage loans, this subpart requires creditors to provide additional disclosures at least three business days prior to the loan's consummation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 31(c) Timing of Disclosures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31(c)(1) High-rate, High-fee Mortgage Disclosures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129 of the TILA and the proposed regulation require a three-day ``cooling off'' period between the time consumers are furnished with special disclosures about a high-rate, high-fee mortgage and the time the consumer becomes obligated under the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The law also authorizes the Board to identify in the regulation circumstances under which a homeowner may modify or waive the right to the three-day waiting period to meet bona fide personal financial emergencies. The legislative history states that the provision is intended to protect consumers from high-pressure sales tactics and to ensure that consumers understand the terms of loans with high interest rates or up-front fees. The Board is not proposing regulations regarding waivers of the cooling-off period at this time. Sections 226.15(e) and 226.23(e) of the regulation discuss waivers of the right to rescind, and the Board solicits comments on whether similar provisions should be incorporated for high-rate, high-fee mortgage loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 31(c)(2) Reverse Mortgage Disclosures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Besides the other disclosures required by the regulation, section 138 of the TILA requires creditors to furnish additional disclosures to consumers at least three business days prior to consummation of a reverse mortgage transaction. Timing requirements for closed-end credit are often tied to the consummation of the transaction, and the regulation parallels the statute for closed-end reverse mortgage loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, reverse mortgage loans may also be structured as open-end credit plans. In that case, the proposed regulation provides that the disclosures must be given at least three business days prior to the first transaction under the open-end credit plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conforming Paragraphs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) mirror provisions in subparts B and C, and provide consistency among the subparts of the regulation. (See &sect;226.5 and &sect;226.17.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 226.32_High-Rate, High-Fee Mortgages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 32(a) Coverage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 152 of the Equity Protection Act provides that the high-rate, high-fee mortgage rules do not apply to a residential mortgage transaction, a reverse mortgage transaction, and an open-end credit plan. The proposed regulation tracks those exceptions, with two additions for clarification. The Board believes the Congress intended to exempt from coverage only those reverse mortgage transactions which are part of the new disclosure scheme in proposed &sect;226.33, and the proposed amendment reflects that limitation. Also, the proposed amendment clarifies that the exception for open-end credit plans extends to all plans subject to subpart B of the regulation (Open-end Credit).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PLEASE, NO MORE MUDSLINGING  </P> <P> The June primaries have passed, and thankfully so has the mudslinging!  </P> <P> Why don't today's politicians base their campaigns on their own merits and  accomplishments rather than the mistakes of their opponents? Give the voters  what they want: a straightforward campaign that is free from put-downs and  accusations.  </P> <P> When will the politicians figure out that criticizing their opponents will not  win them an election?  </P> <P> Sang Korman learned this lesson too late and it cost him. Korman ran against  Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) for the Republican nomination in the 21st  Congressional District. His campaign was typical -- make Gallegly look like the  bad guy by airing his "dirty laundry." Korman's campaign backfired. Not only  did he lose the election (receiving only 31.6 % of the vote), it cost him an  estimated $500,000.  </P> <P> In the future, politicians should spend less of their time and money on  negative campaign tactics and place more of an emphasis on cleaner campaigns.  </P> <P> JOHN C. HARTMAN  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

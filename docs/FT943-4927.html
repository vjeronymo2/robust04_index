			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Barbados votes in early election Barbadians go to the polls today in an early election for a new government for the Caribbean island. Latest opinion polls put Mr Owen Arthur's main opposition Barbados Labour party in the lead. The election, being held 15 months before it is constitutionally due, was called by Mr Erskine Sandiford, the outgoing prime minister, after he lost a no-confidence vote in parliament when rebellious cabinet members, critical of his leadership, voted with the opposition. Mr Sandiford, who is a candidate in the election, has been replaced as leader of the Democratic Labour party by Mr David Thompson, a 32-year-old lawyer who is the island's finance minister. The opinion polls give the BLP 32 per cent of popular support, with 21 per cent going to the incumbent DLP and 9 per cent to the minority opposition National Democratic party, which is led by Mr Richie Haynes. The pollsters warn, however, that the outcome of the election could be determined by the 38 per cent of voters who were undecided up to last weekend. Reducing the island's 22 per cent unemployment rate, maintaining the stability of the currency and expanding the business sector are the issues which have dominated the campaign. The DLP has promised measures to cut unemployment by 5 percentage points over the next 18 months, followed by 4 points the following year, and 3 the next. The jobs are expected to come from proposed tax cuts and from new investments in hotels, construction and expansion of the information processing sector. The development of small businesses through a range of incentives has been proposed by the opposition BLP as one means of reducing unemployment. It says that if elected, it will transform the island's economy, which is presently based on tourism and cane sugar production, into one based on a range of services for foreign markets. The three parties contesting the election have said they will resist pressure from international financial institutions to devalue the Barbados dollar. The currency, whose parity is fixed by the government, has been under pressure intermittently over the past four years.</p>

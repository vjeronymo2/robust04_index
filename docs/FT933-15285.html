			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Convergence path strewn with crises Two of a kind - Industrialists with different perspectives but similar aims for Europe Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of Saint-Gobain, the French industrial conglomerate, surveys Europe from a tower-shaped looking glass, the company's mirrored office block in the La Defense district of Paris. He does not much like what he sees. 'We need to pay attention not to Europe's objectives, but to how it functions,' he says. Thickset and courteous, Mr Beffa provides ample evidence that Europe-mindedness can improve corporate health. After steadfastly working his way up the Saint-Gobain chain of command, he was appointed to the top job at the then state-owned group in 1986. Now 51, he shepherded it through privatisation with a mix of elan and elbow-grease. With a series of acquisitions in Europe and the US, he strengthened Saint-Gobain's position as Europe's largest maker of glass and insulation materials. Now, however, profits have fallen, mainly through Europe-wide economic slowdown, high interest rates and foreign currency devaluations. EC policy disarray, Mr Beffa says, is nibbling away at the foundations of the company's business: the European single market. Further, the stresses of German reunification have disturbed the traditional balance of interests between France and Germany - which together account for half Saint-Gobain's turnover. The strains are evident among ordinary people as well as among politicians. But Mr Beffa's chief complaint is about lack of economic and political convergence across the Community. 'There is a crucial difference between an integrated European Community and one which is merely a zone of free trade. There has to be a number of areas of common policy - on economic policy, monetary affairs, social affairs, industrial and commercial policy and so on. Fragmentation in these areas causes problems. If there are too many differences, they threaten the existence of the single market.' Mr Beffa's competitive spirit is not in doubt. He has just examined the latest results from Pilkington, the UK glassmaker and Saint-Gobain's arch-rival. His conclusion is polite but triumphant: Saint-Gobain's earnings ratios are better. But there are furrows on Mr Beffa's brow. One is caused by exchange rate difficulties. 'The instability created by the foreign exchange movements in September have been extremely harmful. When other EC currencies devalue by up to 20 per cent, this can cause a brutal shock. 'Sharp fluctuations of foreign exchange rates undermine the calculations made on where to site specialised production facilities.' Because of the company's range of EC manufacturing sites outside France  - mainly in Germany, the UK, Italy and Spain - 'Saint-Gobain can shield itself to a certain extent against these developments. But these exaggerated movements must be avoided,' says Mr Beffa. A second, linked, concern is French economic weakness - caused partly by high domestic interest rates to maintain the franc's parity against the D-Mark. 'For us, 1993 will be a very difficult year. But the worst point of the recession could be in the second half of this year - 1994 should see a certain up-turn.' A further reason for Saint-Gobain's weak-er performance has been increased competition from eastern Europe in products such as flat glass. 'Exports of some eastern European products have rapidly increased.' Access to EC markets needs to be 'organised'. 'We must work out some firm rules of the game. Otherwise, the west will suffer painful consequences in terms of higher unemployment.' In Mr Beffa's critique of the way the Community works, he refuses to join in criticism by some French politicians that Britain is trying to undercut other countries' wage rates through devaluation and 'social dumping'. Although Mr Beffa says the UK shows 'a relative lack of enthusiasm for Europe', he adds: 'This is not enough to make me say that everything Britain does or says is anti-European. Sometimes you even need British pragmatism - the tendency to look at the short-term and not just at the horizon.' Mr Beffa is more concerned about costs in Germany, where 15,000 of the 100,000 workforce is employed. Mr Beffa says wage costs are 5 per cent to 10 per cent higher than in France. During Germany's unification-induced boom between 1989 and 1991, the impact of the extra costs was offset by higher sales. 'Now that German activities have been hit by the German downturn, we need to bring our costs in line with volumes.' On the wider question of the Maastricht timetable for economic and monetary union, he says Germany holds the key. 'If, by the end of the year, there is a substantial cut in German interest rates, we will be going in the right direction. Otherwise, there will be problems.' Two shorter-term goals take precedence over the longer-term Emu objective. One is achievement of currency stability. The second concerns the Bundesbank's monetary policy. The Maastricht treaty, he says, 'laid down an objective for the future. But we need a plausible path for the transition period before we get there. 'What is important is not whether we have one day a single currency, whether it's the Ecu or anything else. It is much more important that countries follow coherent and convergent economic policies to bring exchange rate stability, and that the central bank in charge looks at the economic situation across the whole of the European Monetary System when making decisions on interest rates.' Mr Beffa leaves to the politicians the question of how to attain more convergence. Yet without it, he knows the view from Saint-Gobain's tower will become still cloudier. 'If each country follows different policies, the economic crisis can only be deeper and longer.'</p>

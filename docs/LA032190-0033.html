			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> NEW TAX CALLED ANSWER TO LAYOFFS  </P> <P> The Beverly Hills school district has sent layoff notices to 60 teachers and  other employees, prompting a community group to call on voters Tuesday to  support a new property tax. The proposed parcel tax, if passed by voters in  June, would generate $22 million for public schools over five years, enough to  offset the lack of funds that threatens 48 full-time positions at the end of  the school year and others in the future, school district officials said.  </P> <P> The district sent layoff notices last week to 60 employees, district  spokeswoman Hali Wickner said. Districts are obligated to give several months'  advance notice of possible layoffs and they routinely do so nearly every year  in times of budget uncertainty. A community group of parents and activists, the  Yes on Schools Committee, stepped up efforts Tuesday to rally support for the  property tax.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report attributed to UNIAN] </F>   [Text] On 29 March, Ivan Yemets, head of the Central  Electoral Commission, held a press conference on the results of  the elections to the Ukrainian Supreme Council. He confirmed  the following:    The elections took place in all 450 electoral districts. In  the first round, 49 deputies were elected, of which 11 are  engineers, 13 education system workers, three lawyers and  economists.    In terms of party membership, the break-down of deputies is  as follows: 12 members of the Communist Party of Ukraine, four  members of the Rukh, two from the Ukrainian Republican Party,  Ukrainian Peasants' Party, and Socialist Party each, while other  24 were independent deputies.    In the words of Ivan Yemets, most of the parties retain  their  positions in the second round of elections. In the first place,  this applies to Communists, Socialists, and national democrats.  Ivan Yemets expressed confidence that the "second round will  give Ukraine a new legislature."    Asked how many deputies are required to make the new  Ukrainian parliament work, Ivan Yemets responded: The present  legislation has some discrepancies regarding this question.  This is why it will clear up later whether 226 or 301 deputies  will be necessary."    Speaking on the Crimean referendum, Ivan Yemets declared  that  the Central Electoral Commission had nothing to do with it.  This is solely the business of the Crimean president. It was  announced that most of the electoral commissions set the  second-round election for 10 April. In this connection, Ivan  Yemets called on the press representative to explain to the  population the need to elect a new parliament.  <H5>  Rukh Garnered 12 Percent </H5>   Of 49 deputies elected on 27 March, 11 represent the Rukh or  were supported by it. They include the organization's activists  Vyacheslav Chornovil, Les Tanyuk, Mykhaylo Kosiv, Yaroslav  Kendzyor, Serhyy Holovatyy, Andryy Mostyskyy -- all were members  of the previous Supreme Council.  <H5>  The Election Results Were Fabricated </H5>   Levko Lukyanenko, honorary chairman of the Ukrainian  Republican Party [URP] and cochairman of the Democratic Bloc  "Ukraine," noted: "The outcome of this election is not the  result of the electorate's preferences, but the result of the  struggle conducted by the party in power with democratic forces.  We are dealing here not with the real popular choice, but the  documentation of the actual balance of forces. The party in  power used its structures and exerted an immense influence on  the electorate, resorting to intimidation, forgery, and blatant  violation of the electoral law. In many places, fearful of  losing their jobs, people refused to be observers. The  electorate is scared, in particular, the part that we counted  on. The elections took place in an atmosphere of a flagrant  violation of law and intimidation," Levko Lukyanenko emphasized.  The cochairman of the Democratic Bloc "Ukraine" cited the  following facts: In Lugansk Oblast, instead of distributing  ballot papers, they made lists indicating who voted for whom.  In Tarashchanskyy Electoral District, where the URP's candidate  Petro Borsuk ran, a truck crashed into Borsuk's car in the  evening of 27 March. After the truck's driver was hospitalized  with a concussion, rumor spread that it was Borsuk himself who  was in the hospital.    Asked to comment on the defeat of the URP leader, Mykhaylo  Horyn, in the election delivered by Stepan Khmara, Levko  Lukyanenko noted that there are two reasons for this. First,  some disservice was done by discontent with Horyn's brother,  Mykola, who is head of the Lvov Oblast Council. Second, Stepan  Khmara deliberately ran in the same district with Horyn to  demonstrate his hostility to the URP, and used all of his  eloquence to deceive uneducated social groups. "However,  Mykhaylo Horyn," Levko Lukyanenko noted, "was not knocked off  his feet. He still has his energy, and will continue to work  for Ukraine."  <H5>  Negative Opinion </H5>   Serhyy Holovatyy, the newly elected deputy and head of the  Ukrainian Legal Foundation, spoke critically about the results  of the first-round election to the Supreme Council. He stated  that "presidential representatives, who have already inflicted  heavy damages on Ukraine," will sneak through rural electoral  districts. In his words, the Ukrainian people will feel the  negative consequences of their choice for a long time to come.  <H5>  Communists' Performance [subhead] </H5>   In the headquarters of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, we  were told that their candidate, Oleksandr Bozhko, qualified for  the second round in the Pecherskyy Constituency of Kiev City.  However, the Socialists declined to say how many of their  candidates made it to the second round of the election, asking  us to wait until official announcement of the election    In the headquarters of the Communist Party of Ukraine, we  were told that the party's 173 candidates won in the first round  in 22 Ukrainian oblasts, including Oleh Hrachov, Oleksandr  Bondarchuk, and Volodymyr Martynyuk.  <H5>  Performance of the Greens </H5>   The 31 members of the Green Party that were put forward by  working teams, and not by the party, were not successful. In  particular, the party's leader Vitalyy Kononov, an independent  candidate at the Gagarin Electoral District, did not get to the  second round of the elections.  <H5>  "New Ukraine" and Liberals] </H5>   The Secretariat of the "New Ukraine" said that their two  members, Volodymyr Hrynyov and Volodymyr Filenko, who ran from  Kharkov, qualified for the second-round election. According to  the party's Donetsk-based organization, four Liberal Party  members, including its vice president Yuryy Baskakov, entered  the second round.  <H5>  Mass Agitation in the Crimea </H5>   The Crimean National Movement Organization [OKNR], the  Crimean organization of the URP, the Ukrainian Civilian Congress  of the Crimea, and the Committee "Crimea With Ukraine" made  public a declaration emphasizing serious violations of law in  the elections that have just taken place. The "statement by  Yuryy Meshkov, the highest official in the Republic, made on the  eve of the election" is called one of the grossest violations.  The documents also points to the fact that according to  preliminary findings, the poll did not result in an overwhelming  approval -- it was ignored by the Crimean Tatars, a considerable  part of Ukrainians, and representatives of other nationalities.  "We are confident," the declaration's authors stated, "that the  poll's results will be fabricated." In this connection, the  OKNR and other Crimean pro-Ukrainian organizations announced  their intention of coordinating their activities regarding the  issues of "preserving Ukraine's territorial integrity."    Leaders of the Ukrainian Civilian Congress, the Committee  "Crimea With Ukraine", and the OKNR held a press conference,  where Ihor Banakh, deputy chairman of the Committee "Crimea With  Ukraine," discussed "numerous violations during the Crimean  election." In his words, there were cases in which one  individual could vote for several candidates. In one of the  electoral districts of the Krasnoperekopsk District, the militia  detained a group of people encouraging people to vote for the  "Russia" Bloc. Members of electoral commissions removed posted  information on pro-Ukrainian candidates. Ihor Banakh expressed  his personal hope that official Kiev will pursue tougher  policies with regard to manifestations of the Crimean separatism.</p>

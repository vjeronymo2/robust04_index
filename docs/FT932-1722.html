			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (23): Why the Think Tanks overflow - Management THE TRANSFORMATION OF AMERICAN POLITICS: THE NEW WASHINGTON AND THE RISE OF THE THINK TANKS by David M Ricci Yale Pounds 25, 310 pages SYSTEMS OF SURVIVAL: A DIALOGUE ON THE MORAL FOUNDATIONS OF COMMERCE AND POLITICS by Jane Jacobs Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 16.99, 238 pages DIAL 'M' for Political Theorist: Machiavelli, Madison, Mandeville, Marx, Mill, Montaigne, Montesquieu, More; and the middle name of David M. Ricci, who has written a stimulating academic account of the Washington Think Tank. This amounts to a book about how ideas enter into public life as data, speeches, or public policy research. The pluralism in Washington which makes President Clinton appear indecisive results from the rise of non-government lobby and public policy organisations at a time when the Washington professional was becoming a manipulator of information rather than an interpreter of moral or spiritual certainties. While WASP ideals and the Eastern establishment (such as the Council on Foreign Relations in New York) held sway in the 1970s, the thinkers emerging from institutions like Harvard's Kennedy School simply took the train south and plied their trade in Washington. In England, Oxford graduates became civil servants and Cambridge graduates professional spies. In America, Ivy League professional schools fed the equivalent of their own Washington bureaux, pro or contra government. Bored lawyers, tired of government contracts, had the opportunity for pro-bono work in social or political causes to remind them why they became lawyers in the first place. There was plenty of excess capacity: membership of the DC Bar trebled between 1973 and 1981 (to 34,000); you were more likely to be sued than mugged on the Metro. The Think Tanks grew on this supply of expertise. The Brookings Institution (1927), the Institute for Policy Studies (1963), the Heritage Foundation (1973) and countless Political Action Committees provided the jobs and the environment for informed debate adjacent to the academy and to government. Alongside them, professional research organisations also prospered in the 1970s and 1980s; by 1981 there were 80,000 private research association staff in Washington. 'Anyone who can raise enough money and hire the right sort of experts,' says Ricci, 'can establish a think tank and start churning out books, newsletters, briefing, conferences, and the like. The really acute questions are who will pay attention to these sorts of things, if at all, and why.' But the book fails to answer those acute questions. He interviews few people in power, and decides not to chart specific legislative measures which flow like pulses of energy through the Washington medium. Ricci focuses too narrowly on Washington. After all, Messrs Bradley, Woodward and Bernstein were to be found in the Hamptons in the 1980s, mixing with New York media people on Long Island. He also mentions but ignores the impact of that American institution, the Op-Ed page, a much more catholic gathering of voices than its counterpart in the UK. The book periodically returns to the question of 'how things get done on the Potomac', as if Wall Street finance houses or Mid-Town public relations agencies (the new Madison Avenue after advertising's decline in the late 1980s) have no purchase on power. Already in the mid-1980s public relations firms in New York were retained by foreign governments to manipulate information outside Washington - a form of privatised diplomacy. It may be that the National Journal (January 1986) correctly identified the 150 men and women in Washington 'who made a difference', but the technique of identifying and contacting opinion formers by direct means was part of John Scanlon's brilliant campaign for CBS in the Westmorland Trial during 1985 in New York. In other words, Washington has no monopoly on either influence or sophisticated information management. This is not Hedrick Smith's gossipy, informed Washington case study, The Power Game, because Ricci determines to deliver history rather than information. The essence of Washington flavours books like Zbigniew Brzezinski's 1983 Power and Principle, Stephen Hess's The Ultimate Insiders (published by The Brookings Institute, 1986) or even Garry Wills's Reagan's America: Innocents At Home (1987). Read these, alongside Walter Isaacson's superb recent biography of Kissinger, for full Washington exposure. The strengths of Ricci's book lie in his history and his allusiveness. He holds Francis Bacon responsible, in The New Atlantis (1624) for creating the idea of a clearing house for the wise, an apolitical symposium of ideas called Salomon's House. The early Constitutional notion of an equilibrium of opinions found expression in the 1960s and 1970s when the expertise, the marketing and the need for multiplied opinions led to the formation and growth of the Think Tank. Ricci writes excellently on the growth and scientification of American higher education since 1865, on the arrival of what he calls Big Government after the New Deal, on the decline of WASP ideals and the rise of a cultural and political pluralism, and on the increasing privatisation of government such that Jimmy Carter said in 1978: 'Government cannot solve our problems . . . eliminate poverty, or provide a bountiful economy, or reduce inflation, or save our cities.' Alongside Ricci's detailed polemic, Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics by Jane Jacobs is a difficult, coded dinner-table symposium rather like Castiglione's Book of the Courtier or one of Thomas Love Peacock's novels. Jacobs maintains that human systems devolve into Commercial or Guardian syndromes, the former relying on contractual and collaborative patterns of behaviour, the latter on hierarchy and individuality. Fundamental questions emerge, but the format drains them of seriousness: the diners interrupt each other with 'This is a mite far-fetched' or 'Stop right there. I've heard about leveraged buyouts - who hasn't - but I don't understand them.' Legal and social theorists such as Judith Schklar or Robert Nozick or Martha Nussbaum patrol the same beat, but have the advantage of citing the sources. Jacobs's notes should be more integrated into the text, not excised from it. The range of reference is both wide and enthusiastic: from Stephen Jay Gould's 'co-opted epiphenomena' back to Machiavelli the political theorist.</p>

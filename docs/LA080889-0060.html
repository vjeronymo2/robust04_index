			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> MCI Accused of Illegal Pricing: American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. accused  its biggest competitor, MCI Corp., of offering large business customers  illegally low prices to win their long-distance telephone business. AT&amp;T  officials said they hope that the complaint will lead to a reversal of a  Federal Communications Commission policy that exempts AT&amp;T competitors from  having to file papers with the FCC detailing rates and other terms that they  offer customers. In its complaint to the FCC, AT&amp;T alleged that MCI has  used unlawful discriminatory discounts the past two years to win contracts with  the Pentagon, Merrill Lynch and others.  </P></p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / JP Morgan allows peek into 'black box' JP Morgan, the US investment bank, is to open up a central component of its 'black box', an internal system for measuring financial risks. It will make the system it uses to measure daily movements in interest rates  -including money markets, swaps, and government bonds - exchange rates and equity indices available free of charge, even though this has taken years of work and many millions of dollars to build up. JP Morgan said it aimed to improve risk management and foster greater stability in markets for derivative instruments such as swaps, futures and options. The move follows reports by industry bodies, such as the Group of 30 and the Bank for International Settlements, which have stressed the benefits of a single consistent measure for calculating market risk. 'This is a tool box rather than a black box,' said Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of JP Morgan, and head of the G30 study, which recommended the use of a consistent measure to calculate market risk. JP Morgan said its 'Risk - Metrics' system provides a consistent methodology for measuring market risks and data needed for daily evaluation of risk. The information will be provided through public access computer networks and some other channels. Background, Page 27</p>

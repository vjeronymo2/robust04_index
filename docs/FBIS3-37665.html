			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin] </F>   [Text] Zagreb, 21 Feb -- "The danger of air strikes against  Sarajevo has essentially been lifted at the current stage,  although the possibility of major provocations and adventurist  sorties has not been completely ruled out." This was stated in  an exclusive interview given to ITAR-TASS by Vitaliy Churkin,  special representative of the president of the Russian  Federation and deputy foreign minister, at Zagreb airport today  on his return from the Bosnian capital.    "The Serbs are firmly observing the promise they gave to  Russia, their heavy guns have been either withdrawn or brought  under UN control, and the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]  leadership has no complaints about them. The questions raised  yesterday by the Russian side with the command of Bosnian Serbs  were solved on the spot, and relevant orders were given and  executed in our presence," the Russian diplomat said.    Commenting, at an ITAR-TASS correspondent's request, on the  statement by Ejup Ganic, vice president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, to the effect that some hours  before the NATO ultimatum expired 40 to 50 percent of the Serb  heavy guns remained in their former positions, the Russian  president's special envoy said: "Among the Muslim figures there  are people who are making nervous and sometimes irresponsible  statements. The figure of 40-50 percent is unrealistic. An  insignificant number of Serb heavy guns have indeed remained,  but they are dispersed across the eight areas allocated for this  purpose. But these heavy guns have been declared to the United  Nations and are under its control. Some of these guns are  simply out of order, the rest have been made incapable of  immediate military use. UNPROFOR has no complaints to the Serbs  regarding these armaments", Churkin stressed. Today our  battalion starts performing its new duties in the capital's  district of Grbavica along the disengagement line. This is a  difficult area of Sarajevo, where French "blue helmets" too are  performing the peace-making mission, he said.    V. Churkin noted that the Russian delegation received "all  the necessary assurances" from Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency  President Alija Izetbegovic "that there will be no kind of  provocations and additional complications for our soldiers." In  a short speech for the press Izetbegovic yesterday stressed that  "the Russians have come as friends." As regards the Serb  population in the areas surrounding Sarajevo, then, in the words  of the diplomat, it has received the Russian servicemen "very  well and even enthusiastically." "The very presence of the  Russian 'blue berets' is calming and stabilizing the situation  in Sarajevo," he said.    Commenting on Russia's attitude to the meeting commencing in  Bonn tomorrow of representatives of the foreign ministries of  Russia, the United States, and EC member states, which will  proceed with the involvement of a UN delegation, V. Churkin  described it as an "important diplomatic if not political  event." "Such a meeting is taking place for the first time  after overcoming the crisis in Sarajevo, and in my view this is  a move to a new level of unity in the efforts of key members of  the international community in settling the Bosnian problem. We  are preparing for this meeting and hope that it will be followed  by meetings at a higher level. Overcoming the crisis in Bosnia  will make it possible to energetically complete a settlement in  Bosnia as a whole," he concluded.    On the same day, V. Churkin flew to Bonn to take part in the  forthcoming meeting of high-ranking officials.</p>

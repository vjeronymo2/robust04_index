			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: SNP prepares to lead a nation THE Scottish National party yesterday launched what was in effect not one manifesto but two: one for this election and one for the first post-independence election. The first four pages of the manifesto Independence in Europe - Make It Happen Now] are devoted to the SNP's plans for independence and a Scottish constitution if it wins a majority of Scottish seats on April 9. The remaining 13 pages and the whole of a companion brochure called Recovery in Scotland - Make It Happen Now] put forward detailed plans and costings for the SNP's agenda should it win a general election to be called immediately after independence becomes a reality. Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP, said his party was offering Scots political and economic freedom and a chance to go forward into the mainstream of Europe, rather than remain stuck in a regional backwater of Britain. Mr Jim Sillars, SNP deputy leader, called it 'a people manifesto', and said it was time for Scots to face their responsibilities. Responding to claims by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, that business would be driven out of Scotland by constitutional change, Mr Salmond said: 'We are offering a competitive environment for Scottish business.' He pledged to bring business rates in Scotland down to the levels south of the border within the four years of the first Scottish parliament. In the same period, 200,000 jobs would be created by the party's medium-term recovery strategy, Mr Salmond said. The SNP manifesto was intended to prove the party's economic credibility, but Mr Salmond did not deny that theirs was nonetheless the most leftwing of the manifestos on offer. He said that the SNP was in line with the mainstream social democratic tradition in Europe. Mr Salmond accepted that voters might reject the latter half of the SNP's manifesto in a post-independence election, but as Mr Sillars pointed out, unlike the other political parties, the SNP has to win only once to achieve its main aim.  -------------------------------------- SNP 1987  -------------------------------------- Votes                    416,473 % of total votes             1.3 Seats                          3 Candidates for 1992           72  --------------------------------------</p>

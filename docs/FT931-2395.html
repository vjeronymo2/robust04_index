			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / UN aid convoy finally reaches besieged Srebrenica: Personal triumph for French commander A UNITED NATIONS aid convoy, led by the charismatic French commander of UN forces in Bosnia, was yesterday greeted by thousands of cheering and weeping people as it finally reached the besieged town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia. The convoy of 16 trucks, carrying 175 tonnes of food and medical supplies, had been repeatedly blocked by the Bosnian Serbs over the past nine days, and was only the third to reach Srebrenica since Bosnia's civil war began last April. Its arrival in a town whose population had swollen to 60,000 people by the inflow of refugees from the surrounding region and where 40 people were reported to be dying every day, was a personal triumph for General Philippe Morillon, the UN commander. Gen Morillon, in the teeth of disapproval of his superiors in the UN, had gone to Srebrenica last Thursday and declared that he would not leave the town until aid for its desperate population arrived. Serb authorities allowed the convoy into eastern Bosnia only after the general, who had gone to the border to negotiate with the local Serb militia commander, agreed to Serb demands that the convoy should travel without military escort and leave behind two Belgian doctors and three UN military observers. The general also insisted to the local Serb leaders that he had the authorisation of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia for the convoy to proceed to Srebrenica. Once in the town, Gen Morillon warned that, following a lightning offensive, Srebrenica was close to capture by Bosnian Serb forces, who were only 2kms away. A UN official had earlier reported that Moslem positions and targets 4kms away had been hit by a shell every second during a 15-minute period. The convoy was due to spend the night in Srebrenica and evacuate the hundreds of sick and wounded in the trucks that brought in supplies. Conditions in the town were reported to be appalling by UN officials. Diarrhoea was rampant as the result of contaminated water and food was so scarce that fights broke out over supplies dropped by US aircraft. The people, many without shelter and adequate clothing, wandered about the streets in an 'indescribably filthy' condition and as many as 30 people wounded by shellfire were treated every day in local clinics chronically short of medical supplies, the official said. Before the arrival of the convoy in Srebrenica, Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, had urged the US to provide heavy helicopters to fly in supplies and evacuate wounded people from the town. She asked Washington to double the amount of food it has been parachuting into the stricken town. Shortly afterwards, the US State Department announced it would double its airdropped relief supplies in Bosnia to 60 tonnes a day. In New York, meanwhile, the UN Security Council yesterday began consultations on a resolution proposed by France, and backed by the US and Britain, authorising immediate enforcement of the no-fly zone in Bosnia. It is expected to be adopted next week. The initiative was taken by France following the bombing a week ago of two Moslem villages by Serbian aircraft in the first major violation of the ban on military flights over Bosnia since it was imposed by the Council last November. The western move is also aimed at encouraging Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem Bosnian president, to accept the plan by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international mediators on the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, to divide the country into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. Mr Izetbegovic on Thursday boycotted the talks in protest to the events in eastern Bosnia, but returned to the negotiating table with the mediators again today after the arrival of the convoy in Srebrenica. The mediators are convinced that, if they manage to convince the Bosnian president to sign their plan, it will become easier to pressure Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to do the same.</p>

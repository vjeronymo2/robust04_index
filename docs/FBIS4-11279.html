			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 1600 GMT on 25 April carries its "Straight Talk" program with  host Osvaldo Rodriguez and his guest, reporter Luis Sexto of  BOHEMIA magazine.    The topic of the discussion is: What country do we live in  today? Rodriguez and Sexto point out that Cuba is overcoming the  economic crisis. Although there are pessimists who believe that  all is lost, Sexto points out that Cuba is poised on the runway,  ready for takeoff.    Rodriguez focuses on two words used by Sexto in his  arguments: ignorance and pessimism. Rodriguez says that those  who cannot see the progress are more ignorant than pessimistic.  He believes that many people will have to see progress in their  own homes before they can believe.    Sexto points out that Cuba has developed its infrastructure  during the past 30 years. He says: "Nowadays there is a trend  toward denying all that has been accomplished in Cuba during the  past 30 years. In other words, we are in these circumstances and  what we did in the past is no longer good. Of course, they do  not realize that external factors are greatly influencing the  internal reality of Cuba."    Sexto goes on to say that there are many signs of recovery:  "Every time a factory goes into operation, Cuba advances a  millimeter down the runway for its takeoff. A few months back,  we put the cardboard factory in Santa Cruz del Norte into  operation. That is good news. We believe the current sugar  harvest will be a bit better than the past harvest. If we  produce 1,000 tons more, than we will have grown another  millimeter in our situation. We will have produced more than  last year."    Rodriguez points out that there have been other  achievements:  "Now that you are talking about accomplishments, I should remind  you that in the first quarter 305,000 tons of oil were extracted  from Cuban soil. This represents a 12-percent growth in relation  to the goal for that quarter. It also represents an increase in  comparison to last year."    Regarding this, Sexto replies: "That is a record high  figure.  In other words, during the month of January, oil workers worked  very hard. There are some who say that no one works in this  country. Nevertheless, the oil workers have rejected that  superficial and incomplete vision that is circulating."    With regard to the tobacco, pharmaceuticals, and oil  industries, Sexto points out: "In the past, the tobacco crops  suffered some deterioration. I believe there has been a recovery  in this area. This year we have had a good harvest.    "I also understand that the income from biotechnological and  biopharmaceutical products is increasing. We also know that our  nickel is selling well. It is even being marketed, if I am not  mistaken, in more than 20 countries and its price has increased.    "As you mentioned just seconds ago, oil extraction has  increased. The possibility of finding better oil and in greater  quantities may not be an off-the-wall possibility. It may be a  very serious possibility. Some people have said that those are  real possibilities. In other words, we have foreign companies  which have invested a large sum of money in this country and I  believe that no one invests money blindly and foolishly. I  believe there must be a certainty, a certain guarantee that what  is being invested will not be lost."    Regarding the economy and public opinion, Sexto says: "There  is a poll that indicates that 65 percent of the those questioned  believe that with the gradual application of measures that will  be adopted in the next few months, our economy will benefit."    Rodriguez remarks: "That same survey points out that only  1.4  percent of those questioned believe that there is no need for  measures."    Sexto concludes by saying: "That 65 percent believes that  the  economic measures that will be adopted in the next few months  will gradually help improve the country indicates that there is  a tendency toward optimism. Workers truly trust in the strategy  that our country has followed to overcome this difficult  situation." "Straight Talk" ends at 1615 GMT.</p>

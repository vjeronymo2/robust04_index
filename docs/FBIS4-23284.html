			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 1 SAPA -- The South African Police  Union [SAPU] which claims to have more than 30,000 members  countrywide on Wednesday [1 June] demanded the immediate  reversal of a decision by the medical aid schemes Polmed and  Medihelp to reduce benefits for employees of the the South  African Police Service [SAPS]. SAPU said in statement the  unilateral decision followed media statements by minister of  safety and security Mr Sydney Mufamadi that he would meet police  unions to thrash out issues of salaries and benefits. The union  criticised the medical aid schemes' decision as "arrogance of  the worst kind".    According to SAPU it would embark on action which would have  a serious effect on the medical aid schemes should the decision  not be reversed. The reduction of benefits was "a slap in the  face of SAPS employees" who were already financially  disadvantaged. The statement said SAPU had already entered  negotiations with other employee organisations, medical  professionals and the SAPS on the issue.</p>

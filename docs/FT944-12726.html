			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Investors are expected to focus on the short-term money markets, which will be affected by seasonal and technical factors this week. A substantial rise in fund demand from banks, due to month-end funding, corporate tax payments and the public holiday on Thursday, is likely to put upward pressure on short-term rates. The banks are also expected to increase fund procurement for the year-end, pushing up two-month interest rates. Over the past few weeks, the Bank of Japan has allowed short-term rates to rise moderately in the face of increasing evidence of a gradual economic recovery. Although it has been forced to adopt an easier stance because of the yen's appreciation against the dollar, economists expect it to allow a further rise in short-term rates because of the underlying economic trends. 'We expect the BoJ to allow a gradual widening of the spread between the overnight call rate and the ODR,' says DKB International. Meanwhile, oversupply worries are adding to investor cautiousness as corporate borrowing on the straight bond markets seems set to increase. Last week Tokyo Electric Power, the leading electric utility company, said it would issue Y100bn of straight bonds in November and corporations are also expected to turn to the Eurobond markets for funds.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DUFFY USED $61,802 OF SECRET FUND;  </P> <P> SHERIFF: UNDER COURT ORDER, DUFFY REVEALS HOW HE SPENT MONEY FROM HIS SEIZED  DRUG ASSETS ACCOUNT.  </P> <P> San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy distributed more than $60,000 in seized  drug proceeds from a secret $1-million checking account he created to bypass  the county's spending approval, according to a summary of the account released  Wednesday under court order.  </P> <P> Forced by court order Tuesday to turn over the $1.044 million he gathered in  the secret account, Duffy also was under Superior Court Judge Harrison  Hollywood's order to show during a hearing Wednesday how he spent the money.  </P> <P> Almost all of the $61,802 he spent went to the district attorney's office for  its participation in drug busts and to various city governments that contract  with the Sheriff's Department for service and were entitled to share in the  proceeds.  </P> <P> But Duffy also spent $5,400 for an attorney to defend himself in a civil  lawsuit. County auditors warned Duffy in June that spending drug money for  attorneys was improper when they discovered that he paid nearly $70,000 earlier  this year to the same law firm for the same purpose.  </P> <P> Hollywood asked a court-appointed certified public accountant to verify Duffy's  account. Duffy attorney Janet Houts said the sheriff has asked U.S. Atty. Gen.  Dick Thornburgh to audit the entire county drug fund account.  </P> <P> The county's sheriff for 20 years, Duffy's last term has been marked by  continual controversy. He has been feuding with the Board of Supervisors for  months over who controls the money and property the Sheriff's Department seizes  in drug raids.  </P> <P> The sheriff had control of the money until July, when supervisors voted to  usurp his spending authority. At the time, Duffy wanted to spend $450,000 on  laptop computers for his department. Supervisors wanted the money spent on  security measures at the South Bay jail in Chula Vista.  </P> <P> Duffy lost the battle, but decided he would no longer let county supervisors  determine how the money was spent. He said the county had violated federal  guidelines for how the money can be spent.  </P> <P> In September, he opened a checking account with the San Diego office of  Security Pacific National Bank and deposited 11 checks totaling $372,697. A  week later, he added eight more checks that totaled $303,689. On Nov. 1, the  day after county auditors discovered the secret account, Duffy deposited 17  more checks that totaled $423,109. The account earned $6,745 in interest.  </P> <P> Assistant County Auditor William J. Kelly said Wednesday it appears that Duffy  earned 5% to 6% interest on the secret account. The county treasury earns 9%,  he said.  </P> <P> County officials said that Duffy violated a county ordinance that requires all  funds be deposited into the county treasury.  </P> <P> Duffy wrote 15 checks from the secret account, most to the district attorney's  office and the cities of Vista, Encinitas, Poway, Lemon Grove and San Marcos,  city governments that contract with the Sheriff's Department and share in the  drug bust proceeds.  </P> <P> One check, in the amount of $5,400, went to Duffy attorney Martin J. Mayer to  defend the sheriff against deputies involved in the so-called "Rambo Squad"  case at the El Cajon jail.  </P> <P> Duffy previously had paid nearly $70,000 to the same law firm, which county  auditors rejected as an improper expenditure and asked him to repay.  </P> <P> Duffy wrote a check Tuesday in the amount of $1,044,429 -- the entire amount of  the fund -- which Judge Hollywood had ordered him Friday to deposit in a  court-controlled trust fund.  </P> <P> At the sheriff's request, Hollywood ordered the county to deposit drug money  not contained in the secret account into the court's trust fund, where it is to  be frozen until the matter is resolved. Hollywood said he did so to show both  parties that he is impartial.  </P> <P> The county turned over $555,000 and was allowed to exclude $1.2 million the  county already appropriated from the sheriff's budget.  </P> <P> Of the $1.2 million, the appropriations included: $404,300 approved for the  Chula Vista Jail improvements; $241,675 for a electronic bracelets for  prisoners who were participating in a home surveillance program; and $50,000  for a study on whether to establish a regional crime lab.  </P> <P> Hollywood has asked retired Superior Court Judge William Yale to mediate the  dispute among Duffy, the Board of Supervisors, county counsel and sheriff-elect  Jim Roache. Roache, who is to be sworn in Jan. 7, was in court Wednesday and  said he was concerned about how the drug funds can be spent in the future.  </P> <P> All parties agreed to a Dec. 20 mediation date, although they will try to meet  earlier. Hollywood also asked the county counsel to study how other counties  resolve disputes over drug funds.  </P> <P> Roache said he had not taken a position on whether the sheriff or supervisors  should have authority over the money until his attorney, Everett Bobbitt,  studies federal and state laws that govern the use of the money. He said he  disagreed that Duffy was permitted to use the money for attorney's fees.  </P></p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: MCI takes Dollars 150m charge for reshape MCI Communications, the second-largest US long-distance telephone company, is to take a one-off charge of up to Dollars 150m in the fourth quarter to cover the cost of its continuing realignment into three strategic groups, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. Under the reorganisation, announced in September, MCI is scrapping four domestic divisions and one international unit, and creating three separate groups - one for US operations, one for overseas business, and one for emerging technologies such as interactive multimedia and wireless communications. The costs incurred have been related mostly to the streamlining of MCI's engineering and network operations facilities, and the relocation of those operations to lower-cost areas. The latest charge will also help pay for commercial litigation contingencies and other restructuring moves, including those linked to its forthcoming acquisition of British Telecom North America.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Zimbabwe faces liquidity crisis ZIMBABWE is facing a serious money market liquidity crisis following the Reserve (central) Bank of Zimbabwe's decision to close its rediscount window, refusing to accommodate the market except at penal overnight rates of interest. The sudden tightening of monetary policy, which took effect at the end of June, follows a reported agreement between Zimbabwe and the International Monetary Fund for an enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF). One of the terms of the agreement is understood to be that Zimbabwe maintains positive real interest rates, which, with inflation in May of 36.5 per cent, implies a marked increase in bank lending rates. Money market sources said the Reserve Bank tighted its monetary stance when it failed to meet IMF benchmarks on June 30, and was given until July 15 to bring credit creation levels down to those stipulated by the Fund. The central bank's move was prompted also by the publication of a surprising set of monetary aggregates showing that money supply rose 34 per cent in the year to May, which came as a shock after a marked slowdown earlier in the year. In April the broad (M2) measure of money was growing at an annual rate of only 20 per cent. The money supply figures were a surprise because the rate of bank lending had slowed in recent months. Between May and December last year total bank lending, including that by the finance houses, rose more than 53 per cent to ZDollars 6.85bn (Pounds 730m), but in the first five months of 1992, lending was up less than 8 per cent to ZDollars 7.4bn. Last week the Reserve Bank pushed its rediscount rate to 30 per cent from 25 per cent - the second such five-point increase in the past three months - while the rate for 90-day money (Negotiable Certificates of Deposit) surged to 38 per cent. Despite the authorities' clear intention of pushing up rates to meet the IMF's demands and also to curb inflation, some banks are urging the authorities to ease monetary policy, warning that if the tight money policy is maintained, there will be some large corporate collapses. The central bank has responded by asking the banks to use their USDollars 140m (Pounds 73.2m) lines of offshore credit, available for pre-shipment financing of tobacco exports, and also to draw on their soft loan facilities of USDollars 80m provided to help agriculture recover from drought. But the banks say that this will not be adequate and warn of a serious crisis in weeks unless policy is eased. The liquidity crisis comes at a most unwelcome time for the government, which cannot afford to back down on monetary policy, ahead of a crucial budget to be presented by the finance minister, Mr Bernard Chidzero, on July 30. Mr Chidzero is also committed, in terms of the ESAF deal with the Fund, to cut public spending by no less than 6 percentage points of GDP, or approximately USDollars 400m.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Banking on low prices UK base rates will rise. Nothing in yesterday's inflation report from the Bank of England will change that. But the reduction in the Bank's medium-term inflation forecast to 2.5 per cent means that a rise in rates is not pressing. Nor may the eventual increase need to be as great as the markets fear. The report could still provide Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, with an excuse to push for an immediate rate increase in his meeting today with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. It plausibly argues that the probability of overshooting the 2.5 per cent forecast is greater than that of undershooting. The main risk is that producer price inflation will feed through to retail prices. Moreover, the Bank clearly feels uncomfortable with a projection right at the top of its 1 per cent to 2.5 per cent target range. Even so, the betting must be that Bank will wait for further evidence before urging action. Central to the Bank's analysis is the assumption that September's increase in base rates will cut inflation by nearly half a percentage point. The reasoning is that consumers are still so heavily weighed down by debt that interest rate rises will have a bigger effect on demand than in previous cycles. If the Bank is correct, inflation could fall to the middle of its target range without any need for base rates at the peak to rise beyond 7 per cent. All this is encouraging for markets. Though US bonds may continue to be knocked by fears over US inflation, the better inflation outlook in the UK should lead to a further narrowing in yield gap between gilts and Treasuries. Equities would then be carried higher too.</p>

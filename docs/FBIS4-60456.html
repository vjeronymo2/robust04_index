			<p>BFN     [Text] The Islamic Group has dismissed recent charges by  the Egyptian Human Rights Organization saying it had killed  eight Christians in Asyut over the past four months.    The Islamic Group issued a statement saying that killing  Copts is not its objective, adding that security authorities  have always tried to raise accusations against it to conceal the  facts and their incompetence at identifying the real criminals.  The security authorities' objective is to distort the image of  the Islamic Group in Egypt and abroad, it added.    The Islamic Group said that it is concerned with the issue  of  the Copts and that the Copts' rights, which were approved by  Islam, will be respected at present and in future.</p>

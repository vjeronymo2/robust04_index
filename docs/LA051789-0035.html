			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> STOCKS ;  </P> <P> PROFIT TAKING SNUFFS RALLY; DOW OFF 10.44  </P> <P> Stock prices pulled back Tuesday amid selling to collect profits amassed during  the previous two strong sessions.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which ran up a gain of nearly 82 points  on Friday and Monday, finished with a loss of 10.44 points at 2,453.45.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 7 to 6 in nationwide  trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 791 down, 677 up and 500  unchanged.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 173.1 million shares, down from  179.35 million in the previous session.  </P> <P> Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in  those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled  211.64 million shares.  </P> <P> "Basically, what we're seeing is a bit of a pullback after two very strong  days," said Gordon L. Smith, a managing director at the investment firm Alex.  Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore. "This is quite normal. The market took  quite a run and needs to pause."  </P> <P> The selling, which wasn't confined to any particular type of stock, appeared to  be motivated mainly by the desire to collect profits, he said.  </P> <P> Market operators decided the time was right to sell because the government is  due to release some potentially market-moving economic figures today and  Thursday, said Peter VandenBerg, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman  Hutton Inc.  </P> <P> Today, the Commerce Department is scheduled to report on the country's  merchandise trade performance in March, and the following day the Labor  Department releases its April consumer price index.  </P> <P> International Business Machines skidded 1 3/8 to 111 3/8. The computer giant  unveiled a new OfficeVision family of software designed to be compatible with  IBM machines of all sizes.  </P> <P> Among companies involved in mergers or attempted takeovers, Ogilvy Group eased  1/8 to 53 1/8 in heavy over-the-counter trading as more than 1.7 million shares  changed hands. The advertising and marketing concern has agreed to be acquired  by Britain's WPP Group for $54 a share, or about $864 million.  </P> <P> Avon Products, which has received a $39-a-share offer from privately held Amway  Corp., was up 5/8 at 40 1/4, a new 52-week high. Amway has indicated that it  would consider paying more if Avon would agree to a negotiated deal.  </P> <P> On the Tokyo stock market, share prices rose, boosted by purchases by  investment trusts and some financial institutions. But the dollar's strength  against the yen kept many sidelined, brokers said.  </P> <P> The 225-share Nikkei index surged 210.16 points to 33,926.45. The index fell  150.04 points Monday.  </P> <P> In London, share prices closed lower in light trading as the market  consolidated its strong gains of the past two trading sessions.  </P> <P> At the close, the Financial Times 100-share index was down 13.2 points at  2,136.7, just 0.7 point above its lowest level.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> The bond market closed mostly higher as a late rally boosted the price of  long-term government securities.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up 9/32 point, or about $2.82 per  $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from  price, fell to 8.81% from 8.84% late Monday.  </P> <P> Trading was light most of the day, with prices stable or slightly down until a  late flurry of buying.  </P> <P> Analysts attributed the market's behavior, which followed a decline in bond  prices Monday, to internal influences following a strong run-up last week on  signs of modest inflation.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  were down 1/32 point to up 1/32 point, intermediate maturities were unchanged  to up 3/16 point and long-term issues were up as much as 3/16 point, according  to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.  </P> <P> In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal  bonds was unchanged at 92 7/8. The average yield to maturity held steady at  7.52%.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills issued Monday rose to 8.50% as the  discount rose 3 basis points to 8.22%. Yields on new six-month bills fell to  8.72% as the discount fell 4 basis points to 8.25%. Yields on one-year bills  were unchanged 8.84% as the discount held at 8.19%.  </P> <P> A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the  annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the  percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at  maturity.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded  at 9.1875%, down from 9.8125% late Monday.  </P></p>

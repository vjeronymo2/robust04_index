			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Socialist Party, by Pal Szombathy; place and date not given: "We  Will Not Be Short of Coalition Partners"]    [Text] The discussion on 3 January with [former prime  minister, now international banker] Miklos Nemeth will end  speculations about his return to Hungary, Gyula Horn told  NEPSZABADSAG. Horn said that raising the idea of a future  liberal-conservative coalition does not show any political  foresight. In his view, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is  not in danger of finding itself in quarantine and it will find  coalition partners if it achieves good results at the  elections.    [Szombathy] According to our information, on 3 January, you  talked to Miklos Nemeth for two and a half hours, and the  dilemmas of his political return were the topic of the  conversation.    [Horn] It is true that we held a long discussion with  Nemeth. We agreed that we would soon jointly inform the public  on the result of our consultation.    [Szombathy] Is it correct to assume that your joint  statement will end the speculations over his possible return to  Hungary?    [Horn] Presumably, yes.    [Szombathy] It is not the first time it has been suggested,  and not only by [Federation of Young Democrats, FIDESZ,  Chairman] Viktor Orban, that the MSZP should again be refused  the chance to form a coalition in 1994 by the parties of the  former Opposition Roundtable. In your view, after four years,  what are the chances of isolating the MSZP, which certainly  appears to be on the rise?    [Horn] If I took the suggestions of Orban and others  seriously, then I would also like to ask some questions. For  example, the liberal parties have very strongly criticized the  government's policy over the past four years; in fact, many of  their prominent representatives stated that this executive power  should be replaced in 1994. In this case, how do they imagine  new cooperation with the government parties? How seriously are  we to take everything that they have said over the past four  years? In the event of cooperation of this type, the two  liberal parties would join in some kind of continuity with the  current coalition: If this is so, then they will have to  explain this to their own supporters and voters. Why were the  other two parties of the liberal bloc left out of this assumed  alliance? It was the FIDESZ that said that the liberal  coalition of four parties would be able to win the elections.  Finally: Is it really so important for them to get into power  by all means? In my view, these plans, which even preceded the  calling of the elections, are distasteful. We can hear little  about the program that the liberals want to implement. The  remaining four months will be a serious challenge to the  country: Raising this kind of proposal at this moment does not  show political foresight.    [Szombathy] Is there a real danger to the MSZP in this kind  of possible "quarantine attempt"? Can a more or less united bloc  be established to oppose the MSZP?    [Horn] We ended the previous regime four years ago and the  MSZP played an important role in this. In democracies, parties  do not normally get excluded from cooperation; this is usually  done in dictatorships. I do not wish to make predictions, but  it will be very difficult for the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF], the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], and the FIDESZ to cooperate  without losing their own political image. The leaders of the  SZDSZ are much more cautious in their statements on this issue;  presumably their views will become clearer by the time of the  elections. For me, the important question is whether the  liberals can agree on the social and economic issues that are  important for the country.    [Szombathy] Do you expect that, in the event of an MSZP  victory at the elections, the other political forces will firmly  refuse to form a government with the Socialists ?    [Horn] A kind of evolution has taken place in the way in  which the parliamentary parties treat the MSZP: At first, they  were condescending toward us, then they spoke about a left-wing  danger, and now they are alarming the electors by saying that it  is a waste of time to vote for the Socialists because the MSZP  would not become a part of the government anyway. In my view,  if we achieve a good election result, we will find coalition  partners among the current parliamentary parties. I do not  think that we will be short of coalition partners. In my view,  the important issue is what kind of agreement can be made with  the partners as regards the government's tasks. The current  nervousness comes from the danger of losing power on one side  and from the hope of gaining it on the other. The MSZP is not  suffering from either of these illnesses.    [Szombathy] Do you consider it a possibility that the MSZP  will be forced to turn down the mandate to form a government?    [Horn] I do not deal with this issue. In January 1994, I  find it early and somewhat comical to talk about forming  coalitions. The MSZP does not want to commit itself on possible  coalition partners or its prime minister candidate.    [Szombathy] According to some people, one of the reasons  that you have not named anyone as your prime minister candidate  is that the MSZP does not really have any "marketable" prominent  people apart from yourself.    [Horn] An increasing number of prominent politicians are  appearing in the party; I could mention at least eight to 10  names. Unfortunately, the opposition is in a difficult position  in presenting its politicians on Hungarian Television, which has  the greatest effect.    [Szombathy] Failing all else, can we arrive at a situation  where the MSZP names [SZDSZ Parliamentary Group Leader] Gabor  Kuncze as its nominee?    [Horn] I would like to affirm that Gabor Kuncze will not be  our prime minister candidate. Whether the MSZP will support  Kuncze after the elections is a different issue. It is also to  be seen whom, in case of a certain result, the SZDSZ would  support for prime minister from the Socialists.... We will draw  up our national list in February, but we would not like to  commit ourselves to anyone. The country is bound to have a  coalition government. For us, it is not a key issue that the  leader of the new cabinet should come from the MSZP. The  structure of the new government must not be decided by loyalty  to a party. I do not exclude the possibility that the next  prime minister will not be a leading party politician.    [Szombathy] Does this mean that we can be certain that you  will not nominate a prime minister until the elections?    [Horn] Nothing is certain in politics. However, there are  no rules that say that the leader of the national list has to be  a candidate at the same time. We will maintain our current view  on this issue and I do not think that the sensible public will  fail to understand this.    [Szombathy] The view can often be heard that the MSZP is not  at all interested in getting into government. Is it possible  that you will be a constructive opposition with a 20 to 25  percent result?    [Horn] We do not want to get into government by any means:  We would not participate in a coalition that does not agree on  certain basic economic and political issues, and does not state  that people living on wages and salaries cannot be burdened  forever with the costs of the changes. However, it was probably  our opponents who concocted the story that we are not seriously  thinking of taking on a governmental role: All serious parties  work to this end. The new government will only have a chance to  fulfill its four-year term if it seeks ways for social  reconciliation.    [Szombathy] MSZP members often say that stability can only  be preserved if the left wing and the trade unions are involved  in power. In your view, would a left-wing opposition increase  the chances of a government crisis?    [Horn] The new executive will definitely have to come to an  agreement with the trade unions. The left wing, which fosters  the best relations with them, has the best chance to do this.  However, our relations will probably have their problems.    [Szombathy] The MSZP's popularity is increasing. The  question is, how much will your individual candidates be able to  achieve, coming from different strata of society and entering  into the competition from different backgrounds. A larger  parliamentary group can also expect conflicts similar to those  of the MDF....    [Horn] It is certain that people whom we do not welcome have  also appeared around the party, but the party's leadership was  not able to influence the selection of the candidates. However,  I am not aware of any nominations where the expertise and  honesty of the candidate was not taken into consideration. I  can only welcome such a broad range of people. Presumably,  after the elections, the MSZP's group of deputies will be much  larger: The professional structure of the parliamentary group  will be important. Naturally, the number of conflicts increases  in a larger community. It is a lie to claim that there are any  people at all among our candidates who returned as former  leaders after turning their backs on politics in 1990.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GEORGIA LINEBACKER ARRESTED IN COCAINE BUST  </P> <P> Norman Cowins, the University of Georgia's star linebacker, was in the Clarke  County jail Monday after allegedly attempting to sell cocaine from a truck  parked in downtown Athens.  </P> <P> Coach Ray Goff suspended Cowins from the team after learning of the arrest.  </P> <P> Cowins, 21, was arrested and charged Sunday night with possession of a  controlled substance with intent to distribute, carrying a concealed weapon and  possession of a firearm in the commission of a crime, Athens Police Major  Joseph Lumpkin said.  </P> <P> The Clarke County Sheriff's Department said Cowins remained in jail Monday,  being held without bond.  </P> <P> Lumpkin said the police department received a complaint at 9:39 p.m. Sunday  that a man was attempting to sell cocaine from a truck at the intersection of  Henderson and Paris Street.  </P> <P> When officers arrived, they found Cowins, two men, a woman and her young  daughter at the truck, Lumpkin said. As officers approached the truck, they  noticed the barrel of a partially hidden semiautomatic pistol in the bed of the  truck.  </P> <P> At that point, officers searched the truck and found a brown bottle containing  a substance that tested positive for the presence of cocaine, Lumpkin said.  </P> <P> Cowins was the only person in the group arrested.  </P> <P> "In light of the facts presented to me, I have decided to suspend Norman Cowins  from our football team indefinitely," Goff said. "But regardless of the  circumstances, he's still one of ours, and we are committed to helping him  through this difficult period."  </P> <P> Cowins, a junior from Douglasville, Ga., has been a standout linebacker for the  Bulldogs so far, assisting in or executing 10 tackles in his first game.  </P> <P> During spring practice, Cowins won the "Best Tackler" award and was named no. 1  outside linebacker. He majors in economics.  </P></p>

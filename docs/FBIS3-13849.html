			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by political </F> correspondent Gadi Sukenik "in Jerusalem, a short while ago"--  recorded]    [Text] [Rabin] I expect the resumption of the  negotiations with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon as soon as April,  after the Passover and Independence Day holidays. I very much  hope that this time, they will be held on a much more  businesslike basis than in the past.    [Sukenik] Last night you spoke to 'Arafat on the phone.  Other than discussing the UN Security Council resolution, did  you make any promises to him that made him push to move forward?    [Rabin] I made no specific offers, except for stressing that  the Palestinians as well as ourselves should in no way grant  awards to loathsome murderers on both sides. They should not  give any prizes to Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] or the  Islamic Jihad, and we will not give any awards to the supporters  of the loathsome murderer who committed the abhorrent crime in  the Cave of the Patriarchs.    [Sukenik] Is the issue of evacuating settlers from Hebron  still off the agenda?    [Rabin] I made no commitment, except for the pledge to stand  by our responsibility -- in addition to the struggle against the  Palestinian extremist terrorism which seeks to murder Israelis  and the peace -- to provide the Palestinians with protection  against loathsome murderers the likes of that man, who does not  deserve to be called a human being, who committed the murder in  the Cave of the Patriarchs.</p>

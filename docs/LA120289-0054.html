			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ALEMANY UPSETS TAFT, 48-46, ON BURR'S 3-POINT BASKET AT BUZZER  </P> <P> Junior guard William Burr made a three-point basket as time expired Friday  night to give Alemany High a 48-46 upset win over Taft in the first round of  the fifth annual Simi Valley tournament at Simi Valley High.  </P> <P> Alemany, which did not lead until the final shot, battled back from a 40-32  deficit at the beginning of the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> With six seconds left and the Indians trailing, 46-43, Alemany's Greg Ryan made  two free throws. Taft Coach Jim Woodard used a timeout to set up an inbounds  play, but Irvin Scott's pass was intercepted by Alemany's Tim Fontenette, who  was fouled with four seconds remaining.  </P> <P> Fontenette missed the front end of the one-and-one but Ryan grabbed the rebound  and called timeout with one second remaining. Alemany Coach Rocky Moore  designed the last play to go to Fontenette, but the 6-6 forward was covered and  Burr, standing 22 feet away from the basket, took the final shot.  </P> <P> Burr scored a game-high 26 points including six three-point shots. Guard Casey  Sheahan paced Taft with 15 points and forward James Yoakum added 12. PAUL OLSON  </P></p>

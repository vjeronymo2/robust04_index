			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DELAY TACTICS BY ATTORNEYS  </P> <P> In response to "Ingenious Tactics by Attorneys May Offset Long Odds," by Edwin  Chen, Part I, April 30:  </P> <P> A potentially informative and interesting article with regard to the  difficulties faced by defense attorneys in criminal cases was tainted by Chen's  selection of cynical comments from some "experts" and reliance on undocumented  slanders. In particular, I refer to his statement, "Another pervasive defense  tactic is to delay a case endlessly." He does not explore the legitimate need  of defense lawyers to seek sufficient time to investigate their cases and  prepare appropriate legal motions; he implies that their purpose is to allow  witnesses to die, memories to fade and evidence to be lost.  </P> <P> I have practiced criminal defense for over 20 years. In that time I have  lectured others on criminal law, listened to experts on criminal law, taught  criminal law, headed a public defender law office, served as president of the  California Public Defenders Assn., and in general been constantly immersed in  the practice and theory of criminal defense in California. I have never taught  nor have I been taught that a continuance for the purposes he notes is proper  or to be sought.  </P> <P> Perhaps the next time you decide to deal with this subject your reporters will  talk to the ordinary, overburdened trial lawyers, especially those in the  public defender practice. What you will find is that they have more cases than  can be reasonably handled at any one time; that there are not enough courtrooms  to begin to try every case that the prosecution files; that some prosecutors  overfile cases with the sole purpose of forcing pleas; that some of their  defendants are not guilty and that many are not guilty of the crime charged;  that cases move very fast and that there is already precious little time and  resources to prepare the defense to a case which may have been put together  over weeks or months by police, prosecution and other personnel.  </P> <P> It might also be worth your examining the motives of the attorneys who  represent the indigent defendant. We get no more money for acquittals, we get  no less business if we are in trial a lot. While we may be less quotable than  the media stars you cite, we are a lot closer to the truth of the system, and  we know that if it were not for the efforts of a few dedicated defenders of the  criminally accused all citizens would have less freedom than they now enjoy.  </P> <P> GLEN MOWRER  </P> <P> Public Defender  </P> <P> Santa Barbara County  </P></p>

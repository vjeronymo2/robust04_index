			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Howard launches volunteers initiative Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, will today announce government proposals to increase voluntary activity in the community. The initiative will build on plans to establish a national network of volunteers as outlined by Mr John Major, prime minister, in October. Mr Howard will emphasise the need for the private, public and voluntary sectors to work together. Local organisations will be able to bid for grants to finance projects that increase the use of volunteers under a new award scheme proposed by the government. The first awards will be made later this year. Voluntary-sector leaders are concerned that in addition to calling for concerted action the government could do more to encourage the use of voluntary workers in areas such as health and education, where it has direct responsibility. Today's announcement coincides with the restructuring of Action Resource Centre, the charitable organisation that arranges the secondment of employees with business skills to voluntary organisations. It is to be known as Action: Employees in the Community and will operate in conjunction with Business in the Community. This week also sees the launch of the government-supported Community Development Foundation's Streets Ahead initiative, a campaign aimed at encouraging the corporate sector to recognise the value of developing practical links with community-based organisations.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Takeover rumours lift Hong Kong TOKYO was closed for the Japanese royal wedding. HONG KONG heard market rumours that Cheung Kong and Citic Pacific planned a joint bid for Miramar Hotel, suspended pending an announcement. This boosted technical demand and the Hang Seng index rose 79.34 to 7,339.08 as turnover eased from HKDollars 5.03bn to HKDollars 4.69bn. Cheung Kong gained 10 cents at HKDollars 27.80, while Citic put on 30 cents at HKDollars 18.20. Brokers said there was still some caution ahead of the next round of Sino-UK talks next Monday on Hong Kong political reforms. Meanwhile, Kim Eng Securities said the probable short term effect in China of the Rmb devaluation was that inflation was likely to escalate, leading to a further movement of capital into gold and foreign assets. 'Hong Kong,' said the broker, 'is the likely beneficiary.' SEOUL went to a 31-month peak for the third consecutive day, the composite index ending 9.06 stronger at 777.25. Volume and turnover set a record high of 79.4m shares worth Won1,340bn. BANGKOK advanced 1.8 per cent as investors decided that a no-confidence debate would have no great impact on the government. The SET index finished 15.17 ahead at 845.88 in turnover of Bt5.03bn. All four major sectors - banking, finance and securities, construction materials and property - rose strongly. Bangkok Bank climbed Bt3 to Bt125, Siam Cement Bt14 to Bt438 and housing developer Tanayong Bt3 to Bt62.50. AUSTRALIAN golds retreated as the All Ordinaries index slipped 14.0 to 1,709.1. The golds index dropped 54.1 to 1,725.5, investors fearing further losses on bullion, which had shed more than USDollars 1.50 an ounce in 24 hours, to around USDollars 371.75 by the Sydney close. National turnover was 214.3m shares worth ADollars 411m, with falls outpacing rises by a ratio of two-to-one. NEW ZEALAND fell on very light turnover, with a 3-cent decline to NZDollars 1.11 in Brierley a major contributor as the NZSE-40 index dipped 8.14 to 1,646.99. Supermarket operator Progressive Enterprises rose 6 cents to NZDollars 1.73: rumours of a takeover by Foodland Associated, a Perth-based grocery wholesaler, resurfaced as the latter raised ADollars 51.7m in a share placing with institutions. KUALA LUMPUR saw a big premium on the listing of Buildcon, the ready-mixed concrete group, as the broad market stayed cautious and profit-taking pushed the KLSE composite index down 1.35 to 734.93. However, volume soared from 273.3m shares to 448.2m and winners led losers by 262 to 78. Leading the gainers, Jasa Kita climbed MDollars 3.75 to MDollars 10.60 on rumours of a takeover. Buildcon closed at MDollars 8.80 for a premium of MDollars 4.60 over its offer price. SINGAPORE was led lower by some index stocks as the Straits Times Industrial index receded 6.16 to 1,864.51, but brokers said the underlying tone was still firm, with speculative buying still evident. TAIWAN registered the smallest turnover since January, TDollars 14.5bn against Tuesday's TDollars 17.65bn, as the weighted index ended 7.70 down at 4,269.72. MANILA weakened across the board as selling of blue chips spilled over into mines and oils. The composite index dropped 17.81 to 1,581.84. JAKARTA ended mixed in moderate trade and the JKSE index was up 0.8 at 352.8. BOMBAY saw volatility in market leader Telco put pressure on blue chips and the BSE index lost 25 to 2,351. Telco was sold short ahead of its results, and while it only lost Rs3.75 to Rs192.50 on the day, brokers said later that the results were worse than expected. KARACHI went higher on buying of textile shares ahead of the 1993/94 budget, due for release on Monday. The KSE index gained 11.99 at 1,182.72. Polyester stocks rose sharply on rumours of higher taxes in the budget on imported polyester fibre that would boost demand and the price of locally produced polyester.</p>

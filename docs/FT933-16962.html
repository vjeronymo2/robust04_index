			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Accountancy Column: Elusive harmony / Assessing 20 years of progress towards global standards As the International Accounting Standards Committee celebrates its 20th anniversary this week, it is an appropriate time to consider how much progress has been made towards achieving the objective of promoting international accounting harmonisation. Shortly after its creation in 1973, the IASC predicted in a progress report: 'Provided that the initial enthusiasm and thrust with which the IASC was started is continued, its impact in the years to come will be important. It will take perhaps five to 10 years before its full effects are recognised, but after that they will increase each year. Accounts issued in every important nation of the world will comply with the standards promulgated by the IASC or will disclose the extent to which there has been non-compliance.' In retrospect, this may seem to have been an optimistic prediction. In practice IASC standards have often been flexible. They have also been difficult to enforce given its lack of influence in many countries where professional accounting organisations are permitted only a relatively minor role in standard setting. Any progress in international accounting harmonisation, or lack of it, is of course not just the responsibility of the IASC. Many other agencies are involved, including the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the European Community. But the IASC is perhaps the only organisation to claim prime responsibility for promoting international accounting harmonisation around the world. How much progress has the IASC made? What have been the successes and what are the remaining problems? Some insights into these questions can be gained from the results of our recently completed survey of five countries - France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the USA - covering 26 accounting measurement issues over the period 1971/72 to 1991/92. The aim was to assess progress in the last 20 years. The sample covered 293 large listed companies reporting in both 1971/72 and 1991/92. The breakdown was: 25 from France, 42 from Germany, 54 from Japan, 82 from the UK and 96 from the US. Given the size and significance of these companies and the importance of the countries involved, which are among the largest economies and stock markets around the world, it would seem reasonable to expect that the impact of efforts to harmonise accounting internationally would be clearly discernible. Indeed, this is the kindest sample to choose, since a much tougher test of harmonisation would be to look at all member states of the IASC and to include both large and small companies, listed and unlisted. We examined the annual reports in the sample published during 1971-72 and 1991-92 and highlighted a total of 26 accounting measurement issues. A 'harmony index' was constructed for each measure, to assess the extent of international harmonisation. This index provides a range of values from zero for extreme diversity to one for an absolute uniformity of accounting methods. Its calculation uses a variant of the Herfindahl index, a measure of concentration which has previously been used to study harmonisation. It is derived by multiplying the relative frequency of use of a particular accounting method across the countries and adding the results for all alternative methods. A summary of our findings in the table shows that progress towards harmonisation over the last 20 years has been mixed. Taken overall, it has been quite modest, with an increase in the average harmony index score from a moderate level of 0.6230 to only 0.6903. This is an average increase in international accounting harmonisation of only 10.8 per cent from 1971-72 to 1991-92. There were only 14 issues showing an increase in harmonisation. In 12 cases there was in fact a reduction in harmonisation or a higher level of accounting diversity. There are significant increases in treatment of consolidation, exchange differences, the treatment of gains/losses on long-term investments, and the treatment of research and development expenditures. It is also noteworthy that there is a relatively high level of harmonisation in respect of investments in associates, the treatment of gains/losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment, the treatment of gains and losses on the disposal of current investments, and accounting for extraordinary and exceptional items. Significant decreases include the treatment of goodwill, the costing of inventories, the method of depreciation, the valuation of long-term investments, the treatment of borrowing costs, the basis for providing for deferred taxes and the method of determining the cost of pensions. There is a relatively low level of harmonisation in respect of the costing of inventories, accounting for depreciation, and the basis for providing for deferred taxes. Despite 20 years of effort, clearly there are substantial continuing problems facing those promoting international accounting harmonisation.

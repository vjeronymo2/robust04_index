			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Moves to woo investors in MinFin bonds - Russian bonds Moves to bring greater stability to trade in Russian hard currency bonds could increase western investment in a market overshadowed recently by publicity surrounding the spectacular performance and potential of some local equities. On Tuesday, Banque Indosuez and Morgan Grenfell - along with a number of Russian banks and other traders - formed a new traders' association which will aim to make the market for dollar-denominated 'MinFin' bonds more 'investor-friendly'. In 1993, the ministry of finance issued more than Dollars 7bn of the bonds - the country's largest hard currency issue - to Russians whose dollar bank deposits were frozen during 1991's foreign exchange crisis. Although only Dollars 100m to Dollars 300m of the paper is currently in the hands of overseas investors, they could become popular alternatives to the other two main classes of Russian debt, which are more widely held by European and US investors: Dollars 1.9bn of fixed interest eurobonds, primarily denominated in Deutschemarks, and Dollars 26.5bn in commercial debt paper currently trading at a steep discount in the secondary market. Trading in the five tranches of the MinFin bonds only really began this year, with investors encouraged by the government's redemption of the first tranche of some Dollars 266m in May. With the remaining tranches trading at between 75 per cent of face value for the shortest dated bonds to 30 per cent for the longest dated, potential returns are attractive. Based on a standard 3 per cent coupon, yields to maturity are roughly 15 to 23 per cent. Daily volumes reached Dollars 100m at the end of the summer, rising sharply following the drop in the rouble in October and the accompanying increase in demand for dollar assets. Market expansion, however, has not been without its difficulties and in recent weeks trading volumes have been as low as Dollars 15m a day. 'Events have often pushed investors to the sidelines, creating frustrating illiquidity and exacerbating price shifts,' said Banque Indosuez. Traders say that lack of liquidity has created additional problems for investors because a single large trade can influence the entire market. 'Western institutions and investors are quite wary of market manipulation. Investors are aware of the risks but they worry about the lack of transparency,' says Mr John Gibbens of Morgan Grenfell. In particular, custody and settlement arrangements have left something to be desired. The bonds are one of the few merging market issues for which clearing must be done in the country of issue. Although traders insist that settlement procedures are far better than those in the local equity markets, this year's increase in activity put the system under some strain. The new traders' association, whose founding members also include BCEN-Eurobank of Paris, ICFI-Moscow Partners, Aljba Alliance, New Alliance Corporation, Moscow Narodny and Vneshtorgbank, aims to tackle these problems by establishing clearly defined settlement procedures and market practices. Much of its work will be along similar lines to that of the New York-based Emerging Markets Traders Association, to which it is affiliated. In any event, traders argue that the MinFin bonds are better value than either the eurobonds - which have been trading recently at more than 80 per cent of face value - or the commercial bank debt. While unpaid interest continues to accumulate on the commercial debt, investors in MinFin bonds enjoy the benefit of regular interest payments - so the paper has a lower 'carrying' cost. Ultimately, investors will be influenced by Russia's efforts to reschedule its commercial debt, which would involve a resumption of debt service payments and the probable conversion of overdue interest into a new bond issue. Success would be certain to increase demand for paper currently trading at 31 to 32 per cent of face value on the secondary market, possibly to more than 50 per cent. Despite allegations in some quarters of a lack of political will to achieve an agreement, there has been progress in recent weeks. In a research note published last month, Mr Daniel McGovern, fixed income strategist at Merrill Lynch, said he expected an agreement within three to four months. Mr McGovern, formerly chief economist to Russia's creditor banks' advisory committee, believes Russia's ability to service this agreement is quite strong. 'The nascent growth in the real economy, a solid macro-economic adjustment programme for 1995, and large hard currency earnings underscore Russia's shift towards economic recovery,' he says. However, many dealers are sceptical. Following recent reports of talks, one trader said: 'The market is getting a bit jaundiced.' Another told Reuters: 'I'm cynical . . . We've seen too many false starts.' For them MinFin bonds  -relatively well insulated from Russia's stormy political process - may represent a better bet.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (5): Younger brother's wings clipped - William Dawkins on another setback for Japan Japan's unrealised ambition of creating a world-class aerospace industry has just hit another setback, yet Tokyo's industrial planners are pursuing their target with undimmed enthusiasm. As soon as Japan's chaotic politics return to normal, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry will ask parliamentary approval to suspend what used to be its main attempt at getting civil airliner manufacturing off the ground. Miti's decision to freeze a state-funded joint development project for a 150-seater aircraft, code-named YXX and led by Boeing of the US, is a telling illustration of why Japan has failed to fulfil its ambitions - set down in a 25-year-old Miti policy document - of turning aerospace into a pillar of the economy. The combined turnover of Japan's aircraft industry reached Y893bn (Pounds 5.67bn) in 1991, at the latest count by the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, which is slightly less than the country's motorcycle production. Among the constraints are Japan's dependence on foreign aerospace technology, its competitors' desire to keep Japan as no more than a valued subcontractor in the overcrowded world market for civil airliners, and the minuscule government financial support Japan has devoted to aerospace by comparison with the US and Europe. Boeing precipitated Japan's decision to freeze the YXX by deciding to develop a cheaper alternative, so leaving Japan's three-company consortium, the junior partner, incapable of carrying on independently. The consortium, called the Japan Aircraft Development Corporation (JADC), which includes Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, has neither the technology, nor the marketing clout to go it alone. This is not the first time Japanese aerospace aspirations have been frustrated by reliance on US technology. It recalls the late 1980s battle over the joint development of the FSX fighter - due to come into production for the Japanese air force in 1996 or 1997 - in which both sides haggled over transferring technology which might have been useful for civil aviation. So Miti plans to withdraw its backing, from April, for the eight Japanese engineers on the YXX project and to concentrate instead on a smaller, Japanese-led civil airliner, to be made with foreign partners, hopefully from the US, Asia and Europe. Code-named the YSX, this is planned to be a 70 to 80 seat short-range carrier, to come into service at the end of this decade or early in the next one. A small project like the YSX, suitable for sale to regional airlines in the US and Asia, is Japan's only chance of taking a leading role in a commercial aircraft, industry experts believe. Bigger ideas are beyond its reach. 'The YSX will definitely be realised. It is the essence of our civil aircraft policy from now on,' says a defiant Mr Toshifumi Hirai, director of Miti's aircraft and ordnance division. One possible snag is that the members of the JADC industrial consortium, which has just finished a Miti-funded feasibility study into the YSX, are believed to be less enthusiastic about the next phase than Miti's planners. Miti wants the YSX to have a Japanese engine, but the companies are unsure whether they can justify the heavy investment, given that Japan is estimated by industry experts to be 20 years behind the US in engine technology. Miti, however, has placed the highest priority on getting the YSX off the ground. Japan does not want to overtake the US and Europe in aerospace, Mr Hirai stresses. But it does want to earn a place among, or at least only slightly behind, the leaders. 'We are in a marathon race and our objective is to be able to keep the backs of the first two runners in sight, but not overtake them. Lately, they have been running too fast for us,' says Mr Hirai. Other constraints on the Japanese aerospace industry include the small size of its domestic market, its heavy dependence on imports - where Japan Airlines prides itself on being the largest private sector buyer of US equipment of any kind - and its negligible exports. Four-fifths of Japanese aerospace companies' annual sales go to the military, a higher proportion and hence greater temptation to marketing complacency than is the case with European and US competitors. Moreover, the air force is small and defence exports are legally banned, features of Japan's pacifist constitution. All this has made it impossible for Japanese aerospace companies to build up the costly international marketing and technical maintenance networks that international airline customers require. That is why Japan's only two post-war home grown civil aircraft, the YS-11, a 64-seat twin propeller airliner, and the Asuka, short take-off and landing aircraft were commercial flops. 'Technically, the YS-11 was excellent, but foreign airlines just didn't have the confidence to buy it. The lesson for Miti was: never go it alone,' says Mr Paul Rubin, secretariat of the US Aviation Industry Association in Japan. The YS-11, a Japanese design - with 80 per cent imported parts - started to roll off the production lines in the early 1960s, but only 182 were sold. The Asuka managed a test flight four years ago but had so few potential customers that it never went into production. Yet where Japan did learn the lesson of the YS-11, and seek foreign co-operation, it typically ended up as a junior partner with limited access to technology. It has, for example, a respected record as a supplier to Europe and the US, producing around 20 per cent of the parts for the Boeing 767-300 and 40 per cent of the 747 jumbo airframes. Yet these are generally medium technology parts, such as wing flaps and lavatory modules. 'The US has always wanted the Japanese aerospace industry to be a good younger brother. They don't want us to be an elder brother,' complains Miti's Mr Hirai. But, as the US aviation association's Mr Rubin points out: 'Nobody goes into joint development of any kind and gives away more than they have to.'</p>

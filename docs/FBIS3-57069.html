			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Baltic News Service reports that the Lithuanian  General Procuracy will today institute criminal proceedings  concerning financial machinations in the supply of arms to the  Lithuanian Army. This was announced at a news conference given  by Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas National  Security Committee. According to him, all the reports in the  newspapers RESPUBLIKA and LIETUVOS RYTAS on the purchase of  helicopters and warships are correct.    Petkevicius said that everything will be decided by the  court, but he is convinced that many machinations and the  creation of various closed joint stock companies have harmed  (?the litas). He also stressed that there are people with two  or three previous convictions serving in military units.  According to the law, they should not be given arms.    Speaking about the main tasks facing the Seimas National  Security Committee, Vytautas Petkevicius mentioned the  conclusion of the creation of the army legal base [as heard],  the handing over of border protection duties to the border  police, and the creation of the national security service.  According to him, the national security service has been  neglected but is now in the embryo stage.    Meanwhile, Lithuania has become a hotbed of espionage. Both  the East and West are spying, and Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev and Western experts know more about the Lithuanian Army  than its commanders, Petkevicius claimed. Petkevicius refused  to dwell further on the activity of foreign special services,  saying that he has no right to do this. Speaking about the  arrest of Mykolas Burokevicius and Juozas Jermalavicius, he  stressed that due to rumors by some Lithuanian officials in  describing events on the border [as heard], the Belorusian  minister of internal affairs and the procurator general have  suffered a great deal.</p>

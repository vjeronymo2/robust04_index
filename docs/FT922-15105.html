			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling unruffled by polls A FIRM Labour party lead in the UK opinion polls failed to ruffle sterling yesterday, writes Emma Tucker. After losing more than  1/2 pfennig in early trading on the news that the previous night's polls pointed towards an overall Labour majority in next Thursday's general election, the pound spent the rest of the day hovering around DM2.8512, well above its DM2.7780 floor in the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi Securities in London, said: 'All the talk about a sterling crisis is exaggerated. Gilts and equities have reacted quite badly to the opinion polls but the exchange rate has been as flat as a pancake.' The pound opened at DM2.8512 after Tuesday's close of DM2.8584, dipped to DM2.8510 towards the end of trading and closed at DM2.8515. Mr Nick Stamenkovic, an economist at DKB International in London, said sterling held up because of the commitment of the main parties to the ERM and because the interest rate differential against the D-Mark widened over the day, providing some interest rate protection for sterling. The yen lost ground against the dollar in early trading in London as the markets reacted with dismay to the response of Tokyo stocks to the long-awaited 0.75 per cent cut in the Japanese discount rate. The Nikkei index sank 3.95 per cent to a five-year low. 'Any further weakness in the Japanese stock market is going to spill over into the currency,' said Mr MacKinnon. By mid-morning in London the dollar was standing at Y134.15/20 after a Y133.90 finish in Tokyo and a Y132.70/80 close in New York. The dollar continued to build on its early gains in the afternoon following the release of positive US economic data. The National Association of Purchasing Management survey for March rose to 54.1 per cent from February's 52.4. The US unit ended in London at DM1.6530 from a DM1.6477 close in Tokyo and a DM1.6425/35 New York finish. Against the yen it closed at Y134.30. In New York yesterday the dollar finished at DM1.6513 and Y134.55. Traders said the dollar was the biggest beneficiary from the yen weakness but that yesterday's US data was too mixed to justify further gains. The real test for the dollar comes tomorrow when US employment data is released. As the US currency drifted up, the D-Mark lost ground against it. Underpinned by German interest rates, however, the D-Mark remained firm on most cross rates. The French franc barely moved all day as the wait for news on the government reshuffle went on. The franc is expected to remain stable provided Mr Pierre Beregovoy remains finance minister or is named premier.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Perez trips up over his own reforms: The suspension of Venezuela's president over corruption charges PRESIDENT Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela who was suspended from office yesterday over allegations of corruption - is in part a victim of his own attempts to reform Venezuela. In trying to change the country's traditionally corrupt judicial system, he encouraged the independence of the Supreme Court. It was this body that on Thursday handed down a crucial ruling that there was sufficient cause to try him for corruption. The court ruling paved the way for yesterday's unanimous vote by the Senate for impeachment - meaning that Mr Perez is automatically suspended from his duties as chief executive and must answer criminal charges before the 15 members of the Supreme Court. Previously, a president could count on the highest court to support any government initiative, since most justices were closely linked to the ruling party. But Mr Perez last year appointed five new justices who were political independents. It was also the president who supported more independence for a central bank whose foreign exchange receipts have provided evidence against him in the case. He also openly encouraged political debate and tolerated vociferous opposition and calls for his resignation, eventually culminating in the corruption charges. The irony is that many of the trends Mr Perez tried to reverse in his second term of office - big government, state inefficiency and an arrogant political class - were those that he set in train himself in his first administration during the oil boom in the 1970s. In a TV address after the Supreme Court voted on Thursday on the charges of fraudulently managing Dollars 17m in government funds, the President's voice broke and he seemed ready to burst into tears. 'I would have preferred a different death,' he said. As a result of the Senate vote, a former underling, Senator Octavio Lepage, takes over as acting president until the full Venezuelan congress decides on a legislator to fill the rest of Mr Perez's term. Mr Perez, 70, was elected by a large majority in 1988 and his period in office is due to expire in February 1994. His critics assert that charges sent to the Supreme Court by Attorney General Ramon Escovar Salom on March 11 show that Mr Perez and two former cabinet ministers, Mr Alejandro Izaguirre and Mr Reinaldo Figueredo Planchart, used Dollars 17m allotted for security and defence purposes for other ends. The president and his supporters say that while administrative irregularities did occur in handling the money, there is no evidence of criminal action by Mr Perez or his two former ministers. They consider the charges and subsequent actions as vengeance against Mr Perez by foes collected in more than 50 years of politics. The attorney general's charges centre on documented evidence that money from a secret fund slated for security and defence purposes outside Venezuela were paid to the wrong ministry: the ministry of the presidential secretariat rather than to the ministry of the interior, which had original responsibilities for the funds. Mr Perez has said he will not divulge how the money was spent since it involved confidential actitivities. He is only the latest in a line of presidents who had access to secret government funds and there was previously no accounting of how these funds were used. Another accusation made against Mr Perez - although not in formal charges - was that he and associates used their knowledge that the government would soon eliminate multiple exchange rates to make a large foreign exchange gain in early 1989. The money - 250m Bolivars was converted at 14.5 to the dollar to around Dollars 17m. When a few days later exchange controls were lifted, the Bolivar was devalued to more than 34 to the dollar. Almost since he took office in February 1989, Mr Perez has been unpopular. He instituted highly unpopular economic reforms in keeping with an extended agreement with the International Monetary Fund. His economic reforms, which lifted generalised food subsidies, for example, created hardship for many poor Venezuelans and brought strong opposition early in his government. These political and economic problems exploded in February 1992 when army officers attempted a coup. They said they tried to topple the government to make Venezuelan democracy more responsible, to eliminate corruption and to rid the country of IMF-inspired measures. The political situation worsened during 1992 and another attempted coup was staged in November. Throughout all this, Mr Perez came under attack not only as the father of unpopular economic reform but also a representive of old, corrupt politics. Mr Perez admitted to numerous errors. In the end, the task of overhauling the country turned out to be too much. He could not complete economic or political reform, and was unable to carry through plans to privatise government companies or rebuild Venezuela's crumbling health, education and public safety systems. He became a lightning rod for grievances caused by accumulated mistakes, corruption and abuses of recent decades.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Last credits for Ealing as receivers are called in The latest instalment in the chequered history of Ealing Studios, the home of classic British films such as Passport to Pimlico and the Lavender Hill Mob, came to an end yesterday when BBRK Group, its parent company, went into administrative receivership. BBRK, a group of film lighting and special effects businesses, bought Ealing Studios two years ago in a Pounds 6.1m deal with the BBC. BBRK has since tried to revive the old Ealing tradition by relaunching the studios as a centre for film production. However, yesterday BBRK was forced to call in administrative receivers for all its subsidiaries including Ealing. The studios are now being run by Casson Beckman, the insolvency practitioner, which said the full extent of its liabilities would not be known until early next week. The receivership comes as a blow not only to Ealing itself but to the entire British film industry which has recently made some progress in its attempts to relaunch the UK as a production centre for the Hollywood film studios. Ealing has long been regarded as a totem for the industry's fortunes. The studios were established in Ealing, an inconspicuous suburb of west London, in 1907 and within five years became the biggest film production centre in the UK. Ealing's heyday was in the 1940s when, under Sir Michael Balcon as head of production, it turned out a string of classics - including Kind Hearts and Coronets and Whisky Galore - to entertain the British public during the second world war and post-war years. The Balcon formula of waspish comedies free from violence and bad language seemed anachronistic by the 1950s. The BBC bought the studios in 1957 and Ealing had a new lease of life as the source of classic television drama series such as Colditz and The Singing Detective. Since selling the studios in 1992, the BBC has continued to use Ealing for drama production, while BBRK has tried to drum up film contracts. Casson Beckman said it intended to continue with the productions now being shot at Ealing, including a BBC drama series and a new film version of Jane Eyre, directed by Franco Zefferelli and starring William Hurt.</p>

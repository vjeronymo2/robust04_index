			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> CATALINA TRIP TWICE AS NICE FOR OAKWOOD  </P> <P> It is unusual for a team to play the same league opponent 2 days in a row. And  it's even more rare for a team to play both games on the other team's home  court -- and win both. But that's exactly what Oakwood did Friday and Saturday.  </P> <P> Playing at Avalon High on Santa Catalina Island, Oakwood defeated the Lancers,  59-52, Saturday in a Liberty League game. The victory followed a 71-53 win  Friday.  </P> <P> Mitchell Butler led the Gorillas to both victories, scoring 24 points and  grabbing 14 rebounds Saturday to go along with 37 points, 11 rebounds, 6  assists and 10 steals Friday.  </P> <P> L.A. Baptist 31, Miraleste 28 -- Brett Craig, the Knights' leading scorer, was  held to 5 points, but teammate Dave Garcia picked up the slack with 16 points  in the nonleague game at L. A. Baptist.  </P> <P> Garcia made 6 of 8 field-goal attempts as L. A. Baptist shot 60% (12 of 20)  from the floor.  </P> <P> Crossroads 56, Campbell Hall 54 (2 OTs) -- Ty Leatherman hit a 3-point shot for  Campbell Hall to send the game into double overtime. Richard Strayer scored 16  points for Campbell Hall and teammate Phil Bruno added 15 points and 10  rebounds.  </P> <P> GIRLS  </P> <P> Oakwood 43, Avalon 32 -- Capucine Rubin scored a game-high 20 points and pulled  down 16 rebounds for Oakwood in the Liberty League game at Avalon as the  Gorillas posted their eighth consecutive win.  </P> <P> The Gorillas (11-2, 5-0) defeated Avalon, 43-30, on Friday.  </P> <P> L.A. Baptist 56, Miraleste 21 -- Jill Shackelford scored 14 points and Kristin  Heerema added 13 for the Knights in the nonleague game at L. A. Baptist.  </P></p>

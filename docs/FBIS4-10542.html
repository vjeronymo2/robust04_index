			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Foreign Ministry sources informed CLARIN on 12  April that, pursuant to an agreement reached on 12 April in  Tunisia between Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella and Palestinian  leader Yasir 'Arafat, the Palestinian Liberation Organization  (PLO) will open "an affairs bureau" in Buenos Aires within a few  months.    According to the talks held on 12 April between Di Tella and  'Arafat, when the PLO achieves statehood, thanks to the historic  peace agreements between the Israelis and Palestinians, the  bureau may become an embassy, with the appropriate powers.    The establishment of an "affairs bureau," a diplomatic  status  below that of an embassy, has been an old goal of the Arab  community in Argentina. After President Carlos Menem -- of  Syrian ancestry -- was inaugurated in 1989, the Arab community  in Argentina again favored this measure. [passage omitted]</p>

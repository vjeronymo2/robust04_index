			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES;  </P> <P> SCC BREEZES PAST CHRIST COLLEGE FOR THIRD TIME  </P> <P> Southern California College won its 13th consecutive game Saturday with a  126-74 victory over Christ College Irvine in a Golden State Athletic Conference  game at SCC.  </P> <P> Playing without leading scorer center Jeff Bickmore, who was sick with the flu,  SCC relied mostly on the outside shooting of guards Kyle Lundy and Todd Dixon.  </P> <P> "It was kind of fun seeing five guards running down the court and dishing off  to everyone," SCC Coach Bill Reynolds said. "They're so unselfish, it's fun to  watch."  </P> <P> Dixon scored 24 points, and had four assists and six steals. Lundy scored 26  points and had seven assists. Guard Jim Mansfield added 16 points and 8  assists.  </P> <P> "I really thought we stayed pretty focused in the second half," Reynolds said.  "This is a team we can always put away because of their inexperience, but I was  proud of the way they kept up the intensity."  </P> <P> SCC (22-2 overall, 10-0 in league play) defeated Christ College on Jan. 6,  132-67, and on Jan. 20, 120-75. Christ College Irvine (4-22, 0-10), hasn't won  a conference game in two seasons.  </P> <P> "It was hard for us to get up for this game since we knew we were going to beat  them," SCC's Terrance Jackson said. Jackson came off the bench in the second  half to score 11 consecutive points. He finished with 16.  </P></p>

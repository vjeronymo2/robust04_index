In a statement issued today, a ministry source said that  there is absolutely no truth to reports that the  computer-operated centers for receiving reports on faulty  telephone lines, which the National Communications Authority has  established, are being used to obtain information on the  subscriber's line when reporting a fault. The source stressed  that the line is tested in order to ascertain the type and  location of the fault and to automatically record it so that the  repair teams can correct the fault and restore the line to  operations.    The source added that Egyptian engineers and technicians are  in charge of these centers, that no person other than those  working there are allowed in, and that there are no foreign  experts working in these centers.    The statement went on to say that the fault-reporting  centers  are completely secure and no telephone line can be tapped while  engaged. It added that there are no contacts or links between  these centers and any foreign entity and this confirms that the  Egyptian network cannot be technically penetrated.    The statement noted that the role of the company carrying  out  the work is limited to the installation of the equipment, and  this is done under the supervision of the authority's engineers.  The company's role ends once the equipment is received here and  before being put into service.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Personal care marriage sharpens competition - Wilkinson Sword's move into Warner-Lambert's arms WILL this be fifth time lucky for Wilkinson Sword? After four previous changes of ownership in 13 years, during which it was shorn of important assets and contracted a serious debt problem, one of the grand old names in the personal care business is about to start a new life in the arms of an American suitor. Last week's Dollars 142m sale of the company to Warner-Lambert, the US pharmaceuticals and consumer products manufacturer, offers Wilkinson the prospect of financial stability and industrial support which it has badly lacked in the latter chapters of its 200-year history. The deal also ends a bizarre anomaly whereby Gillette of the US, Wilkinson's biggest competitor in the Dollars 3.5bn world wet shaving market, was a large shareholder in and creditor of Eemland, Wilkinson's parent company. The arrangement has drawn fire from anti-trust authorities around the world. The combination of Wilkinson with Schick, Warner-Lambert's razor division, will create a business with annual sales of more than Dollars 500m. Though only a fraction of Gillette's Dollars 1.9bn annual razor and blade business, it should provide keener competition, particularly at the upper end of the shaving systems market. Schick, which had sales of Dollars 316m last year, is a distant second to Gillette in the US, although it has five times the sales of its bigger rival in Japan, where it is market leader. Elsewhere, Schick's sales are mainly in France and Sweden, where it has market shares of 15 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. In an effort to strengthen Schick's presence outside the US, Warner-Lambert last year reorganised its international operations into a worldwide group. The main aim was to provide a more coherent thrust for a business which had long been fragmented along national lines. In Europe, Schick's priority region for expansion, the Wilkinson acquisition brings a business with sales last year of Dollars 190m, plants in Britain and Germany, a development centre and an innovative product, the Protector system razor launched a year ago. Wilkinson also has a small ceremonial sword factory in west Lon-don. But Wilkinson's most valuable asset is its sales and distribution channels, particularly in the UK and Germany, where it does more than half its business. These will widen Schick's access to the big supermarket chains which account for a growing share of razor and blade sales. Mr Morgan Morton, president of Schick Worldwide, says he plans to continue to sell both Wilkinson's Protector and Schick's FX razor system in Europe and to launch both products in new markets. He also expects to expand European sales of Warner-Lambert products, such as Listerine mouthwash, and over-the-counter markets. 'We now have the opportunity to achieve a pan-European presence,' Mr Morton says. However, he insists Schick is not seeking a showdown with Gillette, preferring to pursue a selective niche strategy: 'I don't think we are looking significantly to change Gillette's market share in Europe.' He expects Wilkinson, which made a small profit last year, to be able to finance its own growth. The company recently expanded by 50 per cent production of the Protector, which has proven more popular than expected, particularly in Germany. In any event, new ownership will free Wilkinson of the crippling financial problems and internal disagreements which forced Eemland to put it up for sale last year, less than five years after buying it from Stora, the Swedish forest products group for SKr4bn (Dollars 518m). Stora acquired Wilkinson as a result of taking over Swedish Match, which had bought the business from Allegheny International, a US industrial conglomerate which had owned Wilkinson since 1980. Eemland is owned by assorted investors, including a group of Scandinavian financial institutions and J. P. Morgan, the US bank, as well as Gillette. The consortium was formed specifically to buy Wilkinson in one of the most highly leveraged buy-outs of the late 1980s. Even after selling Wilkinson's matches and lighters business to pay off some of its borrowings, Eemland remained saddled with about Dollars 300m of debt, which it was increasingly hard-pressed to service out of Wilkinson's slim profits. More than one-third of the debt was owed to Gillette in the form of a roll-up loan carrying an exceptionally high interest rate. Eemland's fragile finances were strained to breaking point by the investment in Protector, which was developed without the knowledge of the Eemland board because Wilkinson was worried that Gillette would learn about the project. A further source of difficulty was the growing anti-trust pressure on Gillette to sever its involvement in Eemland. Warner-Lambert has bought Wilkinson free of debt, at a price which leaves Eemland's shareholders with a loss of about Dollars 200m on their investment. Most of it is expected to be borne by Scandinavian institutions, notably Copenhagen Handelsbank and the SPP and Skandia insurance companies, which have paid dearly for their short-lived adventure at the razor's edge.</p>

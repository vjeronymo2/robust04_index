			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sokhbet Mamedov of IZVESTIYA: "Azerbaijan </F> Opposed to Creation of Russian Military Bases on Its Territory"]    [Text] Baku -- The statements by certain Russian generals  that they "are planning to site a military base in Azerbaijan"  and Moscow's obvious desire to send its peacemaking forces into  the Karabakh conflict zone have evoked an extremely negative  reaction in the republic.    Many Azerbaijanis say that "the republic's authorities are  unable to withstand the tough pressure from the Russian generals  and have been forced to agree in principle to the fulfillment of  their demands."    Azerbaijan today is the only CIS republic with no Russian  troops on its territory, aside from the small number of  specialists serving the Gabalinskaya radar station.    The last Russian Army units peacefully and freely left  Azerbaijan in early 1993. This event, which took place during  the presidency of Abulfaz Elchibey, is regarded by his People's  Front comrades in arms as one of their main achievements. How  did they succeed in reaching agreement with Moscow? This is  still a mystery to many people. At the same time most observers  note some inconsistency on the part of the Russian leadership.  Having completed the hasty redeployment of its troops from  Azerbaijan to the North Caucasus a year ago, today Moscow is  seeking opportunities to bring them back.    "Officially Russia has made no such proposal to us," Gasan  Gasanov, head of the republic's foreign policy department, told  IZVESTIYA. President Heydar Aliyev was also categorical about  this: "So long as I am head of Azerbaijan, there will be no  foreign bases on the republic's territory."    The situation with regard to peacemaking forces is rather  different. Russia, so an informed source from the republic's  Foreign Ministry told IZVESTIYA, is pressing for exclusively its  own military subunits to take part in the process of settling  the conflict in the mountain part of Karabakh under the auspices  of international organizations. But Azerbaijan, displaying  natural caution, is proposing that a mixed contingent of CSCE or  UN peacemaking forces be stationed along the entire  Armenian-Azerbaijani border. While politicians are seeking  mutually acceptable solutions, opposition forces in the republic  have intimated that they will not tolerate the return of Russian  soldiers to Azerbaijan in any form. "The very fact that this  issue has been raised is fraught with great danger to the  republic's sovereignty and independence," the People's Front has  stated. The "Musavat" party, headed by Isa Gambar, former  speaker in the republic's parliament, holds a similar view.  "Moreover," Etibar Mamedov, leader of the National Independence  Party, the most influential opposition party, stressed in  conversation with your IZVESTIYA correspondent, "I would not  envy the republic leader who ventured to take the responsibility  of turning Azerbaijan into a military test range for any foreign  state. He would be bound to be held in general contempt."</p>

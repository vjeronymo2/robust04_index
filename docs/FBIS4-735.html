			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Prospects of violence are so great in South Africa  that it is making hundreds of white people in South Africa flee  across the border into the neighboring states of Zimbabwe,  Namibia, Swaziland, and Botswana. However, as Derek James now  reports from Gaborone, the locals of Botswana have also been  making their own panic moves.    [Begin James recording] Botswana is attractive to South  Africans because of its closeness, stability, and peace.  Already stories abound and are confirmed by top Bank of  Botswana officials of large amounts of South African rands being  handed over to banks here. Monday's (?free) fall of the South  African currency is not only a message of a collapse in overseas  confidence, but also a strong signal to those who have money to  get it out of South Africa. One such person handed over 300,000  in South African rands, that is 50,000 pounds, into a Botswana  bank account last week. Most South Africans are still not rich  enough to afford top Botswana hotels and are staying with  friends, but in Zimbabwe and Namibia the caravan parks are  already filling up. Some South Africans will simply be making  temporary use of neighboring countries.    Botswana itself is stocking up in preparation for a dramatic  drop in supplies of food. Over 80 percent of our food comes  from South Africa and traders have been warned that strikes,  hijacking of vehicles, and the celebrations will mean limited  supplies for at least four successive weeks. A senior Bank of  Botswana official assured (?journalists) last week that  Botswana's currency will be protected, but a dramatic 6.8  percent drop in the South African rand since January is bound to  affect the Botswana pula, which is partly linked to the rand.  People in Botswana are filling their cupboards with tinned  food, as they hear of South Africans' advice to stock up with  food and water, gas cookers, candles, and matches, as the great  days of election and freedom approach.    The shortages of food will hit the neighboring countries  first, although the influx of money will be a temporary  blessing, as Botswana is merely being used a conduit for the  outflow of cash.

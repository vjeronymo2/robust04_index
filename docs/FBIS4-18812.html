			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 9 (A.A) -- The Russian Federation  agreed on transmitting the Kazakh and Azeri oil through Turkey  by pipelines instead of the straits.    Deputy Premier Murat Karayalcin told a press conference  today  that the Russian Federation which had so far opposed changing  its route, had, for the first time accepted not to use the  straits.    During talks between 4 and 7 April in Moscow, the first  deputy premier [title as received] Shokhin told Turkish  officials that he favored the Turkish proposal.    Turkish, Russian, U.S., Kazakh and Azeri officials will  convene in Ankara at the end of this month or in May to discuss  the details of this new plan, Karayalcin added.    Giving account on the Russian-Turkish joint economic  protocol  signed in Moscow, Karayalcin said that this protocol was to be a  milestone in relations.    Russia assured Turkey in the talks that it will not  interrupt  its 6 billion cubic meters of annual natural gas supply to  Turkey from now on and agreed on increasing this amount 2  billion cubic meters more for each year.    Karayalcin said that the frequent accidents taking place  recently in the Bosporus strait have justified the Turkish  thesis that the strait was not convenient for such an intensive  traffic.    Turkey had to close the Bosporus strait shut for a few days  in March after 20 people died when a Greek Cypriot tanker  carrying Russian crude oil collided a Greek Cypriot cargo  vessel. Sixteen seamen were also lost on the 30 km (19 mile)  Bosporus which dissects the 10-million-population Istanbul. The  accident was the worst in the Bosporus since a 1979 collision  when an oil tanker exploded, killing 43 seamen.    Turkey, worried about environmental risks, unveiled new  safety rules for the straits in January and will enforce them on  July 1.</p>

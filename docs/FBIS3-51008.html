The fights broke off after it was decided not to allow the  participation of 13 senators elected in the 18 January 1992  elections, whose election has been challenged by the parties  supporting Aristide.    Senator Eudrice Raymond of the National Front for Change and  Democracy (FNDC), which brought Aristide to power, attempted to  leave the building so as to prevent the quorum from being  formed, but the challenged senators closed the doors.    It was then when challenged pro-Duvalier Senator Gabriel  Ancion hit Raymond and later attacked centrist Senator Judnel  Jean.    Assembly President Firmin Jean Louis was also hit in the  face  by Deputy Pierre-Francois Vital, while Jean Louis' bodyguard was  apprehended by armed civilians and police.    In light of the chaos and panic prevailing at the assembly,  most of the legislators decided to abandon the building. It is  not yet known when the legislative process will be resumed,  given the new situation.</p>

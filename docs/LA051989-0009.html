			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARCOS SUFFERS KIDNEY FAILURE; 'VERY CRITICAL'  </P> <P> Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos was in "very critical"  condition Thursday, suffering from kidney, cardiac and pulmonary failure,  hospital officials said.  </P> <P> Marcos, 71, suffered acute renal failure and was taken to St. Francis Medical  Center's operating room late Thursday morning for vascular access surgery,  according to Gene Tiwanak, the hospital's assistant administrator.  </P> <P> Marcos also suffered cardiac and pulmonary failure, Tiwanak said.  </P> <P> "The prognosis is very poor, and his condition is very critical," Tiwanak said.  </P> <P> Marcos, who was undergoing kidney dialysis, suffered severe infection,  including pneumonia, according to Dr. Azucena Ignacio, his personal physician  and an internist at St. Francis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Receiving Medication  </P> <P> Ignacio said Marcos was being treated with antibiotics and a heart medication,  which she refused to name.  </P> <P> "Some medications are working, some are not," Ignacio said.  </P> <P> The Marcos family was informed of his worsening condition and that he was  conscious before surgery and had been conscious on and off since, she said.  </P> <P> In the 2 3/4-hour surgical procedure, his veins were prepared for hemodialysis,  or the removal of body wastes from his blood by machine, Tiwanak said.  </P> <P> "The problem is that his kidneys failed and we had to get him on dialysis  quick," Tiwanak said.  </P> <P> The deposed president, who is also suffering from pneumonia, was placed on  dialysis in the hospital's intensive care unit, Tiwanak said.  </P> <P> The procedure is not life-threatening, but the hours following the surgery were  expected to be crucial, considering Marcos' frail health, the hospital  administrator said.  </P> <P> Earlier, Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad had said Marcos had only a 2% chance  of surviving the operation, but Tiwanak refused to comment on Marcos'  prospects.  </P> <P> Marcos' wife, Imelda, was praying in the hospital chapel with son Ferdinand  Jr., Trinidad said.  </P></p>

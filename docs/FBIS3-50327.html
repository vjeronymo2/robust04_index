			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, Jan 26 (CTK) -- [passage omitted]  The daily REPUBLIKA, published by the state-run Slovak News  Agency TA SR, describes the policies of Budapest towards ethnic  minorities and complaints by Hungarian ethnic minority  representatives in Slovakia concerning their position as  hypocritical.    The daily notes that according to official data, of  Hungary's  population of 10 million in 1991, 92 percent were Hungarians,  three percent Romanies, and one percent each Germans, Slovaks,  Jews, south Slavs, and others. However, according to the same  official data, 98 percent of the Hungarian population speak  Hungarian while only two percent speak other languages. The  daily also points to the contradiction between Hungary's Law on  Ethnic Minorities, under which they have the right to be  represented in Parliament, and the election law in which such a  right is not embedded.    "This testifies to the fact that through the Law on Ethnic  Minorities Hungary just wants to deceive the world, while the  practice is quite different. A similar situation is also with  ethnic minorities and the number of its members. On one hand  Budapest allegedly recognized the existence of minorities but on  the other it actually rejects their existence, because almost  every Hungarian citizen speaks Hungarian. And weighing all pros  and cons, citizens are right in the long run because the  assimilation of non- Hungarians in Hungary is tough and  pitiless. To round up all the facts we will receive a gross  bundle of hypocrisy in front of the whole world, Europe, and  especially of neighbors," the daily writes.    We can say without exaggeration that in Slovakia the  Hungarian minority enjoys super-rights. In spite of this many  of them maintain that they are being deprived of their basic  rights. It is possible to live with hypocrisy and to deceive  many for some time. But if hypocrisy acquires a double dimension  -- that Slovaks and other minorities enjoy all rights in Hungary  and the Hungarian minority in Slovakia is deprived of all rights  -- it is necessary to speak about pathological abnormality, a  disease which should be dealt with in order for it not to  paralyze the whole European region as it has already done, for  example, in the Balkans, REPUBLIKA concludes.

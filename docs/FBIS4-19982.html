			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eric Leser and Carole Monnot: " French-Type </F> Pseudo-Capitalism"]    [Text] The new wave of privatization  confirms the locking in of the leading groups. Neither "Rhenish"  nor "Anglo-Saxon," the "financial heart" is controlled by a  caste drawn from the civil service.    Edouard Balladur had solemnly promised that his government,  at the head of public companies and future privatized ones,  would not lead a witches' hunt. This time, the composition of  the well-known "hard core" of the groups placed on the market  would be beyond question. In short, the new wave of  privatization would be unassailable.    Six months after the transfer of the BNP [National Bank of  Paris] to the private sector, the first grand style operation,  we must accept that reality does not actually match with what  was said. To be sure, all the bosses of the public groups were  not dismissed immediately after the majority changed. To be  sure, community rules make it theoretically mandatory to leave  the door opened to investors of European Union countries. But  the game does seem to be played in private among people  belonging to the same world, between former denationalized  companies and future privatized ones. The game was played in  four rounds.    1982-1983: In addition to the leading institutions--BNP,  Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale--and the insurance companies  that had already been nationalized since 1945, the Left in power  nationalized some hundred banks, including the two investment  banks (Paribas and Suez). The leading French industrial groups  (the former CGE [General Electricity Company], which since then  has become Alcatel-Alsthom, Saint Gobain, Bull, Thomson,  Pechiney, Rhone Poulenc, Matra, Usinor and Sacilor) passed under  state control.    Four years later, having assumed power, the Right privatized  a first wave of companies, Suez, Saint Gobain, Matra, Havas, the  Societe Generale, and Alcatel-Alsthom--according to the "hard  core" technique. A subtle balance fell into place among groups  regarded as playing a pivotal role--such as Alcatel, Societe  Generale and Havas. But in the autumn of 1987, the stock market  crash brought the privatization program to a halt. Once again  in power, the Socialists, for budgetary reasons, authorized  cross-shareholding investments. Unable to appeal to the  financial market and state capital endowments being rare, the  public groups, looking for a capital base, increased mutual  equity investments, which offered the double advantage of not  involving state control once again and of bringing in fresh  money.    In the spring of 1993, the UDF [Union for French  Democracy]-RPR [Rally for the Republic] coalition was back in  business with an extremely ambitious privatization program. For  convenience--why start all over again when drafts have already  been formulated over a period of some 10 years?--or for  political will, not only did the woven common interests remained  intact, they resurfaced stronger.    The government was able to rely on an untouched base: The  privatized companies of 1986-1987 that had held on to their  teams and shareholders. The only attempt undertaken by the  Socialists to break up the hard core--the assault decreed in  1989 by Pierre Beregovoy against the Societe Generale--ended up  in defeat and brought out new common interests.    STABILITY - As a rule, the stability of the leadership in  the  privatized groups is much higher than that of public leadership,  and even private, companies. It is so true that we can wonder if  there is not legislation unique to the privatized companies,  legislation which derives from the logic of neither public nor  private logic, but from the method used, that of the hard core,  the only calling of which would be to isolate French capitalism.    Behind the popular success of the spectacular privatization  of the BNP, Rhone-Poulenc and Elf Aquitaine, the prime minister  shapes the ties, balance of power, and alliances among the  largest of the French groups.    The choice of standard chairmen and shareholders always  obeys  a very specific logic, namely, the gradual implementation of a  all powerful "financial elite," lead by a limited circle of  former top civil servants with an homogeneous social and  political profile. First observation: For the most part, groups  being privatization find their shareholders among the privatized  companies and those capable of being privatized.  Cross-shareholding investments between leading recently  privatized groups, and those invited to do so, make it possible  to manage the scarcity of capital, but they are aimed primarily  at protecting the groups from the possible hunger of foreign  capitalism.    In fact, the Generale des eaux, the Lyonnaise des eaux and  the AXA insurance company, which are the only exceptions, are  allowed to share the economic power, but not in the best  positions, these being reserved for the denationalized companies  of 1986-1987 (Saint Gobain, the Societe Generale, Parisbas, and  Suez) and 1993-1994 (BNP, UAP [Paris Insurance Union], and  Elf-Aquitaine). The privatization of the UAP, planned for the  very near future--and of the anticipated privatization of AGF  [General Insurance of France] --gives its final coherence to the  patiently implemented system. A new French-style capitalism is  taking shape. But is it really new? Interwoven with the state  since World War II, its nature has not really changed. There is  no English-style market capitalism, no German-style  bank-industry and no Italian-style network of powerful families.  It is a "financial core" capitalism, actually rather close to  the Japanese system. Have the "50 buddies" replaced the 200  families, as claimed by the opposition?    The creation of groups of stable shareholders is more  attuned  to a give-and-take logic than to real economic motivations. A  given industrialist will accept participation in the capital of  his principal banker or insurer who is also one of his  shareholders. Who is the BNP's main shareholder? The UAP. Who is  the UAP's main shareholder? The BNP.    Similar combinations link the Societe Generale to  Alcatel-Alsthom, the Societe Generale to Rhone-Poulenc, Saint  Gobain to Suez, Saint Gobain to the BNP, the UAP to Elf  Aquitaine, and in time, they will link the UAP to Elf-Aquitaine,  and Paribas to the AGF's. No true "godfathers" stand out against  these mutual obligators. It would more likely involve a group of  baronies forced to compromise with each other. For Jacques  Friedmann, "companies gravitate toward each other, sharing  common interests in addition to their capitalistic ties." If the  division of these groups is hazy, their interests do not  necessarily meet.    INFLUENCE - Despite the stronger powers given to the  Privatization Committee in 1993, influence continues to be a  factor in French privatization. Some people claim that they are  being totally controlled. The state nominates the chairmen,  imposes its choice in the matter of stable shareholders and, in  fact, decides who the members of the board of directors are to  be. Elie Cohen, a CNRS [National Center for Scientific Research]  researcher, is critical of this: "France is the only country in  the world where the state nominates in advance the shareholders  who will hold the real economic power. It is the reverse channel  of capitalism, the public authorities, and the leaders whom they  have appointed, choose influential shareholders who place the  market before the accomplished fact." Even the Italian  privatization process--which ignores the hard-core system--is  far more liberal!    The French system is all the more locked in as the leaders  are drawn from the same pool, namely, the higher public  offices--the Inspectorate of Finance and the leading government  agencies; between 1986 and 1988, these individuals also often  worked in ministerial cabinets--the whole system bound by a  common political thought. The profile of these members is  thoroughly homogeneous. In no way does it resemble that of the  entrepreneurs and captains of industry.    Elie Cohen states: "No difference is made between appointing  bosses to head the public companies and choosing men to lead  privatization. But in the first case, what a government does,  another can undo. In the second, it involves incorporating a  biased connection into the bedrock of capitalism." The  government is developing from privatization a closed circuit  control of the leading French groups. Corroborating this  statement are, among other examples, the efforts used to secure  the appointment of Jacques Friedmann, a very close adviser of  Edouard Balladur and Jacques Chirac, as head of the UAP, which  implied transferring the bosses of the Credit lyonnais and the  Credit national. Another corroboration is the showdown between  the prime minister's office and the Economics Ministry to find  Michel Albert's successor. Edmond Alphandery had to throw his  resignation into the ring to snatch a win for the appointment of  his protege, Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, who is more friendly  toward the UDF than the RPR. A true "cultural exception!"    Boards of directors thus become "a true admiration society."  As shown in the case of the Societe Generale, any threat against  one of the leading beacons of the new capitalism would be  perceived as a danger by the others. It remains that the  rigidity of the system is also its weakness. How will it deal  with quarrels of succession without cracking?    Even more serious is the absence of a real counterpower and  control outside the "club." Jacques Friedmann can assert all he  wants that cross-shareholding investments do not lessen the  scope of mutual controls ("We have the interests of our  companies to defend and accounts to give to our boards of  directors and to our shareholders as a whole."), there continues  to be a doubt about the leaders' ability to escape the hold of  the clan. The public authorities plead in their own defense a  limited "address book." A few weeks ago, Gerard Longuet was  acknowledging: "The number of French participants is relatively  small. They are known. We have Paribas, Suez, the AXA, UAP, GAN  [National Insurances Group] and AGF for the financiers; a few  private groups, such as those of Marc Fournier (the Mixed  Shipping Company), and mutually crisscrossing industries in the  image of Elf and Renault, in addition to people who get along  together like Philippe Jaffre, Michel Pebereau, and Louis  Schweitzer. France is a small country."    TO TAME -- But how can we imagine that BNP boss Michel  Pebereau, as UAP's main shareholder, would question Jacques  Friedmann, who seats on his board of directors, he too as a main  shareholder? Boldness is not the first quality of high officials  who are now business leaders and who built their brilliant  career primarily by trying not to make mistakes. We can wonder  about their ability to tackle business and to take industrial  risks.    For them, the transfer to the private sector corresponds to  the need of taming the market. Therefore, it involves primarily  showing an acceptable profitability and choosing management over  offensive strategies. In fact, a falling stock price is the  single factor of destabilization. Theoretically, the creation at  a future date of a French-style pension fund could some day give  small stockholders real power, but it has been postponed until  fall.    Finally, in-breeding carries with it another risk should one  of these groups, which are the system's key factors, run into  difficulty. It is easy to imagine that the state could not  remain indifferent, the Treasury standing as the ultimate  guarantee of a rigid and closed system. Does it really involve  giving the private sector a chance?</p>

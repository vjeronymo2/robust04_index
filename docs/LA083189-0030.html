			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST BILL CLEARS 1ST COMMITTEE;  </P> <P> CRITICS SAY MEASURE WOULD WEAKEN STRICT REGULATIONS FOR OFFICEHOLDERS  </P> <P> A bill carried by state Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) has cleared  its first legislative hurdle despite complaints from critics that it would  undermine state conflict-of-interest regulations for public officials.  </P> <P> Under state Fair Political Practices Commission regulations, local officials  must automatically disqualify themselves from voting on any development within  300 feet of real estate that they own, including their homes, because of the  potential for a conflict of interest.  </P> <P> The legislation, sought by the city of Signal Hill, would exempt a public  official's principal residence from conflict-of-interest requirements.  </P> <P> The Senate Governmental Organization Committee approved the measure on an 8-0  vote and sent it to the Appropriations Committee.  </P> <P> Officials of the Fair Political Practices Commission opposed the legislation as  too broadly drawn and said it could lead to other changes in the  conflict-of-interest statutes. Lilly Spitz, a commission lawyer, described the  potential impact of the bill as "like setting a toe into some quicksand."  </P> <P> It is unclear whether Beverly will have the time to maneuver the measure  through the legislative process before adjournment. Because the bill would  amend the state Political Reform Act and Beverly wants it to take effect  immediately, all action will require a two-thirds majority.  </P> <P> Beverly, whose district covers Signal Hill, said he is pushing the proposal  partly to spur the commission to reach a compromise with the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Add 1,300 Units to City  </P> <P> He said three of Signal Hill's five council members and two of its planning  commissioners live near two proposed developments, which would add 1,300  residential units to the city.  </P> <P> The officials are prohibited from voting on any item affecting the developments  because of regulations issued last year by the political watchdog agency,  Beverly said. "Merely by virtue of your residence . . . you should not be  guilty of a conflict of interest," Beverly told the committee. Because the  two-square-mile hillside city lies in the middle of an oil field, much of its  land is undeveloped. The housing developments would take up the bulk of the  remaining vacant land in the city of 8,400.  </P> <P> John Larson, Fair Political Practices Commission chairman, told the committee  that the commission has spelled out procedures for cities to handle such  extreme cases.  </P> <P> He said the Signal Hill City Council may conduct a random drawing among the  trio of council members who were disqualified. Along with the remaining two  members, the person whose name is drawn would make up a quorum of the council  to review the development projects, according to an analysis of the bill by the  Governmental Organization Committee.  </P> <P> According to the committee analysis of the bill, Signal Hill officials say  other communities are also penalized by the regulations "because it is  difficult for a locally elected official to avoid conflicts no matter where he  resides in the city."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Had to Disqualify Selves  </P> <P> Last year, the commission determined that three planning commissioners and two  council members in Monterey Park had to disqualify themselves from major zoning  changes because their homes fell within areas under review or in close  proximity to them.  </P> <P> Larson said he was in sympathy with Signal Hill's dilemma, but he maintained  that the dispute could be resolved through changes in his commission's  regulations or through a narrowly tailored bill to lift conflict-of-interest  restrictions for officials in small cities like Signal Hill.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 3 (AFP) -- A transformer fire Thursday  morning at the Czech nuclear power plant in Dukovany, in the  eastern Moravian region, caused no casualties nor radiation  leaks, the CTK news agency reported.    The fire, which broke out shortly after 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) at  the plant's third reactor, was extinguished two hours later, the  agency said.    Power was maintained at minimal level throughout the  incident, after initially dropping to 30 percent below minimum  when the fire broke out, it added.    The state of the third reactor had "stabilized" after the  incident, which was classed as level 0 on the INES international  scale, according to an expert from the state nuclear security  office quoted by CTK.    The plant, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of the  Austrian border in Moravia, has four 440 megawatt  ex-Soviet-built VVER [water-moderated water-cooled power  reactor] reactors.    The incident came a day after Czech Prime Minister Vaclav  Klaus confirmed his country's decision to press ahead with  building a nuclear power plant at Temelin in southern Bohemia --  a project which has been heavily criticized by Austria, which  fears radioactive fallout from possible accidents.    The Temelin plant, to be completed in two or three years at  a  site only 40 kilometres from the Austrian border, will have two  1,000 megawatt ex-Soviet-type VVER reactors.    Austria, which has banned nuclear facilities on its  territory, has asked Prague to build a gas-based plant instead.    Klaus said his government's decision was "final" and that  Austria "should recognize the sovereignty of the Czech Republic."    Responding to Klaus's remarks later Wednesday, Austrian  Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said Vienna would continue its  efforts to block construction of the plant.    A nuclear accident "would not only be a risk for the  sovereign Czech Republic, but also for the neighbouring  populations," Vranitzky said, adding that the April 1986  accident at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant "was not limited  to sovereign contamination."    Austrian efforts to block the project were undermined last  Thursday when the American EXIM-Bank decided to guarantee a loan  needed to complete the Temelin project. Citi-Bank was authorized  to grant a 317 million dollar loan to the plant's builder,  Westinghouse.</p>

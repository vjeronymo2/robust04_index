			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Finance Ministry has urged merchants to charge  the value-added tax [IVA] and asked consumers not to refuse to  pay it, noting that noncompliance with this mandate will be  punished according to the law.    Finance Ministry Legal Adviser Rafael Silva said only the  Supreme Court of Justice can abolish the IVA law, and therefore  it cannot be suspended by a judge, because this would be  unconstitutional. He added that the legal basis for the writ of  amparo is not clear, because it does not specify what right was  violated and places the state in a defenseless legal position  [indefension judicial]. Furthermore, the writ of amparo demands  from the government additional information on the implementation  of the IVA -- a measure that is not required when a law is  implemented. He stressed that this tax cannot be suspended.    [Begin Silva recording] The Finance Ministry has no legal  authority and no legal instrument enabling it to suspend the  implementation of a law. We cannot do that. In any event, what  the Finance Ministry could probably do after being legally  notified of the decision is to instruct customs not to charge  the IVA, or not collect the IVA, which is the only tributary  obligation this would entail for the Finance Ministry. [end  recording]    The Finance Ministry has not taken any action against the  judge who issued a ruling eliminating the IVA. Nevertheless,  Finance Minister Adviser Alcides Villalba has requested his  dismissal.</p>

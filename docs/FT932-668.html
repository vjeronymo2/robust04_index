			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Azerbaijan cancels big oil contract: Move coincides with return to power of Brezhnev-era leader WESTERN oil companies are trying to decide how to respond to a sudden government decision to cancel Azerbaijan's first big investment contract in the strife-torn republic. The abrupt cancellation was made after the companies had paid Dollars 70m (Pounds 46.6m) in pre-signing bonuses. The deal, which the oil companies had decided to pursue even after the republic's elected president was stripped of his power, was for the development of the ex-Soviet republic's estimated 4bn barrels of oil reserves off its Caspian Sea coast. The authorities have given no explanation for a decision to 'nullify' the contract, which before President Abulfaz Elchibey fled the capital was due to be signed on July 2. A consortium of eight western companies  - led by British Petroleum and Amoco and Pennzoil of the US - was to develop three fields containing all the country's proven reserves. The other companies involved are Britain's Ramco Energy, Norway's Statoil, the US's McDermott International and Union Oil of California, and the Turkish Petroleum Company. The acting government has not said what it will do next, short of promising the companies that their money will be refunded. Oil executives suggested the government may decide to alter the percentages allotted to each company, negotiate an entirely new contract, or call for new companies to apply. One even speculated that some oil companies may even be using this month's political upheaval to change the terms of the arrangements. 'We're waiting to see what direction the government takes now,' said one executive, from the capital of Baku. 'The government is sophisticated enough to know that if you try to take the money and hide with it, you'll cut yourself off from new oil companies. They won't stand for something like that. 'They have an obligation to us - we hope.' The decision was taken by the government on Wednesday, only a day after it accepted pre-signing bonuses. It coincided with the return to power of the republic's Brezhnev-era leader, Mr Heidar Aliyev. President Elchibey, who had given full backing to the deal, has taken refuge in his home village and called the confiscation of his powers a coup d'etat. On Saturday night Mr Surat Husseinov, the leader of the mutiny which facilitated Mr Aliyev's return to power, entered the capital to begin talks with the latter, diplomats said. Mr Husseinov, 35, a war hero who commands a private army estimated at more than 3,000 men, has been demanding to be either president or prime minister, with control over the republic's defence and interior ministries, and its KGB. Diplomats have expressed surprise that the 70-year-old Mr Aliyev has not dispatched his younger rival and got him to accept a lesser position.</p>

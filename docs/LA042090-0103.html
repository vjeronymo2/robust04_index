			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COALITION SUES EPA IN BID TO HALT INCINERATOR PROJECT  </P> <P> A coalition of Eastside and South-Central Los Angeles community groups opposed  to a planned hazardous waste incinerator in Vernon sued the federal  Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday, escalating a four-year campaign to  halt the controversial project.  </P> <P> The complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court by the National Resources  Defense Council on behalf of Mothers of East Los Angeles and Concerned Citizens  of South-Central Los Angeles claims the agency failed to properly review the  project before issuing a permit April 10.  </P> <P> On Thursday evening, community activists and elected officials rallied  opposition to the plant with a meeting at an East Los Angeles church and a  protest march to the proposed incinerator site in Vernon, a small industrial  city southeast of downtown Los Angeles that is surrounded by low-income,  minority neighborhoods  </P> <P> "There are alternative locations. There are also alternative technologies,"  said Joel Reynolds, an attorney representing the community groups. "The EPA has  taken a position that it doesn't have to look at alternatives, and that is  central to this lawsuit."  </P> <P> An attorney for California Thermal Treatment Services Inc., the company that  wants to build the facility, predicted that the suit, like previous court  challenges, will fail.  </P> <P> Community activists claim the incinerator -- the first large-scale commercial  incinerator in California -- will spew potentially cancer-causing materials  into the already polluted region and create thousands of tons of toxic ash that  would have to be buried in as-yet-undetermined locations.  </P> <P> Supporters of the incinerator project, which would be operated as a commercial  enterprise, say it would reduce hazardous waste problems. Company lawyer Larry  Straw said opponents have grossly exaggerated the health risks and have "no  evidence whatsoever" to back up their claims.  </P> <P> The federal lawsuit represents a new legal front in the battle over the  controversial incinerator. Another active court case pits the South Coast Air  Quality Management District against California Thermal Treatment Services.  </P> <P> The suit filed Thursday asks the court to order the EPA to rescind the  hazardous waste disposal permit and require the agency to prepare an  environmental study that includes an assessment of alternatives.  </P> <P> EPA spokeswoman Virginia Donohue said the agency "does not get into siting for  hazardous waste facilities. That's a state and local issue and a zoning issue."  </P> <P> "The EPA believes strongly in pollution reduction and hazardous waste  prevention," Donohue said. "A well-built incinerator that meets environmental  regulations and environmental controls has a valid place in hazardous waste  management."  </P></p>

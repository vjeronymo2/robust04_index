In his address to conference yesterday, Mr John Major said that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, had invited Britain to send delegates to Moscow to act as observers for the elections, due to be held in December. The request came in a telephone conversation between the two leaders on Thursday. The Foreign Office said yesterday that observers for the forthcoming elections would probably comprise a high-level team from the British parliament, including several MPs.</p>

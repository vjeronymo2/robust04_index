			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Number's up for Bonn and Weimar NOT only history and John le Carre have immortalised Weimar and Bonn. Both happen to share the same post code: 5300. But not for much longer, if an ambitious plan by the German post office is implemented as scheduled on July 1. On that day the two separate post codes of the two Germanys will be superseded by a new system aimed at making the postal service more efficient and faster. Mr Norbert Schafer, a post office official, said it was only a matter of time before the two systems had to be harmonised. 'The west German postal codes system was introduced in 1961 (the year the Berlin Wall was built). The east German system, which was more rational because it had more post codes which thus covered much smaller areas, was introduced in 1965. But there are 800 towns and cities in east and west Germany which share the same postal code. There's lots of room for error.' Introduction of the new system, at a cost of DM400m (Dollars 240.9m) and after nearly two years' research and testing, involves scrapping the current 5,400 codes and replacing them with 26,000 new ones. The first casualty will be the suffix placed after every city, town and village, which characterised only the western German system and which denoted a particular district. Instead, all cities, towns and villages will have a prefix only. For instance, Berlin's trendy Savignyplatz, whose post code is currently W-1000 Berlin 12, will be changed to 10623. 'The W (for West), and the O (Ost or East) will no longer exist,' explains Mr Schafer. 'The first two numbers of the new system will denote the region. The last three numbers denote the post office allocated to your new post code.' Mr Klaus Lammich, an official from the transport and telecommunications department of the Federation of German Industry, says he has received complaints from members, mostly about the cost. 'But overall, we accept it because it is necessary.' Quelle, the country's giant retail and mail-ordering service, says the short-term effects will be difficult, but longer term its business should profit from a faster postal service. Mr Eric Jesker, a spokesman for Quelle, says it will cost the company around DM30m to change their entire data system. 'Once July 1 comes, that's it. There no room for tolerance. There's no room for mistakes. If you use the old post code, your letter will not get delivered,' he says. If it works, 5300 Bonn and 5300 Weimar will be another relic of the past.</p>

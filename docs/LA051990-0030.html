Ray  Dixon said.  </P> <P> Rescuers arrived to find injured victims waiting dazed along the road,  witnesses said. The injured were taken to Northern Inyo Hospital in Bishop,  about 14 miles north of Big Pine.  </P> <P> The bus is operated by Southwest Charter Co. of Phoenix, Ariz.  </P> <P> In 1986, the nation's second-worst bus accident occurred on a mountain canyon  highway about 100 miles north of Friday's accident. That crash, which killed 21  and injured 22 others, many of them residents of a Santa Monica retirement  home, occurred when a Starline Sightseeing Tours bus veered off U.S. 395 and  into the West Walker River.  </P></p>

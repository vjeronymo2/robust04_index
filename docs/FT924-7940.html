			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Mapping an approach to corporate ills: An initiative by the Bank of England to help beleaguered companies Bankers to British companies are getting nervous. 'What I describe as some of the better names among companies are breaching their borrowing covenants,' said a senior director of one of the UK's biggest banks. He and his peers fear that unless the banking community - foreign banks included - works together to support these companies, serious damage might be done to the UK economy. To reinforce the need for co-operation between banks, Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of the Bank of England, has in the past fortnight spoken to closed meetings of bankers on guidelines operating in the City as to how banks should behave when a company runs into difficulties. These guidelines are known as the London Approach and are a statement of best practice supported strongly by the Bank. Yesterday he repeated the speech in a more public forum, at the Chartered Institute of Bankers. The intention of the London Approach is to create an orderly framework for negotiations between a bank and a troubled company to prevent that company from going into receivership unnecessarily. When a company runs into difficulties, it often asks its banks to defer principal payments, roll up interest or extend new credit. Most lending agreements contain covenants requiring a unanimous agreement of the banks to any such substantial changes in the loan terms. The convention that there should be unanimity allows a bank wanting to get back its loan from a troubled company to hold the company's other banks to ransom. One recalcitrant bank may threaten to vote against a reconstruction proposal and put a company into receivership, unless other banks promise to repay that bank's loan. In such disputes the Bank of England is normally happy to intervene and put pressure on the rogue bank to be more co-operative. Mr Pen Kent may either talk to the bank himself, or, if that bank is foreign, to its domestic regulator. However, he is adamant that this is not a process of favouring the views of UK banks over foreign banks. 'We operate an open-door policy and will talk to any player involved whether large or small, domestic or foreign,' he said. Mr Kent has intervened in bank negotiations in relation to 70 companies in the past year. Although the Bank has usually been successful in forging a unanimous view among banks, Mr Kent urged banks to adopt new procedures when writing loan covenants. He said the requirement of a unanimous vote for a reconstruction to go ahead should be replaced with a qualified majority. He attacked banks and professional advisers for charging excessive fees when refinancing companies. 'Fees and costs are . . . always too high.' Companies such as Eurotunnel, WPP and Brent Walker have complained that their bankers and other advisers have been charging tens of millions of pounds for changes in their borrowing agreements. Mr Kent said: 'I know of a number of cases where the costs associated with a proliferation of advisers has led to a real risk to the future of the company concerned.' All the advisory costs in a corporate reconstruction are typically paid by the company being rescued, even if those costs relate to legal and financial advice given to the company's banks. Mr Kent said that when a company has several banks, those banks should share a single legal adviser. He warned that 'we in the City . . . shall bring ourselves into disrepute' unless these fees and costs are kept down. Mr Kent also has misgivings about the new practice of banks selling their loans in troubled companies to other financial institutions. These transactions are relatively common in the US and are gradually taking place in the UK. Some of WPP's banks for example sold their loans when the advertising group ran into difficulties. Mr Kent was concerned that when banks are trying to rescue a company - what he calls a 'work-out situation' - debt sales 'will impede progress'. He added: 'Selling debt in response to news that a company is in difficulty is not in keeping with one of the basic tenets of the London Approach.' The Bank of England does not want to discourage the creation of a secondary market in corporate debt. But Mr Kent wants the banking community to draw up a 'code of conduct to minimise disruption during the formulation of a work-out'. In particular, any institution buying debt in a troubled company should be made aware that it is taking on a responsibility to join in the negotiations to rescue the company and not rely on the company's traditional bankers to organise the rescue alone. Mr Kent added that in general banks should not exclude non-bank creditors - holders of bonds or short-term debt securities - from the process of rescuing a company. But he has not been persuaded by the request from foreign banks that the Bank of England should establish a register of companies' debts, so that any bank lending to a company could discover whether that company had already borrowed too much from other sources. The request for such a register was made after last year's collapse of Mr Robert Maxwell's companies. Mr Kent said: 'I have my doubts about whether such an institution would be effective.' Such a register would not work in the UK, he believes, because companies can borrow offshore and therefore any company which wanted to disguise its overall indebtedness could do so. Some companies, such as O&amp;Y Canary Wharf, owner of Europe's biggest property development in London's Docklands, are, however, incapable of being rescued by the voluntary efforts of bankers. These companies need to use insolvency legislation to protect themselves from the competing claims of creditors. But Mr Kent said that UK insolvency law is unsatisfactory. Too few companies are using the administration procedures of the Insolvency Act to acquire creditor protection for a limited period while rebuilding their businesses. So if bankers cannot agree on a voluntary rescue, most troubled companies go into receivership, from which they rarely emerge as a going concern. 'I would like to see a detailed review of the working of these parts of the Insolvency Act to explore ways of making these (administration procedures) more usable,' he said. But the best cure for corporate ills is not any legislative change, he added. lt is for banks to learn more about their customers and only lend when the cash flows of a company can support the loan. In the meantime, 'If we all keep our nerve . . . there will be more survivors to benefit from those lessons.'</p>

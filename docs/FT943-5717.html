			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Personal View: 'Gatting' the Greens - Environmentalists must live with trade Recent congressional debate might suggest to most Americans that trade and environmental policies are incompatible. Some environmental groups fear that decisions made by the World Trade Organisation may force a 'lowest common denominator' reduction in environmental protection in the US and elsewhere. Proponents of trade expansion are equally worked up, fearing inclusion of environmental issues on the WTO agenda will add burdensome delays and complexities to trade policy decision-making. Both sides are over-reacting. There is no inherent conflict between environmental protection and open trade; they are not mutually exclusive goals. There is nothing in General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules - rules soon to be assumed by Gatt's successor organisation, the WTO - that precludes consideration of environmental issues during a multilateral negotiation. The more relevant question is whether those issues are ripe for negotiation on a global basis. A second, and perhaps even more relevant, question is whether those who seek consideration of environmental issues have as their primary motivation protecting the environment, or impeding trade. The challenge for international environmental policy is to strike a sensible balance between economic development/job creation/trade expansion, on the one hand, and environmental protection on the other. In recent years most environmental organisations have begun to embrace market-based solutions to environmental issues, recognising that markets and growth are not generally inconsistent with environmental protection. There remains, however, a cadre of hard-core activists who view command-and-control regulation as the only legitimate environmental policy, and who also view economic growth as an enemy of the environment. This hard-core group seems bent on enshrining unilateral trade retaliation, extraterritorial regulation, and unfettered regulatory sovereignty as the cornerstone of US trade and environmental policy. Painting the new WTO as a 'Gattzilla' out to devour the environment, as some environmental groups have done, trivialises the challenge of determining how best to mesh environmental protection with economic growth and trade expansion throughout the world. That answer is not to be found in a massive global environmental bureaucracy, nor in unilateral imposition of US environmental standards on developing countries; citizens of the third world are not about to be consigned to a future as hewers of wood and drawers of water. The answer must be found through multilateral consensus within Gatt (and then the WTO). Gatt is already addressing many of these difficult and vital issues. The present agreement specifically permits nations to take measures to protect the environment, so long as they are aimed at conservation of exhaustible natural resources and are taken in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption. This is broad language, and it has been interpreted broadly. Too often the positive side of Gatt's record on environmental issues has been overlooked. Gatt has clearly stated that a nation may have more demanding environmental standards than those in other countries - so long as they are not more trade restrictive than necessary. Gatt has also ruled that nations may take balanced action for conservation of natural resources outside their borders and that restrictions may be imposed to conserve a natural resource even if its stocks are not presently depleted. Gatt thus encourages nations to conserve resources for future generations. Just recently the Gatt established a special committee on trade and the environment. It will study and report (to the new WTO) on a whole range of environmental issues of concern to US business, including the trade effects of packaging and labelling requirements, product standards, and environmental charges. The US trade representative will also have an advisory committee on the environment to examine similar issues. The WTO must eventually confront these issues - in a manner compatible with Gatt's historic objective of opening trade. WTO member nations must act objectively and systematically, lest they seriously jeopardise a half-century of progress in liberalising trade. The US, as a leader in the WTO and a force for both open trade and environmental protection, should nurture this process, helping its fellow WTO members to avoid premature, capricious judgments concerning the future interrelation of the environment and trade. All this is relevant to the present debate over giving the President 'fast track' authority to negotiate environmental agreements. We simply do not yet know whether it would be in the self-interest of the US to negotiate on these issues, and we certainly do not yet know what our specific negotiating objectives would be. Most other nations are not nearly as far along on the 'negotiating curve' as we are. After the recently established committee on trade and the environment reports its findings, interested parties in all nations can assess whether new trade/environmental negotiations are appropriate. If so, let's negotiate; if not, the WTO can and will move on to other issues. The Gatt accord now before Congress will allow an individual WTO member to impose higher product standards than other nations so long as the standards are based on sound science. The US supports this concept, for it encourages environmental stewardship, but we need to make sure that 'high' standards are not used simply to gain an unfair competitive advantage. Standards that cannot be supported scientifically will properly be subject to WTO challenge. Bad science is too often just disguised protectionism. Good science will improve public health and environmental quality around the globe, and it will also enhance the credibility of its proponent organisations. Only through multilateral consensus can the US achieve meaningful change in international trade rules or global environmental standards. The US cannot mandate standards, because the Gatt - to the frequent benefit of the US - has traditionally operated by consensus. (Though that could change under the WTO, it is unlikely to do so except on rare occasions.) Therefore, the key to success is to negotiate and negotiate well. If we have unrealistic negotiating objectives in these new areas, the negotiations will not succeed. That would do nothing to protect the environment. But we can work through the WTO and other international bodies to convince other nations of our positions and to encourage the adoption of sound principles to improve environmental protection. Reducing trade barriers in industrial countries will also encourage developing countries to raise their own standards of environmental protection. Nations devote more attention to protecting the environment as they become richer. As a middle class emerges and grows, demands for protection of the environment increase. We should work with this trend, not against it. In short, we need to 'Gatt' the greens, not 'green' the Gatt. Multilateral co-operation on issues affecting trade and the environment will offer a stronger and more secure basis for environmental protection than ad hoc, politically charged actions by individual nations, however well intentioned. Those of us who have worked on trade issues for many years do not believe that open trade and environmental protection are inconsistent goals. We look to the future with confidence that the WTO will properly mesh legitimate objectives in both areas.

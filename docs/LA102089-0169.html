			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BAY AREA QUAKE;  </P> <P> 5:04 P.M.;  </P> <P> A TIME WHEN LIVES CHANGED;  </P> <P> TALES OF THE QUAKE: DEATH, HEROES AND LUCK ;  </P> <P> ON GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE -- A SCARE  </P> <P> Lissa Collins-Gudim, 28, was halfway across the Golden Gate Bridge, heading  toward San Francisco from a house-hunting trip to Sonoma with her husband, Tim,  when it began.  </P> <P> "The first thing I thought was maybe we'd lost all four tires," said the  Pacific Palisades resident. "All of a sudden, the guy driving us, the real  estate broker, said: 'Oh, my God! We're having an earthquake!' And then it got  worse.  </P> <P> "The bridge was swaying . . . . The next thing that happened is that it began  waving. It fanned, sort of. The cables -- the little ones that go up and down  -- were like spaghetti. The big ones, those big fat ones, they were moving from  side to side, six feet in either direction."  </P> <P> Brake lights flared. Cars screeched to a halt, each driver trying to avoid the  next. Across the bay in San Francisco, a huge column of dust arose from the  collapsed buildings in the Marina District.  </P> <P> On the Golden Gate, the swaying lasted 40 to 50 seconds, Collins-Gudim  estimated, nearly three times the elapsed time of the actual quake.  </P> <P> "I just thought I was never going to see my kids again," she said. "I had my  hand on the car door. If we were going to fall in the water, I didn't want to  drown." CATHLEEN DECKER  </P></p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock makes employment top priority MR NEIL Kinnock yesterday made an immediate reduction in unemployment his first priority for a Labour government and said he was not prepared to abandon the ambition of 'a fully working economy'. In spite of the party's recent efforts to reduce expectations that full employment remains an attainable objective, Mr Kinnock said he wanted eventually to ensure that there were 'jobs available for just about everybody who is looking for a job'. He acknowledged that the target of full employment 'might miss by three quarters to 1m' depending on the demand for skills and the impact of technological change, but it was possible to move towards it. His remarks followed a lecture to businessmen and academics on a day when senior Labour figures lined up to attack the government's failure to combat the recession and to claim Labour alone would end it. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said Labour knew the recession 'will not cure itself' and that the voters realised time was up for a 'do-nothing, no-change government'. Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said independent forecasters accepted that Labour policies would lead to higher growth and lower unemployment. Mr Kinnock said in his lecture that the past 13 years had represented 'a vicious circle of low investment and falling competitiveness, leading in turn to lower investment'. The government, he said, had built its economic strategy around the proposition that the only economic task of government was to pursue an anti-inflationary policy and it had no responsibility for the supply side of the economy 'other than to undertake deregulation, privatisation and tax cuts as often as possible'. He denied suggestions that his party's plans for personal taxation would hinder economic recovery and said the proposed tax rates compared favourably with those in Europe. The Tories, however, seized on a remark later in the day by Mr Kinnock to claim that he had admitted the Tories' argument that higher taxes would kill the recovery. In an interview with Channel 4 news, Mr Kinnock said: 'The state of the public finances is bad, and to respond to that by increasing taxes would be very deflationary and push us deeper into recession - that must be wrong.' Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, said that Mr Kinnock 'stands condemned by his own words.' Mr Kinnock said that Labour's proposed Budget would this year halt growth in unemployment and reduce the number of jobless by 300,000 in 1993. Growth in real earnings would be 50 per cent higher as a result of Labour's plans.</p>

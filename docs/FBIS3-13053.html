			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Amin Muhammad Amin in Sanaa] </F>   [Text] Yemeni Interior Minister Brigadier General Yahya  al-Mutawakkil has stated that the al-Jihad Organization and the  Afghan Arabs who returned from Afghanistan are the ones behind  the recent assassinations in Yemen, not the General People's  Congress Party, which participates in the ruling coalition in  Yemen.    Yahya al-Mutawakkil affirmed in an interview with AL-AHRAM  that arresting the masterminds and criminals of the organized  assassinations in Yemen is the joint responsibility of the  General People's Congress and the Socialist Party.    He added that the majority of these terrorists are based in  the southern governorates such as Abyan, Hadhramaut, and  Shabwah, as well as in the northern governorates such as Sanaa  and the areas of Khawlan and Marid [place name as published].    He pointed out that those involved in the assassinations are  well known but all have not been arrested because it is not easy  to do so. He clarified that the terrorists are currently hiding  out in mountainous areas where huge military forces are needed  to track them down.    On the Pledge and Accord document, he said: The document  came to express the aspirations of the people to find a system  that guarantees the maintenance of unity and paves the way for  local government. He pointed out that the expectation that the  crisis would be resolved immediately after the document was  signed in Amman was not accurate since it is too serious and  complicated to be resolved by a mere signature.    He explained that the conflicts started after united Yemen  was established. Because of everyone's joy over unity, they  forgot to take needed measures, such as merging the armed and  security forces and institutions and finding a unified course  the state should follow. The differences emerged very clearly  after parliamentary elections were held. These elections  revealed the loyalty of the parties in the north and south to  their old bodies, foremost of which is the Army. This deepened  the rift between the two sides.    He said: What is happening in the Yemeni arena does not  represent the end of the road because Yemen is currently going  through a state of upheaval.    Al-Mutawwakil expected the military skirmishes between Abyan  and Mudiyah to stop next week and the forces to withdraw to  their original positions.    On the surprise postponement of the cabinet meeting that was  to convene in Aden by Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas,  he clarified that a request was made to postpone the meeting so  that its success could be guaranteed, especially since the  agenda proposed by the prime minister is not enough. He added  that he will convene an extraordinary cabinet meeting after the  'Id al-Fitr. On the demands made by the Socialist Party to  remove the military camps from the cities, he said: The pledge  document has specified certain steps for doing so, however, the  current atmosphere does not allow this demand to be met.  Therefore, we need to hold talks and agree over a joint method  to implement all articles of the pledge document gradually.    Regarding the participation of new mediators, including Arab  and other countries, to implement the document, he said: There  is no justification for new mediation because the People's  Congress is in constant and direct contact with the leaders of  the Socialist Party. He ruled out that developments in the  Yemeni arena will lead to restoring the split between the north  and the south. He said it is difficult to accuse foreign powers  of having interfered in what is happening. However, unity does  have some enemies and there are some sides that wish to redivide  Yemen into two parts.    Regarding the recent problem of foreigners being kidnapped,  he said it is new to Yemeni society but is part of the crisis  the country is going through. This crisis has given tribes the  chance to carry out kidnappings to blackmail the state.    Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil affirmed that the  security forces have taken all necessary measures to guarantee  that such incidents are not repeated.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Cardoso signs Dollars 350m IADB loan agreement MS Zelia Cardoso de Mello, Brazil's economy minister, has signed a Dollars 350m (Pounds 205.8m) loan agreement with the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), writes Stephen Fidler in Washington. The loan, to improve urban sanitation, will create about 45,000 jobs. It had been delayed because of US concern over Brazil's growing arrears with commercial banks. The loan was approved by the bank's board last week, following an agreement in principle last month with leading bank creditors over the arrears. Ms Cardoso yesterday met Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund. She told journalists she hoped Brazil could 'start as soon as possible' negotiations over its external debt and hoped the IMF and other institutions would provide 'necessary support' for the process. Asked about the possibility of debt relief for Brazil from creditor governments, she said she did not want to anticipate any proposal - which would have, in any case, to follow agreement with the IMF. However, Brazil applauded the decision to write off at least 50 per cent of Poland's debts and said the treatment 'should be extended to other middle- and low-income countries'. The US and Japan have agreed to lead a support group of countries friendly to Peru to help it erase its Dollars 2.1bn in arrears to the IMF, World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. This would allow borrowing from the institutions to resume. Agreement came at a meeting on Monday afternoon in Washington. Mr Camdessus said another meeting would take place in May, at which other countries friendly to Peru would be present, to take the issue forward. The size of the arrears in relation to Peru's resources complicates the problem. Mr Camdessus also said he hoped the IMF would provide support for programmes in Argentina and India.</p>

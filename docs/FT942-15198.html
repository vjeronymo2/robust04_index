			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: A solution to Russia's ills requires common sense Sir, Despite enormous pressure from governments of the Grou of Seven industrial countries (possibly with the exception of Japan), the International Monetary Fund is to be congratulated for limiting the loss - only Dollars 1.5bn this time - from the most recent tranche of ill-conceived and poorly-administered disbursements to 'rescue' Russia. If the west had signed on to the plan advocated by Jeffrey Sachs (Personal View, March 31) over the past few years the losses could have escalated to 10 or even 100 times that amount. Russia does not need a stabilisation fund, debt relief or, worst of all, charity. What is in short supply is common sense and truth. Russia has enormous mineral and agricultural resources. It needs to be told, preferably by domestic experts, that the country is bankrupt (to use Professor Sachs's analogy) because its world-class assets are under-performing, or worse, non-performing. If the Russians want to enjoy the marvellous benefits of modern technology - that is,increases in the material standard of living - they are going to have to find their niche in the fiercely competitive world economy, as have Taiwan, South Korea and, more recently, Chile and Mexico. They must also produce goods at internationally competitive prices and acceptable quality standards. If their current bankrupt 'system' of industrial organisation, labour relations, public finance, property rights and government intrusions in economic life - not to mention what passes for fiscal and monetary policies  -prevents them from getting closer to this objective, it is obvious what has to be done. Throwing good money at a failed system flies in the face of common sense.

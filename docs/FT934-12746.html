			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (8): Why the Finns came to town - Eastward investment / Eilenburg in Saxony FINLAND'S and Europe's largest paper manufacturer, could have chosen to build its new recycling plant in western Germany, or in another European Community country. Instead, it decided on the eastern German state of Saxony. 'We had looked around other states in eastern Germany. The decision was close. In the end, we opted for Eilenburg, a small town near Leipzig,' said Mr Jukka Hamala, the president of Enso-Gutzeit. Many factors influenced the group's final decision to expand into paper recycling in eastern Germany. It received investment grants of between 15 and 20 per cent for a greenfield site on which it will build a recycling paper mill costing DM800m. And, taking into account tax relief and special depreciation allowances, Gutzeit reckons its investment outlay will be about 55 per cent of the total amount. But it was not only the financial incentives which brought the Finns to Saxony. 'There was the minimum of red tape,' explained Mr Kari Vainio, head of communications at Gutzeit. 'We started negotiations two years ago in November. One year from now, we will be up and running. This is really fast. We had the maximum of cooperation. None of it was fake. It was a really constructive relationship with the local authorities,' he said. The site, which cost about DM10m, was bought not from the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising and restructuring eastern German industry, but from the local authorities of Saxony. This time next year, Gutzeit will be on schedule to produce at Eilenburg 280,000 tonnes of newsprint, primarily from recycled paper and it will employ about 350 people. By 1995, 100 per cent of the operations will be based on recycled paper. The mill will have a capacity of 320,000 tonnes a year. But while investment incentives and a flexible local administration smoothed Gutzeit's road to Eilenburg, there is little doubt in the mind of Mr Kai Korhonen, managing director of Sachsen Papier, (the name of the plant), about the importance of Saxony's geographical and cultural location. 'Think about the traditions of this place,' he said. For well over a century, Saxony, and Leipzig in particular, was one of the great European crossroads. Today, it is two hours drive from Berlin, slightly longer to Prague, and four hours to Munich. 'Look at the market out there,' said Mr Harmala, on the day he laid the foundation stone at Eilenburg under a hot, cloudless day. 'The media and newspaper market is growing in western Germany, and especially in eastern Germany. We cannot ignore the growing demand in the countries of eastern Europe. By being here, we will be in a position to capture these markets,' he added. The German market alone accounts for 15 per cent of Gutzeit's net turnover which last year totalled DM3.2bn. The European Community countries together account for 60 per cent of its net sales. Net sales and total exports world wide account for 80 per cent of the group's annual turnover. 'With this profile, it is clear we had to expand into the German market and also use it as a stepping stone into eastern Europe,' said Mr Vainio. Saxony's cultural traditions played an important role for Gutzeit's decision as well. A major publishing centre in the last century, this proud and increasingly self-confident state has retained its traditions and expertise in this field. There is also an infrastructure in place. Deutsche Telekom, for example, has already invested DM850m in Leipzig alone to support the expanding graphics, book publishing and printing sectors. Gutzeit is not alone in coming to Saxony. Since late 1990, when the Treuhand embarked on its privatisation programme, the state, led by Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, has attracted DM45.1bn worth of investment commitments and has secured 426,661 jobs through these sales. Of the 3,797 enterprises and property sold by the Treuhand, more than 230 have been bought by foreigners who have invested DM3.7bn in the state, and have guaranteed 30,000 jobs. Mr Vainio's only comment in explaining the high level of investment in the region was short and to the point. 'We believe in Standort Saxony.'</p>

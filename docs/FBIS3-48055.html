All parliamentarians from 33 countries who  attended the two-day conference vowed to wage a campaign for a  new conference.    A resolution issued at the end of the conference today  called  on all countries to support an initiative to lift the ban on  arms exports to Bosnia-Herzegovina. The parliamentarians also  voiced their reservations against the Bosnia peace negotiators,  who had acted against the UN Charter and the London Conference.  They also called on the United Nations to take immediate action  to save Sarajevo and other cities from Serbian destruction.</p>

This figure  includes all revenue at national and regional level.    Expenditure: The estimate of total expenditure from the  National Revenue Account is R135.1bn, up 10.2 percent form  1993/94. This now covers all spending at national and regional  level, except that financed from the former regional  administrations' own revenues. It includes the R4bn for the  transition.    Finance: The final consolidated Budget deficit will be  R29.3bn or 6.6 percent of GDP [gross domestic product]. This  compares with last year's 6.9 percent. Loan redemptions will be  about R6.9bn, lifting the gross borrowing requirements to  R36.5bn. Government intends to finance this mainly through  domestic loans of R34.513bn. Foreign borrowings of R1.8bn are  planned.    Reconstruction and Development: An amount of R2.5bn was  allocated to the RDP [Reconstruction and Development Program]  fund, rising to R5bn, R7.5bn, R10bn and R12.5bn over the next  four years. The initial finance was raised by cuts in  departments' budgets.    Tax Proposals: Individual tax rates remain unchanged, but  there is a transition levy of 5 percent on individuals with  taxable income above R50,000, or R175,000 in the case of married  women.     -  Companies with taxable income in excess of R50,000 are  also liable for the transition levy at a rate of 5 percent.    -  The corporate tax rate falls to 35 percent from 40 percent  from  April 1994, but STC [secondary tax on companies] will be raised  to 25 percent from 15 percent with immediate effect.        VAT [value-added tax]: Remains unchanged at 14 percent.    Customs and Excise:     -  The price of a 340ml can of beer rises by 2c (6c/1).    -  Spirits rise by 53c a 750ml bottle.    -  Cigarettes increase by 7c for 10.    -  Cigarette tobacco increases by 9c per 50g.    -  Pipe tobacco and cigars increase by 65c per kg.    -  Unfortified wine rises 4.5c per 750ml bottle.    -  Fortified wine increases 5c per 750ml bottle.    -  Sparkling wine rises 6c per ?50ml bottle.    -  Other fermented drinks such as cider rise 2c per 340ml can.    -  Sorghum beer increases 1c/l.    -  Sorghum beer powder rises 5c/kg.    -  Cold drinks and mineral water increase by 1c/l.        Import Surcharge: The 5 percent imp?rt surcharge on all  capital and intermediate goods will be removed with immediate  effect.    Pensions:     -  Civil pensions rise by 5 percent from April 1 1994 for  pensioners who retired or before July 1 1993; those who retired  later but before April 1 1994 receive a 0.56 percent increase  for each full month since retirement.    -  Pensions which have increased since retirement by a  percentage  which, after taking into account the increase above, does not  equal 70 percent of the increase in the CPI [consumer price  index] since retirement, will be increased to that level.    -  Military pensions will rise by 5.6 percent from April 1 1994.    -  About R418m is made available for a general social pensions  increase and the elimination of backlogs.        Job Creation: R292m is allocated to job creation, excluding  allocations from the RDP fund. However, the figure mainly  represents a rollover by the Manpower Department.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> RAGING CHARGER HEADS TALENTED FIELD FOR FEATURE  </P> <P> Raging Charger, who finished a close second in his 1990 debut two weeks ago,  heads a field of eight sprinters in tonight's feature at Los Alamitos Race  Course.  </P> <P> The 350-yard main event features 3-year-old and older horses racing for a  $16,000 claiming price.  </P> <P> Here's how they'll line up (from the rail out with riders): Ah Wilderness,  Eddie Garcia; Grampa Sam, Steve Treasure; Easy Duino, Bruce Pilkenton; Lucky  Leinster, Kip Didericksen; Raging Charger, Lute Proctor; Hemet Flash, Ralph  Seville, and Bubba Dasher, Danny Cardoza.  </P> <P> Raging Charger, owned by Bonifacio Rayas, opened his 1990 season in allowance  company two weeks ago at Los Alamitos. Racing as the 2-1 favorite, jockey Henry  Garcia had Raging Charger on the lead a few strides away from the gates, but  had to settle for second when Double The Effort stuck his neck out in the final  yards.  </P> <P> The 5-year-old gelding raced with some tough allowance horses last year at Los  Alamitos.  </P> <P> Jockey Henry Garcia led Raging Charger to a fourth-place finish in the 550-yard  Barbra B Handicap last season. The Colorado-bred likes the shorter 350-yard  distance and is well-placed in tonight's field.  </P> <P> With leading rider Didericksen, Lucky Leinster could upset the top choice. The  4-year-old son of Leinster House won five of nine races last year for trainer  James Maple.  </P> <P> Hemet Flash faces one of the easiest fields of his career after racing with  stakes horses last year.  </P></p>

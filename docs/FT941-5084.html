			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Record exports for South Korea car companies South Korea's four main motor vehicle companies reported increased sales for 1993, although two remain in the red. Exports reached a record 639,000 vehicles, benefiting from the depreciation of the Korean won against the Japanese yen. Increased sales in the developing world, including south-east Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, were largely responsible for the rise in exports. Domestic sales were helped by low-interest financing as car companies competed to increase their market share. Hyundai Motor, the nation's largest car company, reported a 39 per cent increase in net profits to Won58.2bn (Dollars 72m), as sales rose 18 per cent to Won7,180bn. It predicts a 18 per cent jump in sales to Won8,500bn for 1994. Exports rose 19 per cent to 337,640 vehicles, and this year are expected to rise 14 per cent to 385,000. Domestic sales increased 9 per cent to 443,600 vehicles and Hyundai predicts 18 per cent growth to 525,000 this year. Last year the company had a 46 per cent share of the Korean motor market. Kia Motors reported net profits increased 24 per cent to Won18.7bn in 1993, while sales rose 25 per cent to Won4,110bn. It predicts a 33 per cent increase in sales to Won5,600bn for 1994. Exports grew 54 per cent to 158,415 vehicles and are expected to expand 64 per cent to 260,000 this year, as Kia increases its US presence by establishing a dealership network. Domestic sales increased 18 per cent to 520,000 vehicles last year, giving it 27 per cent of the Korean market. Daewoo Motor narrowed its loss to Won60bn in 1993 from Won90bn in 1992, and predicts a profit this year as exports increase 40 per cent. Sales rose 29 per cent to Won2,200bn and are predicted to jump 45 per cent to Won3,200bn in 1994. Ssangyong Motor reported a Won37.1bn loss in 1993 against a Won8.8bn loss in 1992. But sales rose 12 per cent to Won382bn. The results reflected increased competition in the market for sports utility vehicles, the company's main product.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Wang and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] New York, June 7 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC]  Premier Lien Chan arrived in New York Tuesday [7 June] evening  after a whirlwind visit to Mexico.    Lien is the first incumbent premier from the ROC to visit  New  York since Taipei and Washington severed diplomatic ties in 1979.    Previously, Lien was only allowed to make transit stops in  Los Angeles or Miami on his way to Central American countries.    Lien and his wife arrived in New York at 7:55 P.M. Lien said  his New York tour is purely for private purposes.    ROC Vice Foreign Minister Fang Chin-yen, who accompanied the  premier on his Mexican tour, also traveled to New York with Lien.    On hand to greet the Liens at the airport were Ding  Mou-shih,  ROC representative in the United States, and Natale Bellocchi,  chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, the unofficial  conduit for US-Taiwan ties.    Lien will stay in New York for two days. ROC officials  stationed here said Lien is here for a family reunion with his  two children who are studying at Columbia University. "We have  not arranged any public activities for Lien during his stay  here," the officials said.    Lien just wrapped up a groundbreaking visit to Mexico where  he reportedly met with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari and many other senior Mexican officials to discuss ways  to promote bilateral commercial and tourist exchanges. Lien  reportedly also met with Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, who will  represent Mexico's ruling party in the country's forthcoming  presidential election.    Lien was the highest-ranking ROC official to visit Mexico  since the two countries cut diplomatic ties in 1971.    ROC Government Spokesman Jason Hu, who flew to Los Angeles  Sunday after accompanying Lien on his official visits to El  Salvador and Guatemala, would not confirm whether Lien had met  with the Mexican president.    Hu instead said Lien "satisfactorily accomplished his goals  as expected" during his two-day stay in Mexico. "Albeit  unofficial, Lien's Mexican visit was fruitful and laid a solid  foundation for future cooperation between the two countries," he  noted.    Quoting Foreign Ministry officials who accompanied Lien on  his Mexican tour, Hu said Lien had reached consensus with  Mexican officials on a number of programs to promote bilateral  exchanges. Among others, the Mexican Government will send a  trade mission to Taiwan later this month to court Taiwan  investors.    Lien will leave here Thursday and is scheduled to return to  Taipei Saturday, ending his four-country tour.</p>

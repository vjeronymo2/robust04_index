			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Arts: A dip in the deep end - Theatre A new fringe theatre in London, The Bridewell, has opened at the St Bride Institute at Bride Lane, Fleet Street. It deserves to be a roaring success. The auditorium is built over a disused Victorian swimming pool - around the walls is a raised wrought-iron gallery, and above, a glazed roof. The pool was built in 1893, and was closed in 1972. Last year, Carol Metcalf and her company, Breach of the Piece, staged Much Ado About Nothing in the shallow end of the pool, and the idea of a theatre emerged. After five months' work, Pounds 400,000 from the Institute and some non-invasive design by Lloyd Leroy Architects, the theatre opened. The pool itself is now the orchestra pit. The theatre's owners and governors, the St Bride Institute, are planning exhibitions and conferences in the space; the theatre's artistic director, the tireless Metcalf, can offer the theatre for a single early-evening after-work corporate show or a lunch-time revue (imagine how many people fit into a 25-metre swimming pool). The schedule includes Sondheim's Pacific Overtures later this year, but the Bridewell has opened with Shakespeare. Julius Caesar gave the world the 'most unkindest cut of them all'; this has nothing to do with the Lorena Bobbitt case in Virginia, and everything to do with getting Julius Caesar down to two hours on stage with a small cast. The result is more a recital than a play. The essentials of Julius Caesar remain, although the actors need to relax much more and the action of the play needs to quicken. The modern dress works well, particularly with video links to the battle scenes and studio speeches from Brutus and Mark Antony. The shortened version of the play offers itself as Brutus' tragedy, the dilemma of a man torn between instinct and judgment: the part is well played by Clive Paget. Caesar stays alive long enough to show he is worth killing, Cassius lurks hungrily throughout, and Casca (successfully cast as a woman) is blunt to a fault. Elsewhere, the play depends so much on ceremony (this is where 'standing on ceremony' comes from) and crowd scenes which are all sweaty nightcaps and foul breath, that a scaled-down version risks missing the scope and reach of Caesar's ambition. In action, this theatre has great potential for large scenes and intimate moments. But in Caesar the actors occasionally traded lines like water-polo players tossing a long pass across the pool. The lighting could also be more focused to divide up the big stage, and the music should be more martial. Carol Metcalf directs. But this is a sound start to what should be a fine new career for the converted swimming pool. No jokes about Brutus' line: 'Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar I have not slept' - that would be too shallow a view of this deep play. Bridewell Theatre (071 936 3456): in repertory with The Merchant of Venice until February 5</p>

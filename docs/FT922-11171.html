			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: The coming fall in real rates ONE of the certainties in economics, to paraphrase Professor Paul Krugman, is that what cannot be sustained will stop. (Professor Krugman, by the way, is one of the very few economists who can be recommended as light reading.) What has to adjust will adjust. The trick is to guess when and how we will do it. Now apply that thought to real interest rates. Real rates have been unusually high for some time now, and some forecasts circulating seem to assume that this is the new normality; but in the long run, it can't be. Existing private borrowers pay high real rates - high in comparison with expected price increases in their own line of business - because for the time being it looks preferable to bankruptcy. But this simply deepens the hole they are in. Unless rates fall, or prices rise, they will simply go broke later, as is becoming uncomfortably obvious at the moment. Governments can play ostrich rather longer. They cannot forever pay rates that are higher than the real growth of the economy; that is the true definition of the debt trap. For long periods, though, they can neglect the problem; or they can get away with it through asset sales or by raising taxes. While this goes on we remain trapped in our present situation, in which private borrowers are crowded out of the market, simply refused credit at any price. Government meanwhile wonders why the forecast recovery never comes. In the end, slow growth cuts revenues, the assets run out, while higher taxes stifle real growth, and so further reduce the real rates which are affordable. A vicious circle, in short. The adjustment will then come in one or all of three ways: inflation, or default, or better policies. There are no other possibilities. Blank default is probably only conceivable in one or two countries which have especially heavy public debt which is still growing faster than the economy. In Italy, for example, there are already early signs of a buyers' strike in the bond market. Inflation, which is what made the Italian deficit system work for so long still looks likelier; the market is trying to discount both possibilities. British investors, watching foreign investors bid for our gilts, may feel smug. But it is currently fashionable to compare the 1990s with the 1930s; so it is worth remembering that in 1932 the British government invented a half-respectable form of default, by calling in high-coupon gilts before redemption date, and replacing them with 2 1/2 per cent stocks. This once-in-a-generation trick might appeal to a future British government, if it could hope thereafter to run a balanced budget. Inflation, though, is rather likelier, and could happen even in a flat economy as it did in the 1930s, through reduced competition. At that time it was officially encouraged, with the Bank of England as the leading sponsor of defensive cartels. Now we have creeping cartelisation - for example the swap-shop now set up by ICI, which was a defensive creation of the 1930s - and creeping protectionism. This picture of the future may look a little far-fetched, but it looks like the one the market is discounting. If bonds are risky in some sense, and renewed inflation a strong possibility, then the high level of equities on Wall Street, and indeed in London if you allow for thin dividend cover, makes good sense. It is hardly the result that our authorities, including the backward-looking disciplinarians in Paris and in the IMF, intend; they think they are fighting inflation. It is, all the same, the kind of adjustment which may have to happen if they remain obstinate. Give them the benefit of some doubt, though, and the picture changes. If they wake up to the fact that their squeeze is quite unnecessary in the coming years of banking caution, and if continued stagnation makes the Fed's example more attractive then they can let real rates fall sooner. Bonds are a bull market, but recovery follows - as in the US - some way behind. Then the yield gap closes, and bonds are the place to be. And British investors are also offered an each-way possibility: indexed gilts should rise strongly in any scenario short of official default. Place your bets.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSTER DOUGLAS JUST DOING WHAT WILL SELL  </P> <P> So Mike Downey believes Buster Douglas is blowing his image (Aug. 8).  </P> <P> Why? Because he is doing what every other athlete does, and that is to psych  himself up by mouthing off, with expectations of generating interest and  building the gate.  </P> <P> As Muhammad Ali said, "If your opponent listened to all of your hype and  rhetoric, you already have the edge going into the fight."  </P> <P> I seriously doubt if we will have another "Ah was lucky," a la Joe Louis or  Rocky Marciano. The name of the game today is hype.  </P> <P> WILLIAM BROWN  </P> <P> Carson  </P></p>

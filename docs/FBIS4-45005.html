			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hasan al-Chalabi, head of Constitution Committee </F> of Iraqi National Congress: "To Maintain or Lift Sanctions  Against Saddam Regime? Acceptance of Current Regime's Survival  Will Cause Iraq To Lose Its Immunity"]    [Text] Conflict over the fate of sanctions against Saddam's  regime continues to rise. Sometimes it becomes confused and  indistinct in its outlines; at other times its currents clash  and fight each other; and this ever since the embargo was  imposed on Saddam by international resolutions soon after the  invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. After Kuwait was liberated,  each of the parties involved in the embargo began acting on  inspiration from its interests and according to the dictates of  its own policy on the subject. This has became as clearly  evident on the Arab scene as on the international scene.    Exploiting this situation, the regime began to stir  interests  and ambitions this way and that among its friends in the  pressure group in the major powers. Thus, for example, one sees  France, which had been behind Security Council Resolution 688 to  end the regime's repression of its people, concentrating on  measures to ease the embargo and speed its lifting and on  measures acceptable to Saddam's regime--implementing Section 22  of Resolution 687, for example, regarding the elimination of  weapons of mass destruction--to justify ending the sanctions,  regardless of other international resolutions.    No sooner had France done this than Russia and China joined  her. When the fraternal neighbor Kuwait moved to ask about the  fate of the linkage between lifting sanctions and recognition of  her borders and sovereignty, these countries were forced to talk  with Saddam--they were also inspired by their interests--on the  chance that he might agree to such recognition and the problem  might end.    Would that the matter had ended there, and that [another]  fraternal neighbor had not proceeded in its own way! Suddenly  Islamic Iran, claiming to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi  people, opened its borders to the Baghdad regime, so that it  could obtain the goods and materials it desired to support its  survival and enable it to regain its strength. Thus Iran forgot,  or pretended to forget, Iraq's savage war of aggression against  it; it forgot, or pretended to forget, the famous condition that  Imam Khomeyni's voice proclaimed during that war: that war  should continue until victory was achieved with the demise of  Saddam and his regime forever; and it forgot, or pretended to  forget, the imam's famous words spoken when he was asked to halt  the firing: that he would rather drink poison than agree to what  he was being asked to do.    And now fraternal Jordan, that went out of its way to  support  Saddam and his regime despite all the aggression he had  committed against his people and neighbors, has never flagged in  its efforts to smuggle forbidden goods and materials to him  under the cloak of alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi people  and reducing the losses resulting from the blockade of Aqaba.  How one wishes that the government in Jordan would believe that  alleviating or ending this suffering will not come by supplying  Saddam's government with the means to survive and conquer its  own people, but rather by depriving him of those means, so that  they can escape his clutches and his suffocating hold on their  necks! On that day, our brothers in Jordan will realize that the  crushing suffering of the Iraqi people comes from the  continuance of Saddam's government and from those who supply him  with support and backing, and from nothing else.    How great were the surprise and wonder of the Iraqi people  when they saw fraternal Qatar normalize relations with Saddam's  regime and when one country after another restored them under  the same cover of "alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi people  and its tragic pains"! None of us could see how exchanging  ambassadors with Saddam's regime or the Qatari ambassador's  return to Baghdad alleviated suffering and pain. Did brotherhood  and neighborliness not oblige the government leaders in  fraternal Qatar to read the reality of Iraq attentively and  fairly and scan the record of its present government before  making their normalization decisions and going it alone among  their fellow Gulf countries? They ought to have determined who  it was who had devastated Iraq and brought down on it all these  woes--the international community or Saddam's regime. They  should have known with clear sight how this fraternal country  might be saved and its people rescued from their  suffering--whether by supporting and helping the root of the  suffering or by liberating the people from him and releasing  them from their fetters.    Dealings with the Baghdad regime proceed selectively.  Positions, measures, and arrangements are accepted or rejected  according to how they accord with the interests of this or that  party. As for the Iraqi people, they are absent, or rather have  been made absent, from the stage of events. None of these  parties wants to execute on Saddam and his aides the sentence of  history that in times past was imposed on similar insolent  tyrants, who received just retribution at Nuremberg and  elsewhere. How is Saddam any different from Hitler and his  cronies or from any of the world's great war criminals, that he  should escape retribution and punishment to the present day? Has  his aggression against his people entailed less than the  aggression of those criminals? Was his aggression against a  fraternal neighbor less hateful than what took place at their  hands?    These interests and ambitions, which are besieging the  people  of Iraq, thus leaving them easy prey to Saddam's repression and  tyranny, are making Iraqis focus their attention on the region  of their country that has liberated itself from him. They are  tying their hopes to it for salvation from his evil scourge,  with this region as the base from which the onslaught can  proceed against those who sit in the centers of power and  government in Baghdad. We can therefore imagine how much  heartache and pain there were when Iraq's brother Kurds fought  and made war on each other in this region and how much  apprehension and anxiety for their destiny until the fighting  and war ceased. There was universal rejoicing in Iraq and  elsewhere when Iraqi Kurdistan freed itself from Baghdad's rule  and when the democratic process began there about this time two  years ago. As we witness the cessation of mutual fighting and  war, we can but say to our dear brethren that peace among you  and in your dwellings is the point on which Iraqis pin their  hopes for liberation and freedom from slavery.    The alliance between you and Iraq's Arabs embodied in the  Iraqi National Congress is the life preserver from the regime  and scourge of Saddam; for secession is not something you want,  neither is it possible due to well-known regional and  international objections and circumstances. Maintenance of the  status quo for however long is nothing but a transitional,  temporary solution. Therefore, the outcome will be either to  remain in this alliance and strengthen it, or to return to  Saddam's regime and leave the matter to God. It is in the  interest of Iraq's Kurds and Arabs now to adhere to the  federalism embodied in the government of Iraqi Kurdistan, on the  one hand, and to the Iraqi National Congress, on the other hand,  as a transitional, temporary central body to bring to the Iraqi  people a government that the people elect in universal, direct,  free, and honest elections after getting rid of Saddam's rule.  Let us work together to strengthen the regional government and  the central National Congress, that we may stand as a united  Iraq in the face of Saddam's regime at home and abroad.    However selectively the Security Council resolutions  concerning Saddam's regime may be handled, and however far the  attempts may go to obscure what he did to his people and in the  region--attempts to erase the facts of his behavior--the  regime's aggressiveness and violations of the laws of humanity  are so enormous and dangerous that in order to remove the regime  it will not suffice that its arsenal of weapons of mass  destruction be removed, or that it recognize Kuwait's  sovereignty and borders, or that it release Kuwaiti prisoners as  mandated by international resolutions. No, all these resolutions  with their provisions must be carried out effectively, but  especially the provisions of Resolution 688, which calls for  changing the nature of the current government in Baghdad. Only  in this way can the people escape their present predicament,  security return to the area, and the necessary standards for  international dealings be followed.    Certainly, none of this can be achieved or expected while  Saddam with his aides and regime continues to rule. What we are  saying and advocating is nothing new in the history of the  world's tyrants and masters of injustice and oppression. The  aggressiveness of Hitler and his aides, for example, caused the  German state to be removed from the political map for about 40  years. When Germany was restored to political existence in 1949,  it was divided between West and East, and remained so for 40  years, until it regained its unity and sovereignty in the fall  of 1991.    What is this punishment compared to the nature of Saddam's  regime? See how he does as he pleases in the region and rides  roughshod over the world, as he and his mouthpieces call for  lifting the sanctions and normalizing relations with him; and  this at a time when just retribution ought to be imposed on him  and those who sided with him, as having been directly  responsible for the invasion and the fearful war crimes that  were committed, instead of these sanctions that have not  affected his person, his sources of power, or his means of  oppression to any significant extent.    The survival and actions of the present Baghdad government  have caused the state and people of Iraq to lose the immunity  and esteem they had in the international community, thus  encouraging infringement and trifling with the rights of Iraq. A  sign of this are the recent statements by UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali about Iraqi funds that have disappeared or been  squandered by various financial and oil companies--as if they  were loose funds and fair game, with no one having ownership or  title to them. The situation reminds us of what used to be  called "the Sick Man [of Europe]"--the end of the Ottoman  Empire, when there was competition and fighting to divide and  plunder his possessions. It is not unlikely, after the situation  we are witnessing of Saddam with his people and the world, that  his shameful rule in Iraq will lead to the same consequences as  that "sick man's" rule.    Now that Iraqi Kurdistan has freed itself from Saddam's  rule,  Iraq today lives in a state of real and effective division of  government between the north, on the one hand, and the center  and south, on the other. Thus there are two separate governments  ruling Iraq, each independent of the other; indeed, each is  fighting the other, so that one cannot expect Iraq to regain its  unity as a people and state so long as the current government  continues to exist in Baghdad. One is therefore led to wonder at  those who hold that only Saddam's rule can guarantee Iraq's  continued unity.    Saddam is tireless and indefatigable in challenging the  rights of the people of Iraq, the rights of neighbors, and the  injunctions of the legitimate international authority. Whenever  the time approaches for the periodic Security Council review of  the sanctions against his regime, one sees him working  energetically to get rid of them so as to survive and remain in  power. Thus you see him today stirring up Turkey's regional  fears, one the one hand, and its anxieties about its revenues,  on the other, calling on Turkey to act against the entity  existing in northern Iraq, with its secessionist possibilities  whose consequences could affect Turkey's unity to the core. He  is also calling Turkey to cease being silent about the billions  of dollars it is losing as a result of the halt to Iraqi oil  exports through Turkey.    Turkey has therefore begun protesting to the United States  and other coalition members about the continued embargo on Iraq  and the survival of the liberated entity in the north. Indeed,  the Turkish foreign minister, Hikmet Cetin, during his recent  visit to New York at the end of April, was led to advocate a  strange selectivity in applying the Security Council resolutions  concerning Saddam's regime. He advocated lifting the embargo, on  the ground that the regime had fulfilled all the relevant  demands specified in Section 22 of Security Council Resolution  687 on the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.  Disregarding the remaining provisions of international  resolutions, especially those of Resolution 688, dealing with  the rights of the Iraqi people vis-a-vis their present  government, he said: "There is no relation between the Council's  resolutions and the government in Iraq. It is not the business  of the United Nations or any country to decide who shall  administer and rule Iraq." He emphasized that Turkey "did not  approve of introducing personal aspects into the terms of the  oil embargo." He called on Iraqi Kurds to hold talks with  Baghdad, describing the situation in their territory as  "unstable."    We do not understand how this minister could consider the  Saddam regime's enormous violations of human rights and the laws  of humanity in Iraq and his aggressive attack on Kuwait and  other countries as "personal aspects." While making these  pronouncements, should he not have remembered the positions he  once took calling for a trial of Serbian war criminals? Is there  any difference between what the latter did and what Saddam did?  How can one consider what happened in Bosnia-Herzegovina war  crimes, and what happened in Iraq and vicinity personal aspects  and affairs?    How could he deny a relation between the United Nations and  Saddam's rule when every letter of the UN Charter is at variance  with his claim? Should he not have read the principles of this  international charter, especially Section 2, Paragraph 7, before  making his pronouncement under the influence of the political  principle that calls for changing one's position whenever one's  interests change?--but not to such a length as caused his deputy  minister, having ascertained that the United States had released  the Iraqi oil stored in Turkey's pipeline, to wash his hands of  his alliance with Iraq by saying, "We were treated as if we had  made an alliance with Iraq to violate the embargo, but this  unnecessary attempt was the result of misunderstanding."    Efforts by Saddam and his regime to convince officials to  follow a selective policy in implementing international  resolutions concerning him were most successful with France,  where there were friends and followers. Today we see France  speak with pompous eloquence when Saddam's envoy Tariq 'Aziz  arrives in New York, saying: "France urges Iraq to take a  concrete step toward recognizing the state of Kuwait. We have  told the Iraqis that this is the essence of the matter and that  their taking such a step would set everything else in motion."    Is what France says true? Is it true that the essential  solution to the problems of the Saddam regime and to the world's  difficulties with him lie in his recognizing Kuwait's  sovereignty and borders? Saddam does not object to such  recognition if it proves sufficient to lift the sanctions from  his regime. He knows full well that no solemn recognition can  ever stand in the way of his realizing his ambitions, dreams,  and vision of glory as soon as he senses that he can cross the  Kuwaiti and other borders. The problem with him in this respect  is not so much the promises he makes or the oaths he swears as  the availability of forces to do one thing or another. He has  accustomed us to what he calls "phasing" in policy and military  affairs. What this means is that in one phase he yields  something difficult to yield, only to take it back and even more  in another phase.    The story of what he gave to Iran in Algiers in 1975 is  well-known. Scarcely had he finished dividing sovereignty over  the Shatt al-'Arab equally with Iran than he began plotting not  only to regain the Shatt completely, but also to invade all of  Iran; and so it came to pass on 22 September 1980. He did the  same thing in his war against Iran. Scarcely had he finished  with that war, which absorbed his and Iraq's effort and  strength, than he began planning for his new war. At the time,  people imagined that the man, exhausted by eight years of war,  had no further desire for violence, aggression, and hostile  adventures such as would cause him to embark on a new war; yet  he attacked Kuwait on 2 August 1990.    Thus, recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and even of its  borders is not unacceptable to Saddam. All that remains before  he grants it is the matter of arranging things to save face.  Having bound himself and his regime with pledges and promises  not to relinquish Iraq's right to the territory of Kuwait and to  remain there even if it should require a hundred years of war,  it is difficult for him to retreat from his pledges and promises  so easily before the nations and the world. Perhaps Tariq  'Aziz's statement to the Austrian newspaper DER STANDARD on the  eve of his trip to New York, confirms what we have said  previously. He said: "The Kuwait issue now is finished for the  Iraqi government, except that we cannot prevent the Iraqi people  from thinking as they wish; however, historical facts cannot be  ignored." Nevertheless, Saddam's man of sound judgment and chief  of diplomacy thinks it possible that the people will join with  their government. They support it "because they know that it is  working for their welfare and that of Iraq"--if it is possible  to overcome "the frustration the Iraqi people feel from seeing  that although their country's government has carried out all the  UN resolutions on Kuwait, this has not helped alleviate their  suffering, but has even increased it."    It would not be beside the truth or the facts for us to say  in light of what we read in Tariq 'Aziz's statement or read in  Saddam's actual attitude and precedents in this matter that  Saddam and his regime are ready to implement all the Security  Council resolutions concerning them, except one: Resolution 688,  which calls for changing the nature of his government and giving  the Iraqi people their say regarding it. This resolution is his  first and last enemy, for he sees in its implementation his end  and the collapse of his government.    There is therefore no way to conclude a truce with him. One  cannot hold one's peace regarding him or regarding what such  countries as the United States and Britain call for  implementing. The latest example to appear of his war against  this resolution was what we read in the writings of some of his  propagandists. They said that America's support of the  resolution, as enunciated in Secretary of State Christopher's  article in THE NEW YORK TIMES, did not reflect his country's  real policy on the matter: there was a split in American circles  regarding policy toward Saddam's regime, and it would be only a  matter of months and days--time to prepare everything--until the  hour of truth would strike and things would return to their  normal course with America and other countries.    We do not know whether this prophecy was made as a result of  information possessed by its authors or whether it was a guess  on their part. In any case, we assure them that stands on  liberating Iraq from Saddam's regime from the direction of the  United States are not based on the flowery words and promises  that the Iraqi National Congress receives from time to time,  sometimes from President Clinton and sometimes from his aides.  Rather, these stands are based on calculations of interest that  clearly indicate that the international community has no  interest in the Baghdad regime's remaining in power, because  there is need for a government that shall express the opinion  and interests of the people, respect rights and peace in the  region, and rebuild the world's trust in Iraq--things that  Saddam can no longer accomplish.    American and British insistence on linking the lifting of  sanctions from Saddam's regime with implementation of Resolution  688 accords with the essential purpose for which the sanctions  were imposed. They were not imposed only to expel his regime  from Kuwait or to eliminate his weapons of mass destruction, as  Saddam and his mouthpieces say; they were imposed to uproot and  utterly eradicate aggressiveness. This gave the aforesaid  resolution absolute priority in the invasion and liberation of  Kuwait. Only this resolution, implemented with the required  honesty and effectiveness, can change the nature of the current  government in Baghdad and write a new history for it and the  region. Only then will the measures and steps now required be  rendered irrelevant.    We therefore believe that the efforts of all parties on the  Arab, regional, and international scene interested in the  region's peace and security must work together to insist that  Resolution 688 have precedence over other resolutions in the  areas of respect and implementation. This they should do by  working to move it into the scope of the provisions of Article 7  of the United Nations Charter. Ending sanctions against Saddam's  regime should be made conditional on its execution and  implementation. At the same time, an effort should be made to  break the siege of the Iraqi people, especially in the liberated  area, by rendering Security Council resolutions 706, 712, and  778 effective.</p>

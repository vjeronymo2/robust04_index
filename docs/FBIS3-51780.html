			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirna Ortega from the "Telemetro Reports" </F> newscast]    [Text] Arnulfist Party [PA] officials are meeting at the  Presidency to study the possible withdrawal of Molirena  [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] members from the posts  they currently occupy in government. Right now, and at the  request of President Guillermo Endara, PA presidential candidate  Mireya Moscoso de Gruber and PA leader Carlos Rodriguez are  meeting with him at the Presidency of the Republic.    When she arrived at the Presidency, Dona Mireya Moscoso de  Gruber talked to reporters and commented on the possible  withdrawal of the current Molirena ministers.    [Begin recording] [Gruber] The president will have to make  this decision, and it will be a hard decision to make. Members  of Molirena, as well as members of the Authentic Liberal Party  and the PA, have served to support his government. Therefore, I  believe the president must choose what is best the country --  not for his party or for himself -- at this time.    [Unidentified reporter] Do you think the government will  work  the same if Molirena is not in the government alliance?    [Gruber] We, the Arnulfists, feel a bit uncomfortable with  the situation, because the members of Molirena are now going to  be in the opposition. I believe the government will not work  properly without them. Nevertheless, the president must make  the decision, and we should leave it in his hands.    [Reporter] Will the Arnulfists make any recommendations on  this issue?    [Gruber] No, we have not talked to the president yet.    [Reporter] Is that the reason for today's meeting?    [Gruber] The president called me and said he wanted to talk  to me. I will learn the reason for the meeting when I meet with  him. [end recording]    Mireya Moscoso also acknowledged that the president and his  government team will be faced with a difficult task if Molirena  withdraws from the government.    [Begin recording] [Gruber] President Endara's relations with  the Legislative Assembly will be difficult. However, I hope the  legislators will act to help the country and not a specific  party. Their responsibility is to further the good of the  country, not to further their own interests. That is why they  were elected.    [Reporter] Has President Endara's government been weakened  with the latest events and with Molirena's possible withdrawal  from government?    [Gruber] I do not think so. The PA is a big party. We  demonstrated it yesterday when more than 100,000 people backed  us at Santa Ana. Those people are the president's political  backing. [end recording]</p>

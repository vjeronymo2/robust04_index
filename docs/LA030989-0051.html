			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> STEVE LACY SEXTET GOES THROUGH THE MOTIONS  </P> <P> Steve Lacy, the celebrated "first soprano saxophonist of modern jazz" whose  quest for an appreciative audience gave rise to his emigration to Europe in  1970, opened a three-night stint at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Though the sextet features some extraordinary talents in pianist Bobby Few and  bassist Jean-Jacques Avenel, there were few inspired moments during the  three-tune, hourlong opening set.  </P> <P> But there were plenty of moments of drudgery. Each of the tunes was composed by  Lacy and each fit a specific formula that had the rhythm section performing as  a conventional jazz trio backing three instrumentalists in an unyielding search  for wrong notes. As an ensemble, the group sounded like a traffic jam with a  beat.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the beat rarely swung. "Prospectus," the opening tune, started  off swinging at a good clip, but Irene Aebi's violin began undermining the  tempo as soon as she began her awkward underscoring of Steve Potts'  alto-saxophone.  </P> <P> Never designed to swing was "The Bath," a dirge-like tune composed of  three-note descending riffs. Some pleasant melodic ideas by Potts were  diminished when his penchant for playing out of the alto's natural range  resulted in an imitation of a screech owl.  </P> <P> Last on the agenda was "Gay Paree Bop," a joyless paean to be-bop that recalled  the tremendous influence on the form of Arabic folk melodies and Chinese  harmony. As if a lack of identity wasn't enough, the tune featured a vocal by  Aebi that was delivered with all the warmth of a drill sergeant at dawn. Relief  was the feeling when the song, delivered at breakneck speed, finally ended.  </P> <P> Lacy, whose effectiveness in this setting was greatly lessened, remains one of  the foremost proponents of the avant-garde. One senses, though, that pretense  has replaced innovation, posturing replacing invention. And from the determined  look and scowl on the soprano saxophonist's face, Lacy should, for his own  sake, pursue music that offers some joy. A. JAMES LISKA  </P></p>

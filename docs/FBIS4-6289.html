			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Apr 18 (ANTARA) -- Iraqi President Saddam  Husayn is asking Indonesia as chairman of the Nonaligned  Movement (NAM) to help settle the problem of continuing United  Nations' economic sanctions against his country, Foreign  Minister Ali Alatas said here on Monday.    "Iraq maintains that the sanctions should have been stopped  long ago as Baghdad has complied with all UN Security Council  resolutions including those on non-proliferation of nuclear and  chemical weapons," the minister told the press after a meeting  with visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister Sa'id al-Sahhaf.    Alatas said a letter from the Iraqi President containing the  request would be handed to President Suharto by Sahhaf on  Tuesday.    He said Indonesia had been closely following developments  involving Iraq and made informal approaches to other NAM member  countries to collect their views on Iraq's stance that it had  implemented all of the Security Council's resolutions.    "We have the impression that Iraq has carried out all  resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council. Yet the UN  economic sanctions have continued to be in force," Alatas said.    "Indonesia as chairman of NAM will certainly attend to  matter  and, after an in-depth study, make efforts to help resolve it,"  Alatas said, adding that all decisions on the steps NAM would  take to help Iraq would be made by President Suharto.</p>

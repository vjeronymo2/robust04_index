			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Emess passes dividend after 15% decline Emess, the lighting and electrical accessories company, has passed its interim dividend after a 15 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 1.1m, for the half to June 30. Mr Michael Meyer, chairman, said: 'We will consider a payment of a final dividend in light of the full-year results.' Although the second half is traditionally the stronger period, Mr Meyer remained cautious. He is pessimistic about the outlook for the US economy, which affects Alsy, the consumer lighting company. 'Every month is a slog in the US,' said Mr Meyer. 'We are battling against an awful recession.' US losses fell slightly to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.4m). Trading profits in the UK were unchanged at Pounds 4.1m. Losses from the consumer lighting division rose to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 800,000). Margins at its German business, Brilliant, continued to fall. Trading profits at the commercial lighting division fell from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 2.8m, and in electrical and graphics operations from Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 1.3m. Borrowings were static at Pounds 33m, representing gearing of 57 per cent.</p>

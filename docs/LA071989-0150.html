Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> STEELERS' TOP DRAFT PICK HOLDS OUT  </P> <P> An agent for Pittsburgh Steelers running back Tim Worley said that because of  stalled contract talks, the team's top draft pick will train in Los Angeles to  sell insurance and may not train in Latrobe to play football.  </P> <P> "We're prepared to go the whole year if necessary and go into the draft again  next year. I know a lot of teams would like to take him. They need running  backs," agent Doc Daniels said Tuesday from Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Daniels is reportedly seeking a five-year, $9-million contract for the Georgia  running back, the seventh player taken in the draft. The agent said the  Steelers have offered $1.6 million over four years.  </P> <P> "We're not even in the same stadium," he said.  </P></p>

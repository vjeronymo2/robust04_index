			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Clarke may act over executive pay Shareholders may be given increased powers to curb excessive pay increases for top company executives, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, disclosed in the Commons yesterday. He revealed that the practical issues involved were under examination as the government came under renewed pressure to condemn the 75 per cent rise awarded to Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive. It is understood that the chancellor has had preliminary discussions with Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, about the legislative implications of increasing shareholder power. A Labour attempt to condemn the broken election promises, and the failure to deal with the 'excesses in the privatised utilities' was defeated by a government majority of 46 (312-266) at the end of the six-day debate on the Queen's Speech. Mr Clarke ruled out renewed Labour demands for the imposition of a windfall tax on the excess profits of the privatised utilities, and for executive salaries to be brought within the regulatory regimes which oversee their pricing policies. He said he disapproved of large salary increases in any company which went far beyond what could be deemed reasonable in relation to their performance. The continuing chorus of disapproval about the rewards available to the heads of the privatised utilities dominated the final stages of the debate. Sir Edward Heath updated the phrase he used when, as prime minister, he condemned the activities of Lonrho, by describing Mr Brown's increase as the 'unacceptable post-privatisation face of capitalism'. He added: 'Why do I condemn it? Because it shows he has absolutely no understanding of public relations between his corporation and the public - absolutely none.' Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, also opposed a windfall tax - but called for excess profits to be returned to consumers through rebates. Mr Clarke said he had been able to prepare the Budget against the background of the 'most encouraging set of economic prospects' for many years. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, announced that he was close to reaching an agreement with Labour and other parties to reduce the number of late sittings. He envisaged that debate on some bills would be limited through a voluntary timetable. He also suggested that some debates on backbench motions would be switched to Wednesday mornings to Friday sittings.</p>

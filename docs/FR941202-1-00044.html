OSM notified Utah of the concerns by letter dated August 24, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;967). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah responded by telephone conversation and requested a meeting between the Division and OSM for the purpose of addressing the applicability date issue set forth by OSM in the August 24, 1994, letter. On September 7, 1994, an executive session between the Division and OSM was held at the Western Support Center in Denver, Colorado to discuss the applicability date issue. Notice of the executive session was posted in the Western Support Center (administrative record No. UT&hyph;969). A summary of the executive session was recorded by OSM and entered into the administrative record (administrative record No. UT&hyph;970). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated November 3, 1994, Utah responded to the concerns identified in OSM's August 24, 1994, letter by submitting the revised amendment that is the subject of this notice (administrative record No. UT&hyph;990). The provisions of Utah Admin. R. that Utah proposes to revise and add are: Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200, concerning continuously mined areas; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553 and 553.110 through 553.130, concerning general backfilling and grading requirements; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.510, 553.550, 553.552, 553.611 and 553.612, concerning previously and continuously mined areas; Utah Admin.

R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553&hyph;663 concerning the applicability date of Utah's AOC provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200 by limiting its definition of the term ``continuously mined areas'' to underground mining operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553 by deleting a paragraph that was intended to be a general provision regarding the exceptions approved in the Utah program for complete highwall elimination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

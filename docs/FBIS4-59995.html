			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Lutfi Shatarah report: "Sharp Differences Between Salih </F> and His Military Commanders Over Appointment of 'Abd-Rabbuh  Mansur as Defense Minister"]    [Excerpts] London -- Two weeks after the outbreak of  battles in Yemen between the northern and southern regular  forces, serious indications have appeared on the ground  supporting the southern leaders' claims that the war is not  between the "legitimate forces" and "a group of mutineers from  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]," as claimed by Sanaa, but  rather that it is a fierce war between northern forces supported  by the militias of the Yemeni Reform Grouping led by Shaykh  'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, elements of the outlawed Jihad  Organization, Afghan Arab groups from Sudan and other Arab  states, and Iraqi military experts on the one hand, and southern  forces on the other.    The southern resistance is continuing against the northern  forces trying to breach southern defenses in several areas with  the aim of putting pressure on Aden to force the YSP leaders to  leave the country or surrender, that being the view of President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih who has conveyed to the Arab League  delegation his rejection of any cease-fire initiatives.  [passage omitted]    On the political level, it has been revealed that sharp  differences have emerged between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  and the northern military commanders over the appointment of  'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, a supporter of former south Yemeni  President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, as defense minister. Sources  have confirmed that Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, President  Salih's half-brother, rejected that decision and that a number  of northern military commanders maintained that as they were  fighting southern regular forces, they would not accept a  southern officer's assuming responsibility for the northern  forces, whatever his political position against the southern  leaders.    The sources said that President Salih proposed a compromise  solution to prevent a military mutiny in the current  circumstances, and he agreed to freeze the new minister's powers  until after the war and after settlement of the porblem, but  some northern commanders are pressing for the appointment of  'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar as defense minister. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Muhsin Muhammad Bin-Farid, leader of the Sons of  Yemen League, has stated that the aim of the announcement of the  declaration of principles initiative signed the day before  yesterday by the YSP and the opposition's National Bloc was to  stop the fighting, form a government of national salvation, and  thoroughly investigate who caused the fighting.    He warned that the opposition would stand against any side  which did not respond to the initiative -- in a hint to the  leaders of the General People's Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni  Reform Grouping. He added that Sanaa's rejection of the  initiative left no alternative but the mobilization of all  military, human, and moral resources to make Sanaa understand  that no solution could be imposed by military force and that  there must be a return to reason and to dialogue for the  implementation of the national consensus document.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Bin-Farid added: "We  have our own human resources, intrinsic capabilities, tribal  relations, and the feeling that there is a right which must be  upheld." He emphasized that the opposition devotes all its  resources, big or small, to stopping this mad war. He also  said: "Unity can only continue with the approval of the parties  concerned, not by coercion and armed force. This war has been a  blow to unity. [quotation marks as published]</p>

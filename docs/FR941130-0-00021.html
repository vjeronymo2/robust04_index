An institution that is in the process of converting to stock form that has filed a proposed stock conversion application with the applicable state and federal regulators (or otherwise has initiated a stock conversion) prior to the effective date of this section shall file the required materials with the FDIC as soon as practicable. An insured mutual savings bank chartered by a state that does not require the filing of application materials to convert from mutual to stock form that proposes to convert to the stock form shall notify the FDIC of the proposed conversion and provide the materials requested by the FDIC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Content and filing of notice <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Content of notice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The notice required to be filed under paragraph (a) of this section shall provide a description of the proposed conversion and include a copy of all notices or applications concerning the proposed conversion, including all attachments or appendices thereto, that have been filed with any state and federal banking and/or securities regulators.

The FDIC, in its discretion, may request any additional information it deems necessary to evaluate the proposed conversion and the institution shall provide such information to the FDIC expeditiously. Among the factors to be reviewed by the FDIC are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The use of the proceeds from the sale of stock, as prescribed in the business plan;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The adequacy of the disclosure materials;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The participation of depositors in approving the transaction;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The form of the proxy statement required for the vote of the depositors/members on the conversion;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Any increased compensation and other remuneration (including stock grants, stock option rights and other similar benefits) to be obtained by officers and directors/trustees of the bank in connection with the conversion;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) The adequacy and independence of the appraisal of the value of the mutual savings bank for purposes of determining the price of the shares of stock to be sold;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) The process by which the bank's trustees approved the appraisal, the pricing of the stock and the compensation arrangements for insiders;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) The nature and apportionment of stock subscription rights; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ix) The bank's plans to fulfill its commitment to serving the convenience and needs of its community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In reviewing the materials required to be submitted under this section, the FDIC will take into account the extent to which the proposed conversion conforms with the various provisions of the mutual-to-stock conversion regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision (12 CFR Part 563b), as currently in effect at the time the FDIC reviews the required materials related to the proposed conversion. Any non-conformity with those provisions will be closely scrutinized. Conformity with the OTS requirements, however, will not be sufficient for FDIC regulatory purposes if the FDIC determines that the proposed conversion would pose a risk to the institution's safety and soundness, violate any law or regulation or present a breach of fiduciary duty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notification of completed filing of materials. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The FDIC shall notify the institution when all the required materials related to the proposed conversion have been filed with the FDIC and the notice is thereby complete for purposes of computing the time periods designated in paragraphs (e) and (g) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

At any rate,  the reasons he gave are clearly not enough to resign over. This  is what Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said  today in an interview with Interfax. He did not rule out the  possibility of it simply being an attempt to achieve a  pro-Gaydar government cabinet. [passage omitted]</p>

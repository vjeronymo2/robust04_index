"We look forward to the beginning of these inspections as  soon as possible," said Mike McCurry, spokesman for the State  Department, at a regular news briefing.    The IAEA, a U.N. organization based in Vienna, announced  today that the DPRK has accepted the inspection activities  requested by the IAEA in its seven declared nuclear facilities.    The inspectors will take certain measures, such as reloading  of cameras and changing of seals to facilitate future  verification, the IAEA said in a statement.    The aim of those inspection activities is to verify that the  nuclear material in the facilities has not been diverted since  their earlier inspections, the statement said.    "It is a necessary step for the IAEA to be able to reassure  the international community that there has been no diversion of  nuclear material from that facility," McCurry said.    The spokesman also said that "satisfactory completion of the  inspection at the earliest possible date and resumption of the  North-South dialogue on de-nuclearization will pave the way for  the next round of U.S.-North Korea talks."    A meeting between the U.S. and the DPRK is likely to be held  in New York this week, McCurry added.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Sport: A glimpse of the future - Rugby Union The first half of the rugby season has given us a taste of how the game will work once it becomes a non-stop year-round international sport. Over the past 10 weeks, the Springboks have been in Wales, Scotland and Ireland and Romania and Canada at Twickenham. The international games followed each other rapidly. After next year's Rugby World Cup in South Africa only three countries will definitely pre-qualify for the 1999 finals - the two finalists and the winner of the third place play off (a fourth may also pre-qualify if the host is not one of the first three nations). England may well pre-qualify as hosts but there is a good chance that Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France will have to pre-qualify. The increase in matches will stretch the international rugby calendar throughout a full season. One immediate result of this autumn's proliferation of internationals was to marginalise non-international matches, namely the Varsity Match. The internationals provided some pointers to world cup form. The Springboks are nearly a great side. Against Scotland they were magisterial. They were more fortunate the following week against a fighting Welsh side who have found their pride and commitment again. The Welsh had only one game plan and it did not involve using their three-quarters. Instead Neil Jenkins, at fly half, kept the ball in front of his forwards in the hope that the Springboks would give away penalties. It nearly worked. At least, in Derwyn Jones, the 6ft 10in lock, Wales now know they can win line-out ball at will. It will be interesting to see if Alan Davies, the Welsh coach, changes his one dimensional tactics for the forthcoming Five Nations Championship. For the South Africans, the Barbarian fixture in Dublin, was one game too many. They graciously made five changes to their test team to give all their squad the chance to play and thus revealed that they do not yet have a squad that will win the world cup. Few would disagree that in three of the five critical positions - at full-back hooker and No 8 - they have, the best players in the world: Andre Joubert, Ulrich Schmidt and Rudulf Straeuli. But at both half back positions the jury is out. True, Joost van der Westhuizen, the scrum half, ducked and dived to great effect against Scotland but his passing from the base of the scrum was woeful and this meant that his fly half, Hendrik Le Roux, was rarely ever able to impose his personality on his side's tactics. Almost by error, the South Africans found a game plan based on their emerging back row of Francois Pienaar (an inspirational captain and a public relations dream), Ruben Kruger (the best player on tour) and Straeuli. By their athleticism and presence this trio took games, shook them hard and seized the initiative time and time again. The Springboks looked tired alter the Welsh game. The time has come to move the Barbarians game and follow the example of cricket. Cricket tours start with a soft opener against the Duchess of Norfolk's XI at Arundel. Visiting rugby teams should start with the Barbarian fixture and the gate should go to charity. England easily, if somewhat clumsily, defeated a poor Romania XV and then last week turned the screw against a battling Canadian side. The team is beginning to settle - Simon Shaw, the uncapped Bristol lock, needs a few games in the Five Nations' championships to bed him down ready for the World Cup; Ian Hunter needs to be rehabilitated on the right wing and Mike Catt will one day prove a brilliant deputy for Rob Andrew. In the 1991 Rugby World Cup side, England finally decided that what mattered most on the right wing was that the player would give no tries away and be safe under the high ball. They chose a centre, Simon Halliday to play on the wing. The same thought must be occupying Jack Rowell, the current England coach. He knows that Tony Underwood, who played on the right against Canada, is not up to international rugby but he is unsure - rare for him - of the solution. I suspect Philip de Glanville and Mike Catt will be tried out at some time over the next few months. England have developed an ability to raise their game for big matches. Their 15-a-side approach is how the game is played in New Zealand and Australia and one effect is that the scorelines are much higher. Running rugby involves a greater risk but is much more fun to play and to watch. The Varsity Match was a classic. Cambridge emerged from the tunnel on to the Twickenham turf slowly and deliberately reminiscent of the Scots under David Sole four years ago at Murrayfield when the foe was England and a Grand Slam was at stake. Cambridge played a wonderful game and deserved their win. Naturally, it hurt, being an Oxford Blue, to see Oxford lose. At one time in the second half they looked as though they were going to concede 40 points but rallied and nearly won the match. Cambridge used a tactic I had not seen before. At the maul, their forwards did not pile in blindly hoping that somehow sheer strength would see them through. They kept popping the ball up to the next player coming in. As a consequence they ripped the Oxford defence to shreds. It was compelling to watch. Cambridge showed the northern hemisphere countries, who are fed up with arguing the rights and wrongs of the turn-over law, a way to use it more constructively. The up-coming Five Nations Championship should have been moved to April so the participants could have used it as the final stage of their build up. As it is, the championships serve only to interrupt their preparations. Scotland, unless they can drop Gavin Hastings, do not have a hope and will win the wooden spoon. Ireland and Wales still have to demonstrate that they understand the word variety. England and France again look as though they will fight it out. England have so often been the favourites these past six years, but have won only twice. The probability is that France will emerge as the Five Nations Cup holders for 1995.</p>

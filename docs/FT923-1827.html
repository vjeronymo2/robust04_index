			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hewlett to take one-off charge of Dollars 544m HEWLETT-Packard (HP) is taking a Dollars 544m one-time charge before tax to adopt a revised method of accounting for the cost of medical insurance for retired employees. The accounting change will result in a Dollars 332m after tax reduction in fiscal 1992 earnings. HP is one of several US corporations that have adopted the new rule, set down by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which requires companies to include in their accounts the long-term costs of medical benefits obligations. HP's first-quarter earnings, originally reported as Dollars 306m, or Dollars 1.21 per share, have been restated as losses of Dollars 30m to reflect the charge. Additional 1992 expenses, as a result of the accounting change, will be approximately Dollars 23m pre-tax.</p>

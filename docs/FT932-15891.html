			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Sherwood Group pays Pounds 19.6m for bra maker SHERWOOD GROUP, the Nottingham-based lace, lingerie and socks maker, is extending its acquisition programme to continental Europe with the L47.4bn (Pounds 19.6m) purchase of an Italian bra manufacturer. The deal will be funded by a Pounds 10.7m placing and open offer of shares for cash. At the same time, the company revealed pre-tax profits on continuing operations for 1992 of Pounds 18.2m, an increase of 25 per cent on 1991's Pounds 14.6m. The figures are on the FRS 3 basis. Earnings per share were 11.7p (11p) and a final dividend of 1.7p raises the total by 14 per cent to 2.6p. Turnover improved 22 per cent to Pounds 141m. The acquisition is of 75 per cent of Lepel, a family-run business that stands third in the Italian bra market. The payment will be in two stages: the first L25bn (Pounds 10.3m) will be paid on completion of the deal with the cash raised from the placing and open offer, and the rest will be paid a year later from cash flow. 'Garments will then account for more than 50 per cent of sales, making a better balance between lace and garments,' said Mr David Parker, chairman. The deal will lift net debt from Pounds 25m at the end of 1992 to Pounds 30m at the end of the current year, said Mr Peter Newbold, finance director. He said, however, that gearing would remain at about 45 per cent. The acquisition will immediately enhance earnings. COMMENT At eight times the exit p/e which enhances earnings from year one, Lepel looks like a bargain. But the Italian market is tricky. Firstly, there is black economy competition and the importance of personal contacts. Sherwood has done its best to minimise the risk by leaving the Leporati family with a 25 per cent stake tying them into a five year contract. Secondly, there is a structural change taking place in European clothes retailing. The independent sector, Lepel's strength, is giving way to the chain store, where larger companies excel. Sherwood and Lepel may be able to offset this by venturing into export markets, but investors may want to wait until they see the tie-up working. If it does, profits should climb above Pounds 23m this year putting the shares on a p/e of 11.5. This makes them look cheap and the open offer attractive.</p>

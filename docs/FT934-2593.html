			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / International Company News: Airline alliance closer as booking row ends Canadian Airlines International and American Airlines have settled their dispute with the Gemini computerised reservations system, bringing the two carriers within reach of a long-delayed alliance. With the threatened litigation no longer an issue, the link between American and Canadian now appears virtually assured of being consummated early next year. A Canadian Airlines official said that 'it's down to the final details on Gemini'. Under the proposed alliance, which was first mooted two years ago, American's parent company, AMR, will inject CDollars 246m (USDollars 186.3m) into Canadian in return for a 25 per cent voting interest. A key condition of the deal is that Canadian sever its links with Gemini, and instead join the Sabre reservation system owned by American's parent, AMR Corp. Canadian's attempts to withdraw from Gemini have, up to now, been strongly resisted by the other shareholders, Air Canada and Covia, a unit of United Airlines. They have contended that Gemini would be fatally weakened, leaving Sabre with a virtual monopoly of the Canadian travel market. Mr Paul Nelson, Gemini chief executive, said yesterday many travel agents who use the system had urged it to settle its litigation against Canadian and AMR. The parties have agreed to keep details of the settlement secret. Canadian and Air Canada last month appointed a mediator to help negotiate the terms of dissolving Gemini. The deadline for completion of the talks was extended earlier this week to December 20. Air Canada is expected to drop its objections to Canadian leaving Gemini in exchange for an agreement to rejig the two carriers' international routes. Mr Ben Mikula, analyst at Midland Walwyn in Montreal, predicted that 'there'll be a series of quid pro quos', with Air Canada gaining access to some of Canadian's lucrative trans-Pacific routes, and a rationalisation of the two airlines' trans-Atlantic flights. AMR originally set a December 31 deadline for the deal with Canadian, but numerous delays have forced Canadian to request an extension. The financially-strapped airline also plans to ask governments and creditors for bridging finance.</p>

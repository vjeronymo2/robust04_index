			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Dentsu battered by downturn in advertising sector DENTSU, Japan's largest advertising agency, yesterday unveiled a sharp fall in profits. It blamed the decline on reduced spending on advertising by its clients, who were hit by the country's economic downturn. Advertising spending last year declined for the first time since 1965. Non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the year to the end of March plunged 53.9 per cent to Y15.7bn (Dollars 142.72m) against last year's results. It was Dentsu's second consecutive year of falling profits. Operating revenues fell 9.4 per cent to Y1,165.8bn, the first fall since 1966. Net profits plummeted 59.8 per cent to Y6.2bn. Dentsu, which is unlisted, said newspaper advertising dropped 14.5 per cent, as sectors of the economy which rely on newspaper advertisments - property, finance, automotive, and consumer electronics - were hit by the bursting of the 1980s economic bubble. Revenue from television advertising, which accounts for about 45 per cent of Dentsu's total, fell 5.7 per cent. Industries which use television advertising, including cosmetics and foods, were generally unscathed by the recession. Dentsu's sales in the Tokyo area, which account for nearly 70 per cent of its total, declined 11.1 per cent. For the year ending next March 31, Dentsu forecasts a 3 per cent increase in turnover, to Y1,200bn.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Backers ofEurotunnelrights let off lightly Underwriters to Eurotunnel's Pounds 858m rights issue received final confirmation yesterday that they got off lightly despite the dire stock market conditions and city cynicism that hampered the share price in the offer period. The company announced that 93.4 per cent of the primarily French-owned bearer rights shares were taken up by investors, leaving the underwriters with around Pounds 42m out of the Pounds 640m new bearer shares. Only two thirds of the UK portion was taken up, but the excess, or rump, was successfully placed out to institutions, relieving the underwriters of their obligations. Investors took up 86.9 per cent of the combined total. The higher take-up of the French portion reflected the different underwriting system, whereby investors can only benefit from the rights by either selling or converting them. The 1990 issue had received more than 98 per cent of acceptances, and some brokers suggested the result was slightly disappointing. However, the underwriting syndicate, led by Banque Indosuez and Swiss Bank Corporation, is definitely off the hook. The share price closed 25c higher at FFr24 (Pounds 2.84) in Paris, comfortably above the FFr22.5 rights price, and underwriters should be able to secure buyers for the excess. In addition, underwriters have received more than Pounds 18m in commissions, excluding the substantial advisory and administration fees, so they have been well rewarded for their efforts. With the financing finally over, attention is returning to Eurotunnel's attempts to get all its freight and passenger services up and running. Eurotunnel, which is claiming up to Pounds 1bn in compensation from the railways for their failure to provide adequate rail links to the tunnel, said it may seek compensation for any additional loss of revenues which occurs. The company still hopes to obtain its operating licence for an invitation only car shuttle service by the end of July. A paying service should commence in October, when investors will finally be able to start evaluating the revenue projections put forward by the company, and get a sense of the real worth of its shares.</p>

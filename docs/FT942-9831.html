			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Halkin expects to return to dividend list this year Shareholders in Halkin Holdings, the former Hoskins Brewery recently taken over by Mr Howard Hodgson, the funerals entrepreneur, are likely to receive their first dividend in more than five years by the end of 1994. Mr David Moffat, finance director, said yesterday the group expected to pay a dividend which showed a yield of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent on the shares in December. Yesterday's closing price of 61p, a rise of 2p, would imply a net pay-out of roughly 1.2p. Hoskins Brewery has had a chequered past, with several attempts by discontented shareholders to remove management. Mr Hodgson bought into the company last year, aiming to transform it into a mini-conglomerate. Mr Moffat said the group would pursue acquisitions this year. Halkin revealed its first set of results since the takeover and the Pounds 15m rights issue-funded purchase of two businesses - Ronson, the lighter and household aerosol group; and Clifford, which supplies branded goods to the duty-free market. Both business had met their profits targets of Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 1m respectively. The results, which cover only Hoskins Brewery as the other divisions were bought after the year-end, showed a Pounds 998,000 loss for the nine months to December 31, on sales of Pounds 478,000.</p>

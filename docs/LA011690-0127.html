			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW JUMPS ON BARGAIN HUNTING, CLIMBS 23.25  </P> <P> The stock market pulled out of its recent slide with an afternoon rally today.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 91.30 points in the two previous  sessions, rebounded 23.25 to 2,692.62.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 793 up, 709 down and 463 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 186.07 million shares, against 140.59 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index gained 1.66 to 188.37.  </P> <P> Analysts said blue chips in particular benefited from "bargain hunting" after  their recent decline and better-than-expected auto sales reports for early  January.  </P> <P> Many other stocks, however, remained on the defensive amid recession fears and  worries prompted by weakness in the Japanese stock market.  </P> <P> The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 666.41 points, or 1.8%, to 36,850.36.  On Friday, before a long holiday weekend in Japan, the Nikkei lost 656.36  points.  </P> <P> Analysts said that result heightened concern that rising interest rates and  persistent inflationary pressures might lead to a business slump in many or all  of the industrialized countries.  </P> <P> They also said traders were still trying to assess the financial fallout from  Monday's long-expected filing for bankruptcy protection by Campeau Corp.'s  Federated and Allied retailing operations in the United States.  </P> <P> Bond prices fell in early trading today, reflecting what economists called  worries about inflation and interest rates.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was down 17/32 point, or about  $5.30 per $1,000 in face value, by midday. The bond's yield, which rises when  prices fall, increased to 8.24% from 8.17% on Friday. The government bond  market was closed on Monday for Martin Luther King's birthday.  </P> <P> Analysts said the U.S. credit market was responding partly to the Tokyo bond  market, which experienced a sharp sell-off today amid fears about rising  interest rates.  </P> <P> "With interest rates rising in Tokyo and elsewhere there are heightening  inflation concerns worldwide," said Marshall B. Front, an economist at the  Chicago investment and mutual-fund management firm of Stein Roe &amp; Farnham.  </P> <P> "At this point in the U.S. market, we can't seem to find a level where  investors will commit."  </P> <P> Bond investors fear a rise in inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income  securities such as bonds and notes. An acceleration of inflation could also  prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten credit and encourage higher interest  rates, further depressing bond prices.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills were up to 7.83% as the discount rose 11  basis points to 7.59%. Yields on six-month bills had advanced to 7.91% as the  discount rose 9 basis points to 7.52%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 7.86%  as the discount added 9 basis points to 7.33%.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 8 3/16%, up from 8 1/16% late Friday.  </P></p>

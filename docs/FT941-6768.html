			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (1): Island in transition - Jamaica still beset by old problems as it works towards a modern economy The ideological turmoil that marked Jamaican politics until the early 1980s has gone. Now the country's two political parties fight over the philosophical middle ground. Both support deregulation and liberalisation of the economy. The moves to lower tariffs and end import restrictions are now uncontroversial. In other ways, however, the country's problems remain disturbingly familiar. The economy last year grew at about 1 per cent, barely keeping pace with the population. High inflation has gnawed away at living standards and increased already large disparities between rich and poor. The government of Mr Percival Patterson, the new leader of the People's National Party, forcefully renewed its in a general election last March. One of his government's priorities is, he says, reducing inflation. 'Inflation is the critical issue,' says Mr Omar Davies, the new finance minister, adding that inflation - 30 per cent in 1993, 77 per cent in 1992 - should drop to about 1 per cent a month in a few months. However, the economic and social costs of achieving this will be high. The interest rates in place since the battle against inflation resumed in the middle of last year are having reverberations round the economy, creating stresses for companies and dampening investment. 'It's very difficult to borrow money at 65-70 per cent, invest it and make a return at the end of the day. And if you have spare cash, it makes most sense to put it on deposit and get over 50 per cent,' says Mr Charles Ross, executive director of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica. It has further contributed to weakness in manufacturing. The only area of growth in the manufacturing sector has been that of garment assembly, where finished garments are re-exported to the US under special duty free arrangements. This, combined with a weak market for one of the mainstays of the Jamaican economy, bauxite and alumina, has led to a dramatic increase in the trade deficit - it exceeded Dollars 1bn last year, Mr Davies says. What is, on the face of it, a serious issue for the economy has been offset to some extent by buoyancy in tourism, now the single biggest contributor to foreign exchange earnings. Remittances by Jamaicans abroad are also significant. More Jamaicans live outside the island - particularly in the US  -than the 2.5m who reside there. They contribute an estimated Dollars 250m to Dollars 400m annually to foreign exchange earnings, and help to alleviate the poverty suffered at home. These remittances are part of a large informal economy about which the government knows little and controls less. Unfortunately this includes the thriving business in illegal narcotics. Once an important source of marijuana for the US market, Jamaica is now an big transhipment point for cocaine traffic to the US. This involvement with drugs has eroded traditional family and social ties, particularly in urban Kingston, and has provided one of the few routes out of the ghetto for poor children in the capital, where unemployment can reach 75 per cent. It has contributed to a disturbing rise in violent crime. The ability or willingness of politicians to tackle this issue has been called into question by the links between political parties and criminal gang leaders, particularly in the capital. This impression was reinforced by the appearance of the leader of the opposition Jamaica Labour Party, Mr Edward Seaga, at the funeral of one such gang leader, Mr Jim Brown, in 1992. Mr Patterson has been applauded for his decision to bring in a respected outsider to clean up a police force which has lost most of its credibility in the public eye. But it is still necessary for political representatives of certain constituencies in Kingston to reach an accommodation with gang-leaders. If this has contributed to a distrust of the political system, there has also been dissatisfaction with the results. This has been accepted by politicians who have sought to tackle some of the perceived problems through the first important revision of the 1962 constitution. This, it is envisaged, would lay down a charter of rights, alter the make-up and selection of the senate, and replace Queen Elizabeth II as head of state with an executive president with limited powers. Attempts are also being made to address the issue of electoral reform. The aim is to give the voting system more credibility and to try to eliminate the violence still associated with Jamaican elections; to stop double voting; and to clean up the voting lists. However, that process has been held up by disputes between the two parties about how to handle the issue. The outcome of these political reforms may be to constrain somewhat the virtually untrammelled power of the prime minister in the political system. But it is unlikely to do much, at least in the short-term, to alter the country's two-party system. The differences between the two parties are now more a matter of style and implementation. 'One would have to accept that no longer do the ideological polarities between the two parties exist,' says Mr Patterson. His party, with its roots in populist socialism, still maintains, he says, more of a focus than the opposition on the social consequences of its policies. For his part, Mr Seaga - whose party has shifted its ideology significantly less than the ruling PNP - accuses Mr Patterson of 'leading from behind'. He adds: 'The same policies can be executed properly or poorly.' He makes no apology for his own authoritarian image, saying the country needs strong leadership that is lacking at the moment. Having slapped down a revolt in his party, Mr Seaga looks set to contest the next general election  -which can take place as late as March 1997 but will probably be called a year or so earlier - as leader of the Labour Party. Before then, the government will need to have reduced inflation and restarted growth. Despite the economy's problems, Mr Ross says the economy is quite well poised. 'It's clear that barring a big collapse of the bauxite business or of the tourism industry, the economy is much closer to self-sufficiency than it has been in any time in the last 20 years.' The government may also benefit from a likely recovery in the aluminium market and the continued buoyancy of the US economy, on which Jamaica heavily depends. The term 'Jamerica' has been coined to reflect heavy dependency on the US economy. These close links face a challenge from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada and Mexico. Mr Peter King, ambassador at large on trade matters and chairman of the Textiles and Apparels Institute, says that Nafta means Mexico will gain a competitive advantage over other countries in the region, including Jamaica. 'It doesn't mean that people are closing plants here to move to Mexico, but levels of investment expansion planned for the Caribbean have slowed,' he says. He believes the current US concessions to the Caribbean under the Caribbean Basin Initiative cannot always be taken for granted, and that Jamaica should first press for parity with Nafta and then accession to the treaty. 'My own view is that without parity to this free trade agreement, we would be marginalised. We are not a Switzerland that can sit in the middle of Europe.' The question is whether Jamaica goes it alone or attempts to join Nafta as part of Caricom (Caribbean Community and Common Market). Caricom currently appears divided on the issue, with some countries concerned that the concessions under the Lome agreements with the European Union will be threatened by Nafta. Mr King says: 'If we can't do it with Caricom, we should go on our own.'</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOUR DE FRANCE;  </P> <P> BARTEAU IS FIRST IN 13TH STAGE  </P> <P> While France celebrated its Bicentennial, the winner of the 13th stage of the  Tour de France thought of an American, Greg LeMond, as he stood on the victory  stand Friday.  </P> <P> "I want to dedicate this victory to my friend, Greg LeMond; because of him I am  still riding," Vincent Barteau said after winning the 110-mile leg from  Montpellier to Marseille.  </P> <P> Another Frenchman, Laurent Fignon, and LeMond clung to the top two spots in the  overall standings.  </P> <P> LeMond remains seven seconds behind Fignon as the pack rested before  encountering the mountains today.  </P> <P> Barteau won by 45 seconds over another Frenchman, Jean-Claude Colotti, with  Martial Gayant, also of France, third.  </P> <P> Barteau was timed in 4 hours 17 minutes 31 seconds for the distance. Colotti  was 45 seconds back.  </P> <P> LeMond, the 1986 winner, and Barteau are good friends, and LeMond encouraged  and supported Barteau during some bleak periods.  </P> <P> "A lot of people thought I was finished," Barteau said. "But with a lot of  encouragement I came back."  </P> <P> Barteau once held the leader's yellow jersey for almost two weeks in 1984  before falling apart in the Alps. He has gone from team to team since.  </P> <P> The next stage of the 2,020-mile race, which ends in Paris July 23, goes from  Marseille to Gap with four climbs.  </P> <P> Two-time champion Jeannie Longo of France took the overall lead in the women's  Tour de France as American Bunki Bankaitis-Davis won the third stage, along a  36-mile route from Martigues to Marseille.  </P> <P> Olympic champion Monique Knol of the Netherlands, the previous leader, plunged  in the standings and is 19th, 1 minute 28 seconds behind.  </P> <P> Bankaitis-Davis was timed in 1 hour 20 minutes 7 seconds. She finished five  seconds ahead of Longo, who went into the overall lead by 13 seconds.  </P></p>

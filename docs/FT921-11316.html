			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Letter: No attempt to stop merger Sir, Your report, 'A shake-out for S African banking' (January 30), on the ABSA merger mentions market rumours to the effect that Standard Bank Investment Corporation, through the South African Reserve Bank, tried to have the merger stopped. We can categorically state that SBIC has at no time approached the Reserve Bank or the Competition Board (or, indeed, any other body) to interfere with the planned merger. Such action would not square with our frequently stated view that rationalisation within the South African banking and financial services industry is desirable to the extent that operating efficiencies, competitiveness and standards of service, nationally and internationally, are thereby enhanced. Henri de Villiers, chairman, Standard Bank Investment Corporation, Standard Bank Centre, 5 Simmonds Street, Johannesburg 2001, South Africa</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> Ruben Kocharian's paintings are dense, detail-packed still lifes and pictures  of everyday life. Rich with the descriptive texture of blistered paint, papery  onion skins and crisply folded cloth, these genre scenes have a closely  observed intensity. Yet the way the paint thickens up to mimic the subject's  texture frequently knocks the images back into unreality as the artifice of the  illusion is blatantly underscored.  </P> <P> Kocharian further emphasizes painting's illusionistic tricks by cramming as  much into a shallow picture plane as possible. Scenes like the verdant "Lily  Pond" seem about to pour from the surface of the canvas as leaves, water and  vegetation expand into every square inch of pictorial space. Less congested  still life images have an equally compressed vitality despite the torpidity of  the carefully arranged fruits and vegetables. Frequently, as in "Pomegranate,"  the background color is so strong it seems to bump against the fruit in a mad  rush to be out front. In "Against the Wall," the texture of the background vies  with the potted plant hung from it for primacy in the picture's shallow space.  </P> <P> Kocharian's paintings are so quiet about the way they deconstruct elements of  representational painting it's easy to overlook some of the painterly  commentary. But in "Buddha" we get some help. The flattened space and the way  the picture traditionally functions as a window is deftly summed up by the  silent statue sitting on a window ledge. And of course the painting is being  displayed inside the gallery's front window. (Heritage Gallery, 718 N. La  Cienega Blvd., to April 22.)SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

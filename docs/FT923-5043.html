			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Mixed marks for home work: Is teleworking is the future, or merely the fantasy of futurists? THE announcement that managers and professional staff at British Telecommunications are to be allowed to apply to work from home must have left many commuters wondering this week how they managed to miss the revolution that makes 'teleworking' so apparently straightforward. BT says the agreement it has reached with the managers' union, the Society of Telecom Executives, could mean up to 8,000 employees becoming eligible for the homeworking scheme. The company would continue to provide the same pay and benefits to those who chose to work from home, as well as meeting extra heating and telephone costs. From the employee's point of view working from home brings obvious benefits, such as extra flexibility in hours and the elimination of travelling time. For the employer there is the prospect of cutting office overheads and seeing productivity increase. The teleworking revolution has clearly yet to happen. A handful of companies, particularly those in the new technology field such as CPS, the ICL software subsidiary, have a largely home-based workforce. Others have introduced teleworking on an ad hoc basis to retain particular employees, or are experimenting with small groups of workers. British Airways has just finished a six-month trial with a dozen employees in its information management department. The Department of Employment says there are no authoritative figures for teleworking. The first indication of how widespread it is will be available in about three months. The latest estimates, now more than 10 years old, showed between 1.6 per cent and 2.6 per cent of the working population work from home. Those figures cover every home worker, from the piece-worker who hand-finishes garments to the management consultant. If any company is able to operate large-scale teleworking it ought to be BT, with its access to the latest technology. It is also in BT's interests to lead by example and stimulate sales of the telecommunications hardware and services that make teleworking possible. So it is surprising that fewer than 50 managers or professionals out of BT's workforce of more than 200,000 work principally from home. There has been a steady stream of BT publications and surveys extolling the virtues of teleworking. The latest, The Economics of Teleworking, concluded that productivity per worker increased by about 45 per cent when the switch was made to working at home. It also argued national savings could be made through lower commuting bills, fewer road accidents and less pollution. The question is whether the teleworking revolution will ever take place  - or remain a fantasy of futurists. Mr Andrew Wilson, a researcher for Sussex University's Institute of Manpower Studies, considers it is 'unlikely that there will be a wholesale substitution of the workplace from the office to the home'. In a report called Teleworking - Flexibility for a Few, he envisages a future in which employees divide their time between the two locations. He says: 'In this way, the distinction between 'home worker' and 'office worker' will become less relevant as more and more people become accustomed to carrying out part of their work outside the main office.' Mr Wilson identifies a number of potential constraints on the wholesale development of teleworking, among them the unwillingness of organisations to alter their management techniques radically. He points out that in the traditional office 'most managers tend to supervise their staff by direct observation and monitoring'. He adds: 'Managers are able to set tasks, prescribe objectives, monitor feedback and assess performance with an immediacy that is not possible with remote workers.' Teleworking, on the other hand, demands more formalised management procedures and may require an increase in the management time devoted to each employee. The study quotes research into one of the longest-standing teleworking operations, at FI Group, a software developer. This research apparently revealed that each manager at the company supervised fewer than half the number of staff managed by counterparts in other British software companies. The lack of visibility also has an effect on employees. The dangers of individuals becoming lonely, and feeling deprived of the social advantages of working with other people, are easy to imagine. According to the Henley Centre for Forecasting only about half of employees would want to work from home, even if their jobs allowed for it.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TELEWORKING ADVANTAGES FOR COMPANIES Scores out of five  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Increased efficiency                         4.1 Increased productivity                       4.0 Cost savings                                 3.7 Relocation                                   2.2 To avoid redundancies                        2.1 Problems finding suitable staff              2.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Gallup  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES Scores out of five  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Total       Employed       Self-employed  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Convenience                   4.3          3.8              4.4 Flexible hours                4.1          3.8              4.2 Not having to travel or       3.7          3.0              3.9 commute Cost saving                   3.5          3.0              3.7 A better lifestyle            3.4          3.2              3.4 Improved productivity         3.2          3.3              3.2 Base                          250           64              186  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Gallup  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

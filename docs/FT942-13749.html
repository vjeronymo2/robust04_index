			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Victory for the coalition's pragmatists: There are plenty more tremors to come in the continuing realignment of Japanese politics The storms of the past fortnight have blown fresh air into the fusty backrooms of Japanese politics. For the first time in many years, the Japanese electorate has been treated to the sight of political leaders having a highly publicised debate on two of the most fundamental matters for any nation state, tax and foreign affairs. 'It has been truly healthy and refreshing. We do not often see much press coverage given to policy cleavages. It has been educational for the public and for politicians themselves,' says Mr Takashi Inoguchi, professor of politics at Tokyo University. This contrasts with the days of the Liberal Democratic party, which until it was ousted last summer held power for 38 years, when ideological differences were mostly suppressed to present a stable - but in the end fossilised - public image. An accord among senior coalition officials on policy matters came in the early hours of yesterday thanks to a last-minute compromise by the Social Democratic party on a proposed rise in indirect taxation. That brings an end to the power struggle started by the resignation of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa as prime minister and opens the way for Mr Tsutomu Hata, his deputy, to take over after adoption by parliament on Monday. The resurgence of policy debate in Japanese politics is all the more striking because it appeared notably absent in the first moves of the post-Hosokawa power struggle. Initially, the coalition started to split roughly between the SDP-led left, and the right led by Mr Ichiro Ozawa, backroom strategist of the influential Japan Renewal party. In the first week after Mr Hosokawa's resignation, each camp schemed to attract defectors from the LDP, in the hope of forming the cores of rival coalitions. It was, remarked some analysts, reminiscent of the old-style LDP factional battles in which Mr Ozawa specialised in his years with that party. At one moment, it looked as if the right would succeed in a Machiavellian ploy to woo Mr Michio Watanabe, a 70-year-old LDP faction leader, to bring his supporters to the Ozawa camp, in return for the leadership. In the event, Mr Watanabe failed to attract anything like enough defectors to guarantee a majority for the Ozawa camp. Mr Watanabe's fading chances proved to both halves of the coalition that neither of them could win enough seats in parliament to dominate the other. Pragmatically, they gave up trying to outmanoeuvre each other and instead settled down last weekend to discuss how to work together again, with a JRP-inspired joint policy platform. Both Mr Ozawa and Mr Hata felt that this kind of advance accord was needed to defuse the rows which paralysed the Hosokawa administration. The SDP, however, faced an unwelcome proposition. It had to accept the JRP-led right wing's foreign and tax policy to stay in power, at the risk of offending its already dwindling electorate. That meant being drawn into the centre-right, so abandoning party tradition. It is no surprise that it took 27 coalition meetings in the past 15 days to persuade the socialists to accept terms. Mr Ozawa was in a tough mood, hoping to provoke splits among LDP and socialist members all the way along the line, recalls one coalition official. To make it harder, coalition members were breaking new ground. Very few Japanese governments have ever attempted to hammer out a common policy before taking office, preferring instead to make policy case by case, says Mr Jesper Koll, chief economist at SG Warburg Securities in Toyko. The nearest recent precedent is the policy pact struck last July by the members of the Hosokawa coalition, before taking office. Yet that was vague by comparison with yesterday's accords. In theory, this painstakingly constructed policy accord should make Mr Hata's government more stable than Mr Hosokawa's, even though the new cabinet line-ups will be similar to the fractious old one. 'This is a victory for the pragmatists in the coalition ..So Mr Hata may surprise us with a more efficient government, that wants to promote change and still co-operate with the bureaucracy,' says Mr Koll. Yet in practice, this change of government is only a step in the continuing realignment of Japanese politics, caused by the gradual break-up of the traditional parties of government and opposition, the LDP and SDP. The general trend appears to be towards the formation of two or three loose groupings, the coalition's left and right plus the LDP, but not all the players have yet decided which of the new-look teams they want to join. The SDP may soon split as a result of its leaders' decision to cave in to Mr Ozawa's forces. The opportunity for the extreme left, up to a fifth of its members of parliament, to leave could be the cabinet decision on a permanent cut in income tax and a rise in indirect taxation, required in June, in time for the Group of Seven summit in Naples, the following month. 'The tax issue is not resolved. It's simply consensus by ambiguity,' says Mr Inoguchi. The LDP, by contrast, appears to be eroding rather than breaking up, now that Mr Watanabe has returned to the fold. Nevertheless, the post-Hosokawa storm has flushed out 13 defectors, 12 of whom have formed two small pro-coalition parties. As a result, a record 11 parties are now represented in parliament, most of them too small to hold the balance of power. Japan's unstable political landscape can expect plenty more tremors before it settles into a more permanent shape.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             JAPANESE PARLIAMENT  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total seats: 511  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PRO-COALITION            INDEPENDENTS          OPPOSITION  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Social Democratic                              Liberal Democratic party               74    Liberal party  7     party                206  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Japan Renewal                                  Japan Communist party               62    Others        10     party                 15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Clean Government party               52                         Amibition Group        3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Japan news party    37  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Democratic socialist party     19  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- New Harbinger party               15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- New Future party     5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Reform group         4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

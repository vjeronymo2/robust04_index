			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Provident Financial ahead 40% to Pounds 30.7m Provident Financial, the personal loan and consumer finance group, yesterday reported a 40 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 21.9m to Pounds 30.7m. The dividend is raised by 37 per cent to 6.5p. The aim is that this should represent one third and the final dividend two thirds of the total for the year. Almost all the profits increase came from the home collected credit business, where the pre-tax outcome for the six months to June 30 rose 39 per cent to Pounds 27.9m (Pounds 20.1m). There was a 12 per cent increase in the amount of credit issued, reflecting a rise of about 6 per cent in the number of customers, which reached 1.1m, and a higher average loan at between Pounds 300 and Pounds 400. The group's central costs fell from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 2.6m. The home collection credit business saw a further reduction in the number of offices to 257, against 267 at the year-end, and a further cut of 46 in the number of staff to 3,404. By contrast, the self-employed sales force increased by 170 to about 8,000. They deal mainly with tenants on council estates and act as agents collecting payments from borrowers' homes for the unsecured loans offered by the group. Mr John van Kuffeler, chief executive, said the group was committed to a continuing programme of cost reduction. The charge for bad debts rose by 4 per cent - a higher absolute amount than in the first half of 1993, but a lower proportion of the amount of credit issued. The insurance division reported a 4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 5.3m), which came almost entirely from Provident Insurance, the underwriting operation. It specialises in areas of the market where competition from direct writers has not been so fierce, such as third party insurance. Colonnade Insurance Brokers broke even; it made Pounds 528,000 last time. COMMENT Not for the first time, Provident Financial has produced better-than-expected results. Now that it has had a full year of benefits from getting out of non-core businesses and stringent cost-cutting, the question must be whether this progress can be continued. The growth in loans is encouraging, but the scope for further reductions in costs must narrow eventually, slowing increases in profitability. Full-year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 80m would give it a prospective p/e of about 13.5. The business is moving in the right direction, but after a good run since the end of June the price looks about right.</p>

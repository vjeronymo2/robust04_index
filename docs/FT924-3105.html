			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (5): Handicaps that are hard to overcome - Bernard Simon looks at the competitive weaknesses of the country's companies THE slump in consumer demand and the longer jobless queues which have marked the present recession are arguably the least worrying part of Canada's economic problems. While the business cycle is expected to turn gradually upward during 1993, Canadian companies will still be hobbled by more fundamental handi- caps which, without corrective action, could keep living standards on the skids for years to come. These structural weaknesses - which include inadequate research and development, poor worker training, advers- arial industrial relations, high taxes and inter-provincial trade barriers - have come to be lumped under the heading of 'competitiveness'. Professor Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School concluded in a report commissioned by the federal government last year that evidence, ranging from a weak base in machinery exports to high foreign ownership of Canadian industry, points to 'an economy that shows lim- ited signs of upgrading, and suggests that productivity growth - the critical driver of prosperity - may be increas- ingly difficult to achieve.' Views along the same lines have been aired ad nauseam in recent years. But concerted action to correct Canada's competitive handicaps has so far proved elusive. Dr Sylvia Ostry, chairman of the Centre for International Studies at the University of Toronto, noted in a recent speech that 'there seems to be in this country virtually no recognition in the general public and among many polit- icians of the need for a furnace to generate the 'warmth' for this kinder, gentler country to survive the wintry blasts of global competition.' Mr Michael Bloom, a researcher at the Conference Board of Canada in Ottawa, puts some of the blame on a difference in attitude between Canadians and Americans. While Americans aggressively strive for excellence, their northern neighbours put greater emphasis on equity and equality. As Mr Bloom notes, Canada has no Harvard or Sorbonne among its universities. Instead, Ottawa and the prov- inces spend a large chunk of their budgets to ensure that uniform services, which meet 'national standards', are accessible throughout the world's second biggest country. Concern about Canada's eroding competitiveness is increasingly homing in on the country's schools and univers- ities. At first glance, Canada should have one of the world's finest education systems. No government in the industrial world spends more on a pupil's pre-matriculation educ- ation. Teachers' salaries are 40 per cent higher on average in Canada than the US. But Statistics Canada has estimated that some 28 per cent of Canada-born people, aged 16-24, are functionally illiterate and over 40 per cent are innumerate. Canadian students come near the bottom of the list among OECD coun- tries in science and mathem- atics skills. Enrolment in post- secondary engineering and applied science courses has tumbled since the mid-1980s. The list of possible explan- ations for this poor record is a long one. Canadian univers- ities have an ultra-short academic year, with students normally starting classes in mid-September and writing their exams by the end of April. School teachers enjoy the protection of a strong union movement, while many university lecturers are coddled by a system of permanent tenure. In any case, Mr Bloom notes that many teachers are forced to spend more of their time in the classroom these days on social issues - such as Aids and drugs counselling, and violence in schools - at the expense of the academic syllabus. Concern for equity and equality can conflict with pursuit of excellence. For instance, the municipality of Ottawa-Carleton has six different school boards, catering for French-speaking and English-speaking children from Protestant and Catholic backgrounds. No fewer than four departments in the Ontario provincial government have responsibility for some aspect of education. Among the top priorities of the education reform movement is a drive towards national testing. The hope is that a comparison of the achievements of pupils from schools across the country will be a powerful spur to improving academic standards. The provinces conducted a limited trial test of literacy and numeracy skills last June. The plan is to broaden the test to cover about 20,000 pupils at the end of the 1992/93 school year. Sceptics question however, whether such products of negotiation and compromise are radical enough to give government, business and workers the jolt they need. Canada's best hope of improving its competitiveness, they contend, is more likely to come from sharp external shocks, such as North American free trade, or another crunch in the natural resource markets on which the country has always depended for growth in the past.</p>

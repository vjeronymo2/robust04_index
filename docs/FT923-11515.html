			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Amstrad loss may reach Pounds 65m LOSSES AT Amstrad, the UK consumer electronics group caught by a sharp deterioration in the personal computer market, are likely to have reached Pounds 65m in the year to June 30. The group, launched and still piloted by Mr Alan Sugar, said pre-tax losses would be about Pounds 25m more than the market expectations which range around Pounds 40m. Amstrad said the additional losses were the result of erosion of prices in the personal computer market and higher-than-expected restructuring costs. Inventory reduction and restructuring have, however, increased Amstrad's net cash to Pounds 100m from Pounds 60m at the end of June 1991. The announcement was initially greeted by a sharp fall in the Amstrad share price. But the shares bounced to close down only 1p at 29p as the increased cash balance was seen as underpinning the shares and limiting further price falls. The statement made no comment, however, about the final dividend which analysts say remains seriously in doubt. 'The best hope is that they will pay the final dividend but it is entirely at the whim of the chairman,' one analyst said. 'It is not justified by earnings or profits and only marginally by cash flow.' A spokesman for the group said the increased losses did not include any provision for further price reductions in the personal computer market. Nonetheless, the group was 'well poised now' to compete in a market that has turned into a bloodbath as a result of competitors like IBM and Compaq hitting back at computer clone producers like Amstrad. Compaq, the US company, revealed on Wednesday a 43 per cent jump in second quarter net income, providing evidence that a new policy of competing with clones on price rather than features was paying dividends. Analysts believe the provisions and stock liquidation will have been enough to return Amstrad to profits in the current year ending June 1993. While the increased loss was not entirely unexpected, given the all too evident depth of high street discounting, the increased cash pile has increased the quality of net assets.</p>

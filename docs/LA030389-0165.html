			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: WILSON FETE DELAYED BY TOWER BATTLE  </P> <P> Due to his detainment in Washington to participate in the debate on John  Tower's nomination for defense secretary, Sen. Pete Wilson's "Special Evening  in Orange County to Retire the 1988 Debt" has been postponed until Sunday.  </P> <P> The two-part gala fund-raiser, originally planned for last night, will be held  at the Emerald Bay homes of builders Jim and Al Baldwin. A $250 per-person  cocktail bash will be staged at Jim and Nancy Baldwin's granite-smothered manse  at 4:30 p.m. At 7 p.m., just a few doors away, Deeann and Al Baldwin will host  the $1,000-per-person sit-down dinner.  </P> <P> On the pricey menu (besides dreams of Wilson someday becoming governor of  California): romaine lettuce with mandarin orange sections, almonds, avocado,  mushrooms and poppy seed dressing; grilled herb bread; filet mignon with  rosemary-laced cognac sauce and chicken breast with tarragon sauce; wild rice  pancakes and a dessert to campaign for -- flambe of bananas and oranges with  Grand Marnier, all spilled over vanilla ice cream and crepes.  </P> <P> The benefit for Wilson was the hot topic at a recent party in the Laguna Beach  area. "It's interesting to me that the fund-raiser is being staged in the heart  of Ueberroth country," said one guest, referring to the fact that Baseball  Commissioner Peter Ueberroth resides in Emerald Bay. "Wonder if Ueberroth will  run for governor," asked another. "If he does, I'll vote for him," said one  Emerald Bay resident. "I think he's going to wait four years," ventured  another. "Well, I'd say his time has come," said another.  </P> <P> On Wilson's Emerald Bay benefit committee: George Argyros, Donald Koll, Kathryn  Thompson, Michael Parker, William Lyon, John Lusk, Donald Bren, Gavin Herbert  and Gene Autry.  </P> <P> How sweet it is: The Irvine Co. has offered restaurateur Rex Chandler a cool $2  million to open a nightclub-version of his ultra-popular The Rex restaurant --  one of Donald Bren's favorite hangouts -- at Newport Center Fashion Island.  Chandler will serve up an additional one million and the eatery-cum-dance floor  (with live entertainment) will open sometime next year. Earlier this week,  Chandler said he plans to hang onto the existing Rex, located near the Newport  Pier. "But we'll give it a new name and make it more casual," he said.  </P> <P> Would he miss its romantic ocean view? "The new place will have an incredible  view," Chandler said. "It will be built on the second story and during the day  guests will be able to see Newport Bay and at night, city lights. At our  present spot, there is no night-time view." The boyish-looking Chandler began  his restaurant career in Hawaii where he operated the Rex and Nick's Fish  Market in the Waikiki Beach area.  </P> <P> Taking Manhattan: There were only smiles at Dan Camp's going away party on  Tuesday night at the Newport Beach home of good friends Scott and Mary Lou  Hornsby. "But I'm sort of laughing on the outside and crying on the inside,"  whispered one guest. Camp, the extremely affable manager of the Four Seasons  Hotel in Newport Beach for the past 2 1/2 years, has been named managing  director of the Carlyle Hotel in New York. "The hotel where Nancy Reagan is  checking in tomorrow night," said Camp, who added he was sad to be leaving so  many good Orange County friends but "pretty excited about the Carlyle."  </P> <P> Among guests toasting Camp's good fortune (the Carlyle, Camp said, has the  highest repeat patronage of any hotel in Manhattan and its only Mobile Five  Star rating) were Mary and James Roosevelt, who frequently dine at the Pavilion  restaurant at the Four Seasons; Maruja and Dr. George Hodges (who plan to hole  up at the Carlyle and hang out at its famous Bemelman's bar in September); Bill  Voit (of rubber company fame); Ileane and Nick Doolin; Susan and Kevin Consey,  director of the Newport Harbor Art Museum; Maria Crutcher; Sandra Brodie; Dori  and Jack deKruif; and Paul and Virginia Knott Bender.  </P></p>

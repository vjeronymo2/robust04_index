			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Council elections -- In a digest item in last week's Westside section,  supporters of an initiative drive to change City Council elections in Santa  Monica from at-large to districts incorrectly decribed the options for  incumbent Councilman Herb Katz, if the initiative is successful. In 1992, Katz  will either have to move into one of the four districts up for election or sit  out until 1994 when the Sunset Park district in which he currently lives is up  for election.  </P></p>

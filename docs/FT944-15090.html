			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Two Europeans die in Algeria Gunmen burst into an oil camp in eastern Algeria on Tuesday night and killed the only two Europeans there, officials and diplomats said yesterday, The deaths of the two men, a Frenchman and an Italian, bring to at least 66 the number of foreigners killed in civil strife between Moslem fundamentalists and the army-dominated authorities. In Rome, the Italian foreign ministry said a Somali was also killed at the camp near Tebessa, operated by Sonatrach, the Algerian state oil company. But in Algiers, an Italian embassy spokesman said he could not confirm this. The two Europeans worked for Schlumberger, a French company, which named the Frenchman as Philippe Hetet, 36, and the Italian as Mauro dell'Angelo, 30.</p>

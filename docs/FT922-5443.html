			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Tough-talking Ross Perot rides into Sin City SODOM and Gomorrah, also known as Washington, DC, and the plusher suburbs of Maryland and Virginia, were still standing yesterday, but it was a close run thing. For Ross Perot had ridden into town for a quick check on the new ranch he intends to buy next year and declared he just plumb didn't like some of the 'thangs' going on around town, apart, of course, from the sidewalk mob of wide-eyed believers outside his down-home new office jus' a couple of blocks from the big white building on Pennsylvania Avenue. The man who lives there now, George Bush, was out west in cactus land grubbing for votes, as was the man who thinks he ought to move in, Bill Clinton. The big wheel up on Capitol Hill, Danny 'the taxman' Rostenkowski, was going justifiably nuclear about charges that he had fiddled the House of Representatives' post office. There was a clear field and there would have to be changes, Ross Perot told his new television celebrity friends, Barbara Walters and Jesse Jackson; no gays and adulterers sullying his cabinet, and he didn't think much of homosexuals in the military either; no more third-rate justices like Clarence Thomas messing up the Supreme Court; no more taxes either, unless earmarked for education. Actually, a lot of Washington was doing what it normally does in moments of supreme crisis - watching its local football quarterback on the professional golf tour in a Maryland suburb and the Indigo Girls' open-air concert in Virginia. It was left to the wife of a decent amateur golfer to take on the invader. What Ross Perot is up to, proclaimed Marilyn Quayle, whose husband's job is under threat from the little man from Texas, 'is really not the American way'. You just cannot buy the presidency and then rule, she said at dawn yesterday. Not that Ross Perot was sticking around much, leaving for Orlando to talk by satellite to supporters in five far-flung states before moving on by terrestrial transport to a barbecue he has paid for in Arkansas. That is where Bill Clinton usually lives and where chicken farming is very big. In any case, he does not need to come to Washington to find out what is wrong with it, as a surprising number of the city's movers and shakers have taken to going to Dallas to tell him. Of course some of them would rather fancy a job in a Perot administration. They include Pat Choate, whose recent book charges that Japan has bought Washington lock, stock and sake barrel; Jude Wanniski, supply-side polemicist; Lloyd Cutler, Democratic lawyer-fixer; John Steinbruner, from the Brookings Institution, the foreign policy think tank; William Seidman, Republican banking expert; Felix Rohatyn, the financier; and Jesse Jackson, who is everywhere. And, of course, there is Vicki Bagley, local socialite and property whiz-turned-publisher, who came north many years ago with Jimmy Carter. 'I'll do anything for him, scrub floors, bring chick-en, make posters,' she told the Washington Post. Well, at least Ross Perot won't starve if he ever takes up residence in Sin City.</p>

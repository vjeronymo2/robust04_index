			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Traders hope the first cut is the deepest - New York Wall Street may discover this week that it is more pleasant to fret over the inevitable than to deal with its consequences. After months of hand-wringing by market observers over the timing of a move to tighter money, the Federal Reserve finally acted on Friday. In announcing the move to tighter credit conditions, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, made good on his word. Earlier in the week he told a congressional committee that the central bank would have to adjust its policy to stamp out incipient inflationary pressures in the economy. The timing was somewhat of a surprise, however, as was the extent of the damage to stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average limped into the weekend after its worst single-day battering since November 15 1991. The bellwether blue-chip index tumbled 96 points, or 2.4 per cent, to 3,871.42, led by the hasty retreat of interest-sensitive financial and utility issues. The good news is that few analysts expect to see stocks fall as sharply this week. 'The first cut is always the deepest,' says Mr James Solloway, chief investment analyst at Argus Research in New York. With plenty of bargains on offer today, the Dow index may bounce back. The bad news is that most expect a weak trend over the next month or two, as the euphoria that has gripped the market since the new year unwinds. Wall Street has worried about a shift in policy because stocks have thrived over the past three years in the rarefied atmosphere of Fed accommodation. In that time, funds have flooded into equities as investors sought higher returns than other financial instruments could offer. Cheap money has also made stocks attractive because it has helped lift the earnings potential of American companies, which have taken advantage of low rates to reduce debt and buy new equipment. The question is whether a move to tighter money will finally rein in the long-running bull market, or at least trigger a 5 per cent to 7 per cent correction, as many analysts have predicted after Friday's developments. A conclusive answer is months away, but many analysts believe the key lies in how soon the Fed tightens again and by how much. 'This is the end of the beginning,' says Mr David Shulman, chief investment strategist at Salomon Brothers, 'not the beginning of the end.' When the Fed acts again depends on economic data still in the pipeline. In the meantime, trading is expected in a narrow range. The 4,000 barrier appears a more formidable barrier than just a week ago. 'The market may go down a bit more in the next week or two, but then we'll sit tight for a while before waiting for these questions about inflation to be resolved,' says Mr Bill Dodge, an investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds. The picture may clear somewhat this Friday, when the Commerce Department releases the January producer price index.</p>

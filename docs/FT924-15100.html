			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inco to cut nickel output in response to falling prices INCO, the western world's biggest nickel producer, is to cut output by 40m pounds over the next 12 months in response to the unremitting decline in world metal prices. The Toronto-based company yesterday outlined a number of measures which will reduce production of finished nickel to about 380m pounds in 1993 and reduce its capital spending by USDollars 50m. But Inco asserted that it has no intention of losing market share, which amounts to between a quarter and a third of western production. The company said it will continue to satisfy all customers' requirements. The cutbacks, which are less severe than some earlier rumours had suggested, stem partly from a fall in stainless steel production, which accounts for more than half of nickel consumption. In addition, nickel prices have been put under pressure by a sharp increase in Russian exports. Inco's cutbacks will be most heavily felt by high-cost operations in Canada. The austerity measures include an indefinite postponement of the planned reopening of the Shebandowan mine in north-west Ontario, which was due to take place later this month. The company's Sudbury mines will be closed for three weeks over Christmas and the smelter there will operate at a 'much reducted' rate. Similar shutdowns will take place at Thompson, Manitoba, and at Port Colbourne, Ontario. Both the Ontario and Manitoba divisions will also take a four-week vacation during the summer of 1993. The nickel refinery at Clydach, Wales, will switch from two lines to one line to accommodate the reduced feed of raw material from Canada. Executive salaries and directors' fees are being cut by 10 per cent and a hiring freeze will be put in place as part of a wide-ranging effort to reduce costs. Inco's share price dropped 12 cents on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday to close at CDollars 28.63. The announcement of cutbacks was made after the market closed.</p>

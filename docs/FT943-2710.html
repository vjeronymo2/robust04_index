			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / The Long View: Clarke's pre-emptive strike A new chapter of interest rate mythology was created this week with the first moderate, apparently unforced rise in sterling interest rates, after a period of stability, that anyone can remember. Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, strutted the stage on Monday, perfecting his heroic role as the far-sighted finance minister making a pre-emptive strike against the still distant but increasingly discernable ogre of rising inflation. Interest rate changes are still an excuse for drama - although the Government Broker no longer stands on a bench in the stock exchange and rings a bell. Only ghosts from the past threatened to spoil things. We are presently cursed (or blessed?) by ex-chancellors with nothing very much to do and no cabinet confidentiality to inhibit them. Norman Lamont and Nigel Lawson promptly seized their chance to burst into the newspapers with warnings that rates would soon have to be raised further. Certainly, the circumstances of the increase were a whole lot more dignified than those of the typical rises in the past when chancellors were often forced into action by bond market collapses and foreign exchange panics. Broken, too, has been the rule of asymmetry that rates rise in whole percentage points - even two, sometimes - but decline gently in halves and quarters. Is that break with tradition a good thing? Lying behind the old rule was the wisdom that finance ministers have to be forced into taking politically unpleasant steps. Not that rises in interest rates ought necessarily be unpopular politically. Pensioners with a pile of building society passbooks in their cupboards positively love them. Rising interest rates should be viewed as the normal and uncontroversial consequence of a strong economy. But the view from Westminster, under pressure from the industrial and housing lobbies, is different. Hence the worry that anything that chancellors do voluntarily on interest rates is unlikely to be sufficient. So, we must look critically at the Treasury's suggestion that, in conditions of strong economic growth, a half-point rise in interest rates is adequate to ensure that 'we take no risks with inflation'. For the British public, the domestic emphasis here is, no doubt, well-judged politically. It is more logical, however, to fit the increase into a global pattern in which US dollar interest rates have been rising for some time and some rates in Europe - in Sweden and Italy, for instance - have gone up already. Sterling's exchange rate has been easing gently this year on a trade-weighted basis. Meanwhile, it costs the British government much more than those of the US and Germany to borrow through the bond markets (by a margin of up to 1 1/2 percentage points) even though inflation in the UK has been lower than in those countries for the past two years and is quite likely to remain lower - certainly than in the US and possibly than in Germany, where monetary growth has been excessive. Britain's inflationary past still imposes a price; so there was a need to send out a message of prudence. In itself, though, a half-point rise in rates is trivial, apart from its impact on sentiment. In this connection, the Halifax building society was extremely unwise to be so hostile to the threatened rise a week ago. It should have said that a moderate increase, in the context of a strong economy, would pose no threat to house prices. As it is, some buyers may now be discouraged unnecessarily. In the 1980s, however, mortgage rates were often much higher than they are now, without plunging the housing market into decline. The housing market has problems, but the cost of mortgages is not yet one of them. Will sterling benefit? A strong currency reduces imported inflation from rising commodity prices. Sterling has indeed risen a little this week. But the Italian and Swedish currencies have lost much of what they gained from the August interest rate increases. And consider the impact of the collapse this year of the gap between US and German short-term interest rates from over 3 per cent to about  1/4 per cent. Such a relative shift, which was expected widely, was supposed to make the dollar attractive at the beginning of the year, according to widespread opinion in the markets. That has turned out to be quite wrong: in fact, the D-Mark has risen by 13 per cent against the dollar so far in 1994. Two of this year's strongest currencies, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, have the lowest interest rates. You cannot strengthen the currency by raising short-term interest rates; but if you have a strong currency, you can cut them. If this sounds odd, remember that much of the money flowing around the world today travels through the securities markets: we have long-term hot money, if that is not an oxymoron, rather than the overwhelmingly short-term money market flows of the 1960s and 1970s. Note that the bond market interest rate differential has actually shifted in Germany's favour this year by nearly 1/2 per cent, the opposite to what has happened in the short-term markets. As for the UK, the sterling 10-year bond interest rate has jumped by 2 1/2 percentage points this year but there have been no newspaper headlines and no industrial lobbyists have besieged the Treasury on the subject. Clarke does not pretend to set the bond yield as he pretends to set the short-term interest rate. So, are short-term interest rates irrelevant? Not quite, but it took very large rises late in the 1980s to choke off the boom. Lawson added a cool 6 1/2 points in under a year and his successor, John Major, one more point on top for luck. The rises burst the housing market bubble and deflated the consumer boom. The Halifax certainly had reason to be worried then. As the Chinese say, and Lawson knows, the longest journey begins with a single step. But, so far, this is just a gentle stroll.</p>

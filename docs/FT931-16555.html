			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Arts: Diaghilev gems staged in Monaco - Les Ballets de Monte Carlo It was rather like time-travelling. There, at the week-end, in Charles Garnier's ravishing little opera house in Monaco, were four gems from the Diaghilev repertory that had first seen this stage during the palmy years of the Ballets Russes. Whatever the architectural changes in the principality since Diaghilev's time - and the Opera House and the Casino, the Hotel de Paris and the Hermitage, seem the last bastions of the wedding-cake style that used to gleam everywhere in the sunlight - Monte Carlo is a shrine for ballet-goers, its name linked to some of the grandest dance achievements. (During the 1930s the very title was part of an incantation - Les Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo - that attracted audiences world-wide). The Russian connection is slightly older than this century, and the shades of Grand Dukes and jewel-hung ballerinas haunt the theatre - and the casino. It was to Monaco's credit in the early, golden years of Diaghilev's enterprise, before the war swept away the Dukes and the diamonds, that the theatre should have provided a first home for the Ballets Russes; in 1922 Monte Carlo offered a permanent base for Diaghilev's troupe at a time of financial crisis, and thereafter the balletic connection was to remain potent. It is fitting, then, that today's Ballets de Monte Carlo should cast a backward glance at those prodigious years with a programme of Diaghilev works: Les Sylphides, Firebird, L'Apres-midi d'un faune, and Le Spectre de la rose, which had its very first performance at the Opera House. The stagings, as I saw them on Saturday and Sunday, were careful, albeit differing in certain accretions and emendations from the texts we know here (which are owed to members of Diaghilev's troupe, and which I find preferable). They have been decently mounted, and their scores sounded very well indeed from the Orchestre Philharmonique de Monte Carlo under David Garforth's baton. In matter of dancing, performances were for the most part dutiful rather than inspired. Among the women soloists, Joelle Boulogne offered a delicacy of means which was most pleasing in Les Sylphides and for the Young Girl in Spectre - here was dancing fine-boned, fine-textured  - and Claire Bayliss was very apt as the sylphide of the little waltz, the dance sitting sweetly on the music. As the Tsarevich in Firebird I admired both Jose Cruz-Martinez and Nicholas Musin (who was also seen as Nijinsky's Faun). Yet throughout the programme, a vital element seemed lacking: some link with an interpretative past, which is the life-blood of the old repertory. Ballets survive not just by the careful transmission of steps, but through an imaginative contact with their performance history. Coaching in roles, that handing on of a playing tradition, is essential if today's casts are to succeed in these masterpieces. The Monte Carlo dancers, able, gifted, looked somehow uncertain dealing with the nuances of style that will keep such museum pieces alive in the theatre. That they can do so is not in doubt: Monte Carlo's ballet owes this debt to the history of its theatre and of dancing in this marvellous setting.</p>

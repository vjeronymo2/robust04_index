			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Boots beats forecasts with 19% advance: Shares helped by 12% dividend increase - Debts transformed into net cash Boots yesterday shrugged off problems at its pharmaceuticals and DIY businesses to beat the best City forecasts with a 19 per cent increase in underlying profits. After exceptional charges of Pounds 68.5m, relating mainly to withdrawal of the Manoplax heart drug and restructuring of the Do It All DIY joint venture, pre-tax profits increased 2.6 per cent from Pounds 405.2m to Pounds 415.9m. Before the charges, pre-tax profits were Pounds 484.4m - some Pounds 20m higher than consensus forecasts - on turnover which increased 5.2 per cent to Pounds 4.17bn. Buoyed by a proposed final dividend of 10.1p, lifting the total pay-out 12 per cent to 15p, the shares gained 22p to 527p. Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said Boots was reaping the benefits of developing its own brand and vertical integration. A higher proportion of own-label sales helped Boots the Chemists again to lift its operating margin - from 10.7 per cent to 11.5 per cent - with operating profits increasing from Pounds 285m to Pounds 322.9m. Boots Contract Manufacturing, the cosmetics and healthcare business which sells almost two-thirds of its output to Boots the Chemists, in turn raised profits nearly a quarter to Pounds 16.2m. Own-label sales were also growing at Halfords and Boots Opticians, which both lifted profits, and at Children's World and Do It All which reduced their losses. Boots and partners WH Smith are selling 100 Do It All stores, reducing the chain to 140. The prescription drugs business, Boots Pharmaceuticals, raised profits from Pounds 91.4m to Pounds 94.2m in spite of the failure of Manoplax, but Sir James said the strategic review of the business was continuing. He confirmed that a merchant bank was assessing merger and sale opportunites. 'This is a complex process and we won't be rushed,' he said. 'All options remain open. The only thing that has been ruled out is carrying on as we are.' Boots Healthcare International, the over-the-counter drugs division, more than doubled operating profits to Pounds 6.6m. Sir James is keen to expand Healthcare International through acquisitions and has the cash to do so. Boots transformed Pounds 203.8m debts into net cash of Pounds 69m - before Pounds 94m proceeds from the sale last week of Farleys baby foods to HJ Heinz - in spite of record capital spending of Pounds 224m. Much of that went on the retail businesses, with Boots the Chemists adding 48 smaller stores. Boots Properties raised profits by almost a quarter to Pounds 67.1m. Earnings per share, after exceptional items, increased from 27p to 27.7p. Lex, Page 18</p>

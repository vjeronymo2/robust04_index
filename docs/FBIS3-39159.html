			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Irfan Sapmaz and Selin Caglayan: "Aliyev Will </F> Seek a Security Guarantee From Turkey"]    [Text] President Geydar Aliyev, a former member of the USSR  Politbureau, arrived in Ankara yesterday. He will be seeking a  security guarantee against Moscow. Aliyev has been in power in  Azerbaijan for 100 days. He wants to use his visit, which  follows recent Azerbaijani victories on the battlefronts in the  Caucasus, to convey the message to the Azerbaijani people that  "former President Elchibey's era in Azerbaijan has ended and a  new chapter will be opened between Ankara and Baku."  <H5>  Warning to Opponents </H5>   Ankara wants to use the visit to end the chill between  Turkey  and Azerbaijan by removing the Turkish people's negative views  of Aliyev and the conviction that "Azerbaijan cannot exist  without Elchibey." Ankara wants to use the visit to convey to  the Azerbaijani people and to Moscow that it supports Aliyev.    Ankara knows Aliyev has a reputation as someone who is  supported by Moscow. But he is also known to have resisted  Russia during the past few months. Considering that, Ankara  will try to ease Aliyev's anxiety over the extent of the support  Turkey is prepared to give him.    President Demirel has said that Ankara is prepared to  provide  the support Azerbaijan needs. Demirel tried to ensure that  Aliyev was warmly welcomed in Turkey. He disregarded the new  rules on protocol and met his guest at Esenboga Airport.  Replying to an Azerbaijani correspondent's question, Demirel  said: "We embrace the person who represents Azerbaijan. We  embrace Azerbaijan when we embrace Aliyev. Azerbaijan has a  very special place in Turkey's heart."  <H5>  Security Is Aliyev's Main Problem </H5>   Turkey and Azerbaijan will sign 15 agreements during  Aliyev's  visit. This means that all the agreements signed when Abulfaz  Elchibey was in power in Azerbaijan will be signed again.  Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov has said that the two sides will  discuss Azerbaijan's problems with Russia. He stressed: "There  is nothing we wish to conceal from Turkey."    Gasanov said that the memorandum to be signed between the  two  sides will also include provisions on issues relating to  security.</p>

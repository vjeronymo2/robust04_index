			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / BSN changes name to Danone BSN, France's largest food group, is changing its name to Danone, its leading yoghurt brand, and has unveiled several international deals, including the FFr1.9bn (Pounds 223m) acquisition of San Miguel, one of Spain's largest brewers. Mr Antoine Riboud, chairman, said the change of name to Danone, the company's strongest brand, would help the group expand internationally, particularly into non-European markets. Mr Riboud also announced a string of investments and acquisitions, including the purchase of San Miguel, one of Spain's five largest brewers, with sales last year of Pta38bn (Pounds 186m). BSN already holds 24 per cent of the Spanish brewer and will increase its stake to 100 per cent over the next four years. BSN is to set up a joint venture in Russia, Danone-Volga, to produce yoghurts and dairy produce. It is investing about FFr20m and will take an 80 per cent stake in the new company. In Brazil, BSN is to pay an estimated FFr200m for 49 per cent of Campineira de Alimentos, Brazil's second largest biscuit manufacturer, and in Morocco it will pay about FFr100m for a 2.7 per cent stake in ONA, the private sector food group. Mr Riboud hopes that non-European sales will amount to half of total sales within 20 years, from about 9 per cent at present. Background, Page 31</p>

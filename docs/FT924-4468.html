			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Cadbury's code IT WAS appropriate that the final version of the Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate governance should have been published on the same day as Trafalgar House disclosed that its after-tax results for 1990-91 had been rearranged to show a loss of Pounds 99.4m instead of the originally claimed profit of Pounds 44.9m, while receivers were appointed to Rosehaugh, famous exploiter of murky off-balance sheet financing. In important areas of accounting and reporting the sins of the past are being exposed and the impetus of self-regulation is being restored. The emphasis of the Cadbury report is that these advances should be consolidated by establishing a more formalised and consistent board structure embracing chairman, executive and non-executive directors. Since the first draft was published last May the recommendations on non-executives have been refined: there must be a minimum of three such directors, a majority of them independent. Companies must state whether they have applied the Code of Best Practice, and justify any departures from it. But the available sanctions are scant; in practice, any shortcomings in governance will be corrected by a company's shareholders or not at all. The determination of institutional shareholders to enforce the code may therefore decide the ultimate success of this approach. The whole emphasis on non-executive directors largely reflects the unwillingness of fund managers to take a direct proprietorial role. One doubt is whether enough non-executives 'of calibre' can be found. Another is whether they will be backed in practice by the institutions: the latter are now recommended to disclose their policies on the use of voting rights, but this does not go far enough. The ability of entrepreneurs to flourish in such an environment must also be questionable. Many of them look to a board for loyal support and encouragement rather than for criticism and policing. However, at least the Cadbury approach allows for more flexibility in such cases than would a statutory definition of roles. The Cadbury committee's code marks an important advance in that it will force directors to think clearly about their roles and responsibilities. Whether in the long run it will adequately fill the proprietorial gap which has resulted from the growth of impersonal institutional share ownership is more doubtful.</p>

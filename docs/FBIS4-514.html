			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by G. van Oudtshoorn] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 12 SAPA -- South Africa was on  the brink of becoming southern Africa's newest "basket case  banana republic", the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance  Movement -- AWB] said on Tuesday [12 April]. The AWB's finance  committee said in a statement it was not surprised by the  collapse of the financial and commercial rand as the AWB had  predicted this in a statement several weeks ago.    "It is significant that the sale of Kruger Rands has  increased by 1,000 per cent over the past few months. This has  been caused by the liberals of big business, despite their  apparent communist sympathies, suddenly taking fright at the  policies which they have been propagating all along," the  statement said.    "They simply preach one thing and practise another. The  flight of capital out of this country is horrendous. We now  predict a further fall in the Rand [R], both financial and  commercial, as we slip deeper into the financial abyss."    The AWB said that with debts of R209 billion, South Africa  was on the verge of becoming "another third world (if not a `no  world') tin pot banana republic, ignored and laughed at by the  civilised world".    The Boer people had to "get rid of this government and once  again make our fatherland a home for our children. If this does  not happen, our children will suffer a fate too ghastly to  contemplate".</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Moving targets The gilts market has long since given up assuming the government would live up to its commitment to a balanced budget over the economic cycle. Accordingly, it is unlikely to be perturbed to learn that the government itself is now having second thoughts. Thanks partly to the weak equity market, there has so far been little difficulty financing a PSBR which this year will be well over Pounds 30bn. Nonetheless, the Treasury faces a delicate task in communicating the change of heart to the outside world. One danger is that spending ministers will conclude that the purse strings are about to be loosened, making the autumn spending round all the harder. Another is that financial markets will interpret the dropped target as a sign of flagging resolve. Sterling as well as the gilts market could then suffer at a time when the dwindling prospects for economic growth mean the PSBR is rising as a proportion of GDP. The budget forecast was for a deficit of 4.5 per cent this year and 4.75 per cent next. The figures now look more likely to be around 5.5 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. This is well below the double-digit deficits of the 1970s, but the PSBR still requires careful handling. The government would be greatly helped by a 'yes' vote in next month's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. If ERM stability is threatened by a 'no' vote, the fiscal screws may have to be tightened further, whatever long-term fiscal target is by then in place.</p>

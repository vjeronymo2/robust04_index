			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 15 (CNA) -- Both government officials  and entrepreneurs on Tuesday [15 march] expressed their concern  about the negative influence Taiwan's joining the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) might have on domestic  industries.    They did, however, agree that Taiwan's gaining entry into  the  Geneva-based world trade regulating body was "a must."    The points of view were expressed in a symposium organized  to  discuss the impact GATT membership will have on Taiwan and  countermeasures Taiwan can take to protect itself from the  opening of its market to foreign competition.    Taiwan, which was admitted as a GATT observer in September  1992, is expected to become a full member by the end of this  year.    The meeting was cosponsored by Chinatrust Commercial Bank  and  the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.    Jeffrey Koo, the chairman of both the bank and the  institute,  urged the government to make cautious assessments before  substantially opening the domestic financial sector to  foreigners. "The government must take into account the scope of  the domestic market and the financial sector's adjustment  problems," he said.    Hsueh Chi, vice chairman of the cabinet-level Council for  Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), noted that financial  liberalization has paved the way for Taiwan's economic  development.    Between 2000 and 2005, he forecast, Taiwan's GATT membership  would help push up annual foreign trade by 15 to 20 percent and  annual growth of the gross national product by 1 to 2 percent.  Taiwan's foreign trade totaled about US$160 billion last year,  while the GNP was NT [New Taiwan] $5.61 trillion (US$212  billion).    Hsueh, however, conceded that the gains would inevitably be  at the expense of certain industries.    Liu Kuo-chao, president of the Taiwan Electric Appliance  Manufacturers Association, pointed out that the electric  appliance sector will certainly be affected by the change of  rules in government procurement caused by Taiwan's accession to  GATT.    As a large part of demand for engineering, computers, and  telecommunications comes from the government's major  construction projects, the three sectors will be adversely  affected, Liu explained.    To cope with the possible impact on the domestic food  industry, Huang Nan-tu, president of the Wei Chuan Group, called  for coordinated efforts among domestic manufacturers. "We  should work together in a new effort to tap foreign markets,  thereby ushering in a new era," he said.    Chen Sheng-tien, chairman of the Shampo Group, suggested  that  the government take a step-by-step approach to lower tariffs in  order to minimize the negative impact GATT would have on  domestic industries.</p>

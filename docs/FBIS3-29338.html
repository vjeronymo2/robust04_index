The Malaysian soldiers would need the  weapons to defend themselves against any retaliation from the  Serbs, he said.    The cabinet, at its weekly meeting Wednesday, decided to ask  NATO to supply Malaysian soldiers arms similar to that used by  its troops if NATO attacks the Serbian aggressors, he told  reporters here. We will ask NATO to supply weapons similar to  that its soldiers have, and we will make the request as soon as  possible, he said.    Nevetheless, Dr. Mahathir was doubtful whether NATO would  launch any attack against thc Serbs who had stepped up their  strikes recently against the people of Bosnia. We do not believe  that NATO will attack. It only says it wants to attack, he  said. Replying to a question whether Malaysian troops would  continue to defend themselves if tha war prolonged, he said: we  have to consider whether we get assistance from those who have  the capability. So far we have not been notified by NATO whether  it wants to assist or not. He said Malaysia also requested the  United Nations to withdraw the arms sanctions on the people of  Bosnia to enable them to defend themselves.    Dr. Mahathir said the government had no plans to increase  the  number of its soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina because the  existing number, about 1,500, was determined by the United  Nations.</p>

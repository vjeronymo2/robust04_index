			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Up and down the Misery Index The 'Misery Index', which adds the unemployment rate, expressed in percentage terms, to the rate of inflation, fell last year because of the drop in inflation from 9 per cent in January to 4.5 per cent in December 1991. It has been on the increase this year because of a steady rise in unemployment, from 9.2 per cent in January to 9.9 per cent in August. However, falls in inflation since May have helped to keep it down in recent months.</p>

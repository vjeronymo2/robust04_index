			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / High cost of baksheesh Just as he was beginning to get a grip on the conduct of our affairs, Mr John Major had to go and mess it up. One minute he was the new John Major, confident, in command, of well-modulated voice and upright mien; the next he was the familiar old John Major, improvising in a crisis, fumbling, blustering, cornered, on the run. The new PM, on display in Belfast last week, glowed with that special authority that comes from experience, survival, and, over Ulster, possible success. He looked as if he might well vanquish Mr Tony Blair, the young man who has come from nowhere to lead the Labour party. The old PM, back in the House of Commons this week, dangled and danced on the political stage, once again the puppet of events. It is enough to bring tears to your eyes. It is not Mr Major's fault that by the time he became prime minister four years ago his party had already won too many elections in a row for the country's good. As we have seen in Japan and Italy, parties that govern for too long turn corrupt. The cases are different: the known and alleged instances of greedy or careless acceptance of favours or cash by British elected officials are, by comparison with what has been reported in Italy, Japan, France and elsewhere, picayune affairs in which reputations have been lost, and offices forfeited, for the smallest of small change. Nor is it certain that every would-be purchaser of British government influence has received value for money. For honourable as some of them affect to be, not all Britain's Conservatives accord proper respect to the principles of baksheesh. The word, derived from the Persian 'to give', implies a return of something to the giver. Some of our cheapskates take the bribe, but fail to deliver the goods. That appears to be the essence of Mr Mohamed Fayed's highly publicised series of complaints against various Tory MPs and ministers. If so, the Egyptian-born financier is not wholly correct. There is prima facie evidence to suggest that other large-scale contributors to Conservative funds have received whatever dividends the discreet use of patronage or influence can provide. The chairman of Harrods ought to have appreciated that you can always trust the word of a Tory gentleman, if you have a receipt. This is not to aver that an absence of probity is a Conservative monopoly. It was the Liberals under Lloyd George who introduced modern marketing methods to the sale of peerages and honours. Past Labour governments have harboured villains of one sort or another. Certain Labour local councils are notoriously rotten. If the next government to be elected in Britain is a Labour one, and if it remains in office for two or more terms, then as sure as Lord Acton walked this earth, the continuous exercise of power will turn the heads of some of even the saintly Mr Tony Blair's blessed colleagues. That said, it is the Conservatives who have been running the government since 1979. The ministers, MPs and party associates who have fallen from office, or come under suspicion, or squirmed under the pointing fingers of their accusers are all, to a man, Tories. What the prime minister terms 'public disquiet about standards of public life', is not that; it is public disquiet about standards of Conservative life. The Tories are perceived to be the source of connections, influence, trading in favours, the worship of money - the living embodiment of the excesses of the 1980s. In the report of Labour's Commission on Social Justice, published on Monday, there is a reference to a phrase used by an American economist, Robert Kuttner, to wit 'every business relationship is a one night stand'. So, it would appear, are many contemporary Tory political-business relationships. Everyone can see that. The accumulation of news about quick one-night stands, be they at the Ritz in Paris or in a Commons bar, has severely damaged the government. Nobody trusts the Tories any more. Last Friday it was argued here, as elsewhere, that if Mr Major is to regain the confidence of the electorate in the good faith of his government he must make it his overriding purpose to do so. He must understand the depth of mistrust, and respond accordingly. In this he has failed. He has in fact done the minimum possible, and that as camouflage. An all-party committee that will sit under Lord Nolan will draw up rules for the future behaviour of holders of public office, but it will not investigate existing charges; nor will it ever inquire into what individuals may have done. Some files have been assessed by Sir Robin Butler, the secretary to the cabinet. Sir Robin has many excellent qualities, but he is not an inquisitor, and he does his business in private. Hearings will be held by the parliamentary committee of privileges, but Labour, rightly, insists that it should sit in public. Mr Major says this would be against precedent; so is the establishment of the Nolan committee. He says open inquiries would be contrary to natural justice; as Mr Blair said yesterday, courts operate in public. Justice must be seen to be done. In any case, Mr Major's concern for natural justice is limited by political expediency. He has retained two ministers against whom various allegations were deemed by Sir Robin to be 'unsubstantiated' but dismissed one, Mr Neil Hamilton. I hold no brief for Mr Hamilton, but Mr Major's treatment of him is, to put it politely, inconsistent. Yesterday a new report appeared, in which Mr Jonathan Aitken was accused by The Guardian newspaper of lying to Sir Robin about a hotel bill. Mr Aitken has denied this, and Sir Robin has backed him up. The denials of such people, it is intimated, must be taken on trust. Very well. But are we to take on trust the findings of the Nolan committee if it is not to investigate the finances of political parties? Mr Major has resisted this; another dodge. Mr Blair, whose sweetly reasonable approach is not always a match for the prime minister's street-fighting, should not let this one go. Dubious money flows to parties, and notably the Conservative party, as well as to individual politicians. If Lord Nolan is as sharp now as he was on the bench he will interpret his terms of reference to include the consequences of political donations from suspect sources. Fate continues to play cat-and-mouse with Mr Major.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (9): Prime minister rose rapidly on political ladder - Profile: Ranil Wickremesinghe COLOMBO Postal District 7 is an area of elegant colonial mansions and tree-lined avenues. Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka's prime minister since May, is seen as very much a product of the 'Colombo 7 set' and - as a nephew of former President J. R. Jaywardene - a part of the country's political establishment, writes Kieran Cooke. But few doubt the considerable talents of the prime minister. Aged only 44, Mr Wickremesinghe has had a fast rise up the political ladder. There are considerable risks involved in achieving high office. 'We have to take security precautions all the time,' says Mr Wickremesinghe. 'But I never thought of following any other career.' Mr Wickremesinghe's father, who ran Sri Lanka's biggest newspaper group, was a Christian. His mother was a Buddhist. The prime minister's uncle is an Anglican bishop. Former President Premadasa, a man of humble origins, was deeply suspicious of the traditional political establishment. But Mr Wickremesinghe survived and prospered during the former president's time, mainly due to his ability, as then minister of industries, to push through much-needed economic reforms. 'We are continuing with Premadasa's policies. There might be a certain change of style; that's inevitable. The opposition accuses us of being elitist. But there are more people in business now than at any time in the past. The opposition talks about socialism but we have introduced real socialism by giving people enough to eat and raising living standards.' Mr Wickremesinghe says that despite opposition from some unions, the government will continue with its privatisation policy. 'Union fears are without foundation. We are going about the process slowly and carefully. But I've no doubt that before too long we'll have more efficient, largely privately-run enterprises.' A lawyer, Mr Wickremesinghe became an MP when he was only 28 and subsequently served as deputy minister of foreign affairs. Despite the assassinations of both President Premadasa and the leader of an opposition party earlier this year, Mr Wickremesinghe says there is political stability in Sri Lanka. 'We have a mature political culture. Premadasa's assassination was a test and we got through it without any major problems.' But the war against Tamil separatists in the north and east of the country is the main issue. There have been indications that the new administration wants to take a harder line on the problem than Mr Premadasa. 'I don't think policy has changed. We have always said we are willing to negotiate but it seems the LTTE (The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the main separatist group) only responds to pressure. We are not closing the door to talks but the orders to the army remain the same: to eliminate terrorism and ensure that more and more areas are under government control.'</p>

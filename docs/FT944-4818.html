			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / BT challenges Sprint alliance British Telecom, the UK's principal telephone operator, yesterday asked the US Federal Communications Commission to withhold regulatory approval of an alliance between a large US operator and French and German telephone groups. It complained that the French and German markets were neither liberalised nor effectively regulated and that the alliance - called Atlas and involving Sprint, the US's third largest carrier, together with state-owned France Telecom and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom - should not receive approval until equivalence was reached with the US and UK, the world's most liberated telecoms markets. Atlas's aim is to provide telecoms facilities to large multinational companies. BT is already active in this market through an alliance with MCI, the second largest US long-distance carrier, called Concert. Sprint and its allies had argued that, in the wake of the BT/MCI approval, the regulatory process for Atlas could be foreshortened. BT also asked the FCC to look at European alliances involving AT&amp;T of the US and state-owned companies from Switzerland and the Netherlands.</p>

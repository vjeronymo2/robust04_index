			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ANSWER TO GOMPERS SCHOOL PROBLEMS EVADES BOARD  </P> <P> San Diego city schools trustees remain at a loss over how to move the troubled  Gompers Secondary School toward stability.  </P> <P> There was no clear consensus among the five board members Tuesday about how to  respond to the final report from a district-appointed community-school  committee that listed severe discipline problems, high teacher turnover, a  collapsing integration program and haphazard curriculum improvements, despite a  much-publicized renewal plan put into effect two years ago.  </P> <P> Trustees Kay Davis and Jim Roache called for some action by schools Supt. Tom  Payzant to institute consistent student discipline, which the report described  as nearly out of control at times in the junior-high portion of the  seventh-through-12th grade math-science-computer magnet school in Southeast San  Diego.  </P> <P> "If true, there is no way to educate any child without having stability and  law-abiding (procedures) on any school campus," Roache said.  </P> <P> Trustee Shirley Weber debated colleague Ann Armstrong over whether the 53% drop  in the number of white students choosing to be bused voluntarily to Gompers for  the magnet program represents a severe blow to the district's integration  program.  </P> <P> Although Armstrong called the statistics disappointing, Weber asserted that the  school was never really integrated because the white students were largely  segregated in magnet classes that most of the largely nonwhite neighborhood  students did not share. The renewal plan was set up to address demands of  neighborhood parents that their children be given equal access to the  high-powered curriculum.  </P> <P> Weber also called for "less microscopic examination" of every problem at  Gompers, saying that no school would shine if put under similar scrutiny. But  Davis responded that, "whether under a microscope or not, we've lost the  interest of a lot of (whites) and we've got to work now on anchoring down the  decorum" of the junior high students.  </P> <P> Franklin Orfield, retired Superior Court judge who chaired the committee, asked  trustees to take the criticisms seriously, but he also praised principal Marie  Thornton, who has been severely attacked by some Gompers teachers and parents  for a lack of leadership and vision. "It's time to affirm complete confidence  in Mrs. Thornton," Orfield said, adding his belief that the media have  exaggerated Thornton's role in Gompers' problems.  </P> <P> But parent Tom Kaye, who chaired one of the subcommittees, said he probably  would transfer his daughter from Gompers. "There is extreme frustration that  things haven't stabilized . . . and it's hard for me to say that things have  even bottomed out and are going to get better."  </P> <P> Payzant promised a reply to the committee report in September.  </P></p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Label printing side behind Tinsley Robor's Pounds 0.58m loss TINSLEY ROBOR, the special-ist printing and packaging company, continued to run up losses in the second six months of 1991-92 and is omitting the dividend for the year. Shares in the company remained unchanged at 8p. Wace, the pre-press group, has a 19.7 per cent stake in Tinsley - the acquisition of which is still being investigated by the DTI. Mr John Rose, TR's chairman, said: 'It is not a brake on the group.' He pointed out, nonetheless, that it was 'a great disappointment to have to report unsatisfactory results again'. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 335,000 for 1990-91 turned into losses of Pounds 581,000 for the year to end-March and were struck on turnover slightly down from Pounds 24.2m to Pounds 23.5m. However, Mr Rose added that second-half turnover of Pounds 12.7m was up on the first half's Pounds 10.8m. Second-half losses were cut from Pounds 398,000 to Pounds 183,000, from which he drew comfort. Mr Rose said that Howards Printers, the label printing company, was the main source of group losses in both halves. But he felt that the business was worth keeping, 'in the best interests of shareholders', because he was confident that 'what has been done in the past 18 months will bear fruit'. He was not too concerned by the Pounds 6.7m borrowings (giving gearing of 77 per cent) at the year-end. Interest payable fell to Pounds 860,000 (Pounds 1m). The group's main market continues to be the music industry. However, Mr Rose thought it likely that the current year would be the last that Tinsley would produce record sleeves 'in any material quantity', though they carry more value per unit than CDs and cassettes. The group increased its share in the growing CD market, and its variously packaged formats. Volumes in the music industry generally declined 5 per cent in the January to March quarter. On the commercial side, where a large proportion of the work is promotional, 'many customers had delayed or scrapped projects', Mr Rose said. Losses per share were 2.4p (earnings 0.9p). Last year Tinsley paid a total dividend of 1p via a final of 0.25p.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Taiwan party stands firm Taiwan's ruling nationalist party, the Kuomintang, did better than expected in local government elections at the weekend, although its share of popular vote fell below 50 per cent for the first time, writes Dennis Engbarth in Taipei. The elections, which had been seen as a test of the party's strength following internal dissension and corruption scandals, appeared to bolster the position of President Lee Teng-hui, who has led the island's democratic reforms. The Kuomintang held on to 13 county and city mayoral posts - the same number as it had previously held. Candidates backed by the opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP) won six posts, a net loss of one seat.</p>

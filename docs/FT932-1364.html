			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Carmakers told to learn from Japanese FAILURE TO absorb lessons from Japanese carmakers in the UK could lead to the demise of many small and medium-sized suppliers to the vehicle industry, Mr George Simpson, chairman of Rover, told MPs yesterday. He said that the Japanese companies' entry into the market had had a big effect on upgrading the quality and productivity performance of some larger companies in the UK motor and components industry. However, unless the big components companies passed on the lessons learned from their Japanese customers, many suppliers could disappear, Mr Simpson told the Commons trade and industry committee. The committee is inquiring into the competitiveness of UK manufacturing in-dustry. The 'important role' which the larger companies had to play in passing on their skills derived from the widespread restructuring going on in the industry. Most carmakers had sharply reduced the number of their direct component suppliers, Mr Simpson said. Smaller and medium-sized companies were becoming suppliers to the larger 'first-tier' component groups.</p>

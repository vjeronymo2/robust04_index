			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Cao Yuhe (2580 3768 0735) and Wang Baoan (3769 </F> 0202 1344): "Nearly 1,000 Shanghai Scientific and Technological  Personnel Make Joint Efforts to Tackle Key Problems,  Meticulously Develop 600,000 kw-Capacity Nuclear Power Station,  Complete 60 Percent of the Projects Whose Key Problems Need To  Be Tackled, and Obtain Orders Worth Over 500 million Yuan From  Both Home and Abroad"]    [Text] At present, nearly 1,000 scientific and  technological workers in the municipality are making vigorous  efforts to develop new materials and new equipment for a 600,000  kw-capacity nuclear power station. According to statistics,  they successfully tackled key problems of 20 important  scientific and technological projects last year; coupled with  the 34 projects completed over the previous four years, they  have completed 60 percent of the total projects whose key  problems need to be tackled and have obtained orders worth 570  million yuan from both home and abroad for Shanghai so far.    China has determined the 600,000 kw-capacity nuclear power  station as the standard type of reactor to be built for a  considerable period of time to come. The second phase project  of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station will build a 600,000  kw-capacity nuclear power station. Shanghai undertook the task  to develop most of the new materials and new equipment for it.  The municipal office responsible for tackling key scientific  and technological problems of major industries listed 89  projects whose key scientific and technological problems need to  be tackled. They involve many branches of learning, such as  machine-building, electronics, metallurgy, chemical industry,  instrument and meter, and so forth. More than 40 scientific  research institutes, universities and colleges, factories, and  enterprises have won the bids through public biddings. To date,  the outlays committed by the state to tackling key scientific  and technological problems have reached over 13 million yuan.    Zirconium alloy, which is touted as "the number one metal of  the atomic age," has been successfully developed by the Shanghai  Nonferrous Metal Materials Research Institute. The magnet wire  coil and wire indicatrix for indicating the position of a rod to  be installed in the drive mechanism for the control rod of a  600,000 kw-capacity nuclear power facility are required to be  able to resist heat 50 percent more than the same materials of a  300,000 kw- capacity nuclear power station are capable of. A  task force headed by Senior Engineer Ling Chunhua of the  Shanghai Electric Cable Research Institute succeeded in  developing such materials after three years of research.    The successful tackling of many key scientific and  technological problems is a result of concerted efforts by  scientific research institutes, universities and colleges,  factories, and enterprises. The Shanghai Instrument and Meter  Elastic Component Factory fulfilled the task of conducting  research in stainless steel pipe with multiple corrugations to  be used for the return circuit valve in a nuclear power station  under cooperation with the Applied Mathematics Research  Institute, Mechanics Research Institute, and Bellows Research  Center of the Shanghai Engineering University. As a result,  China becomes a nation exporting such equipment, instead of  importing it. The Shanghai Power Station Package Equipment  Research Institute assisted the Shanghai Turbine Factory to  carry out an important renovation of the two-tier high pressure  cylinder for a nuclear turbine, thereby facilitating the  manufacture and assembly of such equipment.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from Marianne Jelved, Danish Minister of Economic </F> Affairs: "Denmark More Than Just an `Ally' in Fight Against EU  Fraud"]    [Text] Sir, I was pleased that the FT [FINANCIAL TIMES]  showed interest in the serious problem that fraudulent use of  Community funds constitutes with your article: "A labyrinth of  loopholes" (May 19). As more and more resources are being  administered through the Community budget, the potential scale  of the fraud increases. The removal of internal frontiers with  the creation of the Single Market also poses new challenges in  the fight against fraud.    However, the article needs some correction. It says concern  about fraud is most strongly felt in Germany, which has found  allies in the Netherlands, Denmark and the UK.    In my opinion Denmark has been more than just an ally.  Denmark has played a very active role in enhancing the focus on  the war against EU [European Union] fraud. The protection of  the financial interests of the Community was spelled out by the  Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 when it asked the  Commission to present a strategic programme for reinforcing the  fight against fraud by March 3994.    In addition, the Danish government published a note, "The  Community Budget and Fraud," before the Ecofin [Economic and  Financial] council meeting in May this year. In this note we  suggest important additional elements to the Commission's  anti-fraud strategy. The note proposed speeding up member  states' reaction to the Commission's requests for control  visits; the use of as precise and targeted instruments as  possible; and the development of systems to analyse the results  of various anti-fraud activities.    In addition, the note proposed more publicity to fight  against fraud; and use by member states of more common standards  of control. The Commission's control and auditing teams should  to a larger extent be able to draw on national audits in  connection with EU control visits in member states. And it is  necessary also to focus on the problem that the country where  the fraud is committed is often not the same as the country of  which the swindler is a resident.    The Danish attitude is not only governed by economic  interest. Misuse of public funds runs counter to vital  principles of openness and democratic control. The fight  against fraud is thus of utmost importance for the image of the  Community with our populations.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JOB FAIRS TAKE THE WORK, AND EXPENSE OUT OF HIRING;  </P> <P> EMPLOYMENT: FIRMS FIND THEY LOWER COSTS, AND PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES LIKE THE  OPPORTUNITIES.  </P> <P> Anne Stalker is burned out. After toiling 11 years in the competitive real  estate sales business, the Tustin resident says the desire is gone. She is  looking for a new line of work to restore her career flame.  </P> <P> The search brought her to the Embassy Suites Hotel in Santa Ana on Tuesday to  an all-day sales and management "job fair." She was among more than 1,100  people, armed with resumes and references, who came shopping for job  opportunities offered by 48 companies.  </P> <P> "I'm looking for brighter horizons," said Stalker, as she filled out a form.  </P> <P> Whether or not she finds new employment, Stalker said the event -- sponsored by  The Lendman Group, a professional job-fair organizing company -- is a big time  saver, providing a broad mix of openings from a wide range of companies. There  is no need for newspapers or headhunters.  </P> <P> And as unemployment in San Diego, Orange and Los Angeles counties remains at a  low level, more and more companies are turning to job fairs to attract new  workers -- often hoping to lure the best qualified from their competitors.  </P> <P> Karen Vari, chairperson of the Orange County Employment Managers Assn.,  estimates that nearly 20 job fairs with multiple corporate participants are  held each year in or near Orange County. Close to 100 job fairs are scheduled  by individual firms.  </P> <P> Lendman Group, a consulting firm based in Virginia Beach, Va., which produces  120 job fairs nationally each year, has scheduled a job fair for March 28 at  Embassy Suites Hotel in La Jolla. Companies already signed up for the one-day  event include General Binding Corp., Prudential Marketing Development, MCI  Telecommunications and Donnelley Information Publishing, said Lendman Group  Senior Vice President Joseph Di Geronimo.  </P> <P> Tom Hyland, Cerritos branch manger for Metropolitan Life, which is seeking to  double its financial services sales force nationwide, said "bottom-line results  are better" at job fairs because people who attend are generally serious about  gaining new employment.  </P> <P> Hyland and other interviewers at the Embassy Suites fair said that after an  initial screening, they decide which applicants would fit into their companies  and invite them back for additional interviews and tests. Some companies,  however, don't like the competition of other firms at a job fair and prefer to  hold job open houses at their offices or plants to attract applicants. MAI  Basic Four, the Santa Ana computer company, held such an event last week in  hopes of hiring some software engineers.  </P> <P> Many of the applicants visiting MAI were already employed. They were looking to  upgrade their careers or find new employment in the wake or expectation of  plant layoffs and closures.  </P> <P> With the high cost of housing and other living expenses, many recruiters often  find it easier to attract workers already living in Southern California. This  saves on relocation expenses and avoids the difficult process of getting a  candidate to move from elsewhere.  </P> <P> Dave Fabian, vice president of human resources for MAI, said although that  company also participates in professionally organized job fairs, open houses  are preferable because "we can control the time we have it, the way we do it,  and the interviewing process and we are not competing with 25 or more other  companies."  </P> <P> MAI carefully prepared for last week's job fair, which cost $10,000. Company  managers rehearsed the swift and efficient processing of applicants. On the day  of the event, each of 126 applicants who arrived between 4:30 and 8:30 p.m. was  whisked through the process in about an hour. While waiting for interviews,  they were treated to a buffet and watched videos about the company and its  products.  </P> <P> The efficiency was meant to impress. And it did.  </P> <P> "The way they handle this indicates the way they handle their business and  their customers," said Pat Schilling, a software engineer who had been laid off  from her job at another company just two days earlier.  </P> <P> Employment specialists say the job-fair circuit tends to heat up in January.  </P></p>

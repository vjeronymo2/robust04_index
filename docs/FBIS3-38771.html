			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Feb 7 (AFP) -- French anti-terrorism judge  Jean-Louis Bruguiere has charged three people after completing  his investigation into the murder of former Iranian prime  Minister Shapur Bakhtiar, judicial sources said on Monday [7  February].    But Bruguiere found there was no case to answer against a  45-year-old Iranian woman and an Iranian man, Saili Majid, who  was sought under an international arrest warrant.    Bakhtiar and his secretary were shot and killed in the Paris  suburb of Suresnes on August 6, 1991.    The next stage in the French judicial procedure is for the  Paris appeal court to rule whether the case should be brought  before an assize court.    On January 24, the public prosector reached the conclusion  that the Iranian secret service provided logistical aid to the  killers.    Bruguiere confirmed charges of murder and terrorist-related  conspiracy against Iranian Ali Rad Vakili, who was arrested in  Geneva and extradited to France.    Complicity charges against Iranian businessman Masud Hendi,  45 and Zeynal Sarhadi, 26 were also confirmed.    Hendi is alleged to have helped two of the three alleged  killers to enter France and Sarhadi, a secretary at the Iranian  embassy in Bern, to have aided one of them to escape. Sarhadi  was also extradited from Switzerland, causing a crisis in  Swiss-Iranian relations.    Bruguiere confirmed six international arrest warrants in the  case, two of them against the two other alleged killers, Mohamad  Azadi and Farydoun Boyerahmadi.    According to Hendi, the assassination was ordered by Hossein  Sheikhattar, an advisory to the Iranian telecommunications  minister, judicial sources said.</p>

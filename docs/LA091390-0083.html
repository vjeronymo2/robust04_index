			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS MAKING POLITICIANS RUN ON ISSUES OF THE PAST  </P> <P> When Democratic Sen. Carl Levin debated Republican Rep. Bill Schuette, his  reelection opponent, here last week, virtually the only subject on which they  agreed was President Bush's decision to send troops to Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> No big surprise there. But what was notable was what they did argue about --  energy policy and defense spending -- subjects that were politically comatose  until Iraq invaded Kuwait last month. By contrast, the two candidates brushed  past abortion and the environment -- two issues originally expected to burn  brightly this fall. And the constitutionality of flag-burning -- a question  that ignited passions only three months ago -- never came up.  </P> <P> As in Michigan, candidates across the country are aggressively employing the  developments in the Mideast to sharpen their differences, even when they agree  on the deployment itself. In the process, the Persian Gulf crisis is reviving  partisan disputes that were more common when Jimmy Carter sat in the Oval  Office.  </P> <P> In Illinois, GOP Rep. Lynn Martin has slammed Sen. Paul Simon for supporting  large cuts in the defense budget -- a position that appeared politically  unassailable only weeks ago. In Kentucky, Democratic challenger Harvey Sloane  and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell have ripped each other for financial ties  to the oil industry, whose standing as a political demon had shrunk along with  oil prices in the mid-1980s. "The oil companies have become worse than the  savings and loans," Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said.  </P> <P> In Michigan, where these themes have converged, the Senate contest has taken on  overtones of a political race back to the future. Both candidates have  aggressively employed the new circumstances to reinforce their long-standing  appeals.  </P> <P> Schuette, 36, an attractive and energetic three-term representative from the  north central part of the state, faces an uphill battle to unseat Levin, 56, a  shrewd and rumpled graduate of gritty Detroit politics who was first elected to  the Senate in 1978. Levin leads Schuette by more than 2 to 1, according to a  Detroit News poll released this week.  </P> <P> Throughout the campaign, Schuette has been relying heavily on the polarizing  "wedge" issues that Bush used in 1988 to portray Democrat Michael S. Dukakis as  an elitist liberal ideologue. Since early this spring, Schuette has  persistently attacked Levin for opposition to the death penalty, uncertainty on  flag-burning and for refusing to rule out new taxes, hoping to convince voters  that "Levin is a man who stands 180 degrees from the beliefs and values of the  mainstream of Michigan."  </P> <P> That case has been difficult to make against Levin, whose affable frumpiness  effectively armors him against accusations of trendy elitism. And, with the  Soviet threat imploding, Schuette was denied one of Bush's sharpest wedges --  national defense.  </P> <P> But, with the emergence of the new threat in the gulf, Schuette, like Martin  and other GOP challengers, has nimbly resuscitated the traditional Republican  complaint that Democrats are dangerously soft on defense. At last week's  debate, Schuette repeatedly hammered Levin for not supporting the military  buildup pursued by Ronald Reagan and Bush. Although Levin has endorsed the  President's moves in the Mideast, Schuette charged, he "never gives us the  means for a strong national defense."  </P> <P> Schuette may have found a potent symbol for his case when he criticized the  senator for standing on the deck of the battleship Wisconsin during an early  September tour through the combat zone, although Levin had voted against  recommissioning the ship in 1985.  </P> <P> Levin is not totally defenseless against the charge of being soft on national  security. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on conventional  forces, he frequently notes, he has supported shifting resources from nuclear  to conventional weapons -- the relevant measure of strength in the Persian  Gulf.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, few Democratic strategists had hoped to spend the fall debating  military preparedness. To the extent that the agenda has shifted from cutting  defense spending to ensuring America's security against unanticipated threats,  "it has taken the argument away from the Democrats," said Republican pollster  Alex Gage, who is advising Schuette.  </P> <P> But, if the crisis has freed Republicans to strike old poses on national  defense, it has also enabled Democrats to dust off their invective against Big  Oil.  </P> <P> For Levin, that presents an opportunity to underscore his basic campaign theme.  While Schuette has tried to polarize the race around cultural issues, Levin,  like many Democrats this year, has sought to divide the electorate on economic  grounds.  </P> <P> To cement his links with swing blue-collar voters -- conservative on social  issues but suspicious of the wealthy and big business -- Levin has stressed  such populist issues as trade and tax "fairness." Now, the rise in gasoline  prices has presented him with perhaps his most compelling populist villain.  </P> <P> In last week's debate, Schuette proposed to ease the energy price rise by  offering domestic oil companies more incentives to drill for new supplies -- in  effect arguing that the proper response to soaring prices is tax breaks. But  Levin swung for the gut, declaring that "we ought to sock it to the oil  companies in every way we possibly can. They're gouging the heck out of us. We  . . . ought to have a windfall profits tax on their excess profits."  </P> <P> Few here doubt that Levin won that exchange. "The farmers are bitching about  (oil prices), the bankers are bitching about it, working folks don't understand  it," said state Rep. Bob Emerson (D-Flint). "Everybody's mad at the oil  companies."  </P> <P> The Mideast crisis has also intensified fears of an imminent recession in the  state, where slipping car sales had induced jitters even before the invasion.  </P> <P> That economic anxiety represents the wild card in this race, as in many others  around the nation. Republicans hope it will strengthen their anti-tax and  time-for-a-change arguments. Schuette has already put Levin on the defensive  for previously endorsing an oil import fee and has pledged not to support any  budget agreement that includes new taxes. If such an agreement is reached  before Election Day, and Levin votes for new taxes, "all of a sudden, it would  be a close race," said Republican consultant Tom Shields.  </P> <P> But, short of such a dramatic development, most Michigan analysts feel that  voters here will do what they usually do when they feel a cold economic gale  gathering: lean toward Democrats who promise them shelter against hard times.  Of all the political winds now blowing from the Persian Gulf, that may prove  the most powerful.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND TV;  </P> <P> 'COMIC RELIEF' BRINGS STARS TO HBO TONIGHT  </P> <P> The fourth annual "Comic Relief" benefit for the homeless brings stars and  laughter to the small screen tonight.  </P> <P> Hosted as in previous years by Robin Williams, Whoopi Goldberg and Billy  Crystal, the five-hour comedy marathon begins at 8 p.m. on HBO.  </P> <P> Among those scheduled to perform or pitch for funds at New York's Radio City  Music Hall are Danny Aiello, Candice Bergen, George Carlin, Art Carney, Dana  Carvey, Bill Cosby, New York Mayor David Dinkins, Jane Pauley, Joan Rivers, The  Rockettes, The Simpsons and Susan Sarandon.  </P> <P> Tonight at 9 p.m., KCET Channel 28 begins a five-part series, "Skyscraper,"  which chronicles the construction of a 47-story office building on the former  site of Madison Square Garden in mid-town Manhattan. The series examines and  explains the design, financing and construction processes that turned a hole in  the ground into the 770-foot-high Worldwide Plaza.  </P> <P> And those die-hard fans of the low-rated CBS comedies "The Famous Teddy Z" and  "City" will be happy to know that both series return to the network's schedule  tonight. "Teddy Z," starring Jon Cryer, airs at 9 p.m., while Valerie Harper's  "City" follows at 9:30 p.m. STEVE WEINSTEIN  </P></p>

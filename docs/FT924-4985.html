			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Motoring: First glimpse of a star THIS IS the first officially-leaked picture of the Xantia, Citroen's upper/medium-segment car that will be one of the stars of the Geneva show in March. But while it succeeds the BX - the first of the marque that ordinary motorists, although not car buffs, took to their hearts - the Xantia is more than a mere replacement. Citroen says the elegantly styled Xantia will compete with the Ford Sierra (and, one assumes, its successor, the Mondio), Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra), BMW 3-Series, Nissan Primera and Toyota Carina E. To avoid a family squabble, Citroen does not mention the Peugeot 405, with which it shares components. The Xantia, at 14ft 6in (4.44 metres) long, is bigger than the BX which comes between. It will go on sale in France in March, with a choice of three petrol engines: 1.8-litre, 103 horsepower; two-litre, 123 hp; or two-litre, 16-valve 155 hp. Diesels will follow quickly and an estate car will come later. The top Xantia models will have computer-controlled Hydractive suspension like that of the big XM. Cheaper Xantias will be steel-sprung, but all will have the passive rear-wheel steering sytem which gives the smaller ZX models such good handling. A lot can happen in the next nine months, but you can be sure the Xantia will be priced keenly when it arrives in the UK next summer. EUROPE'S Car of the Year 1993 is the British-made Nissan Micra super-mini. It beat the even smaller Fiat Cinquecento by 338 votes to 304. While I picked the winner last week, I would have lost money on place bets. I thought the Fiat would be third and that the runner-up would be Toyota's Carina E. But the international jury placed Renault's Safrane executive car third with 244 votes, followed by a brace of Mazdas: the plush Xedos 6 with 124 and the 626 with 101. The Carina E trailed in sixth with 79. As Car of the Year contests go, it was no cliffhanger. The entries were on the thin side and it was a pretty safe bet that, for the first time a Japanese car would win. Next year, though, will be different. Among the competitors will be replacements for three of Europe's best-sellers: the Xantia, Ford's Mondio; and a new Mercedes 190. 'A tremendous accolade for the new car and everyone at Nissan in Britain who contributed to its design,' said a jubilant Ian Gibson, the Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) managing director. Yet , while the award does not guarantee commercial success. If the winner is not perceived as the best buy in its class, having the title will not make it a profitable product. Being Car of the Year did not help the NSU Ro80, Chrysler Alpine and Horizon, Rover 3500, Renault 9, Lancia Delta and Fiat Tipo to keep their makers in the black.</p>

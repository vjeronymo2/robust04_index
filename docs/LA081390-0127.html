			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> GLENN CLOSE 'TRYING TO BE TALL'  </P> <P> Glenn Close insists she fits the part of a prairie woman in the Hallmark Hall  of Fame production, "Sarah, Plain and Tall."  </P> <P> "I'm trying to be tall," the 5-foot-4 actress said, raising her skirt just  enough to expose her elevated boots.  </P> <P> "I've added four inches to my height."  </P> <P> As for plain, she said: "I'm a New Englander and I think of New Englanders as  being plain-spoken and unadorned and that kind of thing. There are different  interpretations."  </P> <P> Close was in this small southeastern Kansas town to film part of the production  scheduled for airing on CBS early next year. Filming in Kansas concluded  Saturday.  </P> <P> She plays Sarah Wheaton, a Maine woman who answers a newspaper ad from a newly  widowed prairie farmer in 1910. Christopher Walken plays Jacob Witting, the  lonely farmer seeking a mother for his two young children.  </P> <P> The movie is based on Patricia MacLachlan's 1985 book that won the Newberry  Medal for outstanding children's literature.  </P></p>

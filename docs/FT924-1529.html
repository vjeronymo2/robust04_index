			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Switzerland goes to the market on stock indices - The introduction of SILO and MILO THE Swiss stock market is dominated by the shares of a handful of giant multinational industrial companies and banks. This has an important bearing on Swiss index futures. In the SMI index of the 21 leading Swiss shares, the three pharmaceutical groups, Ciba-Geigy, Roche and Sandoz, account for over one-third of the weighting, and Nestle alone another 28 per cent. Lombard, Odier, the Geneva private bank, argues that these companies' activities are so international that their performance has precious little to do with the Swiss economy or business climate. Thus, the SMI index and even the all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI), where the SMI 21 accounts for more than 70 per cent of the total market capitalisation, give a misleading impression of what is really going on. Lombard, Odier has developed two new indices, one of medium-sized Swiss quoted companies (the MILO index) and one of small Swiss companies (the SILO index). There already exists a Vontobel Small Companies Index (VSC), and Lombard, Odier acknowledges that the performance of it and SILO are much the same, even though composition criteria are slightly different. Lombard, Odier uses the same criterion, market capitalisation, for selecting the components of its indices as the SMI, and is basically taking up where the SMI leaves off. The MILO index is composed of the 94 listed securities of the next 50 largest companies after the SMI 21. SILO reflects the remaining 295 listed shares of 209 companies. Why draw the line at 50? It seemed the right place to split between medium and small companies, Mr Serge Ledermann, Lombard, Odier head of Swiss research, says. It also happens to be close to the capitalisation of SFr500m which is accepted as the border between small and medium-sized companies. Lombard, Odier has been able to project its indices backward to 1980. The result is not a pretty picture. Both MILO and SILO have underperformed the market as a whole, SILO disastrously. The SBC index of nearly the whole market, for example, has doubled since 1980 while MILO is up only 80 per cent and SILO is down 20 per cent. The divergence in performance is particularly pronounced since 1988. The SMI (which was introduced in 1989) is up 30 per cent, while MILO is off 12 per cent and SILO nearly 50 per cent. Lombard, Odier analysts say this is to be expected, given a high inflation rate and the Swiss government's credit squeeze in that period. Also, the smaller company shares are generally less liquid and not of interest to index funds. In recent weeks, the uncertainty over Switzerland's referendum on joining the European Economic Area has accentuated the divergence between big and small shares still further. But it may also point to some opportunities when signs of recovery in the Swiss economy appear. Many of the companies in these indices have made great efforts to improve their competitiveness in the past few years. 'In the mid-range we think we will find the blue chips of tomorrow,' says Mr Ledermann.</p>

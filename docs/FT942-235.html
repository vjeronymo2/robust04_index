			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Blast rocks Algiers demonstration Sixty-four people were injured, two seriously, yesterday when two explosions rocked a demonstration in central Algiers, security forces said, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo. The blasts, apparently caused by a lone attacker, occurred shortly after the start of the rally, called by the Rassemblement pour la Culture et Democratie, one of Algeria's main secular parties, just as the party's leader, Mr Said Saadi, was passing. A CDR spokesman said Mr Saadi was unhurt. The CDR called the demonstration, which it said was tens of thousands strong, on the second anniversary of the assassination of Mohamed Boudiaf, the former president. No group has claimed responsibility for the blast, which the CDR said was 'clearly an attack on Algeria's democratic forces'. More than 4,000 people have died in political violence in Algeria since the cancellation of elections in 1991 led to intensified clashes between Islamic militants and the security forces.</p>

In statements to the weekly newspaper MAYU today, President  Mubarak added that these African leaders with whom he met in  Tunis during the recent African summit also praised the decision  to establish a mechanism to examine conflicts by peaceful means  and the efforts to reduce African debts.    He said that Egypt's status among the African states has  greatly been enhanced, noting that all the African states with  whom he met in Tunis thanked Egypt for the large role and  sincere effort it undertook to solve the problems of the  continent during Egypt's chairmanship of the OAU in the past  year.

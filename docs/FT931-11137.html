			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Pound's fall puts up food prices STERLING'S sharp fall in the past few days adds to the upward pressure on food prices which has been developing since the pound left the European exchange rate mechanism in the autumn. The full impact is likely to take several months to show up in the shops. Many leading manufacturers have announced higher prices in recent weeks. McVitie's, part of United Biscuits, has raised its biscuit prices by 5 per cent. Northern Foods, Marks &amp; Spencer's largest food supplier, aims for an increase of between 6 per cent and 8 per cent by April. Food manufacturers say the rises are needed to cover the higher costs of raw materials which are imported or governed by Common Agricultural Policy support schemes. The cost of some basic commodities, such as sugar and flour, had risen by about 15 per cent before sterling's latest decline. Many of the increases announced by manufacturers are facing stiff resistance from leading supermarket chains, which face increasingly strong price competition, particularly from the growing ranks of discount retailers. Recession has caused many consumers to 'trade down' to cheaper brands and pro-ducts. When supermarkets agree to nominal increases in list prices they are said to be whittling away much of the benefit to suppliers by insisting on bigger volume discounts, more generous price promotions and special offers. Some big retail chains are also said to have been accepting price rises for branded products, but refusing to pay more for competing 'private label' items  - often supplied by the same manufacturer  - which they sell under their own name.</p>

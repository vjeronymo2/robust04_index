			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 103 RULING: A PYRRHIC VICTORY  </P> <P> And so the big news of the day is that the constitutionality of last November's  Proposition 103 has been upheld by California's Supreme Court. Or has it? A  closer reading of the opinion shows that the justices -- even though they found  the 20% rollback permissible -- refused to allow insurance companies to be  hammered into bankruptcy, regardless of how laudable the initiative's goal. The  court also selectively upheld various provisions of the proposition to allow  several loopholes significant enough to drive an uninsured truck through.  </P> <P> The voters got their rate rollback but only for the time that it will take an  insurer to run over to the commissioner's office and file an application for  higher rates -- and immediately begin charging them. Because even though the  court found the rollback constitutional, it said that the allowable rates must  be "fair and reasonable," which means a fair rate of return.  </P> <P> Even after Nov. 8, when rates must be approved by the commissioner before they  can be charged, the commissioner can approve an interim rate pending her final  decision. So voters are cautioned not to make that down payment on the vacation  they were going to pay for with their insurance premium refunds. You'll be  needing that money shortly.  </P> <P> So what if we aren't going to get the refund? The insurers have to renew our  policies. Yes, that's what the court said -- unless, of course, there is a  "substantial increase in the hazard insured against," in which case the court  said, they don't have to renew. And when the insurer does renew, it is  "guaranteed fair and reasonable rates," according to the court. In other words,  it has to renew but not necessarily at the same price.  </P> <P> Well, it still looks like we've got the insurers where we want them -- they  can't leave the state. Or can they? The court said that they can leave  California as long as they follow the steps set out in the state Insurance  Code. In fact, the court said Proposition 103 recognizes the possibility that  insurers may withdraw from some insurance markets.  </P> <P> But if the insurers stick around, we have this consumer advocacy corporation  that will go after them. Wrong again -- the court threw that out because it  violates the state Constitution.  </P> <P> Well, how about getting a refund from some of those so-called old obscene  profits? I don't think so, because the court said: "profits from the past  cannot be used to sustain confiscatory rates for the future . . . no case  supports an unreasonably low rate of return on the ground that past profits  were excessive."  </P> <P> So what do we have after this "victory for consumers?" Beginning in November of  this year, we'll have a new way of regulating insurance rates called "prior  approval," which means that the Department of Insurance will have to  substantially increase its staff to handle all the applications for rate  increases. According to the legislative analyst, for the first full year  (1989-90), an additional 300 people and $15 million to $16 million will be  required to implement Proposition 103. And as the analyst points out, the money  for all this comes from "fees levied on insurance companies, brokers and  agents." Since these are legitimate costs of doing business, they can be  included in the premium rate base. In other words, our rates will increase  because of our consumer victory. But it's good for employment in the  commissioner's office.  </P> <P> And so after this agony that began last November, the problem is still with us.  Insurance prices are still pretty much as they have been and will stay there  until someone challenges them. At which time they will be vigorously defended  by the insurers in both administrative and judicial hearings.  </P> <P> What have we learned? For one thing, we've learned that we should examine our  consumer advocates to see if they know very much about what they are trying to  do. In the case of Proposition 103, it was clear early on that drafters Harvey  Rosenfield and Ralph Nader were ignorant of the biggest consumer vs. insurer  issue around at the time -- the practice of insurers denying or delaying claims  in bad faith. In 1979 the California Supreme Court said that both first- and  third-party claimants could sue the insurer under the unfair-claims statutes  and were not limited solely to a complaint to the commissioner. In 1988 our new  court overturned that decision and destroyed the most effective sanction  consumers had against insurers. Although another of last November's ballot  measures, Proposition 100, would have restored the right to sue for unfair  claims practices, Proposition 103 was conspicuously silent on the issue.  </P> <P> After Proposition 103's tortuous trail through the initiative process, the  election and the courtroom, Rosenfield and Nader must feel like Epirus' King  Pyrrhus after his victory over the Romans in 279 BC. After winning the battle  at a cost of the lives of most of his men, Pyrrhus was heard to remark  something like "One more victory like that and I'll lose the war."  </P></p>

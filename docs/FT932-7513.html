			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: Opera house as Art-Object - Max Loppert howls with frustration over missed opportunities at Lyons LAST weekend the doors of the new Lyons opera house opened at last. Bright splashes of ceremony marked the end of the six long years France's second city has had to endure without one. There were speeches by the mayor and the new Culture Minister. There were two new opera productions, both conducted by the company chief, Kent Nagano: the long-awaited premiere of a Debussy reconstruction and a High-Concept new version of The Tales of Hoffmann. On both evenings in the magnificent Hotel de Ville across the square there were post-performance canapes and champagne for notables, local dignitaries and the specially-invited French and international press. And in between there were opportunities to examine from many angles the realisation of Jean Nouvel's bold design for a state-of-the-art opera-theatre built up out of the old Lyons opera house. Tres controversee, the mayor called it. That is, I think, putting it mildly. On the evidence of these first encounters I shall risk describing the new theatre as at once a brilliantly-imagined art-object in itself and, in practical terms, a pretty considerable disaster. The architect, prevented by on-site limitations of space from enlarging the old theatre, pursued instead the idea of expanding upwards within its frame. The original facade and grand foyer have been preserved; the rest was boldly germinated to provide sharp distinctions of new-versus-old visual contrast. A great half-tunnel roof crowns the edifice; within it a new theatre (1,300 seats, 500 more than in the old) is supported by an elaborate suspension system (the technology of the building is a source of great fascination), and above the auditorium itself there is provision for much-needed administrative and rehearsal space. The marriage of past and present, of glass panes, metal girders and warm-toned classical columns, is distinctive. Viewed from the surrounding square late at night the whole complex leaves an impression of glamour and confidence of style and purpose. But a theatre is for rather more than street-level gazing. It is for audiences and performers, and for effecting with maximum efficiency and ease the artistic link between them. Nouvel seems not to have understood these most basic of requirements. The entrance foyer and main passageways are painted in Stygian shiny black, as is the theatre auditorium itself. The antechambers are in screaming red, with lighting to match. A single pair of escalators is all there is to lift 1,300 people from entrance to theatre level (the pre-performance crush on both opening evenings was simply frightful); and the connecting stairways are made of bouncing thin perforated metal rather like a lemon zester - just the thing for filtering footwear dirt and dust onto the heads of people below. The sense of rat-in-a-psychologist's-cage unease induced by the blanketing colours of death and emergency is completed by arrival in one's narrow seat, with its insufficient leg room and cold metal arm-rests. The reasoning behind the black-and-red ordinance was that this would force total concentration on the stage; what it induces instead - in my case at least - are feelings of claustrophobia and irrational loathing of all architects. Before the Saturday Hoffmann there were cries from the upper tiers of 'Go ahead, we can't see anything anyway]', which raised again the already vexed topic of upper-level sightlines; and a Deep Throat from the chorus told me of physically nightmarish conditions backstage. The new theatre has cost under FFrs 480m - peanuts compared with the sums lavished on the Bastille. It scores over the Paris theatre in one crucial respect - its well-balanced acoustics. For the rest, and with the Paris mistakes in mind, one wanted to howl with frustration at the waste all over again of time, effort and precious resources. When the building's various ills finally prove intolerable, as they soon must, one can only hope that action both swift and clear-minded will be taken to heal them. Given all this, and the various necessary feats of co-ordination required to put on two operas and a new Coppelia in a brand-new opera house, it was to Nagano's great credit that musically the two opera productions were of a standard to make the Lyons visit worthwhile malgre tout. Rodrigue et Chimene is the Grand Opera, on a flatulently verbose libretto by the playwright Catulle Mendes distantly related to Corneille's Le Cid, that Debussy began (in 1888) but never completed. It has been pieced together from various piano-score sources by the Debussy scholar Richard Langham Smith, with textual help from Georges Beck; Lyons commissioned the Russian composer Edison Denisov to score the three substantial acts thus created. The result is not a complete opera (Langham Smith looks forward to the day when a putative fourth act materialises) nor even a 'real' opera (pace, timing and narrative sequence are clumsy). But musically it is two hours of continuous richness, a pre-Pelleas web woven out of the influences of Parsifal, Mussorgsky and Massenet, as well as the language of Debussy's own early songs and Blessed Damozel cantata. It affords a profound new insight into the composer at a crucial turning-point in his artistic development. Hearing it as played by the excellent Opera de Lyon orchestra under Nagano's lucid baton, and sung by a strong cast (Laurence Dale and Donna Brown in the title roles, Jean-Philippe Courtis and Jules Bastin as their warring fathers) and the no less strong Lyons chorus, was a pleasure. Seeing it in a grey-toned, stiff-gaited production by Georges Lavaudant was rather less so  -this was hardly the spirit-lifting piece of work needed to relieve the gloom of the theatre. But totally, horribly faithful to the worst aspects of the architectural enterprise was the unbroken two-hour version of Hoffmann the following evening. Comparable with the theatre, this was Opera as Art-Object: cut-down Offenbach devised by the Lyons dramaturge Michel Vittoz, produced by the company boss, Louis Erlo, and re-titled . . . Des Contes d'Hoffmann (note the dots and the 'des'). A more frustrating exercise in 'structuralist' intellectual posturing of the French persuasion would be hard to imagine. The setting was that weariest of modern-opera cliches, the mad-house. Olympia was a crippled inmate released from her wheelchair and callipers during the Doll Song, a gruesome scene. Drawing high-fashion operatic frisson from presentations of madness and physical handicap is a base pursuit. A lesser cause of dismay was the waste of Nagano, the orchestra and a classy cast: the sympathetic young tenor Daniel Galvez-Vallejo (Hoffmann), Barbara Hendricks (Antonia), Nathalie Dessay (Olympia), Brigitte Balleys (Nicklaus) and the great Jose van Dam as nemesis-figure.</p>

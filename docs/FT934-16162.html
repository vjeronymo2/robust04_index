			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Pound lifts against D-Mark STERLING stood out in a virtually lifeless foreign exchange market with a respectable performance against a range of currencies including the D-Mark and dollar yesterday writes Peter John. Investor buying from South East Asia and Europe pushed the pound up by one and a half pfennigs against the German currency which suffered from the impact of very disappointing industrial order statistics, and a cent against the dollar. It followed the dollar higher in early trade and closed at DM2.4775, up from DM2.4625 previously and at Dollars 1.5260, up from Dollars 1.5170. The rise coincided with a general lift in UK financial markets: the FT-SE 100 index scraped to an all-time closing high and long-dated government bonds were up by around three-quarters of a percentage point. However, most dealers and economists, were at a loss to provide any concrete reason for the burst of enthusiasm and tended to focus on the Tory Party conference. There was no good news to latch on to but the party was at least making a pretence at cohesion. Also, the background of low growth with low inflation and the consequent expectation of a cut in base rates remains. However, an interest rate cut has been so fully discounted that the market is focusing on the fundamental economic advantages of the UK over the rest of Europe. Elsewhere, most markets were on hold ahead of key employment data from the US on Friday. Economists are looking for a rise of between 150,000 and 200,000 in the non-farm payroll figure for September. That figure is seen as a crucial pointer to a US recovery that has appeared to be running out of steam recently. If it is lower than predicted there could easily be a slide in the dollar which held its own yesterday. The currency was supported by US investment funds who decided that it had hit the bottom of its range but it came under pressure from cross-currency options expiries. It closed relatively flat against the Japanese Yen at 105.60 and the D-Mark at DM1.6230. The volatility on currency options - one of the principal elements determining their price - has fallen dramatically in some cases and was blamed for the low level of activity in the underlying market. The Portuguese escudo was quoted at Es102.958 against the D-Mark as the Bank of Portugal intervened to support the currency. Dealers said the central bank intervention was aimed at bringing the rate back past the psychological level of Es103. The Belgian franc weakened to BFr21.67 to the D-Mark against BFr21.60 on light selling by external investors. The Canadian dollar was marginally firmer at CDollars 1.3370 against its US counterpart ahead of elections on October 25. Kidder Peabody argues that the currency is undervalued and should approach CDollars 1.20 over the next 12 months.</p>

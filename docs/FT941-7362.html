			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Industry horrified by Malaysian threat Industrialists and bankers were horrified yesterday by the news that the Malaysian government was planning to cease giving business to British companies. A banker involved in financing Malaysian trade said: 'We are doing everything we can to get the Malaysians to change their minds, otherwise years of marketing and billions of pounds of potential contracts will go down the drain.' The Malaysians will honour existing contracts but there will be no time limit on the embargo on new business. The banker said the move could be costly for British companies that were currently negotiating government contracts worth Pounds 2bn. A UK-Japanese consortium including Trafalgar House, Balfour Beatty, Gammon and G-Mats (part of GEC) has signed a memorandum for development and project management of a new MDollars 13.5bn (Pounds 3.4bn) international airport for Kuala Lumpur. The initial contract was worth a comparatively modest amount. The expectation was that bigger contracts would have gone to British companies. According to a businessman these companies were told yesterday they would not get any of the more profitable contracts. British companies including National Grid, PowerGen and Rolls-Royce are negotiating contracts in Malaysia's fast-expanding power sector. British construction and engineering companies, including John Laing, Bovis and John Brown, have won substantial contracts in Malaysia and were hoping for bigger things as Malaysia geared up to spend millions on infrastructure. Laing has been negotiating a contract on the construction of a Pounds 200m-plus military base at Mersing. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, has been particularly incensed by press allegations that he was linked to Malaysian officials who were allegedly in receipt of bribes. A leading British businessman said: 'He is sick to death of the press attacks.' The final straw is said to have been an allegation in the Sunday Times that a British construction company was paying bribes to politicians in Malaysia. Today's statement from the Malaysian government is expected to express 'sympathy' for the UK government and British companies over the behaviour of the British media. Dr Mahathir has enormous power and influence in Malaysia. He has been in power for 13 years. A government adviser said ministers viewed attacks on Dr Mahathir as attacks on Malaysia. Australia learned this late last year after an aside by prime minister Mr Paul Keating which described Dr Mahathir as 'recalcitrant' for not attending a gathering of Asia Pacific leaders. Malaysia reacted by threatening to cancel Australian business contracts and to downgrade diplomatic relations. The affair was resolved after public expressions of regret by Mr Keating. This will be the second time that Dr Mahathir has launched an embargo on British trade. In October 1981 he initiated a 'Buy British Last' policy that was maintained for three years, after the withdrawal of UK government subsidies for foreign students in Britain. Dr Mahathir frequently attacks what he feels to be western arrogance - whether it concerns world trade, the environment or human rights. He said recently: 'Sometimes you have to be a bit notorious to be a bit famous. In order to be known you have to be nasty.' Baroness Thatcher worked assiduously and successfully to rebuild the relationship with Malaysia. She and Dr Mahatir have a high regard for each other. Since 1988, when she signed a memorandum of understanding with him on Pounds 1bn of UK defence sales to Malaysia, British companies have won a series of profitable contracts. A banker said: 'Apart from Hong Kong, it's the only country in the Asia Pacific region where British companies have had significant successes.' Britain has made an estimated Pounds 1.3bn of defence sales to Malaysia since 1988 and British companies have won civil projects worth considerably more than that. British exports to Malaysia have risen from Pounds 227m in 1986 to Pounds 862m last year. But relations with the British government deteriorated last year because Dr Mahathir was highly critical of what he viewed as Britain's inadequate support for Bosnia's beleaguered Moslem community. A businessman with close links to the Malaysian government said: 'He lectured John Major about Bosnia for 55 minutes when he saw him last September.' Dr Mahathir and his cabinet then became annoyed by criticism in the British press and parliament that the Pounds 1bn arms deal was won because the government gave Pounds 234m of aid for the dam at Pergau. A British businessman said: 'They can't see what all the fuss is about. After all, they want the dam and it's being built by British companies.'</p>

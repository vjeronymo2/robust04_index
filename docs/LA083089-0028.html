			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SYNAGOGUE OKD FOR NEIGHBORHOOD;  </P> <P> L.A. PANEL ALSO APPROVES SCHOOL AT SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE  </P> <P> Over the objections of some Woodland Hills residents, a Los Angeles City  Council committee voted Tuesday to allow an Orthodox Jewish congregation to  establish a private elementary school and synagogue in a neighborhood of  single-family houses.  </P> <P> The Planning and Land Use Management Committee -- made up of Councilmen Hal  Bernson, Robert Farrell and Michael Woo -- said the Beit Hamidrash congregation  of Woodland Hills could establish a synagogue and school in a single-family  house at 22760 Califa St. as long as it complies with 23 restrictions on  parking, operating hours and traffic.  </P> <P> The decision overturned a ruling in April by an associate zoning administrator  who held that the house was an unsuitable location for a school and synagogue,  which he said would disturb neighbors.  </P> <P> Although he voted to grant a permit, Farrell expressed reservations. "You're  putting a growing, vibrant organism into a space that's too small," he said. He  added that there were so many restrictions that the synagogue might find it  prohibitive to operate.  </P> <P> Several neighbors who protested said they plan to appeal the committee's  decision to the full City Council when the issue comes up in a few weeks. "It's  not that we have anything against the religion," Fred Nixon said. "This is an  issue of this operation that could be in a more appropriate place. It's just  not the right area for something like this."  </P> <P> Congregation officials said they would convert the house into an elementary  school that could accommodate 56 children in first through fourth grades.  </P> <P> The school would operate from 7:45 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Fridays, with  occasional evening programs for parents.  </P> <P> The structure will serve as a synagogue for 60 worshipers to attend morning and  Saturday services.  </P> <P> Rabbi Dov Ahoroni said he was heartened by the committee's decision. "We're  very pleased, and we want to be good neighbors," Ahoroni said. "After all, we  live here too."  </P></p>

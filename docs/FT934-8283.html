			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa market pushes towards Pounds 1,000 a tonne COCOA PRICES in London broke out of a three-week stalemate yesterday and made strong gains on the back of fresh investment fund buying in New York. The second position March futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange hit its highest level since July 1988, reaching an intra-day peak of Pounds 997 a tonne before closing Pounds 23 higher at Pounds 994. It had not been above Pounds 991 during a day's trading since October 21. The London market had been waiting to see what happened in New York last Friday, the first notice day for physical delivery against the December contract, which expires on December 14. The New York market had been weak in the run-up to the notice day as it waited for funds to get out of their positions or roll them over. But in the event, Friday brought a notice for December delivery of a large number of contracts by a leading trade house, reported to be Goldman Sachs. As it was thought likely to hold on to the cocoa, thus reducing supply, this helped to boost prices. The London market took heart from the move early on and technical buyers moved in when the price breached Pounds 991. 'There hasn't been any indication in the London market that people were prepared to go short, even when New York was weak,' said one trader. 'Today the situation got a little bit enthused. With holidays in Brazil and Ivory Coast there was no origin selling, and there's some concern about shipments and quality of cocoa from Ivory Coast.' LCE Coffee futures were also firmer, encouraged by new that the Brazilian government had bought 51,000 bags of beans (60kg each) for the export retention stockpile at Friday's auction, bringing the total so far to 76,500 bags. The January position closed at Dollars 1,227 a tonne, up Dollars 17. Under the retention plan coffee producers are holding 20 per cent of their supplies off the market. Current prices are some 22 per cent higher than when the plan was agreed at the end of July, but they remain well below the 2 1/2 -year peaks reached in September.</p>

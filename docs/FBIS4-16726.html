			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Batygin "Parliamentary Review": "One Hundred </F> Days Have Past. But Where Are the Laws?"]    [Text] The State Duma has been working for just over three  months now. Its deputies were elected in December -- a cold,  overcast time of year, but, astrologically speaking, an  extremely propitious one for the future deputies. After all,  those born under the sign of Sagittarius are energetic, active,  independent, like reading and traveling, and attain great  success in their work....    Fine characteristics for a parliamentarian! That parliament  has assembled professionals, and not afficianados of the  "talking shop," can be seen, if by nothing else, by the recent  parliament hearings on the federal budget. The executive can no  longer get away with things that the Supreme Soviet swallowed  uncomplainingly. Duma deputies decisively rejected the draft  budget for 1994, explaining to representatives of the Ministries  of Finance and the Economy and the Central Bank that it was  simply ridiculous to discuss the budget without a breakdown by  regions, and the ill-considered, insulting division of the  regions into three classes could only provoke interregional  conflicts.    The discussion of problems connected with the budget showed  that we should expect no improvement in our lives this year;  funds are needed, and considerable ones at that, for  stabilization. What holes must be darned in the first place?  Just one example, made public at the Russian Academy of  Sciences' Annual General Meeting: Science was promised 933  billion rubles [R] for 1994, but in the first quarter was given  just R45 billion. Hence the Russian Academy of Sciences is  sending the Duma a plaintive appeal for help.    Nevertheless, the difficult dialogue between the two  branches  of power on budgetary problems kept within civilized bounds.  After a businesslike exchange of opinions, having little in  common with the old rivalry and disputes and still less the  feuds and enmity so memorable in relations between the former  executive and legislative branches, the government did not even  insist on parliament's approval of the draft budget.    There are not so many variations in the Duma's strategy, the  last three months have shown. One or two continue to campaign  for the course of reforms in their current experimental form.  However, many are convinced that it is capable only of  destroying, not of creating, and runs the risk of losing the  people's trust. The second variation, whose mouthpiece in the  lower chamber of parliament is above all Gennadiy Zyuganov and  other Communists, is a call for the country to go back to  socialism, to the USSR, and, therefore, to the  administrative-edict system. Alas, history has already given  them the opportunity to bring the country prosperity, and the  results are well known. More and more deputies incline to  another path -- the implementation of professionally executed  reforms with the creation of a temporary system of social  protection for those who have lost their jobs. A difficult  path, but a realistic one that corresponds to the laws of the  market.    In this, the legislature's influence on the course of events  could prove extremely great. Parliament, Duma Chairman Ivan  Rybkin stated, "firmly intends to undertake the legislative  support of intelligent political, economic, and social reforms."  The choice of priorities is also evidence of the thoroughness  of these intentions. The 23 Duma committees -- effectively  miniparliaments -- in which all factions and groups are  proportionately represented have already got down to their  direct task: creative legislation. This work is multifaceted,  painstaking, and -- so it may seem to the bystander -- rather  tedious. The deputies do not think so, engaging in expert  analysis day after day and participating in open parliamentary  hearings and discussions.    The only pity is that not one of the problems discussed has  yet found concrete embodiment in law. Such a low productivity  level in the Duma is worrying. And if you take into account the  fact that the Law "On the Status of the Deputy" has still not  been adopted, it is extremely difficult to divine what  consequences decisions adopted within the walls of parliament  may have.    Of course, we must also allow for the relatively short time  of the Duma's existence -- just 100 days -- the confusion over  its premises, and other organizational difficulties. But the  fact remains that, apart from confidently executed "softening-up  exercises" -- a highly sensible plan of legislative activity --  nothing else has been accomplished. The Duma inmates score real  points perhaps only for helping the president to modify his  savings compensation edict.    And there is plenty of work to do. Finally our society is  starting to realize that the only way to achieve political goals  is through peaceful means, with the aid of elections and the  will of the people. Boris Yeltsin singled out the evolving new  climate of collaboration with the Federation Council and the  State Duma. "Dialogue is developing," he said. "I will do  everything incumbent on me to see that this constructive mood  takes root, to see that parliament serves out its term and that  the next elections take place at the appointed time and in  conditions of stability and a higher level of political culture."    Let us add to the president's words: It would be a good  thing if the constructive mood were constantly reinforced by  creation. So far the deputies born under the sign of  Sagittarius, the Archer, "shoot" and hit target extremely  rarely. The Duma is still only just beginning normal work, and  its deputies have so far only managed to shine in foreign  excursions and parliamentary hearings. To be fair, many such  hearings are packed with content and interesting. In  particular, one of the most recent hearings, devoted to local  self-government reforms, deserves special attention. The issue  was that, according to the norms enshrined in the Russian  Federation Constitution, the organs of local self-government do  not form part of the system of state power, and hence do not  square with the existing structures of the representative and  executive organs in the localities. The future law "On Local  Self-Government," which should avoid this contradiction, could  untie this knot. A timely notion, in our view, and a fine one,  but it does not solve the problem. And yet, because of this  problem in some regions local self-government elections were  aborted, and in many localities they were postponed till the  fall on the president's recommendation.    The parliamentary hearing on the "Partnership for Peace  Program," which dealt with the possibility of Russia's  participation in the NATO program and attitudes to opposing  military blocs, also provoked a great deal of dispute.    The Duma's activity is directly linked to the resolution of  vexed questions. All the same, deputies are obliged to justify  the hopes of those who voted for them above all through  consistent, effective legislation. In this area the 100 days of  the Duma's power can clearly be assessed as a "flop."    ...Three months of intense work have past. The drama of the  election contest and the preelection pledges and promises of  mounds of gold have evaporated, and have been replaced by  routine parliamentary service, deprived of the halo of rallies  and election campaigns.    Fears that the Duma would plunge into factional polemics  have  proved unfounded. Of course, the preposterous antics of the  leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia introduce a  shrill note into the polyphonic deputies' chorus. Although the  Duma is not a place to settle personal scores, from time to time  scandals erupt there -- the latest involving fisticuffs. Well,  parliamentarians are also people, nothing human is alien to  them. Of course, neither Shakhray's ripostes, Lukin's puns, or  Zhirinovskiy's antics determine the import of decisions adopted  by the Duma or influence the disposition of political forces in  parliament. However, the relations of the Duma deputies, it  seems to me, are extremely indicative. The disposition of  forces in the Duma is a kind of reflection of the situation in  society.    For instance, the strengthening of the Communists' positions  in the Duma, the vague rumors around the ultranationalists, in  my view, by no means reflect dissatisfaction on the part of the  Russian people over the fall of the communist regime or  nostalgia for the past. The majority, it would appear, have  already gauged the true price of "protest voting." People today  are not frightened by the advent of the market, but by the  degradation of the economy and the falling standard of living.  They are far less concerned by the verbal interchanges between  leaders of the multiplying parties and movements.    However, "political work" and the factional get-togethers  in the Duma will continue. I. Rybkin said that he sees nothing  reprehensible in such activity. The main thing is that a limit  is kept....    The time has come for people's deputies -- they must by no  means forget who elevated them to the parliamentary benches --  to slow down their pace for a moment and look back at the road  they have traveled in the first 100 days: a short road, but one  packed with events both in parliament and in a great country  which has acquired its own name once more. The formation of the  new, or to be more precise, long-forgotten, body in Russian  power is complete. For all its organizational difficulties,  failures, and inconsistency, and a certain degree of passivity  in its legislation, the Duma has not engaged in contemplation of  life, but is dynamically trying to realize its innate  intellectual potential.    In order not to put the evil eye on, and so doom to an  unenviable future, the present Duma, which is a mere 100 days  old and was born under the size of Sagittarius, which promises  success, it is being called a transitional parliament. Where  will the transition lead deputies and those who stand behind  them (the Russian people)? To oblivion once again, or to a  dignified existence? However banal it sounds, much depends on  us ourselves, on how demanding we are, on our civic activity.  After all, we ourselves elected this parliament.</p>

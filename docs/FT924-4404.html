			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Loan losses hit RBC earnings THE ROYAL Bank of Canada, after nearly doubling loan loss provisions in the fourth quarter, saw net income drop to CDollars 107.3m (USDollars 83.6m) for fiscal 1992, from CDollars 983m a year earlier. After preferred dividends, the country's biggest chartered bank showed a net loss of 5 cents a share, against profit of CDollars 2.92 a share in fiscal 1991. It had warned provisions would increase by CDollars 900m in the quarter, bringing the year's total to more than CDollars 2bn. More than half the extra provision related to the depressed Toronto property market. All the bank's estimated CDollars 780m exposure to Olympia &amp; York Developments was placed in the non-performing category. Mr Allan Taylor, chairman, said that, despite the severe problems in property and domestic corporate loans and CDollars 130m of restructuring costs, retail banking did well with strong growth in residential mortgages and personal savings business. The treasury group did well and the investment banking subsidiary posted record profits. International business was less profitable, partly due to higher provision. At October 31, total net non-performing loans were CDollars 3.5bn, up CDollars 1.4bn on a year earlier. The domestic loan portfolio accounted for CDollars 1.1bn of the increase. Total net loan loss provision stood at CDollars 2bn, against CDollars 605m a year earlier. The fourth-quarter net loss was CDollars 473m, or CDollars 1.63 a share, after the increase in provisions, against net income of CDollars 260m, or 75 cents, a year earlier. Total assets at October 31 were CDollars 138bn, up 4 per cent from a year earlier.</p>

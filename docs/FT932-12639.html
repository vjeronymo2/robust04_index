			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong at a record high as Nikkei weakens LATE SELLING led by the futures market pushed the Nikkei average lower in light volume, but overall share prices ended mixed, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed 80.52 down at 19,623.63, after trading between an intraday low of 19,562.90 and a high of 19,845.60. The Topix index of all first section issues ended 3.08 up at 1,535,77, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.33 to 1,214.27. Volume was estimated at 300m shares, compared with Friday's 311m. Declines led advances by 565 to 457, with 157 issues unchanged. Brokers said that pension and postal funds managed by the government provided support; but the early advance triggered by the flow of public funds lost momentum as late arbitrage-related sales entered the market. An equity analyst at a UK brokerage said investors remain cautious about taking long positions due to worries about the direction of the yen against the dollar. Market participants are also hoping that the G7 members will soon take steps to stabilise the yen's appreciation. He added that trading volume is traditionally thin and the Nikkei average's range limited shortly before next week's Golden Week holiday. Drug manufacturers moved higher on speculation that certain companies will benefit from a possible regrouping of the industry. Fujisawa Pharmaceutical climbed Y20 to Y1,030 and Nippon Chemiphar Y12 to Y884. Investors bought non-ferrous metals issues following the recent rise in gold prices. Sumitomo Metal and Mining, the most active issue of the day, advanced Y63 to Y990, while Mitsui Mining and Smelting added Y14 at Y510. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which formerly led the market, appreciated Y11,000 to Y923,000. Consumer electronic issues advanced, TDK by Y80 to Y3,910, Pioneer Electronic Y50 to 2,420 and Sony Y30 to Y4,730. In Osaka, the OSE average improved 21.46 to 21,429.49 in volume of 12.4m shares. Roundup THERE were some significant movers among the region's markets yesterday. HONG KONG soared to an all-time high on hopes of an agreement over the colony's future, as China and Britain agreed to hold a second round of talks following the three-days of negotiations which concluded in Beijing on Saturday. The Hang Seng index rose 94.81, or 1.4 per cent, to 6,845.75. Although officials have declined to announce details of the talks, investors see the developments as positive for equities. Turnover swelled to HKDollars 6.4bn from HKDollars 4.1bn, boosted by an HKDollars 1.27bn placement by Wharf Holdings on Friday. Mr Peter Bristowe at HG Asia in London said the improvement in sentiment caused investors to focus on blue chips which had been underperforming. SINGAPORE firmed on gains in the shipyard and banking sectors. The Straits Times Industrial index climbed 24.19 to 1,797.26 in volume of 275.3m shares. Traders said interest had shifted from Malaysian shares to second and third tier Singapore issues. AUSTRALIA surged to its highest close since January 1990 in spite of the fact that only Victoria and Tasmania were open for business, with other centres closed for the Anzac holiday. The All Ordinaries index rose 7.5 to 1,710.1 in low turnover of ADollars 162m. BANGKOK was unsettled by reports that investigations into alleged share manipulation had been widened. The SET index fell 17.58, or nearly 2 per cent, to 883.68 in low turnover of Bt3.74bn. TAIWAN eased, with weakness evident in the banking sector following the postponement of First Commercial Bank's dividend. The weighted index closed 14.53 lower at 4,547.78 in thin turnover of TDollars 31.7bn. First Commercial Bank lost TDollars 4 to TDollars 149. MANILA recovered momentum in late trading, with a gain in PLDT lifting the market overall. The composite index firmed 5.42 to 1,552.41. PLDT added 20 pesos at 955 pesos. Turnover was 333.9m pesos. KUALA LUMPUR saw further profit-taking in the afternoon but the composite index managed a rise of 1.79 to 693.44. Turnover came to 510m shares, against Friday's 345.7m. BOMBAY remained weak, with a fall in the BSE index of 63.86 to 2,036.81.</p>

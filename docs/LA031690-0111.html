			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORIZKOVA'S EYES. CHER'S CHEEKBONES. BASINGER'S LIPS.;  </P> <P> A SURGICAL SEARCH FOR THE IDEAL FACE  </P> <P> Paulina Porizkova's eyes. Jaclyn Smith's nose. Cher's cheekbones. Kim  Basinger's lips. Put 'em together and you've got the ideal face. At least, the  latest version. The physical features of these famous faces are on the current  list of perfection among many women who want to change their own natural  features through plastic surgery.  </P> <P> As few as 10 years ago, the list was entirely different. In 1980, the nose of  note was slim and straight, inspired by one actress Candice Bergen was born  with. Ten years before that, it was upturned with a pinched tip, based on that  of super-model Cheryl Tiegs. Like fads in clothing, hair styles and makeup,  trends in cosmetic surgery change regularly, doctors say.  </P> <P> Of today's most desirable facial details, prominent cheekbones and pouty lips  top the list. In contrast, Porizkova's large, slightly hooded eyes and Smith's  narrow nose are considered classics that never really go out of style, experts  note.  </P> <P> Doctors also say that the prized facial proportions are relatively easy to  attain through cosmetic surgery.  </P> <P> High set, well-defined cheekbones, for example, are achieved with soft plastic  implants inserted through incisions made inside the mouth or under the lower  eyelid. The procedure costs about $1,800 in Southern California and takes less  than an hour. Cheekbone, or malar, implants can be removed, but the surgery is  generally thought of as a permanent procedure. Take out the implants and the  face returns to its original form.  </P> <P> Requests for surgically inserted "cheekbones" started rolling in during the  mid-'80s, when Cher's film career took off and her highly articulated bone  structure captured audience attention. Apple-cheeked actress Linda Evans of  "Dynasty" had a similarly inspiring effect when her night-time soap was  must-viewing during most of the last decade.  </P> <P> Ten years earlier, members of the American Society of Plastic and  Reconstructive Surgeons reported virtually no cheek- or lip-augmentation  procedures. But in 1988, when the society last surveyed its doctors, more than  3,000 cheekbone augmentations had been reported. Although no figures are yet  available, many doctors indicate that requests for cheekbone implants have  doubled in the last year.  </P> <P> Augmenting the mouth is a temporary procedure done by injecting liquid collagen  or human fat cells into the lips. The 15-minute treatment, which costs about  $500, lasts about three months, or until the natural substances are absorbed by  the body and the mouth returns to its normal contours.  </P> <P> Many doctors say they discourage permanent silicone injections into the lips,  in part because they see it as a fad that will soon become dated. In 1988,  society surgeons were not reporting significant numbers of lip augmentations.  But last year, when actress Barbara Hershey appeared in the film "Beaches" with  seductive, Basinger-esque lips -- a mouth considerably fuller than in any of  her previous films -- the trend was born.  </P> <P> "It's especially popular with women under age 30: They want to look like  fashion models," says Dr. John Williams, a clinical instructor at the UCLA  School of Medicine and a plastic surgeon in private practice for 25 years.  Williams is one of the doctors who predicts that the full lip look will soon be  outdated. "That's when many of the women who had injections will be glad it was  temporary," he says.  </P> <P> Although women are requesting augmented cheekbones, their goal is not to  achieve the gaunt, hollow-cheeked effect that was in demand 10 years ago. "In  those days, some women had their back teeth removed to create the sunken cheek  look," says Dr. Alfred Cohen, a facial plastic surgeon and partner in Beverly  Hills' Lasky Clinic. "Now they want fuller cheeks and stronger angles."  </P> <P> For some women, fuller cheeks means fat or collagen injections directly into  the cheek area; for others, small pouches of silicone gel are placed under the  cheekbones to create a youthful fullness. "The young girls -- the 20- to  30-year-olds -- still come in for hollow cheeks, but the 40- to 50-year-olds  want more fullness so they don't look haggard as they age," says Encino's Dr.  Walter Dishell, an assistant clinical professor of facial plastic surgery at  UCLA.  </P> <P> The current most desirable chin, says Los Angeles plastic surgeon George Semel,  projects slightly short of the tip of the nose -- as seen in Jaclyn Smith's  facial proportions. The chin line should be firm, with the jawline clearly  defined. In many cases an implant can achieve this look -- at an average cost  of $1,800.  </P> <P> To get rid of any signs of a double chin that may exist, the leading method is  now liposuction, a fat suctioning technique introduced in 1981 that is used to  slim body contours. "We can actually use liposuction to sculpt a jawline and  neck, because instruments today are so refined," says Semel.  </P> <P> In part, the trend toward implants and other augmentations, rather than  removals, is a result of new technical advances in the field of plastic  surgery, explains Dr. Richard Fleming, co-chairman of facial plastic and  reconstructive surgery department at the USC School of Medicine.  </P> <P> "The '90s will definitely be the decade of augmentation," he says. "For years  we found ways to tighten skin over the existing bony structure, and we were  limited by what nature put there. Now we can use implants to change that  underlying structure."  </P> <P> Jan Varner, president of Santa Barbara-based McGhan Medical, which supplies  silicone implants to surgeons, says the trendy augmentation procedures "have  increased sales of implants tenfold in the last five years."  </P> <P> Although most augmentations are done with standard implants, many doctors are  now ordering customized designs, shaped precisely to fit the patient and to  achieve the desired look. Varner reports that customized implants are available  for the cheekbones, forehead, nose, chin and jaw line.  </P> <P> Ethical surgeons are quick to warn patients that despite new technological  developments, results are still limited by nature's original design. "When they  bring in pictures of Paulina or Jaclyn Smith, I'm frank," says Dishell. "I tell  them they've brought in pictures of two of the most beautiful women in the  world, and that I can only work with what they've got to begin with. That  sobers them. I call it the 'doctrine of realistic expectations.' "  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Division of the Black Sea Fleet: </F> "Who Owes Whom?"]    [Text] According to the data of expert analyses performed  by specialists of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the  Main Ecological Inspection, and the corresponding services of  the Crimean Republic and the city of Sevastopol in the framework  of the fulfillment of Section II of Presidential Directive  No.110/93 of 11 October 1993, total losses from possible  economic consequences due to the presence of the Russian  Federation's Black Sea Fleet on the territory of Ukraine will  constitute 53 million karbovantsi a year. Every day, the sewage  discharged, without purification, from the fleet's boats into  the Sevastopol Bay alone amounts to 1,000 cubic meters.    The Black Sea Fleet fuel storage (Military Unit 62709) is  the  main polluter of the Sevastopol Bay with petroleum products.  Subsurface water, soil, and the sea bottom have been polluted.  Today, the Sevastopol Bay is practically dead. It must be  cleared of metal scrap: About 30 ships, as well as munitions,  spare parts, and so on lie on the bottom. One-third of all the  land occupied by the Black Sea Fleet bases needs to be  recultivated. There are four million cubic meters of  contaminated subsurface waters. According to tentative expert  estimates by specialists of the Ministry of Environmental  Protection, the cost of the elimination of the harm inflicted on  the environment as a result of the activity of the Black Sea  Fleet units and facilities in the Sevastopol Bay constitutes  $3.432 million, and the total cost for all places where the  Black Sea Fleet is stationed on the territory of Ukraine is  $17.160 million.    Yet another round of negotiations on the division of the  Black Sea Fleet has ended without any results. The Russian side  continues to insist on getting the shore structure of the Black  Sea Fleet. The cost of the entire fleet is estimated at between  $5 billion and $6 billion, whereas the ecological aspect of the  problem is not even put on the agenda. Well, who must pay whom?</p>

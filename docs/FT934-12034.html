			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Healthcare behind expansion at Shiloh GROWTH IN its healthcare operations helped Shiloh report profits before tax more than doubled, from Pounds 201,000 to Pounds 490,000, for the half year to October 2. Sales rose 84 per cent to Pounds 13.4m. The Lancashire-based group has expanded from its original textile spinning activities and as well as heathcare also takes in protective clothing and packaging businesses. Mr Edmund Gartside, chairman, said that healthcare now represented 55 per cent of group turnover and 71 per cent of profits. Textiles had shown a 'modest improvement' he said and the initial signs of recovery in the sector were apparent. Packaging, on the other hand, was flat although some improvement was expected in the second half. The interim dividend goes up to 1p (0.875p), payable from earnings of 5.75p (2.36p) per share.</p>

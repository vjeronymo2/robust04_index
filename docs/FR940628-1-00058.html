The purposes of the proposed rule are to improve compliance with the form submittal requirements of the RRA and the Acreage Limitation Rules and Regulations (43 CFR Part 426), help ensure that irrigation water is delivered only to eligible landholders, and recoup administrative costs Reclamation incurs in conjunction with noncompliance with these requirements. The proposed rule revises the existing rules by adding a section that will impose fees on districts when statutory and regulatory requirements concerning the submittal of forms are not met. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be submitted on or before August 29, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments must be submitted to J.

In order to ensure compliance with the ownership limitations and the limitations on subsidies, certain statutory and regulatory requirements must be met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One of these requirements applies to all landholders whose landholdings in districts subject to the acreage limitation provisions total more than 40 acres. These landholders must complete RRA certification or reporting forms prior to receipt of irrigation water. The forms must be completed annually and submitted to each district in which the landholder receives irrigation water. Landholders must disclose on the forms all the land they own and lease directly or indirectly in Reclamation projects that are subject to the acreage limitation provisions. The forms must be resubmitted whenever a landholding change occurs. If a landholding does not change, a verification statement to that effect must be submitted each year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the RRA and 43 CFR Part 426 set limits on the receipt of irrigation water and establish requirements that must be met in order to receive such water, the current rules do not address situations in which water has been delivered to landholders who failed to meet all the requirements. These situations were not addressed because the RRA does not contemplate such deliveries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Districts, rather than Reclamation, generally control the deliveries of irrigation water to landholders. Pursuant to their contracts with the United States, the districts are legally obligated not to deliver irrigation water to landholders who do not meet the eligibility requirements in the RRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the form requirements discussed previously, 43 CFR 426.10(k) specifically states that failure by landholders to submit the required certification or reporting form(s) will result in loss of eligibility to receive irrigation water. However, during its water district reviews, Reclamation has found that in some instances, districts have delivered irrigation water to landholders who had failed to meet the form requirements and other requirements of the law and rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1988, Reclamation adopted a compensation policy whereby full-cost charges were assessed for irrigation water that had been delivered to ineligible landholders. This policy is based on the legal theory that when irrigation water is delivered to ineligible recipients, it is an unlawful conversion of the Government's property interest in the water, and the Government is therefore entitled to be compensated for the conversion. Since Reclamation cannot recover the water that was delivered to the ineligible recipients, it has been Reclamation's position that it is entitled to recover the value of its property interest in that water and that the full-cost water rate prescribed in the RRA is an appropriate measure of the water's value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

In Hebron, a protest  rally was staged against the curfew on the town and the massacre  at the Cave of the Patriarchs. Although there were some clashes  in the morning, later in the day the Israeli security forces  refrained from intervening.    A 28-year-old blind Palestinian from Gaza has died in  hospital from wounds after being shot, reportedly in error, by  the Border Police. The man, Ahmad Ali, who came from the  al-Shaja'iyah neighborhood, apparently got caught up in an  exchange of fire when gunmen attacked the Border Police.</p>

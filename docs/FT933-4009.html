			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Christies benefits from weaker pound and improves to Pounds 7m STERLING'S depreciation helped Christies International, the auctioneer, to advance pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.11m to Pounds 7.06m in the six months to June 30. Sir Anthony Tennant, its new chairman, said: 'A substantial proportion of this increase is associated with the effect of sterling's depreciation during the last year, but it is pleasing to note that underlying sales grew by 4 per cent in the period.' Turnover rose to Pounds 64.8m (Pounds 51.4m), helped by a Pounds 5.65m first-time contribution from Spink &amp; Son, the fine art dealer acquired in April. Sir Anthony said: 'While we are encouraged by these signs of improvement, we are seeing relatively modest results in certain other categories where some owners have been slow to regain the confidence to consign works of art to the market.' Cost controls had contributed to the profits improvement, with last year's efficiency programme continuing to bring benefits. The increase in March of the 'buyer's premium', a commission paid on purchases, had improved margins. Sales growth had been strengthened by demand for 19th and 20th century pictures, with impressionist and modern pictures achieving a 57 per cent increase. The company said highlights included Monet's La jetee du Havre, which sold for Dollars 9.7m (Pounds 6.29m) in New York and Renoir's Jeune Fille portant une Corbeille de Fleurs, which fetched Dollars 5.7m in London. Jewellery sales had also improved substantially, as did volume in a number of decorative art departments. Demand also hardened in the middle market, with sales at Christie's South Kensington rising by 22 per cent. The interim dividend is unchanged at 0.5p. Earnings per share were 2.51p (0.7p).</p>

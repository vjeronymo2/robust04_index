			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 445] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, Feb 25, ELTA -- "There is no necessity to  stop the second reactor of Ignalina nuclear plant", Povilas  Vaisnys, head of Lithuania's State Nuclear Agency Inspectorate  VATESI, told ELTA.    "If Lithuania had troubles to get electricity from other  sources, the reactor would not be stopped", he said.    A little amount of steam can leak because of bad sealed  measurers of flow in the technological channel. It does not  hinder safe exploitation of the reactor at all, Vaisnys said.    Anyway, the reactor is to be stopped on Friday, 9.00 p.m.  Vaisnys said there was a need to know the reasons even of such a  little radioactive leak.    He mentioned one more reason of the stoppage - the first  reactor is due to be stopped next month for routine repairs and  "we need to be sure the second reactor operates without  problems".</p>

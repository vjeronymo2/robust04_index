			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / US pace of growth may ease The US economy grew strongly last month, but the pace of growth could ease in the new year, figures for industrial orders and personal spending indicated yesterday. The Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods rose 3.4 per cent between October and November, twice the increase projected by most analysts. However, two thirds of the increase reflected a surge in orders for transport equipment - a volatile sector. Excluding transport, orders rose 0.8 per cent and by 13.9 per cent in the year to November. Consumer spending rose 0.5 per cent in real terms last month following a 0.6 per cent gain in October. Spending on durable goods surged for the second month running, increasing 1.9 per cent in real terms after a 2.3 per cent increase in October. Spending on services was more subdued, rising only 0.1 per cent. The strong demand for durable goods, typically bought on credit, may reflect fears that short-term interest rates will rise sharply after Christmas as the Federal Reserve renews attempts to curb the pace of economic growth. Yesterday's figures, however, raised doubts about the sustainability of personal spending. After-tax personal incomes fell 0.3 per cent in real terms last month, following a 1.3 per cent gain in October. The personal savings rate fell to 4.1 per cent, historically a very low level.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Ireland obsessed by currency issues - Speculation on a devaluation of the punt has been moving equities Having suffered a gloomy 1992, the ISEQ overall index falling by 11 per cent, the Irish equity market faces a deepening recession this year, overshadowed by the ongoing currency crisis, high interest rates and the prospect of a sharp increase in unemployment. Bearish forecasts for the market currently outnumber the bulls; but all hinges upon whether one views the government's current no-devaluation policy as the one most likely to bring down interest rates in the short term, and whether sterling will strengthen to take the pressure off the punt. This, in turn, depends upon one's views of the UK and German economies for the year ahead. After sterling abandoned the European exchange rate mechanism last September, the punt came under heavy pressure, forcing up interest rates and exhausting the government's currency reserves. The Irish stock market fell to its 1992 low of 1,095 in October. In November, following the realignments of the peseta and escudo, equities rallied on the expectations of an imminent devaluation of the punt, the index gaining 18.5 per cent and closing the year at 1,227. The government, however, held its nerve, pushing interest rates still higher to maintain the punt's parity within the ERM, and the speculators lost theirs - until they came back in force yesterday. The ISEQ, having wavered around 1,220 for some time, got excited again yesterday and rose 31.21 to 1,264.33. After four months of querulous support for its policies, the government now faces a rising howl of protests from farmers and business leaders and a growing pile of reports from economists, who are saying that the economic costs of defending the punt in terms of ruined businesses and lost jobs are not worth paying. This week, Mr John Bruton, the leader of the parliamentary opposition, nailed his flag to the devaluation mast, accusing the government of having lost control of the economy. Three of the four main stockbroking firms in Dublin are now forecasting further falls in the market in 1993 if the government does not devalue. NCB brokers say a no-devaluation scenario would result in a 'significant negative effect' on Irish corporate earnings and that 'domestic and foreign institutions will be wary of investing in assets that might ultimately lose relative value if a devaluation were eventually forced'. Davy Stockbrokers, having produced a bullish prediction of 20 to 30 per cent growth for 1993 last December on the assumption of a realignment of the sterling/punt rate to 0.98 (currently 1.09) in the new year, have been throwing those forecasts out of the window and issuing profits warnings for Irish companies. Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of research at Davy, says: 'If the government does stick to its no-devaluation policy, there can be little hope for growth this year.' Mr Dan McLaughlin, chief economist at Riada stockbrokers, says: 'The outlook depends very heavily on whether there is a devaluation or not. I strongly believe there will be. The measures that have been put forward are dealing with the symptoms, not the problem itself. The exchange rate has become the policy in itself, instead of a policy tool to adjust to what the economy requires. If there is a devaluation, then Irish equities look very cheap on their current p/e rating of 12 and there would be a significant rally of maybe 20 per cent.' The countervailing view comes from Mr Mike Moroney, head of research at Good-body's, the stockbroking arm of Allied Irish Banks in Dublin. 'We believe devaluation is not the panacea that others are expecting. The UK and US equity markets have been driven up by the expectation of a rapid reduction in interest rates. Even with a realignment in the ERM, our rates will still be tied to those of Germany, and there is likely to be an interest rate penalty of devaluation which could last 18 months to two years before they drop significantly.' He thinks German rates will soon fall by as much as two percentage points, and that the Irish market would perform better in a no-devaluation scenario. Leaving currency and interest rate predictions aside, all identify an underlying 'technical problem' in the market. With the progressive abandonment of exchange controls, Irish institutions have been diversifying their portfolios out of Irish equities and into foreign ones. Irish pension funds reduced the level of Irish equities in their portfolios to 23 per cent last year from 28 per cent in 1991, and from a high of 34 per cent in 1989. This move does not reflect a view that either the market or companies on the market are poor value in their own right, says Davy. 'Rather, it reflects the fact that the menu offered to investors in the Dublin market is a limited one.'</p>

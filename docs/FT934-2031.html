			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Austerity pledge for Venezuelans Mr Rafael Caldera, Venezuela's president-elect, has vowed to establish 'a government of austerity' when he assumes power in February. Mr Caldera, 77, speaking after he was proclaimed president-elect on Tuesday, will take over an economy suffering annual inflation of around 44 per cent and a fiscal gap estimated at Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) this year. The government must also cope with declining receipts from oil exports, which provide most of its revenues. Mr Caldera said he would reduce spending by the presidential bureaucracy and cut the 1994 central government budget. He also promised to minimise spending carried out via secret government accounts. These accounts were the undoing of Venezuela's last elected president, Mr Carlos Andres Perez, who was forced to leave office this year to face charges that he improperly used Dollars 17m from a confidential account earmarked for security and defence. Venezuelans also voted for a new National Congress, but official results have not been published. Preliminary tallies by the largest political parties indicate that it will be split into four big factions.</p>

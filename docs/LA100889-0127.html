			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FLORA OF THE VALLEY: TELEGRAPH WEED  </P> <P> A member of the sunflower family, telegraph weed is a tall, hairy herb that  blooms year-round along roadsides and in other open spaces in Southern  California.  </P> <P> The plant reaches heights of 7 feet and is strongly aromatic. The odor reminds  one of creosote.  </P> <P> Telegraph weed (Heterotheca grandiflora) does not have spectacular blossoms but  the flowers, which grow in dense clusters near the tops of erect stems, do add  splashes of color to otherwise bleak outdoor landscapes.  </P> <P> The flat-topped yellow flowers are small, only about an inch across. They are  supported by numerous narrow, green bracts.  </P> <P> The flowers of camphor weed, the only other of the species Heterotheca in  California, are even smaller.  </P> <P> Telegraph weed's leaves grow abundantly on the stout stems. They are grayish  green, oval-shaped and up to three inches long. The leaves are slightly  toothed, have short white hairs on both sides and droop at night.  </P> <P> Telegraph weed is a common sight in coastal sage scrub, chaparral and southern  oak woodland plant communities. It can be found in Southern California  mountains along hiking trails and along fire breaks but only at lower  elevations. It also grows in the central part of the state.  </P> <P> The plant was given its common name because of the long, straight stems that  resemble telegraph poles.  </P></p>

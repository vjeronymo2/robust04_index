			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Chou Wen-chiang (0719 2429 1730): </F> "Guangdong Destroys Pirated Audio, Video Products"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 21 Apr (WEN WEI PO)--Guangdong has  achieved preliminary success in joint operations against pirated  audio and video products. This morning, the Guangzhou City  Copyright Bureau, together with the public security department,  the industry and commerce department, the radio and television  department, the culture department, and the city administration  publicly destroyed all seized pirated audio and video products.    According to incomplete statistics, as of 1200 on 20 April,  1,657 stalls and shops had been inspected across the province,  and over 140,000 counterfeit compact discs, 1,322 laser discs,  and more than 85,000 audio and video tapes had been seized.  Operations were particularly large in scale in such key areas  as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. In Guangzhou's [as  published] case , it launched "Implement the Copyright Rights  Law and Protect Intellectual Property Rights Week" across the  province on 19 April.    This morning, industry and commerce, culture, and  broadcasting departments gathered together at a work site at the  Guangzhou Yuexiu Hotel with pirated audio and video products  seized from markets in raids which took place from 19 to 20  April, and an 11-tonne road roller repeatedly crushed the goods  into pieces. Guangzhou Vice Mayor Guo Xiangyang, Vice Secretary  General Li Zhiyuan, and others were present at the site. It is  said that in the first day of operations on 19 April, Guangzhou  sent a total of 921 personnel on several occasions, inspected  407 stalls and shops selling audio and video products, and  seized a total of 63,248 fake compact discs, laser discs, and  tapes. Today's destruction will have a deterrent effect on  piracy.    At present, all areas across Guangdong are continuing the  crack down in light of their actual situations. Relevant  quarters in the province are formulating a series of measures to  strengthen the regular management of the processing,  reproduction, wholesaling, and retailing of audio and video  products. It is learned that after regulating the province's 16  laser disc [including compact disc] producing businesses,  Guangdong will place them under the management of the  information and publication departments. The Provincial  Copyright Bureau has already formulated Copyright Verification  and Registration Regulations for the reproduction of compact  discs. In the future, "two licenses" will be required for the  wholesaling and sale of audio and video products, namely, no one  can get a business license unless one has already obtained a  business approval license from the relevant department. Customs  will also step up antismuggling operations against audio and  video products and stop the flow of illegal foreign publications  into the country.</p>

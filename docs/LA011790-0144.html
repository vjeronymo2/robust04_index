			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> HAYES OPTS FOR 'STAGE CENTER'  </P> <P> Helen Hayes stood on a sidewalk in the theater district and picked a spot for  her plaque in a Broadway Walk of Stars.  </P> <P> "I think stage center is where I'd like it," the 89-year-old actress said after  looking up at an overhang to determine the center in front of a new Holiday Inn  being dedicated in April.  </P> <P> The first plaque pictures a Tony Award and includes Hayes' name; her category,  best actress; the play, "Happy Birthday"; and the year, 1947, the first year of  Tony Awards.  </P> <P> Other plaques will be placed on sidewalks throughout the theater district,  rather than in a continuous line like the Hollywood Walk of Fame, said Meredith  Pillon, a Holiday Inn spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Pillon said Tuesday the League of American Theatres and Producers, the American  Theatre Wing, the Broadway Assn. and Holiday Inn are hoping to begin the  project with about 200 plaques.  </P></p>

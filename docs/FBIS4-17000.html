			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 21 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia's revival is  impossible without the revival of the army. This is what  Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation Council, thinks.  However, as he stressed today in a conversation with the  ITAR-TASS correspondent, there can be no question of  strengthening the army while we are indulging in populist  gestures and exempting hundreds of thousands of young people  from army service.    Vladimir Shumeyko visited the Taman motorized rifle division  today. He acquainted himself with the problems of the guards'  formation, and talked to the servicemen.    In keeping with the legislation which is in effect, some 200  restrictions exist which, according to the speaker of  parliament's upper chamber, do not allow the army to be manned  with a sufficiently large contingent of conscripts. "Of 1.5  million young men, we need to call up at least 700,000, and not  200,000 which is the current figure. We cannot go on putting up  with this situation," Vladimir Shumeyko thinks. He noted that a  "military package" of laws will soon be analyzed in the  Federation Council in order to introduce changes relating to  conscription into military service.</p>

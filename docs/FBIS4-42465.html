			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "tom/APA": "Klestil: `Not a Moment of Lone </F> Action'"]    [Text] Vienna -- Regarding Austria's membership in the  European Union [EU], the Austrian people will be exposed to a  serious test of their identity. It will also show their  contradictory character.    On the one hand, the people are "European champions  regarding  patriotism." As many as 79 percent see themselves "solely as  Austrians," no more than 17 percent "also as Europeans." On the  other hand, only one-third of the citizens (two-thirds in  Switzerland) believe that "their own political system is very  good." One-third of the Austrians even find "their system" bad.    This information was given by university professors Fritz  Plasser and Ernst Bruckmueller at the beginning of a symposium  of the Industrialists' Association (IV) in Vienna on "Austria's  Identity in a Larger Europe." The consequences are obvious for  political scientists and historians. They say that there is  remarkable "inner resistance" against the EU and against what is  new.  <H5>  Excessive Burden </H5>   The European integration process calls the image Austrians  have of themselves (culture, great scenery, but not quite the  managerial skills of the Germans) into question and will lead to  "an excessive burden on decisionmaking."    Against this background, outstanding individuals made  statements in the discussion -- Cardinal Franz Koenig, Theo  Sommer, publisher of DIE ZEIT and a former planning chief in the  Bonn Defense Ministry under chancellor Willy Brandt, the  historian Brigitte Hamann, director Helmut Felderer of the  Institute for Higher Studies, and Polish Ambassador Bartoszewski.    President Thomas Klestil made his first comprehensive  statement prior to the referendum and called upon Austrians to  demonstrate solidarity. He said that this was "not the time of  pursuing party politics or acquiring personal status at the  expense of European policy." Nor was it "a test run" for  parliamentary elections or a "reminder regarding problems that  are not at issue."    The president said he wished to see "all those" gather "who  are convinced of the urgency of a larger, common Europe" and  form a "group of responsible and farsighted Austrians." In the  postwar era, the Austrians in particular had proved to  themselves and to the world that unity is strength. This had  been demonstrated most recently in Brussels when the agreement  was concluded.  <H5>  Developing Tolerance </H5>   Klestil said the Austrians did not have to be afraid of  Europe, because "no other membership candidate has ever been  better prepared than we." It should also be stressed that "we  will not lose our identity." The "really great task" in the EU  would be that Austria "will bring in the values of tolerance and  the many colors of a multicultural society."    Industry Association secretary general Franz Ceska warned  about "a strange mixture" of "fearfulness and pompousness."  People should not let themselves be influenced by a feeling of  uncertainty. However, EU membership was "indispensable" for the  country's industry, he said.    Johannes Voggenhuber, spokesman for the Greens on EU  affairs,  on 30 May criticized the government once again for "making  propaganda instead of providing real information." He said that  copies of the membership treaties for the citizens were out of  print.    Freedom Party secretary general Karl-Heinz Grasser spoke  about attempts at blackmailing the citizens. "Regarding  democracy," EU membership would be "a relapse into the 19th  century."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus held talks with  Danish and Finnish prime ministers at the World Economic Forum  in Davos yesterday. During the talks, Prime Minister Klaus  distanced himself from the opinion voiced by Finnish Prime  Minister Esko Aho, according to whom the emergence of large  European companies might help in coping with American and Asian  economic competition. Prime Minister Klaus rejected this idea  pertaining, according to him, to the fifties and sixties, saying  that small companies are more competitive than clumsy and  bureaucratic colossi.    Later on during the talks, Klaus said that talks between  current and future members of the European Union had revealed  unanimity in many areas, as well as some fine differences of  opinion in some others. According to him, the Czech Republic  can enrich European integration thanks to its experience from  the former regime. West Europe does not share this past, and  therefore it does not perceive some of the matters so sharply.</p>

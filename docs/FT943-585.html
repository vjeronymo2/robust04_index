			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper and aluminium lead afternoon rally at LME - Market Report All base metals clawed away from earlier lows in afternoon trading at the London Metal Exchange yesterday when flurries of renewed speculative interest emerged after copper and aluminium held above support. COPPER snapped to a high of Dollars 2,562 a tonne for three months delivery before drifting back to Dollars 2,558, still down on Monday's Dollars 2,564 close but up from its low of Dollars 2,554. Continuing consumer interest and support just below Dollars 1,600 a tonne saw the three months ALUMINIUM price chase higher on the back of short-covering. It finally settled at the day's high of Dollars 1,615, a gain of Dollars 7 from Monday's close. NICKEL prices moved higher with copper but the market never fully recovered from its earlier mauling following the announcement of another sizeable LME stocks rise. ZINC followed the same pattern and climbed from its low of Dollars 1,026 a tonne to end the day at Dollars 1,031 a tonne, a Dollars 14 loss overall.

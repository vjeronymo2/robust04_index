			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Arts: Robin, Prince of Sherwood - Theatre Corny to the core, and wet behind the ears, this new rock musical might just become a hit. No, there is not an original bone in its body - but not a mean one either. And almost half its rock songs have an expansively lyrical instinct that is appealing. The music and lyrics are by Rick Fenn and Peter Howarth, and almost every song is well delivered. Bill Kenwright's staging puts music and characters first, without any flash scenic effects. And - another plus - Robin, Marion and the Sheriff are all good-looking. Still, this is a wholly formulaic show. And you know the formula - it is Lloyd Webber's. You mix idealism (feared by the bad, loved by the good, Robin Hood), romance (Maid Marion), crooks (the Sheriff) and comedy (Friar Tuck). You tell it with plenty of tongue-in-cheek anachronisms (the outlaws click their fingers and put on shades to sing their 'Hanging Around' number). And you go overboard on pastiche; the authors of Robin, Prince of Sherwood mean to remind you of songs from Presley down to Whitney Houston. If Robin, Prince of Sherwood fails, it will be because it has not followed the prescription well enough. It does not make enough of its story's suspense; or of Maid Marian; or of Robin's idealistic cause. (Instead, in an effort to create some cynical rock fun, it links the Sheriff to the she-devil Morgana.) Early on, a crusaders' song erroneously makes Richard the Lionheart also ruler of Scotland, Wales and Ireland ('It's us lot that make Britain great'): does this mean to have its tongue in its cheek or not? As for Robin's words, they only stop being corny when they are blatantly anachronistic. 'Nottingham' rhymes with both 'dan' and 'flame,' "Morgana' with both 'Indiana (Jones)' and 'Copacabana (Club).' Get the idea? Lloyd Webber would have more sheer nerve; nor would he have handled so predictable a subject. But with the outlaws' 'Hanging Around' number the audience at last can relax and have an intermittently good time. Fenn and Howarth know how to write ensembles - how to build a vocal fabric from differing layers of melody and rhythm. The big number - 'Call Me Robin Hood' - has only one big line, but that makes its effect potently, like a wave crashing. And a little adjustment would actually help other numbers to work better. (The outlaws' 'The lights grow dim' needs less Caribbean 4/6 accompaniment beneath it, and more powerful singing from Little John in his big arching entry.) As Robin, Mike Holloway has looks and voice; he carries the show. I wish, though, that he led it more like an actor who believed in the world onstage, less like a cute TV compere. Peter Howarth not only co-wrote Robin, he also plays the Sheriff. He carries his cuteness with properly melodramatic Mad Max flair, but I don't care for a crook who is less interested in bashing the poor than in diabolism. And surely it would be better to have a baddie who sang in a plainly lower register than Robin? Richard the Lionheart is a dud. Yes, anyone can see the many ways in which Robin Prince of Sherwood could easily be better; and no-one who likes theatre to be spontaneous and persuasive will go near it anyway. Yet it really let actors sing. Full of holes, but full of beans. At the Piccadilly Theatre</p>

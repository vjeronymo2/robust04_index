			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: It is public knowledge that Syria will  settle for nothing short of an Israeli pullout from the entire  Golan Heights and south Lebanon. Full withdrawal is the  linchpin of peace. Whoever cares for a just and inclusive peace  settlement in the Middle East must satisfy the conditions on  which the peace initiative was launched -- the point of  reference laid out by the Madrid conference. Since the Madrid  conference, Israel been shown to be evasive as far as meeting  the conditions required to establish peace. There is no  shortage of Israel's evasive tactics: Unabated settlement  building activity, stepped up repression of Palestinians under  occupation, population displacements, killings, detentions,  falsification of facts, and a defamation effort against Syria  and Lebanon under pretexts that the U.S. Administration and the  world community know are flimsy. The United States and the  world community recognize that it is Israel that must take the  blame for the logjam in the peace process.    No fair-minded person anywhere in the world will concur with  Israel's definition of resistance inside Palestinian land or in  the Golan Heights and south Lebanon as terrorism. The Israeli  Government has never passed up an opportunity to dilute the  Madrid conference formula and the requirements of a just and  comprehensive peace. To advance that goal, Israel has pursued  separate deals and abridged solutions, like the Oslo agreement  and the subsequent Cairo accord, which, in effect, imposed  Israel's tutelage over the Palestinian Arab people. The  Gaza-Jericho agreement, hobbled by demeaning constraints and  deviating from UN Security Council resolutions and the Madrid  conference that envisaged the removal of occupation and the  establishment of an independent Palestinian state on Palestinian  soil, undervalues the rights and dignity and future prospects  for the Palestinian people. It is therefore, not surprising to  see growing opposition to the agreement in the Palestinian body  politic. This in itself is a virtual plebiscite on the option  of separate deals and a reconfirmation of the notion that a  combination of the Madrid formula and the Security Council  Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 is the only game in town for the  eliminatiion of tension and instability from the region. That  notion was best summed up by the paper submitted by Syria at the  sixth round of the Washington peace talks.    Things became even clearer at the Geneva summit between  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. It emerged then  that for a just and inclusive peace to come to the region,  Israel must pull out from all the occupied territories. That  much was resiterated by His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad  to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier this  month. The president impressed on the U.S. secretary the  urgency of addressing the core issues if the stalled peace  process is to move forward.    The question arises as to whether Christopher's next Middle  East tour will break new ground. Will he bring Israel around to  addressing core issues and observing UN resolutions and obliging  the the international community's will for a just peace in which  all the interested parties are involved?</p>

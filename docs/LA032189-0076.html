			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIVEN A CHOICE, THEY HAVE TO GO FOR THE TAR HEELS  </P> <P> When it comes to basketball, is North Carolina really the Tar Heel state?  </P> <P> The answer, overwhelmingly, is yes. In this state, they do polls on subjects  like that.  </P> <P> Recently, a Chapel Hill marketing firm did a random telephone survey of 520  adults, asking the following question: "If all of the following teams were  playing on television at the same time, but not playing each other, which would  you watch: Duke Blue Devils, N.C. State Wolfpack, Charlotte Hornets, Carolina  Tar Heels or Wake Forest Demon Deacons?"  </P> <P> The results: North Carolina, 34%; N.C. State, 19%; Charlotte and Duke, 12%, and  Wake Forest, 3%. A total of 20% said they "don't know."  </P> <P> The Tar Heels carried every region of the state except Charlotte, where the  Hornets had a 32%-26% edge. JEFF FELLENZER  </P></p>

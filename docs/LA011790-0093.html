			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SINGAPORE AIR ORDERS JETS WORTH $8.6 BILLION;  </P> <P> AEROSPACE: BOEING WILL GET THE LION'S SHARE OF THE ORDERS, BUT THE AIRLINE ALSO  ORDERED MD-11S FROM MCDONNELL DOUGLAS  </P> <P> Singapore Airlines, a growing carrier known for its high-quality service, said  Tuesday that it has ordered $8.6 billion worth of new aircraft from Boeing and  McDonnell Douglas.  </P> <P> Though Boeing stands to get the biggest share of Singapore's business, the  order is significant for McDonnell Douglas because it gains a new customer.  </P> <P> Singapore's current fleet consists of aircraft made by Boeing and Airbus  Industrie, the European consortium. But Singapore said it decided to order  McDonnell Douglas MD-11s because Boeing's long-range jets were too large for  certain flights between Singapore and Europe.  </P> <P> The carrier also pointed out that its international marketing partners,  Swissair and Delta Air Lines, have placed large orders for the MD-11. The  airlines believe that there are competitive advantages to using the same type  of aircraft.  </P> <P> Singapore said it ordered five MD-11s and took options on 15 more, worth $3.1  billion if all options are exercised. The order makes Singapore Air the  third-largest customer for the MD-11, behind American Airlines and Delta.  </P> <P> Singapore Air said it ordered 15 Boeing 747-400 jumbo jets, and took options on  15 others. The Boeing order, including options, is worth $5.5 billion,  according to Singapore Air.  </P> <P> Singapore said that aircraft from both manufacturers would be delivered between  1994 and 1999.  </P> <P> If Singapore takes delivery of all the aircraft, the size of its 39-plane fleet  would more than double to 89. However, Singapore said the new aircraft would be  used to replace older models as well as for expansion, primarily in Europe and  Asia. The airline currently offers limited service to the United States, flying  only to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Honolulu.  </P> <P> Bob Candiotti, a spokesman for Singapore Air, said the airline plans to seek  authority to land in either Chicago, New York or Washington. He said the  carrier also plans to begin transatlantic service, possibly later this year,  with a flight between Toronto and Vienna.  </P> <P> Though Singapore's presence in the United States is minimal, it is well known  to international travelers for its high level of service, and it consistently  ranks among the world's top airlines on customer surveys. Its flight  attendants, for example, address passengers by name.  </P> <P> Singapore said it would deploy some of the new aircraft on its European  flights, although it didn't specify which destinations. It said that the  smaller MD-11 was better suited for new service, where the size of the  potential market is uncertain.  </P></p>

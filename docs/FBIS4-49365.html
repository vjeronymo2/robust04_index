			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 4 (XINHUA) -- In the first four months  of this year China took delivery of 11 new passenger planes, all  of which are in the Boeing series.    These new U.S.-made planes include eight Boeing-737, one  Boeing-747, one Boeing-757 and one Boeing-767.    An official from the China Aviation Suppliers Corporation  said that in the past few years, while the world's civil  aviation industry has experienced a sluggish market, the Chinese  aviation industry has maintained a sustained high-speed increase  of over 30 percent.    With the expansion of the country's air fleet, Boeing planes  have become the first choice for the Chinese market. In 1993  alone 47 Boeings were delivered to the Chinese mainland,  constituting 14 percent of the Boeing company's output for the  year. At present China is the biggest overseas buyer of Boeings.    The official said that the 12 major Chinese airlines use 164  Boeing planes, ranging from Boeing 737-500s, with more than 100  seats to Boeing 747-400s, with 420 seats.    Sources said that by the end of this year the number of  Boeing planes used by Chinese airlines will exceed 200. In 1995  China Southern Airlines will be the first to receive a  Boeing-777, the latest product of the Boeing company. Last year  China Southern Airlines ordered six Boeing-777 passenger planes.</p>

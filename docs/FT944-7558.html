			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Call for reform of tax claim law Reform of the law governing the right to reclaim overpaid tax was called for yesterday by the Law Commission, the government's law reform body. The commission reviewed the law following criticism by the Lords in a 1992 case. The right to recover taxes overpaid by mistake or in response to a demand which the revenue authorities had no power to make depends on conflicting statutory provisions and a common law recovery right developed by the Law Lords. The commission recommends a new statutory recovery right for direct taxes allowing taxpayers to reclaim all sums 'paid but not due', subject to several qualifications. Repayment must be claimed within six years, and recovery will be denied where it would unjustly enrich the taxpayer or where the taxpayer could have raised the issue on an appeal against an assessment, but did not. The Law Commission recommends that the present rule, dating from 1802, which prevents recovery of sums paid or benefits received under a mistake of law, should be repealed. But taxpayers will not be allowed to argue retrospectively that payment was made under a mistake of law. For indirect taxes, the commission recommends a new recovery right for excise duties based on the recovery regime for value added tax.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Russian State Duma (lower  house) Speaker Ivan Rybkin expressed hope today that the  parliaments of Russia and China will cooperate with each other  for the happiness of the two peoples.    Rybkin, who heads a State Duma delegation on the first visit  of the legislature to China since its founding four months ago,  was speaking to reporters at the airport before his departure  for China.    China has things for Russia to learn, he said.    Rybkin said he paid great attention to the trip and he hoped  to see how reforms are being carried out in China's industrial  and agricultural sectors.    The successes China has made in its reforms in industry and  agriculture are just what Russia is trying to achieve, he added.    Chinese Ambassador Wang Jinqing went to the airport to see  Rybkin off.</p>

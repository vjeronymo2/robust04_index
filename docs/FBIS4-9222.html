The Romanian head of state assessed that the themes to be  debated, referring to cooperation and security in the Black Sea  area, the political context in Central and Eastern Europe, the  prospects of a stable peace in the region, offered the  possibility of establishing concrete steps toward the promotion  of political dialogue and encouraging the cooperation among and  with the countries in Central and Eastern Europe. "In order to  attain this purpose, the first-hand knowledge of the deep  changes come about in this area in the last four years can  eliminate the reserves sometimes shown towards our countries,"  he stated. ``I hope that the conference participants will have  the opportunity these four days to get an image of today's  Romania, a country where democracy has been entrenched and where  foundations have been laid to the state of law but that,  unfortunately, is still living through many economic  difficulties. We have committed ourselves to a structural  reform, to the end of using to advantage the country's  substantive human, industrial, technological and scientific  potential. This target can be attained completely and rapidly  only through international cooperation and a more sizable  presence of the foreign capital in the Romanian market. In this  respect, we see that after a period when the realities in  Romania were gravely distorted by international mass media,  nobody doubts today any longer that Romania has committed itself  firmly and definitely on the road to democracy, observance of  human rights and specific values of a free world. Besides, the  facilities offered to foreign investors rule out any reticence  in coming toward the Romanian economy.    ``In another sequence of ideas, we hope the Bucharest talks  will be a signal for the international community, to the end of  assisting the countries in the area, by establishing peace, for  avoiding the extension of the conflicts or the emergence of new  hotbeds of war. Romania's situation is not an easy one, as it is  surrounded by zones of permanent unrest. Therefore, like all  countries in Central and Eastern Europe, we are interested in  our security," the Romanian head of state said. ``I am taking  this opportunity to recall the fact that, by our opinion, the  signing of the Partnership for Peace cannot be reduced only to a  simple extension of the NATO a few kilometers farther to the  East.    It means the turning of the North-Atlantic Alliance into a  factor of security for all countries in the region, meant to  avert the danger of new and arbitrary discriminations among the  countries of this region, giving them the opportunity to think  out ways of implementing a partnership for development, proposed  by us as an extension of the Partnership for Peace in Europe.  For European development to become a fact, we should overcome  the suspicions and confrontations and understand that the common  difficulties can be overcome only through opening and  cooperation''.</p>

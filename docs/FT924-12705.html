			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Make Germany's consensus work THE SOLIDARITY talks instigated by Mr Helmut Kohl more than a month ago appear to be spluttering into life. The talks, aimed at placing the financing of German unity on a sounder footing, are crucial to the economic health of Europe. The sooner the participants get down to details the better. Mr Kohl himself has done no more than talk in general terms about sacrifice. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of the powerful I G Metall engineering union, has been rather more specific and suggested that his members would accept pay rises for the next five years that do no more than maintain purchasing power. Mr Steinkuhler does not go far enough, but he has shown that the unions are ready to talk. His comments have been welcomed by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, and Mr Norbert Blum, the labour minister. Mr Steinkuhler also makes sense about the need for general tax increases, which the government has so far refused to contemplate. He wants the tax rises to last longer and be more fairly distributed than in 1991. According to the RWI economic institute, the self-employed and the beamte (public officials) have so far contributed only 1.5 to 2 per cent of their incomes to financing unity, whereas manual workers have contributed about 4 per cent. That is partly because neither the self-employed nor the beamte contributed to the 1991 increase in unemployment insurance. Productivity gap Yet useful as these suggestions are, they do not address the problem of rapid wage convergence between the eastern and western lander, for which Mr Steinkuhler's union bears some share of the blame. The attempt to equalise east and west German wages, given the large productivity gap between the two regions, has proved to be a recipe for mass unemployment in the less productive regions to the east of the Elbe. Mr Steinkuhler says he wants more investment in the east, not lower wages. But why should German companies invest there when they can get the same labour at a fraction of the price in Poland or Czechoslovakia? The result is that his west German members face higher taxes to pay for the unemployment for which they are, in part, responsible. The bargaining system in western Germany has contributed to the orderly distribution of an expanding cake over several decades. But in the east, the system needs to be suspended to allow west German companies to pay the market rate there, with wage subsidies from the government a possibility for those who fall beneath a certain level. Wider question All of this raises a wider question. The solidarity talks are based on the premise that Germany's consensus model in politics and industrial relations is still functioning and is not itself responsible for many of the inflexibilities exposed by unification. At least one of the parties in the centre-right coalition, the Free Democrats, believes that consensus is the problem, not the solution. It says that it has prevented the reduction in subsidies in the west and the promotion of a more vigorous privatisation programme to help pay for unity. It also points out that it was a consensus reflex which imposed the goal of an over-hasty equalisation in living standards between east and west. What could a pact realistically agree? If Mr Kohl accepts higher and more progressive income taxes to close the fiscal deficit, the unions must accept zero real wage growth in the west and a postponement of wages convergence between west and east. Equally, if the government is ready to consider the sort of profits levy favoured by the unions - one imposed on companies which do not invest in east Germany - then the unions and the opposition Social Democrats must accept a much tighter squeeze on subsidies and more privatisation in the west. Paradoxically, Germany is suffering from both too much and too little consensus. Rather than abandoning the system altogether Germany needs to apply it more sensibly. That means exploiting consensus at a political level to tackle the rigidities that consensus has produced at the economic level.</p>

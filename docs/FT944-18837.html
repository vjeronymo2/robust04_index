			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Dollar trades up The US dollar rallied in afternoon trading yesterday on a Tokyo news service report that a US-Japan trade deal had been agreed, writes Philip Coggan. The dollar, which had been trading at around Y98.50 for much of the day, jumped suddenly above Y99 on stories that the Japanese had agreed to relax constraints on bidding for government projects. The dollar then fell back below Y99, after Reuters reported a senior US official as saying there was no procurement deal. The official predicted that the result of the talks would be a partial deal, combined with light US sanctions. The US had set yesterday as a deadline for the talks. Nevertheless, the rumours aroused the currency markets from the lethargy into which they sunk for much of the morning session. 'The markets have been like a startled rabbit in the headlights of a car,' as they await the outcome of the talks, according to Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said that if the dollar does break through the Y99 level, it could test Y100. But even if the US currency rebounded as far as Y102/Y103, that would not break it out of its long term trading range. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, thought the deal would do little to help the dollar in the medium term. 'You need a recovery in Japanese spending and import volumes to make significant inroads into the trade surplus,' he said. 'Without a shrinking in the trade surplus, the fundamental underpinning of the yen will remain.' By the London close, the dollar was trading at Y98.9700, compared with Y98.5050 on Thursday. Economic news in the US and Germany seemed to have little effect on the markets. Figures for German industrial production showed a sharper-than-expected monthly fall of 3 per cent in August. 'There's been quite a lot of bad news for the D-Mark this week but it hasn't been affected,' said Mr Cocker. US data was mixed with a strong rise in personal spending in August, but a fall in the price component of the Chicago purchasing managers index. The trade rumours, however, helped the dollar against the D-Mark. Itc closed in London at DM1.5515, up from DM1.5461 on Thursday. The UK purchasing managers' index showed signs of a slowing in the future pace of growth and rate of price increases. But sterling remained on the sidelines, ending the day down against the stronger dollar (at Dollars 1.577 from Thursday's Dollars 1.5810) and up slightly against the D-Mark (at DM2.4468 from Thursday's DM2.4443). Portugal said it would cut its discount rate from 12 per cent to 10.5 per cent on Monday, but analysts said this was a technical rate which would have little effect on the escudo. The Portuguese currency closed unchanged at Es102/DM. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England offered Pounds 499m of assistance at established rates after forecasting a Pounds 800m shortage, revised from an earlier estimate of Pounds 700m. Overnight rates moved within the range of 6 per cent to 4 5/8 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The three-week strike by Lesotho police for higher  salaries ended today after agreement between the government and  the committee representing the police.    A spokesman for the police committee, Lieutenant Phakiso  Molise, called a press conference this afternoon at the Central  Police Station in Maseru where he explained that the police had  decided to return to work in the best interest of the Basotho  nation. The police had accepted the terms of agreement on  allowances which have been increased by certain percentages.  This also applied to members of the prisons service. As far as  salary increases were concerned, agreement was reached on  sliding upwards all grades up to the position of major.  Meanwhile, the strike ended with the police effecting their  first arrest since the strike started three weeks ago, when they  arrested a man who masqueraded as a policeman. The man who was  arrested this afternoon masqueraded as a policeman, wearing  police uniform and yet he knew that he was not a policeman. He  in fact works for a security firm in Maseru.    He is expected to appear in the Maseru magistrate's court  shortly, charged with impersonating the police.</p>

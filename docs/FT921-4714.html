			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Arts: Chekhovian references - Radio LBC is the only independent radio station in England to give drama, though in Glasgow Radio Clyde does, and in Belfast Downtown Radio. LBC presents its plays in nightly five-minute sections, no direct challenge to the BBC. What challenge there is between the script units is modified by the Woolwich Young Playwrights Competition, whose winners (not all that young) come out on LBC. Currently we are hearing Neville Watchurst's All in the Same Boat. This is a satire about the Gulf war. Johnno, the son of Sir Tobias Johnson, Foreign Secretary and armament maker, enlists his tank crew into the New Age Group. They kidnap a handy conference of world leaders and condemn them to 10 years in a cruise-liner. But Johnno won't abandon his father, and frees him - a mistake, for Sir Tobias takes over the New Age Group, sinks the liner and announces himself as dictator. I meant to be generous, but comedy won't work unless you believe what you hear, and this was all so unconvincing that I couldn't even decide which side I was supposed to be on. You can hear the final instalment on Tuesday. By contrast, the Chekhov-and-after festival on BBC Radio 3 (FM only from now on), continued on Sunday with a repeat of John Tydeman's 1974 production of The Cherry Orchard, containing a stunning performance of Ranyevskaya by Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies - then 82, but sounding a youthful lady of early middle-age. The Chekhov was followed on Tuesday by a modern variant, John Fletcher's The Apple Orchard. In April, 2005 AD, after the nuclear war, a dilapidated garage in Somerset stands in for the Ranyevskys' bankrupt estate, and there Harold grows apples and Sam (a girl) works secretly on electronics. Isabelle and Jonathan, Sam's sister and brother, have continued life in London; now hard up, they visit their old garage in an old Morris Traveller. They are appalled to hear that the Parish Council is to take their old garage yard to grow food. There is much philosophy, a barely relevant former vicar and a quite irrelevant baby. Then Jonathan and Isabelle set off for Barnstable, on foot, for Sam has pinched their carburettor for her secret 'plane, in which she flies off to start a new community in Iona. A miraculous crop of mushrooms will raise funds (though they are radio-active). There are some ready references to Chekhov - missing socks for missing galoshes, space-invader games for billiards. Nigel Bryant directed, and at any rate it was more convincing than All in the Same Boat. Sunday's Radio 4 Debate considered whether 'Britain is failing to consider the future of the arts.' The result was a predictable win for the motion (133-41), the debate being held in the Lyttelton Theatre. Iain Ritchie, of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, and Anthony Everett both made the valid point that the future of the arts depended more on the people than the funds, or, as Christopher Gable vigorously held, more on local than national authorities. Costing the Earth is a green campaign of eight weekly programmes on Radio 4, Saturdays, repeated Wednesdays. The household-sounding name fits the style, which introduces an eco-trained householder now and then to remind us about things like not leaving the light on. This first programme featured an eco-boxing match between Teresa Gorman, MP and Jonathan Porritt, not yet MP, about the worth of such current green doctrines as the greenhouse effect. We heard about the Filipinos' scheme to use old nuclear subs to generate electricity; about the proposed stabilisation of carbon dioxide; about the burning of oremulsion. Dylan Winter was given a little trip to see the Scarborough sewage treatment, which frankly I found more interesting than his trip across the US.</p>

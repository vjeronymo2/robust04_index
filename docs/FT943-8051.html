			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Questions raised by employment statistics Sir, The failure of recent reductions in UK claimant unemployment to be matched by even remotely compatible changes in employment - thereby implying a reduction in labour force participation which is entirely unexpected during cyclical recovery - is now a grave source of disquiet. Thus, UK claimant unemployment which peaked in December 1992, has since fallen by 340,000. The workforce in employment (which, in addition to employees, includes the self-employed and those on training schemes) increased by just 49,000 comparing March 1993 with March 1994. During the most recent quarter for which data are available (December 1993 to March 1994), claimant unemployment fell by 52,000, while employment also fell by 73,000. This development is quite distinct from the pattern observed during previous cyclical recoveries, when any increase in employment to which output recovery eventually gave rise tended to dwarf the reduction in claimant unemployment, since jobs were partly filled by the non-registered unemployed (including new entrants.) No doubt various explanations will be preferred to account for the apparent reduction in labour force participation. School and university enrolment has undoubtedly increased; the Employment Service may have improved its capacity to place people from the register into jobs at the expense of the unregistered unemployed; claimants are being switched into more appropriate benefits (eg invalidity), etc. However, there are so many unanswered parts of this jig-saw that nothing less than some form of special inquiry is required to provide a satisfactory explanation if public credibility in our official statistical services, already damaged by frequent revisions to the headline unemployment total, is to be preserved.

This revision was submitted to meet longstanding requirements as well as new requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. This revision consists of the State Rules 7005.3010 through 7005.3060, which incorporate by reference the new source review requirements specified in appendix S to 40 CFR part 51, ``Emission Offset Interpretive Ruling,'' except for the deletion of unacceptable exemptions included in appendix S. This approval lifts the prior ban on permitting major sources and major modifications in Minnesota nonattainment areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This final rule is effective May 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A copy of this revision to the Minnesota SIP and other materials relating to this rulemaking are available for inspection at the following address: (It is recommended that you telephone John Summerhays at (312) 886&hyph;6067 before visiting the Region 5 Office.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Air and Radiation Division, 77 West Jackson Boulevard (AE&hyph;17J), Chicago, Illinois 60604. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of this revision to the Minnesota SIP is available for inspection at the following address:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Docket and Information Center, (Air Docket 6102), room M1500, United States Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 20460, (202) 260&hyph;7548. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  John Summerhays, Regulation Development Section, Air Enforcement Branch (AE&hyph;17J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 886&hyph;6067.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 23, 1994, at 59 FR 8578, USEPA proposed to approve Minnesota new source review regulations submitted on August 5, 1992, and August 26, 1993. These submittals were intended to satisfy both the requirements predating the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the new requirements those amendments impose. The discussion that follows summarizes the notice of proposed rulemaking. Since no comments were received on this proposal, USEPA is today making final its approval of these new source review submittals and removing the ban on construction of major new sources and major modifications in Minnesota nonattainment areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statutory requirements that apply to State regulations for new source review in nonattainment areas are set forth at part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, particularly in sections 172(c)(5) and 173. Federal regulations developed prior to enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 for nonattainment area new source review programs are set forth at title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, part 51 (40 CFR part 51), particularly 40 CFR 51.165. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 also establish assorted new requirements, for which preliminary guidance was published April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13498), and April 28, 1992 (57 FR 18070). For example, section 189(a)(1)(A) requires that permit programs satisfying sections 172(c)(5) and 173 be submitted for fine particulate matter nonattainment areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The notice of proposed rulemaking provided a summarized history of Minnesota new source review submittals. None of these submittals satisfied the specific requirements for permitting new and modified major sources in nonattainment areas, and so Minnesota became subject to a prohibition against permitting major new sources and major modifications in the State's nonattainment areas, as promulgated by USEPA on July 2, 1979 (44 FR 38583).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 173 of the Act identifies four essential requirements that State new source permit regulations must impose in nonattainment areas: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) New source emissions must be offset by equivalent or greater emission reductions in the area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The new source must have the lowest achievable emission rate (LAER);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Other sources in the same State owned by the owner or operator of the new source must be in compliance or on a schedule to achieve compliance with applicable regulations; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The area must not be subject to a finding of failure to implement the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The submittals being addressed in this rulemaking include State Rules 7005.3010 through 7005.3060 (``Offset Rule''). These rules incorporate appendix S to 40 CFR part 51 into these State rules, modified in response to recommendations by USEPA. In general, adoption of appendix S of 40 CFR part 51 into the State's regulations serves to impose the requirements identified in section 173. Part IV. A. of appendix S provides multiple conditions for granting a permit, including a requirement for lowest achievable emission rates (requirement 2 above), a requirement for compliance of commonly owned sources (requirement 3 above), and a requirement for offsets (requirement 1 above). Although appendix S contains no provision prohibiting permits in ``failure to implement'' areas, USEPA has adequate authority under section 113(a)(5) to take any necessary action to address permits that violate this prohibition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The adoption of appendix S by reference as a State rule fails to satisfy some permitting requirements under subpart I of 40 CFR part 51. In particular, appendix S exempts certain source types and is insufficiently clear on some issues. In accordance with a letter from USEPA dated May 17, 1991, Minnesota made various recommended rule revisions which provide that the relevant appendix S exemptions do not apply in Minnesota. USEPA today finds this modified program to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 51. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in the notice of proposed rulemaking, USEPA has also reviewed whether the requirements enacted as part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 have been satisfied. As proposed, USEPA is today concluding that the Offset Rule, in conjunction with previously approved permitting rules, satisfies these new requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minnesota also adopted significant revisions to its regulations on permit processing on August 24, 1993, which it submitted for SIP rulemaking on November 23, 1993. The primary purposes of these regulations were to satisfy requirements in title V of the Clean Air Act for a State operating permit program and to amend the new source permitting regulations to provide an integrated set of permitting regulations. In developing these regulations, the State incorporated language intended to address various issues USEPA had identified with respect to the prior permitting rules. These issues are discussed in more detail in the notice of proposed rulemaking, and include concerns about permit expiration, variances, and outdated references in the Memorandum of Understanding on public comment procedures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  USEPA is not taking rulemaking action today on the submittal of November 23, 1993. Nevertheless, USEPA finds that the issues discussed in the notice of proposed rulemaking are no longer of concern, in general because the revised State rules prevent the relevant problems from arising. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Upon further review, USEPA finds that a concern as to satisfaction of 40 CFR 51.160(a) was misfounded. This provision, which requires assurance that new sources will not interfere with attainment or maintenance of the air quality standards, was found to be satisfied in 1988 rulemaking on Statewide permitting regulations. (See 53 FR 17033.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted in the proposed rulemaking, USEPA is currently developing a rule to implement the changes under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 in the new source review provisions in parts C and D of title I of the Act. The Agency anticipates that the final rule will be promulgated sometime during 1995. Upon promulgation of this final rule, USEPA will review new source review SIPs to determine whether additional SIP revisions are necessary to satisfy the requirements of the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 15, 1994, at 59 FR 7218, USEPA concluded that particulate matter precursors do not contribute significantly to violations of the particulate matter standard in Minnesota. Therefore, under section 189(e), new source review for particulate matter precursors is not required in Minnesota's particulate matter nonattainment areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. This Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USEPA received no comments on its proposal to approve Minnesota's nonattainment area permitting regulations. Consequently, USEPA continues to believe that the regulations submitted by Minnesota on August 5, 1992, and August 26, 1993, satisfy the requirements under part D for a new source permitting program in nonattainment areas, and is approving this SIP revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the approved rules, permits for nonattainment area sources that satisfy the substantive requirements of the Offset Rule (Rules 7005.3010 through 7005.3060) would be processed in accordance with permit processing provisions in the Consolidated Permit Rules (Rules 7001.0010 through 7001.0210 and Rules 7001.1200 through 7001.1220). On May 13, 1988 (53 FR 17033), USEPA approved the Consolidated Permit Rule as satisfying attainment area permitting requirements but noted that nonattainment area permitting requirements were not met. Today's action finds the nonattainment area permitting requirements met, removes the ban on construction of major new sources and major modifications in Minnesota nonattainment areas, and imposes Minnesota's Consolidated Permit Rule and Offset Rule as federally enforceable requirements for such new sources and modifications. Subsequent rulemaking will address the approvability of the State permitting regulations submitted November 23, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rules submitted by Minnesota were intended to address nonattainment area new source review requirements and did not address visibility-related permitting requirements specified in 40 CFR 51.307. Therefore, USEPA is retaining the provisions of 40 CFR 52.1236, which note the absence of approvable State regulations for visibility protection and impose the federally promulgated regulations of 40 CFR 52.26 and 52.28. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action makes final the action proposed at 59 FR 8578. As noted elsewhere in this document, USEPA received no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a result, the Regional Administrator has classified this action as a Table Three action under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989, based on revised SIP processing review tables approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table Two and Three SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866 for a period of 2 years. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 27, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.

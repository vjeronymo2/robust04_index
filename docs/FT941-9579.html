			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Retail expansion for ICL ICL, the UK-based computer company, is collaborating with Norweb, the electricity distributor for the north-west of England, to establish a chain of at least 20 computer superstores under the Icon brand. The pilot superstore will open in Snipes Retail Park, Ashton-under-Lyne, Manchester, on March 17. ICL is involved through Technology, a wholly owned subsidiary and one of the UK's largest personal computer distributors. The move has the backing of Technology's suppliers. The stores will sell hardware and software from IBM, Compaq, ICL, Apple and Toshiba among others. IBM, which recently agreed to resupply Technology with its products after a row about its acquisition by ICL, said it expected to sell its home computers and portables through the stores. Mr Steve Sowery, director of retail operations for Technology, said the move would enable the company to exploit fully the emerging market for small office and home office systems. More than 40 per cent of pc sales are expec-ted to go through retail outlets by 1995, according to Romtec the marketing consultancy. Norweb is the most aggressively expansionist of the 12 regional electricity companies in retail operations. Mr Duncan Gray, the company's strategic planning controller, said the venture would seek synergy between Norweb's retailing expertise and Technology's computing know-how. ICL, in which Fujitsu of Japan has a holding of a little more than 80 per cent, moved into personal computers through the purchase of Nokia Data Systems of Finland and into volume products through the acquisition of Technology. The company's first stake in retailing came through its acquisition of the 20,000 sq ft Icon computer superstore near Dudley in the West Midlands in July last year. ICL said that the store had closed after only seven weeks when its backers pulled out, but was now trading profitably. Technology expects to generate about Pounds 1.5m in revenues per store in the first year. The development with Norweb continues ICL's efforts to find ways to improve its margins faced with continuing decline in the price of personal computers and software.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: A fifth possibility for the ERM Sir, In your editorial 'Way ahead for the ERM' (September 27), you suggested that there were only four intellectually defensible possibilities for the ERM. There is a fifth possibility that deserves a mention: to define the currency bands in real as opposed to nominal terms, making the adjustment on a monthly basis according to an appropriately defined current inflation differential. Such a system would produce a convergence in real, as opposed to nominal, interest rates and would encourage counter-cyclical monetary policy rather than the tendency of the current system to act pro-cyclically. Exchange rate adjustments would be small, frequent, relatively predictable and immune from political interference. High inflation countries would not be able to use the system as an anti-inflationary anchor and would be forced to address structural factors that gave rise to their problem. Large misalignments would be avoided and the threat of discontinuity that speculative pressures render self-fulfilling would be avoided. Attention would be focused on expected rates of inflation (and differentials) and would bolster commitment to inflation targets. Monetary union would come about as the result of a convergence in inflation rates rather than the misguided attempt to force a reversal of this process.

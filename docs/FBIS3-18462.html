This  period is chiefly characterized by the fact that the United  States has abandoned the region to Russia's influence. Russia  has taken the most important step in reestablishing political  domination in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as in the Balkans. As  we all know well, this domination is based on the foundation of  the "Orthodox Alliance".    Everyone must now realize that an extremely painful and  difficult period has begun for the Balkans. A large number of  Turks and Muslims in the region are gradually being dragged into  a dreadful predicament. The besieged Sandzak, Kosovo, and  Montenegro, as well as Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia--FYROM], on which Greece has imposed an embargo.  In the near future, Albania, the Turkish presence in Bulgaria,  Western Thrace, and the Turkish and Muslim minorities in other  Balkan areas will join these areas.    All these people are threatened with extinction within the  framework of the Orthodox-Crusader political plan drawn by  Russia.    This situation paints a picture of desperation, in which the  tyranny in Bosnia-Herzegovina will soon become a mere detail.  In the coming months, ethnic cleansing policies will be  implemented one by one and mass deaths, famine, and refugee  movements will be observed in this region. Most of the refugees  will move to Turkey. [passage omitted]</p>

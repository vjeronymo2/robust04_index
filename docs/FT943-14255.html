			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Glasgow versus Glyndebourne Sir, I read with interest David Murray's review of the new Glyndebourne production of Mozart's Don Giovanni (Arts, July 12). The last time elements of this audience voiced noisy disapproval also involved a Mozart piece - Peter Sellars' version of Die Zauberflote. When this production came to Glasgow in 1990, however, it received a most enthusiastic welcome at the city's Theatre Royal. It is to be hoped that director Deborah Warner will take heart from this. An imaginative treatment of a much-loved Mozart masterpiece, even if controversial, may find a more sympathetic reception from a different audience. Perhaps Ms Warner should persuade Glyndebourne Touring Opera to take her Don Giovanni into its repertoire. I live in hope that she might measure the reaction of the opera lovers of Glasgow against the louts of Glyndebourne. Thomas McLaughlin, 4 Munro Road, Jordanhill, Glasgow G13 1SF</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Gardening: Mean, moody and magnificent - Robin Lane Fox considers an extraordinary year Perhaps gardeners should never look back: this past year has been extraordinary and we have all had problems in keeping up with it. The diagnosis is simple - natural bloody-mindedness, tempered by violent swings of mood. Has it ever rained more when it decided to rain, or less when it decided not to, and has any other year made such a nonsense of seasons and rates of growth? At either end of the year, the winter produced no serious frost, and I enter 1995 with half-hardy perennial verbenas which are three years old and still unscathed. There is one obvious winner: the luscious green leaves of Melianthus major have never looked fresher, reminding us all what a marvellous foliage plant it is in a sheltered corner or in isolation in a big clay pot. Londoners ought to grow it more. They have started to grow more of my other winner, the white-flowered Solanum jasminoides, which has stayed in flower through December. Even if a frost kills the top growth against a south wall, it usually shoots again from ground level. Nothing has hit it hard for the past 2 1/2 years and it becomes spectacular against tall walls on London houses. In January and February, it rained so absurdly that the first hellebores outdoors were damaged and the crocuses began to open in a paddy field. The flowers on many of my early hellebores had also been torn, and I learnt for the first time how slugs will wreck them in mild winters. Be warned, and protect them with the necessary pellets. I have also learnt to double-up on an old favourite, the hardy winter-flowering Cyclamen coum. Its flowers are brilliantly cheerful and curiously hardy in any winter, although they are native to the warm Greek island of Cos. We all ought to grow more of it. Mild winters make us all appreciate winter flowers. As 1994 has been mild at both ends, the winners are, unarguably, the yellow jasmine and, as usual, the winter-flowering cherries which have been out for five months in the 12. Encouraged by this year, I am now on the look-out for everything which flowers early, from the marvellous single yellow Adonis vernalis, 6in high, to the newer forms of garrya, with longer and richer catkins of green and dove-pink and names like Glasnevin Wine. In spring, my own best success was childishly simple: the deepest blue forget-me-not, called Indigo, and a newly-planted mass of my favourite narcissus for orchards, the old Ice Follies. Other people's best success was more exotic: the brilliant blue Corydalis flexuosa which grows no more than 6in high, flowers incredibly, and arrived from China as recently as 1988. This outstanding plant comes in two distinct colours, sky blue or electric blue, both of which are lovely. It dies away after flowering but re-appears in even better form for the next year. It prefers shade but does not insist on this, or even on a lime-free soil. It was 1994's plant of the year because mass propagation brought it into the better garden centres at prices which ought to continue to drop. It would be my plant of the year if I had not already picked, and grown, it since 1991. By mid-May, everything was absurdly far ahead and we began to fear a blank July. I have now found that early unpredictability is Mother Nature's prelude to an outrage. It turned dark and wet in mid-May, relented for the old-fashioned roses and, just as everything began to grow at an amazing rate, refused to rain on most of us until mid-September. Sprinkler systems and dying trees dominated summer's conversation. I was thankful to have discovered one of the few pink-flowered old roses which will flourish on my poor soil in a dry spell. Called Rose d'Orsay, it has American blood and seems to have been forgotten by almost everyone except the experts. I would prefer to forget the next 10 weeks, apart from annuals with African blood in them. Prospects looked good for a watering system for the new year until the weather relented in time for October, everything smiled, and I learnt to appreciate the smaller-flowered blue and white Michaelmas daisies with names like Little Carlow. Autumn crocus, nerines, sternbergias and all autumn bulbs were spectacular after such a dry summer. So were the late autumn shrubs, reminding us once again that these weeks are a keen gardener's potential heaven. Where, meanwhile, has the frost gone? The rain has decided to overdose and 1994 remains the year without serious spells of winter. We picked fresh roses in mid-December and penstemons remained in flower for Christmas. The results have been chaotic. My personal choice of chaos, however, consists of a bouquet which you could have picked in Plymouth in time for Christmas: roses, blue clematis, red escallonias, fuchsias, yellow-flowered senecio, blue ceanothus, winter cherry and jasmine, and some totally misguided sprigs of lilac. With trepidation, I wish them all a happy 1995.</p>

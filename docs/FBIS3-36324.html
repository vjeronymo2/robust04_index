The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army Press Service  reported that large enemy forces, mostly armored cars, launched  an attack yesterday against Karabakh positions in the direction  of Martuni and Gadrut. The offensive lasted from morning until  late at night. After losing five tanks and 30 soldiers on the  battlefield, the Azerbaijani troops retreated to their initial  positions. Two Karabakh fighters died and seven were wounded.    Relative calm prevailed on the other sectors of the front  until noon today.    The same source reported that an Azerbaijani Air Force plane  appeared over Karabakh at around 1030 today. According to  preliminary reports, the enemy plane was most probably engaged  in a reconnaissance flight. Azerbaijani attack planes bombed  the settlements in Askeranskiy Rayon at 1100. Casualty figures  are being determined.    The Armenian Defense Ministry Press Service has reported  that  the calm prevailing on the border for the past three days has  not been violated. We talked with the Press Service a short  time ago and were informed that the situation on the border  remained unchanged at 1930.</p>

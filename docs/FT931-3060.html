			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Tax will hit low-income families - Fuel and VAT IN INTRODUCING Value Added Tax on domestic fuel, the UK is coming into line with most other European Community countries. Apart from Ireland, all EC countries will now levy VAT on domestic fuel and power. However, the chancellor's decision to charge VAT at the 17 1/2 per cent standard rate - albeit phased in over two years - will put the UK at the top of the league table. Around half the other EC countries charge VAT at a reduced rate, such as 5 1/2 per cent in France and 9 per cent in Italy (1992 rates). Under the EC rules setting the framework for national value added taxes, members can have two reduced rate bands at or above 5 per cent. One option would have been to have taxed domestic fuel at 5 or 10 per cent. That would have mitigated the regressive impact of taxing this basic commodity. According to Mr Paul Baker of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the increase will hit the lowest income families three times as hard as the better-off. For the poorest fifth of households, 17 1/2 per cent on fuel prices will add more than 2 per cent to their spending. For the richest fifth, the cost is around 0.7 per cent of total spending. The environmental gloss the chancellor put on the decision conceals a further regressive element in the impact of this tax change. It will be the better-off families which can afford to improve the insulation of their homes and replace their domestic appliances with more energy-efficient models. Certainly it will put more pressure on gas appliance manufacturers to improve the efficiency of appliances. Analysts said the impact on the power companies would be limited since most consumers have little choice over the amount of electricity or gas they buy. Companies' profits and dividends are unlikely to be affected. Some observers believe the power companies will be open to political attack because of the increased prices, even though they were not to blame. Water companies have been criticised by the Labour party for double digit price rises since privatisation. Because VAT will be levied on all fuels, little switching between fuel sources is expected. However, in some situations - larger new properties - gas may become more efficient than electricity, according to Mr Nigel Burton, analyst at S G Warburg. For the chancellor, there is, however, an important benefit in pushing up the VAT on domestic fuel as high and as soon as possible. EC moves to introduce a carbon tax are still some years away, but the plans under discussion in Brussels would link increased taxes on fuel with compensating tax cuts elsewhere. 'By bringing domestic fuel into the VAT net, the chancellor ensures that he permanently widens the tax base,' says the IFS's Mr Baker. 'And it also gives him the flexibility to decide what he spends the money on  - either for tax cuts or to reduce borrowing.' By not creating a lower VAT rate for fuel, the chancellor keeps open a further option if deficits persist in the government's budget. He could point to the disparity between the bulk of spending on which VAT is paid at the 17 1/2 standard rate and the minority of essentials which remain zero-rated. To introduce a lower rate of 8 per cent on those goods could raise as much as a further Pounds 5bn or more a year - a handsome banker for a future budget.</p>

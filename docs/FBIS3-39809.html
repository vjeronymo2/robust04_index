Pakistan's delegate Shafqat  Kakakhel told the Commission that human rights groups and  agencies have charged the Indian occupation forces with cold  blooded murders, unjustified arrests, killing in custody,  molestation of Kashmiri women, and acts of arson. In response  to a statement by the Indian delegate, he said the Commission  should send a fact-finding team to occupied Jammu and Kashmir to  study the exact state of human rights violations there. He said  this is the only way the international community can know and  try to end atrocities being committed by the Indian forces in  the Indian-held valley.</p>

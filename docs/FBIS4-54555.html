			<p>BFN     [Text] President Tudjman has replied to a letter from Alija  Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency. The  following is the text of the president's reply:    I have received your letter confirming an interest in the  speedy and comprehensive implementation of the Washington  agreement. I maintain that it can already be said that since  the agreement was signed Bosniak-Croatian relations have been  developing in a positive way and that on the whole we can be  satisfied with initial results.    I agree with you, however, that everything should be done to  implement as soon as possible the agreement in its entirety and  that those impeding this positive process on either side should  be neutralized. I firmly believe that it is possible and  necessary to resolve all the issues you mentioned to our mutual  satisfaction. I again stress that you can fully rely on all my  influence in order to fully implement as soon as possible the  agreements signed in Washington.    I believe that my visit to Sarajevo will take place soon and  I am ready to travel as soon as this is technically possible. I  believe that this visit will facilitate quicker solutions of all  open issues and the further development of mutual understanding  and cooperation between the Croatian and the Bosniak-Muslim  people and between the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  Republic of Croatia.</p>

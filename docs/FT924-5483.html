			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Richemont 'satisfied' with 2.1% fall at six months RICHEMONT, the Swiss holding company for Rothmans international tobacco businesses and the Cartier and Dunhill luxury goods companies, appears to be faring better in the recession than some of its competitors in the luxury goods sector. The group's consolidated pre-tax profit fell 2.1 per cent to Pounds 279.4m (Dollars 424.2m) in the six months to September 30 on sales up 1 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn as a result of currency effects and reduced interest on its net funds. Operating profits were up 2.1 per cent to Pounds 266.8m. Mr Johann Rupert, managing director, said he was 'satisfied' with the result, considering the depressed economic conditions in many of the group's important markets. Operating profit of the tobacco products was up 6.3 per cent to Pounds 191.5m, while that of luxury products was down 4.5 per cent to Pounds 76.7m. Mr Rupert said the luxury products result was depressed by a change last year in Cartier's reporting currency from US dollars to Swiss francs. Sales and profits were up 4 per cent in Swiss franc terms but down 5.3 per cent when converted into sterling. Dunhill, which is heavily dependent on the depressed Japanese market, nevertheless managed to raise its operating profit 6.3 per cent to Pounds 21.8m. Mr Rupert said this reflected the increasing contribution of Mont Blanc, the luxury pen business which had become 'a major profit earner,' and was established mainly in western markets. Also, the slack in Japan was being taken up by strength in other far eastern markets. 'The luxury goods businesses are still holding up better than I expected,' he observed, adding: 'The people who were in this business in the 1970s will cope better in the 1990s than the people who started in the 1980s.' He said adverse conditions were expected to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year, but hinted that the result from other interests, which had an operating loss of Pounds 3.6m in the first half, could improve. In particular, the Horn &amp; Hardart mail order business in the US, which lost Dollars 64m last year, was making profits. Richemont has a 62.5 per cent stake in it.</p>

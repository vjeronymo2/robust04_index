			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Withdrawn Sir, Your failure to cover the outcome of the Leeds industrial tribunal case ('Race body accused of bias', July 6) may have left your readers with the mistaken impression that the serious allegations about race bias levelled at the commission were well founded. The fact is that the commission's reputation is totally intact: the complaints officer concerned has unreservedly withdrawn her accusations. Jean Coussins, acting executive director, Commission for Racial Equality, 10-12 Allington Street, London SW1E 5EH</p>

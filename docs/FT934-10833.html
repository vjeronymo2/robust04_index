			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigeria's burden of proof - Arrests have been made but the state oil business has still to satisfy the industry that its reforms are working THE interim government's purge of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has stopped some of the racketeering that became rife during former president Ibrahim Babangida's regime - but it will take more than a few arrests to convince the oil industry that a reform of the public sector oil business is under way. After the discovery of unauthorised payments to store fuel in tankers offshore, NNPC's managing director, Mr Edmund Daukoru, finance director Mr O. Okwara, and company secretary Dr Beneni Briggs were arrested last month. Mr Daukoru, Mr Okwara and five other senior officials were formally charged yesterday with stealing Dollars 41m. About 20 senior officials in NNPC have been suspended. The plan to charter two very large vessels for storing about 1m tonnes of fuel through Lenoil, an independent oil and marketing company, was approved by Mr Chu Okongwu, who was oil minister in 1992. Although each ship was costing Nigeria an estimated Dollars 49,000 a day, the so-called strategic reserve never supplied any fuel. Nigeria has adequate storage capacity on shore but its fuel shortages stem from large-scale smuggling, and crumbling refineries and distribution systems run by subsidiaries of NNPC. Mr Philip Asiodu, who became oil minister in January this year, rejected the chartering scheme and ordered instead the purchase of smaller tankers secondhand, also through Lenoil. Although Mr Asiodu blocked a demand by Lenoil for Dollars 62m, it is alleged that most of the payment went through shortly after he left office in August, leading to the arrest of the NNPC directors. Mr Len Adesanya, managing director of Lenoil, was also arrested. Mr Adesanya was to be in the new management following the takeover of Texaco Nigeria in July. The deal was opposed by the minority Nigerian shareholders, who allege that the buyer, TNP Holdings, registered in the British Virgin Islands, was funded indirectly by the military regime. The takeover is under investigation by Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission. Industry analysts say that close links between Mr Adesanya's operations and Mr Babangida's military regime went right to the top and that Lenoil was one of the two main operators in the smuggling of about 100,000 barrels a day of fuel. Since Mr Don Etiebet took over as petroleum minister in late August, the boards of NNPC and its refining and marketing subsidiaries have been dissolved, and the axe has fallen on several other deals agreed by his predecessor. Mr Etiebet has cancelled all the crude oil lifting contracts signed by Mr Asiodu. Mr Etiebet said the contracts were to be renegotiated because 'people are hawking crude oil . . . we want to know the exact number of people who are lifting and whether they comply with our objectives'. Mr Etiebet has invited new applications to buy Nigerian crude oil from companies established internationally as traders or refiners of oil products or which are investing in upstream exploration in Nigeria. The minister has also invited tenders to supply fuel from internationally recognised companies. The minister has cancelled 16 oil exploration licences awarded by Mr Asiodu to indigenous prospecting companies. According to industry sources, the approvals were rushed through without the normal procedures and many of the licencees do not have the technology or resources to carry out exploration. NNPC's acting managing director is reviewing the sale of an extra 5 per cent stake in an oil production venture to one of its equity partners, Elf Aquitaine, for around Dollars 520m. The joint venture is operated by Shell and produces half of Nigeria's 1.8m b/d oil output. July's sale to Elf broke the 40 per cent limit on foreign ownership in oil joint ventures. The private sector in Nigeria and international creditors would like to see the shake-up in NNPC go further. Recommendations by an economic conference chaired by Mr Ernest Shonekan in February, which included a reduction in state control of the oil and gas industry, have not been implemented. In a follow-up to that conference today the private sector will press for the measures to be passed in the January budget. The budget monitoring committee set up by Mr Shonekan to review government spending under the Babangida regime has submitted the report. The document is highly critical of dedication accounts that diverted about 110,000 barrels of oil from central revenue into offshore accounts. Mr Shonekan has made transparency in government revenue one of his government's main target, but he has yet to show that he can bring oil revenue under control.</p>

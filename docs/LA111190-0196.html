			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 200 SOLDIERS REPORTEDLY DIE IN AFGHAN MASSACRE;  </P> <P> GUERRILLA WAR: THE TROOPS ARE SAID TO HAVE SURRENDERED TO REBELS. MUSLIM  FUNDAMENTALISTS ARE BLAMED FOR THE SLAUGHTER.  </P> <P> Muslim guerrillas fighting to topple the leadership of Afghanistan slaughtered  more than 200 government soldiers who had agreed to surrender, diplomatic and  guerrilla sources said Saturday.  </P> <P> The killings occurred during battles in October for two provincial capitals in  southern Afghanistan, the sources said on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> Moderate guerrillas blamed Muslim fundamentalists for the massacres. Moderate  groups have pulled out of the fighting, aimed at pressuring the Kabul  government to negotiate an end to the 12-year-old war, the sources said.  </P> <P> "Everyone is denying responsibility," one diplomatic source said.  </P> <P> Guerrillas gunned down at least 95 Afghan soldiers who had surrendered and  paved the way for the Oct. 4 fall of Tarin Kot, the capital of Uruzgan  Province, sources said.  </P> <P> About two weeks later, they said, an additional 125 soldiers were slain by  guerrillas negotiating the surrender of Qalat, capital of neighboring Zabul  province. The guerrillas had promised the soldiers safe passage if they  defected, they said.  </P> <P> Another 100 soldiers were holed up in a heavily armed fort overlooking the  deserted city until 400 troops were flown in by the Soviet-backed Kabul  government, along with food and other supplies, they said.  </P> <P> The reinforcements allowed the government to hold Qalat, which sources said was  on the verge of falling to the U.S.-financed guerrillas.  </P> <P> Qalat is strategically important to the Kabul government because of a highway  that links eight provincial capitals. It is the major route for resupply  convoys.  </P> <P> Shortly before the Soviet Union ended nine years of direct involvement in  Afghanistan and withdrew its soldiers in February, 1989, many expected that  huge defections among government troops would bring down the Kabul government  within months. But their predictions proved wrong, largely because of highly  publicized massacres of soldiers who surrendered to the moujahedeen.  </P> <P> In November, 1988, about 70 government soldiers were killed, their bodies cut  into pieces and put on display by fundamentalist guerrillas near the town of  Torkham on the border with Pakistan.  </P></p>

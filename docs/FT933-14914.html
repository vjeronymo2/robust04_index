			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: New headquarters in Cardiff OSPREY PROJECT MANAGEMENT, the project management company of the Franklin &amp; Andrews group, has been appointed by NCM Credit Insurance (formerly ECGD), to project manage its relocation to a new headquarters building in Cardiff. Osprey's Cardiff office was originally appointed in February 1992 to find suitable development sites for the building. A site was selected within the waterside location of Cardiff Bay. The headquarters, which will be built by developer Grosvenor Waterside, will cost in the region of Pounds 12m, with a further Pounds 4m being spent by NCM on the fit-out. The building, which has been designed by Holder Mathias Alcock, is to be constructed to an unusual and innovative design which will have a nautical look to it. It will employ an environmentally friendly air-conditioning system which is similar to those used in Scandinavia: it involves displacement ventilation and chilled beams and this is believed to be the first of its type to be used in the UK. The building will be developed by Grosvenor Waterside to house NCM Credit, who are moving out of the Welsh Office since they became a commercial organisation in November 1991. Osprey will provide full project management services: quantity surveying services on the fit-out contract will be carried out by Franklin &amp; Andrews. Construction works will commence shortly and completion is set for December 1994 .</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Fomenko under the rubric "Reflections </F> After the Election": "Will Old Man Mazay Rescue Political  'Hares?'"]    [Text] It is known that political games, which is what  elections undoubtedly are, do not have logos like the Olympic  Games. If political games did have a logo, Elections-94 would be  personified by a scared hare caught on an island in high tide,  rather than a likable bear cub, the mascot of Olympics-80.    Think of this: There are now 33 parties in Ukraine (the last  one, the Human Rights Party, was registered one week ago),  whereas just a few made their way to the "dry valley," that is,  the parliament. More precisely, only the following will be  represented in the new Supreme Council: the KPU [Communist Party  of Ukraine]--about 100 seats, Rukh--about 30, the SelPU [Peasant  Party of Ukraine]--18, and the SPU [Socialist Party of  Ukraine]--15. They are followed by the URP [Ukrainian Republican  Party] with nine deputies, the Democratic Party, with three  deputies, the Christian Democrats, with three deputies, and the  Social Democrats with two. The leaders of this latter group of  parties, with the exception of the Democratic Party, have lost  the elections personally. To be sure, there will also be several  representatives of national-radical and pro-fascist forces in  the parliament, but they will not play any particular role.    This sad arithmetic suggests only one conclusion: "Although  before the elections radio and TV put on the air in turn 30  political parties which we allegedly have, most of them do not  have a single deputy in the new Supreme Council. Vociferous  party declarations turned out to conceal a void, a complete  absence of party structures at the local level. These dwarfish  parties did not have enough cadres to put together a corps of  deputies, nor did they have supporters to ensure the conduct of  the election campaign.    "Meanwhile, in Churchill's words, parties are 'machines for  winning elections.' So it turns out that the political activity  of the people was bound like a river with ice, and the parties  could romp on the ice. But high tide came (and it is high this  year) and this showy tinsel was swept away. What are these  parties to do now? Who should they expect to be rescued? Whether  they want it or not, there is only one way out--to hop into the  boat seeking protection from Old Man Mazay."    I hear the outraged voice of the pro-Rukh reader: "Here is a  fine how do you do from the left. It is not enough for them to  have rallied 120 deputies around themselves, they also covet  other democrats! And in all this they humiliate--dwarfish  parties, they say, lacking cadres, a void."    Let us make it clear: The above quote does not come from a  presentation by the leader of the Communist Party, P. Simonenko,  whose press conference we have promised to discuss, but from a  report by...V. Chornovil at the recent Fifth Rukh Congress (you  see, Sir Vyacheslav, how frequently PRAVDA UKRAINY quotes you!).  This congress was far more sober than the previous forums and  press conferences of Rukh following the elections. At the  latter, triumphant trumpets were heard, whereas at the  former--sad violins. Chornovil did not succeed in putting a good  face on a bad situation. In particular, S. Odarich, member of  the Rukh central leadership, stated at the congress  straightforwardly that Rukh had failed to keep the status quo,  as Chornovil was trying to prove, that Rukh had suffered a  defeat, that it had pursued a bad cadre policy: Twenty-one  chairmen of regional Rukh organizations had run as candidates  for people's deputy, and only five had been elected. The  chairman of the Kharkov regional organization, G. Altunyan,  spoke in the same vein: Our candidates were unable to clearly  explain the essence of Rukh's economic program to the voters.    The reader will stop me: "Wait a minute. You promised to  tell  us one thing, but you are telling us quite another. Why did you  change the subject? Where is the report on the communist press  conference?"    No, I have not changed the subject. It is just that this is  a  long lead-in.    The leaders of the Communist Party carried on in a calm and  dignified although somewhat dry manner at their press  conference. Instead of picturesque reports and victorious  communiques they produced specific statistics and facts by way  of a business card. Here they are.    "Despite the Communist Party joining the struggle for the  credentials of people's deputies before completing the process  of its establishment, it confirmed by deeds that it is the most  influential political force. Almost 100 deputies are communists  from among 168 people's deputies with a party affiliation (out  of the 338 deputies elected). Of these, five are members of the  Central Committee Presidium, five are first secretaries of  oblast committees, 15 are members of the Central Committee, five  are workers, four are women, 11 are enterprise managers, 14 are  kolkhoz chairmen and directors of agricultural enterprises, and  six are college instructors."    As far as age is concerned, may the statement about the  aging  of the party burden Chornovil's conscience: Only one of the  elected communist deputies is beyond retirement age; the others  are under 50. In Kiev alone the ranks of the communists grew by  a factor of 1.5 during the election campaign.    Questions followed, which members of the Presidium and  Central Committee secretaries, O. Grachev, A. Martynyuk, B.  Oleynik, and KPU Representative at the Central Election  Commission G. Kryuchkov fielded along with P. Simonenko.    [Question] Is it true that a meeting between President  Kravchuk and First Secretary of the KPU Central Committee P.  Simonenko will be held soon?    [Answer] Yes, Kravchuk solicited the meeting himself.    [Question] Specifically how does the Communist Party intend  to proceed in the economic sphere?    [Answer] First of all, for the duration of this crisis  situation we will regulate the key sectors of the economy. We  will try to put taxes and the financial and credit system in  order, and begin to combat crime harshly.    [Question] Many parties, in particular the socialists, are  proposing to hold the first session of the new Supreme Council  before 15 May. What is the attitude of the Communist Party  towards this?    [Answer] We believe that there is no reason to hurry. We  should prepare well.    [Question] How is this to be interpreted: The Communist  Party  is against the essence of the institution of the presidency, and  yet you have nominated a candidate?    [Answer] We see fit to take advantage of the new election  campaign to propagate our program and our ideas.    [Question] It has become known that Boris Oleynik was also  nominated as a contender for the post of president, along with  Simonenko, at the last conference of the KPU. Why did he  withdraw? Did he obey party discipline?    [Oleynik] They say in our village: "One should do what one  has been trained to do." [quote rendered in Ukrainian in the  original] I would not cope with the presidency. I am a writer, a  poet.    [Question] Will you be able to find a common language with  the Kuchma-Grinev bloc?    [Answer] We will seek ways for a rapprochement with this  bloc  and other forces which are truly concerned about the good of  Ukraine. We can promise one thing firmly: We will not be the  first ones to seek confrontation.    There were many other questions--those just out of curiosity  and those openly inflammatory. When the latter were voiced, the  leaders, while bristling deep down, sought a way to smooth over  the rough edges. This might be the reason why the sugary smell  of incense which the members of the Central Committee were  burning to themselves was clearly felt in the auditorium. Of  course, they did not rejoice or embrace as soccer players do  after scoring a goal, but nonetheless tried to prove that all of  their affairs were proceeding as planned and that getting to the  parliament was indeed a piece of cake.    But is this so? After all, it was no secret that out of 28  communist candidates in Kiev and Kiev Oblast, only three  qualified for the runoff election, and not one was ultimately  elected. It is known that there was friction not only between  the Rukh people and the Republican Party, but also between the  socialists and the communists, and in particular, that the  communist V. Trizna fought, in Pecherskiy District of Kiev, the  socialist A. Bozhko, A. Moroz's first deputy. There were a lot  of other snags and rough spots, to put it mildly. Why conceal  them? Why did the official statement of the Communist Party on  the results of the election which was approved at its first  conference breathe not a word of self-criticism but rather  consist of solid self-glorification?    G. Kryuchkov answered my question with a question: "And why  should we make this into Yaroslavna's wailing?"    As if he did not know himself what happens when one fails to  notice even a small splinter in time. Was the lesson learned not  enough, all the more so because, by all signs, the leftist  forces are preparing to play the role of Old Man Mazay in order  to rescue our motley democracy?</p>

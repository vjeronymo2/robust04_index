			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ola Hellblom, Agneta Jonsson, and Mosse Wallen: </F> "Swedish Farmers Take the Bulk of the EU Money to the Nordic  Countries"]    [Text] Swedish agriculture is the big winner in the  European Union [EU] membership deal. Eight to 10 billion of the  Swedish gross contribution of some 18 billion [Swedish] kronor  [SKr] will be returned to the farmers. Swedish subsidies to  agriculture amount this year to 3 billion in direct payments.  Then there is the limit protection, estimated to be worth over  SKr12 billion.    Sweden's state treasury will be the big looser in a possible  EU membership. Even if we have succeeded in getting a so-called  phasing-in subsidy in our membership agreement, the Swedish net  contribution to EU's treasury is estimated at SKr6 billion  during the first year.    Agriculture will, however, be a sure winner in an EU  membership. The largest subsidy item from the EU will be the  so-called acreage subsidy, which is paid out for maximally 1.8  billion hectares. Total acreage subsidies, including fallow  field grants, will be close to SKr4 billion. Animal subsidies  will amount to nearly SKr500 million.    The other main form of grants is export subsidies and the  possibility of selling surplus production at EU stockpile prices  that are considerably above world market prices. Here, the  effects on Swedish agriculture are difficult to estimate,  considering the small scale of exports today.    Other great subsidy items are regional subsidies and grants  to environmental programs, which both require national  cofinancing. EU subsidies to environmental programs amount to  SKr1.5 billion annually and require 50-percent cofinancing.  Regional EU subsidies amount to SKr1 billion for northern  Sweden and about SKr500 million for southern Sweden and require  75-percent cofinancing.    The example of Denmark shows us that agriculture is the main  beneficiary of an EU membership. Here, the farmers received  SKr20 billion in export and other subsidies from the EU last  year. Denmark has, due to its relatively large agricultural  economy, also had a net surplus of about SKr2 billion per year  during its more than 20 years of membership in the EU.  <H5>  Norwegian Farmers Are Negative </H5>   The Norwegian farmers do not want to join the EU. They  represent today the most highly subsidized sector. The  Norwegian farmer is kept sitting on his tractor with a good  income of SKr11 billion per year. But the farmers remain  negative in spite of continued assurances about good conditions.  "We oppose membership for two reasons. We do not agree with  the EU's basic philosophy to let market forces prevail and to  accept expansion at any price," said Per Ole Ranberg at the  Norwegian Framers' Union, one of the two agricultural  organizations.    "Farming plays a completely different role in Norway than in  Europe, where it only produces food. We must supply the country  with food in times of emergency, we look after the environment,  we safeguard quality and maintain an open cultural landscape.  This makes our products very expensive and Norwegian farmers  will be hit hard by EU prices. We also think that the  government calculates the effect of the regional subsidies many  times over. The total agricultural subsidy will in fact be 2  billion less."    According to the government, Norway's agreement with the EU  gives the farmers more or less the same economic conditions as  before. EU's contribution amounts in various forms to SKr4.11  billion and that of the Norwegian state to SKr5.74 billion,  which makes a total of SKr9.85 billion. The state will, in  addition, subsidize all farming to the north of the 62d parallel  and to farmers south of the parallel, who farm in mountainous  regions.    According to this year's agricultural agreement between the  farmers and the state, national grants will continually be  reduced down to SKr11 billion, which means that a readjustment  to the world of the EU can hardly be dramatic.    According to EU rules the total permanent subsidies to  agriculture may not exceed the present level. During some  years, transitional rules will give the Norwegian farmer good  possibilities to adapt himself to the European reality. But he  does not want to.  <H5>  Paavo Has Not Been Forgotten </H5>   "Farmer Paavo, on his frosty homestead, high up on the sandy  heaths of Saarijarvi, tilled his land with steady hands, waiting  for the Good Lord to bless his crop."    Thus wrote the poet Runeberg. But that was a long time ago.  For the Finnish farmer of today the Good Lord has been replaced  by the state, i.e., the taxpayers and a subsidy system, which  has been developed during the last 20 years to protect farming  on frosty homesteads.    The subsidy system has to a large extent been developed by  Heikki Haavisto, present foreign minister and long-time chairman  of the farmers organization MTK [Central Union of Agricultural  Producers], "Finland's LRF" [Federation of Swedish Farmers in  Finland].    Heikki Haavisto was the man in charge of Finland's EU  negotiations in Brussels.    The Finnish agricultural subsidy system is today an almost  impenetrable maze of paragraphs, which encumbers several budget  items. It includes direct grants and subsidies in the form of  tax and pension regulations, generation-change subsidies. The  Ministry of Finance in Helsinki estimates that farmer Paavo  costs today some SKr40 billion per year.    Finland's strained national budget is approximately SKr260  billion.    While the rest of the population has been hit by the  government's austerity program during the deep economic plunge,  nobody has dared to touch agriculture.    Not so even now, on the threshold of the EU. On Thursday [26  May], the government is expected to decide on an additional  subsidy package to the farmers, a so-called national grant to  keep the country's 150,000 farmers indemnified when life in the  EU becomes reality and some other subsidies disappear. The  subsidy amounts to SKr6.1 billion.    The expected decision has aroused anger among the employees,  who think that farmer Paavo has had enough. Their argument is  strengthened by indications that the Finnish national debt,  today 370 billion and 55 percent of the GNP, will double before  the turn of the century to become 100 percent of GNP.    There is one consolation however. The EU will probably not  approve of permanent national subsidies to farmers.</p>

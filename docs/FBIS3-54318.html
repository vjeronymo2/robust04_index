The five-member Afghan delegation include Dr Hashmetullah,  ANLF, son of Sibghatullah Mojaddidi and leader of the  delegation, Dr Talib, Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party], Abdul  Hadi Organdiwal, Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan],  Mr Zari, Jonbesh-e Melli [National Movement], and Haji Mangal  Hussain, Hezb-e Eslami. The foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad  Ali was assisted by the Foreign Secretary Sharyar M. Khan, DG  Afghan Desk, Kazi Humayun, Director Mr Aslam and Ambassador in  Afghanistan Amir Usman. [names and titles as published]    Senior officials at the Foreign Office said it was  significant that the Afghan leaders themselves had included a  representative of General Dostam. "This means recognition for  Dostam by the Afghans themselves and now all parties and forces  inside Afghanistan are represented", the sources added.    The delegation which represented parties opposed to  President  Rabbani continued to insist that it would be only after the  resignation of President Rabbani that Prime Minister Golboddin  Hekmatyar also leave his office.    Source said, "government seems determined to continue to  keep  borders closed as this will give it some leverage against the  Afghans. The Afghan leaders must realise that they cannot keep  on fighting and sending their women and children here. Now the  foreign donors are not helping and Pakistan still has the  refugees for the last thirteen years." The sources said that  there have been repeated suggestions by the foreign office to  the government to open up the borders. Meanwhile, the Afghan  leaders discussed with the foreign office the different formulas  they have to bring about a lasting ceasefire inside Afghanistan.    Some of these steps include 1) resignations of the President  and Prime Minister, 2) evacuation of all military groups from  Kabul, 3) security of Kabul to be given to commanders of Kabul,  4) the leaders should meet to form an interim government, 5) the  interim government should call a Shoora. PPI adds from  Peshawar: The Saudi ambassador to Afghanistan, Sheikh Ukabi  held an important in camera meeting here with three prominent  personalities from different Afghan mojahedin factions and  discussed at length the possibilities of bringing an end to the  ongoing bloody war for the capture of Kabul.    The secret meeting between Saudi ambassador, the political  advisor to Hezb-e Eslami Qazi Muhammad Ami Waqad, Governor of  Nangrahar Province of Afghanistan, Haji Abdul Qadeer and  Commander Jalaluddin Haqqani of Hezb-e Eslami Yunus Khalis was  held here in univerisity town at the Saud Red Crescent Society  office.</p>

Experts say the motor has the features of high efficiency,  low noise, light vibration and low energy consumption. At  present, only a few countries have grasped such production  know-how.    The three sides will invest a total of 68 million yuan  (about  7.82 million U.S. dollars) in the project, with the Chinese side  offering the technology and 40 percent of the investment.    The technology is a one of the state key scientific research  achievements during China's "Eighth Five-Year Plan" (1991-1995).  It passed the state appraisal in November 1992.    Every year 80,000 compression motors are expected to be  produced after completion of the production line.</p>

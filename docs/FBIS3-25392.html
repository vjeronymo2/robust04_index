Yar'adua, who was second in command under Nigeria's military  regime of 1976-1979, Ibrahim Babangida, is claiming 50 million  naira (about 229,000 U.S. dollars) in damages for his arrest and  detention at the weekend. In the suit filed at a high court in  Kaduna, northern Nigeria, on Tuesday [15 February], the retired  general, described his detention as "unlawful, illegal and  unconstitutional". Family sources said he was arrested soon  after he arrived home from a foreign trip.    There has still to be an official comment on his detention,  apart from a press statement credited to a defence spokesman in  Lagos Wednesday. "It is the government that knows the intention  of the detained general and it is the same government that can  account for its actions", the spokesman, Brigadier General Fred  Chijuka was quoted by the statement as saying.    The current problems Gen. Yar'adua is facing can be traced  back to a press conference he gave on 12 January. At that news  conference, he asked the three-month-old government of Gen.  Abacha to hand over to a national government by December of this  year.    Police authorities in Lagos reacted a day later by warning  Nigerian politicians against "utterances capable of threatening  government's good intention to bequeath a viable democratic  institution in the country".    Pro-democracy groups have criticized the detention of the  general, who was a leading Social Democratic Party (SPD)  presidential candidate before being disqualified because of what  the then military government of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida described  as widespread electoral fraud by the aspirants.    Meanwhile, the retired Nigerian head of state, Gen. Yakubu  Gowon, who prosecuted the 30-month Biafra civil war (1967-70),  to keep Nigeria one, has stressed that the country's unity was  not negotiable. Gowon, toppled in 1975 after nine years in  power, told journalists in Minna, northern Nigeria, Tuesday  after visiting former head of state, Gen. Babangida, that  "whatever we do, this nation is more important than any of us  and we must continue to keep it one". He condemned public  statements that could inflame passion and hasten the  disintegration of the country.</p>

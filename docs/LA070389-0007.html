			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'THEY REALLY DESERVE RAISE'  </P> <P> Every month or so you come up with an editorial on why you feel federal  officials in the various branches of our government and members of Congress  should get a raise ("They Really Deserve a Raise," June 22). You always state  their base pay but say nothing of the many free trips officials take at  taxpayers' expense, as well as all of the expensive perks they receive. In  addition to this members of Congress have their lovely honorariums.  </P> <P> I believe the taxpayers let it be known in no uncertain terms that they were  tired of paying taxes to keep supporting these drones. Many of them have said  that they could do much better in the private sector. I notice none of them  leave.  </P> <P> What we need is a good house-cleaning. We need statesmen in all branches who  will serve for a two-year term and then return to the private sector.  </P> <P> Then we would have people who would have to live with the laws they pass. This  is, after all, a democracy and professional politicians are not conducive to  remembering that they are not princes and princesses.  </P> <P> Remember that former President Ronald Reagan was unhappy because he could only  serve two terms. He said he wanted to do a lot more. Yes, I guess he did; he  hadn't quite bankrupted the country yet but one more term would have done it.  </P> <P> We the taxpayers didn't cause the savings and loan problems nor the HUD  problems, etc., but we are going to have to pay the bill -- and with all of  those expensive staff members they had to help them too! I say enough!  </P> <P> HARRIETTE L. BAKER  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

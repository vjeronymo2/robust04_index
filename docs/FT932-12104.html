			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Resignation at Kodak puts pressure on Dow Wall Street US STOCK markets ended flat to firmer yesterday, although blue chip issues failed to sustain early gains because of a sharp fall in Eastman Kodak shares, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.43 at 3,413.50, but well above the day's low of 3,395.40. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 0.01 up at 438.02, while the Nasdaq composite gained 5.64 at 658.16. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 268m shares. The markets opened in an uncertain mood, with sentiment boosted by Tuesday's gains (the first in six trading days) but undermined by further increases in bond yields, which have climbed to 6.9 per cent barely a week after falling to 6.7 per cent. In spite of higher bond rates, equity prices opened firmer, thanks partly to improved earnings from Ford Motor and a strong showing from oil shares. The early gains, however, were something of an illusion because trading had not yet opened in Eastman Kodak shares due to an order imbalance on the sell side. When Kodak finally opened, the Dow quickly dropped along with Kodak shares, which were hit by the news that Mr Christopher Steffen, the company's chief financial officer and the man investors had hoped would lead a revival in Kodak's fortunes, had suddenly resigned over differences with other senior managers. By the close, Kodak had recovered a little but was still down Dollars 4 7/8 at Dollars 47 1/2 following volume of 11.6m shares. The news of Mr Steffen's resignation completely overshadowed the announcement of Kodak's first-quarter earnings, which came in at 46 cents a share of net income, up slightly from the year-ago figure. Ford advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 54 1/4 in volume of 2.7m shares after the car maker reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 1.02 a share, well up from the 36 cents a share earned a year ago and well ahead of analysts' expectations. The news from Ford lifted the rest of the motor sector, with General Motors adding Dollars 2 at Dollars 42 3/8 and Chrysler Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 41. Some leading oil issues were in demand following positive comments on Chevron from Wall Street analysts. Chevron rose Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 85, Texaco Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 64 5/8 and Mobil Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 69 1/8 . Nasdaq stocks were led higher by the technology sector, where Intel firmed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 94 1/2 and Microsoft added Dollars 3 1/2 at Dollars 86. Canada TORONTO ended higher after further active trading, boosted by a surge in gold shares. The TSE 300 index was up 19 points at 3,710.2 and rises outscored declines by 360 to 318. Volume amounted to 60.4m shares. The golds index rose 3.27 per cent as the New York spot bullion price firmed USDollars 2.10 an ounce. Consumer products gained 1.07 per cent.</p>

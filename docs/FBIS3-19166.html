			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has stated that the  resolution adopted by the European Parliament [EP] regarding the  lifting of certain deputies' immunities is unacceptable adding  that the reason for it is lack of information.    Answering reporters' questions in Eskisehir, Cetin pointed  out that there is a wish to politicize the issue and take it  outside its limits. Indicating that similar decisions have been  taken in numerous countries, Cetin gave the lifting of four  German deputies' immunities for holding an illegal demonstration  as an example.    In answer to a question, Cetin stated that Turkey does not  make concessions, the government being a government which cannot  be coerced.</p>

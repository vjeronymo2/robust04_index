			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Jobs: Blackest year yet on executive market - Reported upturns in demand for managers and specialists have evidently been false dawns SAY not the struggle nought availeth, advised the poet Arthur Hugh Clough, before adding by way of explanation: . . . not by eastern windows only, When daylight comes, comes in the light, In front, the sun climbs slow, how slowly, But westward, look, the land is bright. One thing seems sure. Whatever he may have been referring to, it was not the United Kingdom market for managers and higher-ranked specialist staff. Over the past few days the Jobs column has scanned same not only from eastward and westward, but also from northward and southward and all points between. Nary a chink of daylight is to be seen. That's not to say there has been any lack of false dawns. Indeed, I myself was guilty of heralding one of them a whole year ago in the part of the market which consists of advertisements of executive-type jobs in UK national journals. Well within the next 12 months, I forecast at the time, the advertised demand would be turning up again. What it has actually done can be seen from the table alongside which, as usual, is compiled from the quarterly counts made by the MSL international consultancy. The upper part of the table focuses on the 12-monthly period ended on June 30, going back to 1986-87, showing the number of job-openings advertised in eight broad types of executive work. Each opening is counted as one, no matter how many times the advertisement for it appears. The bottom part of the table, below the 12-month totals, shows the all-types tallies for each of the quarterly periods. As the demand is to some extent seasonal - being usually highest in January-March then falling off with each successive quarter - the most useful basis for comparison is the corresponding three months of the year before. By that yardstick, it is now 3 3/4 years since any quarter showed an increase. Moreover, perhaps as a punishment for my hubris in predicting an upturn just a year ago, every one of the quarters since then has been worse than what was previously the lowest three-monthly tally since MSL began counting in 1959 - 4,077 in October-December 1980. Even so, one thing that the optimist in me at first interpreted as a bright spot is the slowing of the rate of descent to a single digit between January-March and April-June just gone. After all, on average across the years, the seasonal pattern of the market produces a fall of about 9 per cent between those two quarters. So a decline of merely 5 per cent might be good news in disguise. Unfortunately, my inquiries suggest not. The slowing looks to be a one-off effect of the UK's general election in April. Organisations fearing a Labour government apparently delayed filling vacancies until victory went to the Tories, distorting the usual pattern. Much the same benighted picture is shown by the counts which MSL has kept since the mid-1980s of advertised demand by four sectors of business. In every case it was a record low. For the 12 months to June 30, high-tech companies produced a total of 874 executive jobs, 38 per cent down on the previous worst in 1990-91. Those in energy and related industries totalled 1,108, little more than half as many as in the 12 months before. Food, drink and tobacco companies produced 514, down 18 per cent on 1990-91. Retailing's total was 11 per cent down at 511 for the 12 months, but mercifully the quarter just ended showed an increase over April-June 1991. True, advertised demand, although the largest part of the market, is not the only one. There are also consultants recruiting by the personal-approach methods of executive search, and so-called contingency recruiters who supply candidates from large numbers of job-seekers on their books. Not long ago it was reported that searchers and contingency businesses were experiencing an upturn. But to judge by members of both camps I've talked to, that upturn has shared the fate of the one I predicted last July. The consensus was that, although business may now be better than in the depths of last year, the rise in demand hasn't been sustained. 'Instead of scraping the bottom, we're bumping along a foot or two above it,' said one. All of which, alas, adds up to a continuing grim outlook for the thousands of executives thrown out of work in the recession, mostly through no fault of their own. Unlike the comparative handful of Lloyd's 'names' who've been unlucky with their side investment, their plight has not been put on public show. And although I've tried to discover what they are doing, nobody I'm in touch with knows. Agencies acting as clearing houses for freelance consultants and the like report an increase in registrations, but not one commensurate with the wholesale loss of jobs. I've also heard that advertisements now tend to draw so many applications that some employers are going into competition with contingency recruiters by setting up their own candidate banks for when the dawn breaks. May it come soon.</p>

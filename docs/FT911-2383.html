			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Tough Scotsman confounds his critics: Persistence has paid off for the dogged Ofgas chief Ask any of the thousands of officials of the California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco who calls the shots in the pricing and supply of gas, and you will get one answer: 'We do'. Unfortunately, when Mr James McKinnon was appointed director-general of the UK's Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas), nearly five years ago, nobody in British Gas seems to have listened to the fact-finding missions which went west to discover how regulation actually works. The corporation and much of the City preferred to believe the government's line that in Britain, the relationship between monopoly and officials would be entirely different. Instead of detailed interference, with cohorts of lawyers enquiring into a public utility's business, the British system, it was said, would represent a 'light rein', and Mr McKinnon, it was quietly hinted, was a semi-retired accountant (then aged 56) who would give no trouble. This proved to be as profound a misreading of Mr McKinnon's tough Glaswegian character as it was of the Gas Act (1986). Perhaps the lorry driver's son who climbed the accountancy ranks to become finance director of the Imperial Group might then have seemed a spent force. He was unceremoniously pushed out of Imperial as part of the 'old guard' when Hanson took it over and might well have retired with his pay-off. Sir Peter Walker, then energy secretary, seems to have taken this view when he suggested, as Mr McKinnon recalls, that Ofgas would be a nice two-day-a-week job in a little office with a staff of fewer than 30. So it might have proved except that British Gas decided on his first visit to its South Bank headquarters to teach Mr McKinnon a lesson. When he enquired how such a fine building was financed, he was told to mind his own business. And he did. He bombarded the corporation with requests, and then demands for information, and then threats. He proved unexpectedly successful at PR, largely by telling the media most of what he was up to, US style. By threats of the High Court, a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and subtler hints of public interest and political pressure, he has carried through a succession of campaigns, of which the latest on the pricing of domestic gas is the most important. The score, says one insider, is: British Gas nil, Mr McKinnon five. He would not put it quite that way, but offers no better image. Mr McKinnon once said that if both sides are bawling out the referee, he has probably got it about right. Now despite criticism that he has become an interfering US-style busybody, he says: 'I have no idea of hanging up my boots'. Nor, it seems, is it in his nature to refrain from using them if the game gets rough.</p>

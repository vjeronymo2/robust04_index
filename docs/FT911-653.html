			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Stalemate on venue for Ulster talks TALKS on Northern Ireland's future were yesterday postponed until Monday as the province's main political parties failed yet again to reach agreement on the venue for entry by the government of the Irish Republic into the negotiations, writes Ralph Atkins. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, expressed frustration after the third successive day of bilateral meetings with unionist and nationalist politicians and called on the participants to 'reflect on their positions over the weekend'. Mr Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister, is to meet Mr Brooke in London today to discuss the stalemate. The continuing intransigence on a logistical detail has intensified the gloom surrounding the talks process, which began two weeks ago. The first 'round table', or plenary, discussions had been due to take place on Tuesday. But discussions remain at the 'talks-about-talks' stage. Mr Brooke's sense of disappointment was shared by participants at the talks, but it appears little headway has been made in resolving differences between the parties. As he left the Stormont parliament buildings in Belfast, Mr Brooke said that if agreement could not be reached 'then I think we would have to pause', but he appeared confident that the 'loose ends' would be tidied up. He added: 'I retain confidence that, because of the purposefulness with which people have been discussing what they want to talk about when we sit down in plenary, that we will find a way through.' Unionists want the talks involving Dublin to be held in London. The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party and the Irish government would prefer a venue in Ireland. Continental European locations appear to have been ruled out for logistical reasons. Asked if he had underestimated the symbolism of the venue, Mr Brooke replied: 'It may have been that I misread the situation as involving slightly more flexibility than there was.'

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- The strong yen has widened  the price gap between domestic and imported rice in 1993, the  Agriculture Ministry reported Tuesday [10 May].    The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said its  estimate showed that the price of rice purchased by the  government from growers was 15 times higher than that of rice  imported from Thailand, compared with 11 times in the preceding  year. The calculation was made at the yen's average exchange  rate against the dollar for the first nine months of 1993 of  112.22 yen per dollar, up 14.43 yen over the year before, the  ministry said.    The ministry said the government's purchase price of  domestic  rice in 1993 was unchanged from the year before at about 210,000  yen per ton, compared with about 14,000 yen for Thai rice, down  5,000 yen from the preceding year, and about 26,000 yen for U.S.  rice, down 4,000 yen.    At the retail level, the average price of domestic rice for  the January-October period of 1993 stood at 384 yen per  kilogram, up 10 yen over the year before due to a poor harvest.    In the same period, the ministry said, the retail price of  Thai rice dropped 9 yen from the year before to 48 yen per  kilogram while that of U.S. rice was down 19 yen at 128 yen.</p>

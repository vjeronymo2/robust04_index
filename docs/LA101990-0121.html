			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE INVESTIGATING ALLEGED EXTORTION BY LAOTIAN AGENCY;  </P> <P> REFUGEES: FAMILY COMMUNITY INC. OF GARDEN GROVE DEMANDED MONEY FOR  REVOLUTIONARY GROUP IN LAOS, NEW ARRIVALS COMPLAIN.  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office confirmed Thursday it is investigating  allegations that Laotian refugees in Southern California were shaken down for  contributions to a Laos liberation group as a condition for receiving social  services.  </P> <P> After investigating extortion complaints from about 18 Hmong refugees in  Riverside, San Bernardino and Orange Counties, the state Department of Social  Services has also recommended terminating all state and county contracts with  the social service agency, Lao Family Community Inc., said department  spokeswoman Kathleen Norris.  </P> <P> "The evidence is there to support these allegations, and we are acting  accordingly," Norris said Thursday. She said the department had been criticized  for ignoring such allegations from refugees in the past and was now conducting  a statewide probe.  </P> <P> Deputy Atty. Gen. James D. Dutton said prosecutors are also conducting a  separate criminal investigation into alleged embezzlement, extortion and other  crimes by individuals who "may be connected or associated" with the political  group, United Lao National Liberation Front, or with Lao Family Community. Both  organizations have headquarters in Garden Grove.  </P> <P> The Liberation Front, also called Neo Hom, advocates the overthrow of the  Communist government of Laos. It is headed by former Laotian Gen. Vang Pao, who  once led a Hmong army in a Central Intelligence Agency-backed drive against the  Pathet Lao.  </P> <P> The Neo Hom had been all but forgotten until December, when it reportedly  declared a "provisional revolutionary government" from the jungles of Laos and  began waging insurgent attacks against the government. Pao, who lives in Garden  Grove but travels extensively, is reported to be the military head of Neo Hom.  </P> <P> Pao's son-in-law, Kao Thao, was formerly the director of Lao Family Community,  a nonprofit agency with 10 branch offices in California and other states.  </P> <P> Thao, 30, was fired from Lao Family in July for misappropriating funds. Last  month he pleaded guilty to embezzling more than $70,000 from the agency and  promised to repay the money. He is scheduled to be sentenced in November.  </P> <P> Dutton said the embezzlement case is unrelated to the extortion probe. Thao's  attorney, Bruce Bridgman, said he had no knowledge of any extortion probe.  </P> <P> Lao Family acting director Gayle Morrison on Thursday denied that the social  service agency and the Liberation Front are secretly linked. Morrison called  the ongoing multiple investigations "a witch hunt."  </P> <P> Morrison also said the evidence did not justify the recommendation by the DSS'  Civil Rights Bureau that all state contracts with Lao Family be terminated.  </P> <P> "We're bending over backwards to help them (investigate), and we will do  anything to do so," Morrison said.  </P> <P> In Orange County, Lao Family has a $356,000 state contract to run a refugee  child development program in Huntington Beach. It has lost contracts for job  training and other services, however, and has been cited by the Internal  Revenue Service for nonpayment of payroll taxes.  </P> <P> Alicia Martinez, who conducted the investigation for the Civil Rights Bureau,  said about 18 refugees in Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties have  alleged they were asked for contributions to the Liberation Front after they  were referred to Lao Family Community for welfare screening or job training.  </P> <P> Fearful that they would not receive help otherwise, some refugees contributed  from $60 to $100 a month from their welfare checks to the cause, Martinez said.  </P> <P> In addition, Martinez said, refugees were sold certificates that would  guarantee them jobs as government officials in a newly liberated Laos, paying  between $1,000 and $5,000 for the documents.  </P> <P> "They were being told that if they wanted to get into Laos when Vang Pao took  over again, that they would have to have these certificates if they wanted to  be a policeman or a judge or some official," Martinez said.  </P> <P> Sources in Orange County said the sale of such certificates has been common  knowledge in the Laotian refugee community for years. Many people supported the  cause and donated freely, but others were pressured, the source said.  </P> <P> "It's a very sad case," the source said. "They have been telling people that if  you don't belong to the organization, you can't go back when they liberate the  country."  </P> <P> According to Martinez, some refugees in San Bernardino said they were afraid to  go to Lao Family for welfare screening because they had been forced to  contribute to the Liberation Front while in Thai refugee camps, or had been  approached by the group in this country.  </P> <P> Martinez said Thao had shared an office with Liberation Front officials a few  doors down from the Lao Family headquarters in Garden Grove. During a search of  the office by the attorney general's investigators, she said, one of Thao's  filing cabinets was found to contain Lao Family case files and budgets in the  same drawer as files marked with the Neo Hom logo.  </P> <P> Though some of the material was in Hmong, Martinez said, "there were lists of  names of people who were contributing to Neo Hom." She would not comment on  whether the donors' names matched those on the case files.  </P> <P> However, Morrison said, the filing cabinet belonged to the Neo Hom officials  who shared the office, and not to Thao. She said the state report was  inaccurate and misleading, and an internal probe has turned up no corroborating  evidence.  </P></p>

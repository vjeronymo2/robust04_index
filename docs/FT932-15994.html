			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Hope raised for fraud trials FRAUD TRIALS should be shorter and juries better informed after the Court of Appeal judgment that the Serious Fraud Office can use all information given to company liquidators under compulsion as evidence in court, an appeal court judge said yesterday. Three appeal judges gave their reasons behind the judgment, delivered last month, that the SFO could have full access to transcripts of interviews carried out by administrators using their powers under the Insolvency Act to compel interviewees to answer questions. The SFO can use this information freely as evidence in court, they ruled. The issue had been taken to appeal by Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Larry Trachtenberg and Mr Muhammed Naviede, head of the Arrows group, who all face fraud charges brought by the SFO. All three have also been interviewed by administrators using Insolvency Act powers. The judges said the Insolvency Act 1986 did not limit provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 1987, which established the SFO. They also rejected arguments by Robson Rhodes, the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, and from administrators of other Maxwell companies, that the SFO's powers should be restricted to enable liquidation operations to be carried out speedily and effectively. Lord Justice Steyn said the ruling 'will enable the contextual scene, such as the hierarchy of companies, the role of individuals, the flow of funds, and like matters, to be placed before the jury far more effectively than has hitherto been regarded as possible'. He added that it should 'improve the chances of the SFO system functioning more efficiently'.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> CLEAN CAMPAIGN: UCI student elections officials expect all the campaign posters  to be gone by Saturday afternoon, 48 hours after the end of voting. . . . Why?  Because a candidate who doesn't comply could be disqualified, even after he's  won.  </P> <P> And no one will know the winners until Monday. . . . But is it legal? No, says  attorney Dan Stormer, who successfully sued the university in 1985 to reform  student election regulations. "It's ludicrous. It's election by intimidation,"  he says.

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar weakness threatens earnings-led recovery A US dollar down by another 3 per cent against the D-Mark in less than two weeks put more question marks against the proposition of the fast track, export-led European earnings per share recovery, writes Our Markets Staff. Weakening bonds, and bond and equity futures markets did the rest. FRANKFURT fell by more than a percentage point on the session, the Dax index losing 25.78 at 2,123.79, and weakened again after hours, the Ibis-indicated Dax ending the afternoon at 2,113.37 after the dollar, US treasuries and equities opened lower in New York. Turnover stayed low, falling from DM5.2bn to DM4.7bn. At Merck Finck, in Dusseldorf, Mr Matthias Welticke said nearly a fortnight ago (when the Dax, coincidentally, was close to last Friday's level) that it only made sense to buy German equities at 5 per cent below their historic high, 2,270 on the Dax, if there were a realistic chance of exceeding this level in the foreseeable future. 'That requires a fundamental trigger', said Mr Welticke, 'and this can only be a better outlook for bonds and interest rates.' His colleague, Mr Horst-Kaspar Greven, noted yesterday that the September bund future was testing resistance on the downgrade. Mr Greven added that the past two weeks had seen the beginning of the German half-year results season - 'below expectations in general,' he remarked, 'but, then, the expectations have been exaggerated.' Yesterday's example was Mannesmann, down DM7.70 to DM447.80. MILAN took its cue from the political scene following some positive comments from government ministers over the weekend. Financial markets were especially comforted by remarks made by the labour minister indicating that there would have to be a reform of the pensions system in the 1995 budget, which is due to be discussed next month. The Comit index closed 14.99 or 2.3 per cent to 676.14. Opposition to pensions reform had been one of problems facing the administration of prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. A feeling that divisions within the coalition government might be on the mend was sufficient yesterday to prompt a modest rally, albeit in low volume. Olivetti was one of day's the biggest gainers, rising L125 to L2,390. PARIS was shaken by events in the bond market, while general equity activity remained low. The CAC-40 index slipped 28.70 or 1.4 per cent to 1,972.63, after a session low of 1,964. Turnover picked up to FFr3.2bn from Friday's FFr2.2bn. Eurotunnel, which is not an index constituent, weakened FFr1.40 to FFr24.15 on weekend newspaper reports, on which the company had no comment, that it might cut prices for freight and car users. The other Euro-stock, Euro Disney, closed unchanged at FFr10.30. In a comment on last week's resignation of the group's finance director, Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe noted that the news should have come as no surprise, given the number of senior staff who have left the organisation. Nevertheless, he added, 'the shares are likely to remain weak, with the focus on rebuilding image and improving revenues'. AMSTERDAM weakened in line with the general downward trend on the continent, although it is seen as particularly vulnerable to the weaker dollar. The AEX index eased 3.12 to 409.33. The market was also hosting another week of corporate results. Gist-Brocades, the biotechnology group, came in with half year figures at the lower end of expectations and the shares subsequently fell Fl 1.70 to Fl 47.30. KNP BT, the paper company, which is due to report half year data on Thursday, was off Fl 1.00 at Fl 48.40 in line with the market. ZURICH was characterised by lack of confidence in the short term, and low volume as the SMI index closed 24.6 lower at 2,532.4. Derivatives-led selling hit prices early in the day and cyclicals came under pressure, BBC falling another SFr24 to SFr1,176 and Georg Fischer SFr50 to SFr1,460. However, the picture was little brighter elsewhere, with Roche certificates down SFr65 at SFr5,625, UBS SFr11 lower at SFr1,080 and CS Holding down SFr12 at SFr523. MADRID moved with the declines in the dollar and its domestic bond market and continued its downward career, nearing the 300 support level as the general index fell another 2.97 to 303.21. Banesto's new chairman said that the recently troubled banking and finance group had entered a new phase which should lead to a relatively rapid return to profitability; but this did not impress Santander which assumed control of Banesto after the April 25 auction of the company; Santander's shares dropped Pta110 to Pta5,050. STOCKHOLM liked the opposition social democrats' election manifesto, published late last Friday. Bonds rose and the Affarsvarlden General index fell only 2.4 to 1,421.3. HELSINKI, closing early in the day, seemed to ignore trends elsewhere in most of Europe as domestic bond yields continued to decline and the Hex index rose 12.8 to 1,888.9, up nearly 20 per cent this year. However, it closed well below its intraday high of 1,906.4. TEL AVIV staged a slight recovery following Sunday's 10 per cent fall which was prompted by a government proposal to introduce a 10 per cent capital gains tax on share profits from January 1. The stock exchange authorities had also suspended the 10 per cent limit by which share prices were allowed to move. The Mishtanim index yesterday gained 3.72 or 2.25 per cent, to 168.90 in high turnover of Shk220m. The exchange was closed for two days last week following the government announcement.

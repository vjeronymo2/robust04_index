			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Tories reaffirm Ulster presence SIR Norman Fowler, the Conservative chairman, yesterday denied that the party intended to stop contesting parliamentary elections in Northern Ireland. He said: 'There have been reports about possible moves within the Conservative party to scale down, or even wind up our association in Northern Ireland. These comments are without foundation.' Sir Norman was referring to recent statements by Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, that he expected the Tory party presence in the province to collapse.</p>

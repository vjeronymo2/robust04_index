			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Poland eager to settle UK air dispute - Warsaw wants London flight row resolved for summer Poland is seeking a quick end to the long-running dispute between British Airways and Lot, the Polish state-owned airline, which has blocked all direct flights between Poland and the UK since October 30. 'We've lost the winter, that was clear when we failed to get a deal by Christmas to catch the seasonal traffic, but we now want to resolve the dispute in time for the summer season starting in April,' says Mr Boguslaw Liberadzki, the Polish transport minister. The dispute arose out of the Polish government's refusal to allow British Airways to double its flights to Warsaw from seven to 14 a week. BA wanted to introduce an afternoon flight from London which would return from Warsaw in time for transit passengers to transfer onto flights to North American and other destinations. Lot feared that this would cream off passengers from its own transatlantic flights serving the large Polish communities in Chicago and other cities. The two airlines, backed by their respective government agencies, have ignored the protests of thousands of business and other passengers who have been obliged by the dispute to change aircraft at other north European airports, doubling travel time between the two countries. Mr Liberadzki says he reached an 'understanding' with Lord Caithness, the UK minister who was dealing with the matter until he left the government earlier this year. 'Both sides agreed they should emerge from the clash without losing face with the number of flights by both carriers gradually increasing to 14 a week over three years,' he said. The UK minister now responsible for resolving the dispute is Lord McKay of Ardbrecknish. The dispute between BA, which last week announced a threefold increase in profits to Pounds 65m for the third quarter of 1993, and Lot, which is being prepared for privatisation, reflects a tough battle by international airlines for a share in the fast-growing east European travel market. BA, whose proposed Air Russia joint venture is currently holding fire, has discarded all previous pooling arrangements with east European airlines, with the exception of Aeroflot, and has held aloof from the kind of tie-ups with east European airlines which led Air France to take a stake in CSA, the Czech airline, and Alitalia to buy a stake in Malev of Hungary. Instead BA opted to double its flights into Prague, Budapest and Warsaw. It obtained agreement from the Czech and Hungarian authorities, increasing the competitive pressure on CSA and Malev and helping to fill seats on its owntransatlantic and other flights with transit passengers from central Europe. BA's hopes to achieve the same results in Poland, however, came up against stiff resistance. Morale at Lot has improved in recent months and so has profitability. The company yesterday reported a Zl 62.9bn (Dollars 3.4m) profit for 1993 after a Zl 84.1bn loss in 1992. It has managed to sell all its old Soviet aircraft and now runs an all-western fleet of three Boeing 767s, eight 737s and five Italo-French ATR 72s, leaving it with total debt of around Dollars 1bn.</p>

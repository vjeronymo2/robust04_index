			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 4 Jun (EFE) -- Chile will request that the  Bolivian sea coast claim not be included in the 24th OAS General  Assembly, which opens in Belem de Para (Brazil) on 6 June. This  request is listed in point 15 of the issues to be discussed  during the foreign ministers' meeting, entitled "Report on the  Bolivian Maritime Problem."    According to some sources, the Chilean position on the  Bolivian claim of a maritime outlet through the Chilean coast is  an issue that should be discussed by the two countries and is  not a multilateral issue for discussion in an international  meeting.    According to the local press, the Chilean Government  believes  there are no pending conflicts with Bolivia, with which Chile  has maintained consular relations since 1978.    The Chilean delegation to the OAS will be headed by Chilean  Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa, who left for Brazil on 4 June.  Figueroa will then leave for an official visit to Argentina on 8  June.    The Chilean press said the Bolivian claim for a sea outlet  to  the Pacific is one of the recurrent issues submitted to the OAS  Assembly. Bolivia lost its sovereign sea coast after the 1879  Pacific War, which it fought with Peru against Chile.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Retailing again main engine of growth - BAA For the first time BAA, the airports operator, is to report quarterly results. Tomorrow it is to release figures for the first nine months of the year to March 30. Analysts are shy of forecasting for the third quarter, but anticipate that full-year profits will fall between Pounds 312m and Pounds 325m. Again the main engine of growth is expected to be the retailing side, though improved productivity and cost-cutting throughout the group will have their impact. Watchers will be awaiting the group's reaction to the government's call for a probe into the economic regulation of airports - currently overseen by the Civil Aviation Authority and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS GIVEN $100,000 BY TIMES FUND  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times Fund has again awarded $100,000 in educational  grants-in-aid to 200 graduating high school seniors throughout Southern  California. The grants will enable the students to continue their education  next fall.  </P> <P> The $500 awards were presented this month at ceremonies conducted at public and  private schools in San Diego, Los Angeles and Orange counties.  </P> <P> The grants-in-aid program, started by the Times Fund in 1967, provides grants  to students whose high school grade-point average is 2.9 or below, but whom  teachers or counselors designate as having high potential for academic success.  Since its inception, the program has awarded more than 6,000 grants totaling  more than $2.3 million.  </P> <P> The grants may be used at trade or technical schools, colleges or universities.  </P> <P> "For years, The Times has quietly supported San Diego's youth with programs  designed to brighten the present and enrich the future," said Phyllis Pfeiffer,  general manager of the San Diego County Edition of The Times. "Encouraging  deserving local seniors to pursue their dreams of higher education is a  particularly rewarding role."  </P> <P> "These students have demonstrated a desire to get the schooling necessary to  become productive, contributing members of their communities. The Times is  proud to help turn that drive for advancement into reality," said Tom Johnson,  publisher and chief executive officer of The Times and president of the Times  Fund.  </P> <P> The grants-in-aid program is supported by the proceeds of various  Times-sponsored events, such as the Sundance World Class cycling event last  month at the velodrome in Balboa Park.  </P> <P> These students, listed with their high schools, are grant recipients in San  Diego County this year:  </P> <P> Libby Marie Allen, Mira Mesa.  </P> <P> Delina Breeding, Lincoln.  </P> <P> Carlos Cruz, Garfield.  </P> <P> Gallegos E.

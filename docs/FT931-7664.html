			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Western Mining acquires Outokumpu nickel stake WESTERN MINING Corp (WMC), the Australian resources group, has agreed to buy a 50 per cent share in the Mount Keith nickel deposit in Western Australia from Outokumpu, the Finnish metals group. The deal will give WMC 100 per cent ownership of Mount Keith, which is expected to start producing about 28,000 tonnes a year of nickel concentrate in early 1995. However, the group will have to fund development costs estimated at ADollars 450m (USDollars 306m). WMC said it had signed an agreement giving Outokumpu the right to buy 50 per cent of Mount Keith production for 10 years. Analysts said the deal suggested that WMC would not exercise its right to purchase a 49 per cent share in the Olympic Dam copper/gold/silver/uranium mine in South Australia from BP, its joint venture partner. BP said in November that it would sell the stake for USDollars 456m to Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation-De Beers group of South Africa, unless WMC exercised its right to buy the stake at the same price. Acquisition of the BP shares would make WMC solely responsible for funding proposed expansion costing around ADollars 1bn at Olympic Dam. The group is also committed to investing ADollars 105m at its Kambalda nickel operations in Western Australia provided the state government moves to allow continuous mining. WMC acquired its half-share in Mount Keith in 1991 following a bitterly-contested joint takeover with the Normandy Poseidon group of Australian Consolidated Minerals (AMC). AMC's defence against the bid centred on an attempt to tie up control of Mount Keith by selling a half-share to Outokumpu. But the move backfired when Outokumpu agreed to develop the mine jointly with WMC.</p>

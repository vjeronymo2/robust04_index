			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE REAL ESTATE RECOVERY MAY BE SLOW, S&amp;LS TOLD  </P> <P> Residential real estate markets in California will take another 18 months to  recover, while the state's commercial real estate sector could be stuck in a  downturn for another three years, real estate experts predicted Tuesday.  </P> <P> The news offered little encouragement to savings and loan executives here  attending the annual convention of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the  industry's main trade group. But a panel of real estate experts did predict  that California will not suffer a New England-style real estate recession, and  that the fallout for lenders will be limited.  </P> <P> Kenneth T. Rosen, chairman of the center for real estate and urban economics at  UC Berkeley, said median house prices in some areas of California, which have  already fallen from 4% to 6%, may drop another 5% to 10% before turning up.  </P> <P> He said a Southern Californian forced to sell a home today would likely have to  sell at a price 10% to 15% below the peak of early 1989. Rosen said he expects  that lenders will see increases in late mortgage payments and foreclosures as  they did during the 1981-82 recession.  </P> <P> Still, Rosen said, California's slump differs significantly from New England's,  where housing prices have dropped about 10%. Rosen said the New England real  estate boom that preceded the current slump was driven by a huge growth in  income, not population growth.  </P> <P> California's boom, however, was driven by migration of people into the state,  and that is expected to continue, Rosen said. He noted, for example, that  California can expect a huge influx of people from Hong Kong before the colony  is turned over to China in 1997.  </P> <P> Anthony Downs, a real estate expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington,  said commercial development is in a depression. He said the building boom of  the 1980s, caused by such factors as easy credit and favorable real estate tax  laws in the early part of the decade, caused so much overbuilding that it may  take five years before builders start launching new commercial projects.  </P> <P> "We built too damn much space," Downs said. "We have got to absorb that space  and it will take us a long time."  </P> <P> Downs said, however, that the halt in new projects ultimately will have a  positive effect because it will strengthen the market for existing commercial  buildings.  </P></p>

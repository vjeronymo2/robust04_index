			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Guatemalan confusion over Serrano successor GUATEMALA'S political system was in confusion yesterday over who would succeed Mr Jorge Serrano, who left the country this week after being deposed as president. Mr Gustavo Espina, Guatemala's acting president and former vice-president, was prevented from taking office late on Wednesday night because of congressional opposition. He needed a majority of Congress's 117 members to approve his swearing in, but only 44 turned out in support. Mr Espina delivered a populist speech to Congress calling on it to purge corrupt members. He said he would donate the president's unaccountable 'confidential expenses' - by which the president buys votes in Congress - to social services. He asked for his ministerial colleagues to resign. Mr Serrano attempted to seize authoritarian powers and suspend the constitution last week, but found himself deposed by the military. Instability may grow if the succession issue is not resolved soon. Mr Espina does not appear to have the support of the private sector, unions or main political parties. 'The best thing that Espina can do is resign,' said Mr Peter Lamport, a representative of the private sector coalition Cacif. A constitutional court is examining whether Mr Espina's support for Mr Serrano's attempted 'self coup' violated the constitution. If it did, Mr Espina would be legally excluded from the presidency. Mr Edgar Tuna Valladares, attorney-general, has opened proceedings against Mr Serrano, Mr Espina and Mr Francisco Perdomo, minister of the interior, 'to determine responsibility in the interruption of constitutional order'. The rejection of Mr Espina has created a problem for the military, which denied on Wednesday that he had resigned. On Tuesday General Jose Domingo Garca Samayoa, defence minister, said Mr Espina would remain acting president in order to avoid a legal vacuum until a purged Congress was able to meet and accept his resignation. The military's ambiguity is said to be causing internal divisions. But observers believe it is unlikely the army will adopt strong-arm tactics after covering its actions until now under a veil of legality.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Christel Tardif: "First A300-600F Leaves </F> Plant"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE  INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] All freshly molded and  off the final assembly line in Toulouse, the biggest cargo  aircraft of the Airbus series is now less than a month away from  its first test flights.    Launched in July 1991 as the result of a contract between  Airbus Industrie and Federal Express Corporation involving 25  firm orders accompanied by 50 commitments to buy, the A300-600F  program is the first aircraft of this class to be ordered in  large numbers.    This first aircraft turned out by the plant comes four  months  after they began to assemble the first sections at German Airbus  in Hamburg. This first aircraft will soon embark on a campaign  of test flights lasting 45 hours. The objectives: to, of course,  verify its aerodynamic properties, the good working order of its  systems... but also--and especially--to evaluate the performance  of the FADEC [Full Authority Digital Engine Control] of the  General Electric CF6-80C engines. This last-named point is  important for Airbus Industrie, which is using the GE CF6-80C  with FADEC for the first time in its aircraft series.    In addition to the flight tests, a certain number of ground  tests are planned to validate the freight-loading systems, air  conditioning.... The verification and fine tuning of the  "multiple choice" freight-loading system with its forward door  area and rear area for handling containers have already been the  subject of a certain number of tests in Breme. Furthermore, the  aircraft is scheduled to be sent back to Hamburg in February,  where the recently developed upper loading deck systems are to  be installed.    This first A300-600F is then supposed to return to Toulouse  in March 1994 to be prepared for certifications of the type DGAC  [General Directorate of Civil Aviation], LBA [Germany's  equivalent of the FAA], and FAA [Federal Aviation Agency] (the  respective certification authorities of France, Germany, and the  United States), which it is expected to jointly receive in  mid-April, just before it is delivered.    The second aircraft of the series is at present in the  middle  of the assembly line in Toulouse, while the third and fourth are  in different stages of production. Airbus Industrie plans to  produce five or six aircraft a year.    According to the manufacturer, some customers have evinced  interest in the aircraft, but no more orders have been reported.  "Freight is a very specialized market that represents only a  very small part of our line of products. Today, most air freight  is transported in the baggage holds of commercial airliners."</p>

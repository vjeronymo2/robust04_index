			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Service sector pay awards fall sharply THE level of pay settlements in the service sector fell sharply in the first half of this year to an average of 4.4 per cent, the lowest since 1983, according to the Confederation of British Industry. Since Britain's entry into the European exchange rate mechanism the competitiveness of the traded-goods sector has depended, in part, on pay not rising faster than in competitor countries. The service sector is not so directly affected, but employers' organisations have stressed the importance of not allowing service-sector pay to be an upward pressure on manufacturing. The latest CBI figures suggest that service-sector settlements, which were running at 6 per cent in the second half of last year, are now rising at about the same rate as in manufacturing. Average manufacturing-sector deals rose 4.3 per cent in the first quarter, excluding the one in seven manufacturers that did not increase pay at all. According to the government's annualised average earnings figures, pay in the service sector has been rising at a slightly slower rate than in manufacturing since April last year. According to the figures for March this year, manufacturing pay rose at a rate of 8.25 per cent and service-sector pay at 7 per cent. Since August, according to the CBI, 44 per cent of employers have reported low or deteriorating profits as a 'very important' downward pressure on settlements in the service sector. Over the same period, manufacturing pay deals continued to show a growing divergence, with 15 per cent of those surveyed at or below 2.5 per cent; 34 per cent between 2.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent; 29 per cent between 4.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent; and the remaining 22 per cent above 5.5 per cent. Productivity gains among manufacturers making pay awards were rather low in the first quarter of the year at 3.7 per cent, compared with 5 per cent in the final quarter of last year, the CBI notes.</p>

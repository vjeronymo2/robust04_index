			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: ABSTINENCE WON'T MAKE ITALIAN HEARTS FONDER  </P> <P> Azeglio Vicini, coach of the Italian national soccer team, probably didn't  endear himself to his players this week when he asked them not to engage in sex  until the World Cup tournament in Italy ends on July 8.  </P> <P> This weekend will be the last at liberty for the players before a long period  of "seclusion," Vicini said, adding: "Chastity of players prior (to) and during  a major competition has been a long-debated but unsolved problem."  </P> <P> A Cup title for Brazil would enliven the debate.  </P> <P> The Brazilians have been told by their coaches that they will be free to make  love during the tournament, which starts June 8, but must refrain from drinking  Italian coffee.  </P> <P> Trivia time: In five seasons in the NBA, how many three-point shots had Patrick  Ewing made before last Sunday, when he sank a three-pointer in the last two  minutes of the New York Knicks' 121-114 victory over the Boston Celtics?  </P> <P> Wouldn't gold be more appropriate?: An Illinois company will issue a  limited-edition silver commemorative coin honoring quarterback Joe Montana of  the San Francisco 49ers as pro football's player of the 1980s.  </P> <P> "We are very happy to honor Joe Montana as the player of the decade," said John  Obie, president of Chicagoland Processing Corp. of Elk Grove Village, Ill.,  which will sell the coins for $29.95, plus $3 shipping and handling. "Joe was  clearly head and shoulders above his NFL competition during the 1980s."  </P> <P> And now, heads and tails.  </P> <P> Blowing smoke?: UCLA's football recruiting classes were ranked among the  nation's top 10 throughout the latter half of the 1980s, but Coach Terry  Donahue, lamenting last season's 3-7-1 record, told the Tacoma Morning News  Tribune: "We've made some mistakes in recruiting, in evaluating, and everywhere  else -- let's face it, we just didn't get some guys."  </P> <P> Said Chris Allen, defensive coordinator at USC: "During the spring, we had an  official work some of our scrimmages, and he'd also worked spring practices at  UCLA and Washington. And he told me that the talent looked to him like it was  Washington, UCLA and us . . . in that order."  </P> <P> Wild night: It was 25 years ago that John Havlicek of the Boston Celtics made  one of the most famous steals in NBA history, intercepting an inbounds pass to  preserve a 110-109 playoff victory over the Philadelphia 76ers and prompting  play-by-play announcer Johnny Most's hysterical scream: "Havlicek stole the  ball!"  </P> <P> Afterward, as fans at Boston Garden celebrated the Celtics' ninth consecutive  Eastern Division championship, Havlicek's jersey was ripped off him, leaving  rope-like burns across his chest. By the time he reached the locker room, his  pants were gone, too.  </P> <P> A few years ago, Havlicek told the Hartford Courant, a woman introduced herself  to him at a party. Pointing to a piece of cloth she had pinned to her dress,  she asked if he recognized it.  </P> <P> "It's a piece of your jersey the night you stole the ball," she said.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: One, in 26 attempts.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Keri Phebus, a sophomore at Corona del Mar High, Laker fan and  winner of the 18s title last weekend in the Seventeen Magazine Tennis  Tournament of Champions at Mission Viejo: "Steffi Graf says her goal is to play  perfectly. My goal is to play tennis like Magic plays basketball."  </P></p>

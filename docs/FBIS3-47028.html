The site of the meeting is expected to be Phuket, where the  Malaysian minister has informally expressed a willingness to go,  according to an official who asked not to be named.    Prior to the meeting, Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin is  likely to raise the financial aspect of the Apec forum at a  meeting with US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, during the  latter's visit to Thailand from Jan 17-19.    Thailand will ask the Apec finance ministers to maintain the  original objective of Apec, which is to act as a trade and  investment consultative forum. Tharin is likely to suggest to  his Apec counterparts that they discuss the latest global  financial policy and also sort out the obstacles hindering world  trade, and how to resolve these problems.    The US and some developed Apec countries earlier informally  suggested the Apec finance ministers meet and discuss how to  integrate the "harmonization system" and the customs code among  the Asia-Pacific nations. The proposal was opposed by some Apec  members on the grounds that the pace of cooperation might be too  fast.    Tharin, meanwhile, said that he would put a double taxation  treaty and financial liberalization high on his agenda during  the upcoming meeting with his US counterpart.    Bangkok and Washington have failed to come to terms on the  double taxation agreement for 20 years, and Tharin stated that  he would accelerate the negotiations for the benefit of the two  countries.    During Bentsen's visit, sources said that both sides are  likely to discuss the two remaining points: the licensing fee  and tax exemption for the international transportation business.    Bentsen is also expected to urge Bangkok to do more to bring  down the barriers in the financial sector for the benefit of US  business, but Tharin said: "Thailand would have to see the  attitude of the US before elaborating on what to do next."    Apart from Thailand, Bentsen will go to China and Indonesia  to boost US interests in Asia.    On the offensive front, Thailand is expected to inform the  US  treasury secretary that it plans to amend or revoke the  bilateral Treaty of Amity and Economic Cooperation signed in  1966. The treaty grants privileges to US citizens doing  business in Thailand in the same way as Thais, and vice versa.  The contentious issue in the treaty is the shareholding  structure, which allows US investors to hold more than 25 per  cent of local firms, a source said.    Thailand is the only Asean country which has signed such a  treaty with the US, and Thai officials earlier expressed an  intention to amend the treaty on the grounds that it is outdated  and not of benefit to Thailand.    One official said that Thailand is likely to stand firm on  the US request for financial liberalization, and will present  its liberalization package to show the US the country's progress  towards financial reform. Bangkok has often said that it will  not do more, as the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks  did not include agreements on trade in services.</p>

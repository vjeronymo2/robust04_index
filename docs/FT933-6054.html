			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK pharmaceuticals There have been false dawns before during the great derating of the pharmaceuticals sector. But recent gains against a rising stock market suggest that drug stocks are at least attracting bargain hunters. Since the outlook for the industry has barely changed, there is no obvious reason for a renewed burst of optimism. Although President Clinton's healthcare reforms look unlikely to include direct price controls, the concentration of power among big buyers of healthcare is having the same effect. The worst of the pain arising from reform in Germany and Italy may be over, but France and Spain have yet to show their hands. The question, then, is whether drug shares offer fair compensation for the continued risk of government intervention. Earnings growth will certainly be below the heady levels of the 1980s, and little better than that achieved by other industries during recovery. Price earnings multiples below the market average now reflect that. More importantly given the dwindling returns on cash, Glaxo and Zeneca yield more than the market average. With a good record of cash generation, and a large cash pile in the case of Glaxo, dividend growth looks assured. If investors are starting to look at drugs companies in terms of total returns rather than just earnings growth, the recent rally in the shares may have further to run. The fog of uncertainty should clear when the details of President Clinton's reforms are unveiled in the autumn. But while the industry reshapes to accommodate whatever new world order appears, it would not do to expect too much.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals says South Africa  must reduce its budget deficit as a matter of urgency if it  wants to avoid a crippling government debt level.

Excessive government  debt would also exert upward pressure on long-term interest  rates. Dr. Stals disclosed, however, that the outflow of  short-term capital in the run-up to the elections has reversed  itself.

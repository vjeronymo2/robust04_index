			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1735.30&blank;Hardship Loans <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment summary: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters suggested that the priority system established for approving REA hardship loans was unnecessary, too complex, and non-statutory. While recognizing that one of the objectives of the priority system is to ensure financing to the neediest borrowers, the commenters stated that, overall, the system would be burdensome on REA and its borrowers and would treat some borrowers unfairly. One commenter stated that the current ``first come first served'' policy for loan approval would be adequate for approving loans in addition to assessing the urgency of each financing request. Further, one commenter, stating that loan approval should be based only on the eligibility criteria in the RELRA and not on specific plant modifications (such as distance learning or medical link facilities), commented that the method and criteria used in assigning points were unfair to some borrowers. The commenters also stated borrowers may be denied financing (within a reasonable time frame or perhaps altogether) due to the nature of the point assignment and ranking system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The hardship loan program created by the RELRA is intended to ensure that lower cost capital financing will be available to those applicants most in need due to extreme operating conditions. Since REA believes that the amount of financing available to fund the hardship program will generally be more limited than the eligible loan applications, it is necessary to implement a system that allows the widest practical nationwide use of those limited funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ranking criteria REA has established does not conflict with a borrowers' eligibility to receive hardship financing. All borrowers that meet the hardship eligibility requirements (TIER, density, and modernization plan) will receive financing, subject to the availability of funds. The ranking criteria does, however, provide REA with a methodology of fairly assessing all eligible applications and provides an equitable manner in which to disburse the limited amount of funds available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the ranking and subsequent prioritizing of a loan application does not require any additional information on the part of the borrower. All of the information needed is readily available in the loan application and the loan study prepared by REA. Any additional burden placed on REA is minimal and will not result in a delay in the processing of an application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment summary: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Concerning paragraph (b), one commenter stated that the size of an exchange within a borrower's service territory is not relevant to the density provision which precludes borrowers from receiving hardship financing for facilities in an exchange where the average number of subscribers per mile of line is greater than 17.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The RELRA clearly intended to avoid the use of lower-cost hardship financing in densely populated ``semi-urban'' areas. RELRA precluded borrowers from receiving hardship financing to be used in any ``area'' where the average number of subscribers per mile of line is greater than 17. REA has defined ``area'' to mean an exchange of the borrower. In addition, to further clarify the measure of a semi-urban area, 1,000 existing subscribers is also used so that high density exchanges with large populations can be distinguished from those remote pockets of populations that have a high exchange density, but are clearly rural areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment summary: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  With regard to the optimal use of loan funds (&sect;1735.30(e)), several commenters stated that there is no need for REA to limit the amount of a hardship loan to any borrower. One respondent commented that by ``splitting'' loan applications and identifying the most urgent financing needs while seeking agreement from all parties involved in a financing request, REA could effectively ensure hardship financing in the neediest situations, without limiting loan size. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  REA has limited the size of hardship loans for the borrowers' (and its subscribers) benefit. Since eligible borrowers will be competing for a limited amount of available financing, limiting the loan size helps to ensure that (1) hardship funds will be provided for the most urgent loan purposes and (2) the widest number of borrowers, and consequently rural subscribers, will benefit from the hardship program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1735.31&blank;REA Cost-of-Money and RTB Loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment Summary: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  With regard to &sect;1735.31(e), one organization commented that the TIER ratio contained in the REA cost-of-money and RTB eligibility criteria seems to be at variance with the statutory definition, and suggested that the final rule conform to the precise language of the legislation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  REA believes the language in the interim rule is consistent with the language of the legislation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment Summary: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One organization commented that REA is without authority to establish the requirement that interest rates on cost-of-money loans be fixed at the time of advance rather than at the time of loan approval. The commenter suggested that in the absence of statutory direction to the contrary, interest rates on cost-of-money loans should be fixed at the time of loan approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The requirements of the interim rule reflect REA's interpretation of the legislation, that is, interest rates based on the cost of capital to the Government at the time of each advance of funds. REA adopted this approach to ensure against rate disparity between the time of loan approval and advance of funds. REA must borrow matching funds from the U.S. Treasury when the borrower requests an advance. The interest rate charged to the borrower is effectively the same interest rate to be paid to Treasury on this borrowing by REA. REA believes that such approach is true to Congress' intent that loans be made at the then current cost of money to the Government. This is evident in the amount of subsidy appropriated by Congress for cost-of-money loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment Summary: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One organization commented that the procedure outlined in paragraph (c)(2) for determination of the cost-of-money interest rate is unnecessarily cumbersome and should be simplified in the final rule. The commenter also suggested that paragraph (d) be revised to make it clear that the borrower's request is a specific one to conform to the language of the RE Act and &sect;1735.32(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  With regard to paragraph (c)(2), the procedure as written is necessary to ensure a clear and definitive method for all parties when setting the interest rate on cost-of-money loans. Concerning paragraph (d), REA believes the language in the interim rule is consistent with the language of the legislation, and that it is evident that REA will only make loan guarantees to those borrowers specifically requesting a guarantee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1735.32&blank;Guaranteed Loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment Summary: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  With regard to paragraph (b), one organization commented that the requirement to participate in a modernization plan should be the same for all loan programs, and the rule as currently written appears discriminatory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The legislation clearly states that the modernization plan shall apply only to REA hardship, REA cost-of-money, and RTB loans. The interim rule as written adheres to the legislation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 1735.74&blank;Submission of data, and 1737.22 Supplementary information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment Summary: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One organization commented that the language relating to the certification of participation in a modernization plan should be revised to eliminate the restrictive reference to the borrower's president by substituting chief executive officer or preferably authorized corporate officer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Participating in a modernization plan and fulfilling its goals may require a significant effort from the borrower, and may effect whether a borrower receives a loan. Due to the critical nature of these factors, REA believes it is in the interests of both the borrower and REA to have the certification signed by the borrower's president.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Simultaneous Loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment Summary: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One organization commented on REA's reference to simultaneous loans, stating that it is not a defined term in the interim rule nor is it a term utilized in either the legislation or the existing RE Act. The commenter suggested this provision be deleted in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

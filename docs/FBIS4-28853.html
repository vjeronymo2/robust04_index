			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- Trade, Industry and  Energy Minister Kim Chol-su on Monday expressed concern about a  move of the United States to revise its anti-dumping-related  laws and regulations in a way advantageous to itself contrary to  the norms of the Uruguay Round agreement.    "The Super Article 301 which the United States has revived  through an administrative order does not go compatible with the  principle of the new World Trade Organization (WTO)," Kim said.    Speaking at the seventh Korea-U.S. business conference held  at the Hotel Intercontinental, Minister Kim said the United  States should not arbitrarily invoke the Super Article 301.    He stressed that any inter-country trade disputes should be  resolved under procedures duly laid down by the World Trade  Organization.    Kim also said he expects the United States' investment in  South Korea would be further spurred in the days ahead.    "American investors should know we have such merits as an  extensive market, able work force, ability to digest high-tech  projects and political stability," he said.    Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador James Laney said at the  conference  that South Korea should ease imports control of consumption  goods such as automobiles and cable television programs.    He said a serious imbalance is shown between the two  countries in the exports and imports of automobile, which he  said is due to South Korea's "unreasonable tariffs policy and  complex imports permit regulations."    Laney also expressed the hope that South Korea will further  ease regulations in the broad areas of cable TV programs or  software designs. This will be helpful to strengthening South  Korea's own international competitiveness, he said.    The American ambassador said that South Korea's consumption  goods market, which he said was closed in the past, is getting  opened step by step.    Still, he said, South Korean bureaucrats have the means of  making imports difficult and imports are still regarded by many  people as something immoral.    Consumption goods imports will give an opportunity for  Korean  consumers to conserve goods and will lead Korean industries to  increase productivity, Laney said.    Prevention of consumption goods imports was taken as the  manifestation of patriotism in the past, but this is a time for  the South Korean Government to switch to a new stance,  Ambassador Laney said.</p>

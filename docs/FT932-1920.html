			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / NHS trusts 'slow to change' MOST National Health Service trusts have not introduced local pay setting, single-union deals, or changes in the skill mix of health workers, according to a comprehensive survey by Industrial Relations Services. The research organisation, which received detailed responses from 33 out of the 160 first- and second-wave trusts, found that some staff working for 80 per cent of the respondents were on local terms, but they were mainly managers or specific occupational groups like healthcare assistants. Some analysts argue that a crucial element in the government's health reforms is the more effective use of labour, with local managers breaking away from the Whitley system of national pay bargaining. 'Lack of management time and resources' is the reason most frequently given in the survey for caution in making change, with the 1.5 per cent government limit on public sector pay also mentioned as a disincentive. Slightly more trusts have cut staff than increased it (12 and 10 respectively) since gaining self-governing status and over 40 per cent of respondents expect staff numbers to fall in the next 18 months. The biggest changes have been in the area of disciplinary procedures with over three-quarters of trusts in the survey signing new agreements. Only two trusts have derecognised any unions and single-union deals were rare, though most respondents had 'single-table' bargaining. Performance-related pay was mainly restricted to management level. The European Community-inspired Tupe regulations, which govern the pay and conditions of some staff transferred to trusts, have affected about one-third of the trusts in the survey.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bonn Controversy Over Nuclear </F> Imports"]    [Text] The Chancellor's Office wants to permit the Federal  Intelligence Service (BND) to buy radioactive material on the  international black market and bring it to Germany for  examination.    After the draft of a working group in the Chancellor's  Office  became known within the government, resistance has started to  come from the Justice Ministry.    The objective of the planned increase in power is to be able  to trace the illegal trade in nuclear material back to the place  of production and to stop its infiltration into the black market  network. Since the examination cannot be carried out on the  spot for reasons involving tactics and measuring techniques, the  material has to be imported, it is stated.    However, the Justice Ministry does not think that the  situation on the nuclear black market "endangers security" so  much that the intelligence services have to be employed. In  Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger's ministry it is pointed out  that, according to the current law, the BND's intervention will  violate the international agreement on physical protection from  nuclear material.</p>

The Cuban Foreign Ministry reportedly is awaiting an  Argentine confirmation of the official visit, the first by a  high-ranking Cuban official since Carlos Menem took office in  1989.    "The response is expected to arrive either tomorrow or in  the  next few days," said Cuban sources. The same sources added that  Robaina is travelling to Buenos Aires after a three-day visit to  Montevideo, Uruguay, from 4-6 April within the framework of a  tour through several Latin American countries.    However, Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister told LA PRENSA:  "So far we have had no news on the subject. If we do, we would  consider it because there is nothing strange in this visit." He  said that, for example, "former Cuban Foreign Minister Malmierca  has visited Argentina," among other "Cuban strong men" who have  recently visited Argentina.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The preamble to the proposed regulations (59 FR 9171; February 25, 1994) contains a more complete explanation of the relationship between length and harvesting capacity for combining permits. Also described in the proposed rule is an explanation of the technical bases for the schedule chosen by NMFS (called the NMFS preferred approach in the proposed rule), as well as a description of two other alternatives, one initially proposed by NMFS (Initial Alternative I), the other by the Council (Initial Alternative II). The proposed rule requested public comments not only on the NMFS preferred approach, but on Initial Alternatives I and II as well. This rule implements the NMFS preferred approach, as described in the proposed rule. The final rule addresses what is primarily a technical issue with little or no conservation implications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The relationship between vessel length and harvest capacity chosen in the final rule is conservative and treats vessels of all lengths equitably. It was chosen based on the recognition that smaller vessels appear to produce at a level closer to their harvesting capacity, while larger vessels, especially 200 ft (61.0 m) and larger, may currently produce considerably below their actual capacity. As a result, the chosen relationship reflects the expectation that the harvesting capacity for larger vessels is potentially greater than the actual amounts that vessels of that size have produced historically.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Initial Alternative I carried the curvilinear relationship only to 90 ft (27.4 m) and the straight line relationship to 200 ft (61.0 m) (ten 60-foot (18.3 m) permits), with no increase in capacity rating points for vessels larger than 200 ft (61.0 m). The Council's recommended formula, Initial Alternative II, was curvilinear to 200 ft (61.0 m) with the straight line relationship beginning with twenty 60-foot (18.3 m) permits at 200 ft (61.0 m) and ending with thirty-two 60-foot (18.3 m) permits for 400-foot (121.9 m) vessels. All three concepts are shown graphically in Figure 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d620 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSER14AP94.000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING 3510&hyph;22&hyph;C <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments and Responses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments were submitted by 6 fishing vessel owners' associations (Coast Draggers Association, Fishermen's Marketing Association, United Catcher Boats, American Factory Trawlers Association, and 2 from Mid-Water Trawlers Cooperative), 6 seafood processing companies, the Astoria Chamber of Commerce, 48 individuals or corporations associated with individual catcher vessels primarily involved in the Pacific whiting fishery, 3 corporations owning catcher-processors (factory trawlers), and a corporation owning a mothership processor. Thirty of the comments received were from Newport, Oregon. The total number of comments received was 65, with 54 advocating adoption of the proposal recommended by the Council (Initial Alternative II), 5 advocating the NMFS initial proposal (Initial Alternative I), 3 supporting the NMFS preferred approach, and 3 offering comments but no preference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Twenty-two commenters argued that the NMFS preferred approach would increase harvest capacity in the Pacific whiting fishery because large, efficient factory trawlers with a significant harvesting capacity would purchase permits issued to historically unproductive vessels, many with little or no historical catch of whiting, thus increasing the overall harvest capacity in the groundfish fishery, and particularly the whiting fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of the commenters favoring the Council's recommendation argued that the purchase of a permit with marginal historical production by the owner of a potential highline vessel would increase capacity in the fishery. Most of these commenters made no distinction between harvest capacity, fishing effort, and actual production (catch). Fishing effort is the actual intensity with which a vessel/permit is used. It represents an amount of fishing activity per time period, not an amount of catch. In the context of this rule, capacity refers to the potential amount of fish that can be caught and retained by a vessel of a given length. Since permits are transferable, it is important to note that the potential catch associated with capacity is not necessarily the historical catch of that vessel, but rather the potential of the permit when affixed to a successful vessel of the same size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council in Amendment 6 specifically instructed NMFS to develop a schedule for combining permits that assured that harvest capacity, not fishing effort or catch, did not increase. The schedule chosen by NMFS is an attempt to keep the capacity represented by the sum of fishery permits from increasing. When permits are combined, the capacity of the resulting permit should not exceed the capacity of the group of permits that have been combined. The capacity of a permit is not defined by the level of fishing effort or production that its owner may have experienced over the preceding years, but by its potential for use by a highline vessel of the endorsed size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

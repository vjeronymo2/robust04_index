			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "South China Sea Fisheries To Face More </F> Supervision"]    [Text] China will increase survey work and strengthen  supervision of fisheries in the South China Sea, an agricultural  official said yesterday.    "It is very important to safeguard the rights of Chinese  fishermen in the area and protect the region's rich marine  resources," said Zhuo Youzhan of the Ministry of Agriculture,  which oversees the fishing industry.    The heightened attention on the South China Sea comes after  a  recent fishery inspection of the Nansha Islands [Spratlys], the  first conducted in the area since 1949.    The 37 crew members, sent by the Ministry of Agriculture,  returned to Guangzhou Port in Guangdong Province on May 10 after  a 21-day exploration of 3,398 nautical miles.    During the trip, they enforced maritime regulations and  compiled a survey of fishery resources and weather patterns,  said Zhuo, who is director of the Fishery Bureau.    The data will provide information for the protection and  future development of local marine resources as well as for the  supervision of fishermen in the area, he said.    The Nansha Islands, a traditional fishing ground for Chinese  fishermen, are rich in eel, red porgy, reeves shad, prawn and  other aquatic life.    Every year more than 300 fishing boats enter the area from  Guangdong and Hainan provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Nationality  Autonomous Region. But the lack of proper supervision has led  to repeated disputes over fishing territory, Zhuo said, adding  that this is a top concern.    It is important to develop the rich fisheries with foreign  co- operation, he said, adding that China should increase  seafood production to meet increasing home market demand and  relieve fishing pressure in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea and East  China Sea, which have suffered from overfishing in recent years.    The population of favorite ocean delicacies such as croakers  and hairtails there has sharply declined in recent years.    China has ranked first in the world in seafood output since  1990, Zhuo said, and the per-capita consumption of seafood rose  to 14.7 kilograms last year from 4.4 kilograms in 1979.</p>

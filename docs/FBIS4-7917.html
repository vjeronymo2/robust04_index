			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 7 (BTA) -- Following consultations  with the parliamentary groups, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov next  week will announce his plans about cabinet changes, reads a  government press release this afternoon. Prof. Berov this  morning chaired a regular government sitting resuming his duties  after a 26-day sick leave and a major heart operation. While he  declined to make any comments before journalists, photographers  were allowed to take pictures.    The prospective cabinet changes will be aimed at fulfilling  priority cabinet tasks to carry out privatization, combat  corruption, conclude agreements with the international financial  institutions, expand this country's international ties, protect  Bulgarian business and revise its social policy in favour of a  wide strata of the population. The ministries, too, are  expected to specify and publicize the steps they will take by  year-end to carry out these tasks, the release also said.    The better part of the release responds to criticism against  the Cabinet by President Zhelyu Zhelev. On Saturday, April 2,  Dr. Zhelev sharply criticized the Cabinet for bringing reforms  to a standstill, declaring the withdrawal of his support for  them. "The incumbent cabinet suits the Bulgarian Socialist  Party (BSP, the former Communists), as it gives them a chance to  do what they've always wanted to do, govern without shouldering  the political responsibility for it," the president then said.  Meeting with the leader of one of Bulgaria's major labour  organizations, the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in  Bulgaria, President Zhelev reiterated he no longer supported the  cabinet and predicted early elections would be held this autumn.    Though asked by the press to respond to last Saturday's (92  April] criticism, Berov would not do it, "to avert a further  straining of relations between the cabinet and president, which  some would see as a war between the two institutions". The  government Press Office release describes the arguments in the  presidential attack as emotional, farfetched and one-sided. The  release describes as baseless the presidential charge that being  responsible for the dollar and price rise in the last month, the  government has endangered civil peace and social stability.  "This was an insufficiently considered move", says the release.  It accuses President Zhelev of sometimes trying to turn into a  supporter of some political force or other. "It is inadmissible  for the president to declare confidence or no confidence in any  government. This is a function of the parliament. Presidential  attempts to change the parliamentary lineup are unconstitutional  and recall some old-fashioned non-republican ways in Bulgarian  history", says the release. The prime minister is far from  thinking that his government is ideal and has fulfilled all its  promises, the release also says. Yet only a nonpartisan  government of national responsibility can rule this country in  the present complicated and extremely controversial lineup, with  no parliamentary force commanding a clear majority.    The release refutes the president's criticism for the forex  [foreign exchange] crisis, arguing that the cabinet cannot be  held responsible for forex policy, as this is a responsibility  of the central Bulgarian National Bank subordinate to  parliament. It says the president gave twice smaller figures on  the land reform. "It should be clear that legislature also has  a commitment to the land reform to fulfill, and that legislation  assigns a significant role to judiciary at this stage", says the  release. In connection with criticism of the low progress of  privatization, the release recalls that the government-sponsored  amendments to the Privatization Act have been stalled in  parliament for over seven months. According to the release, it  is an exaggeration to speak of a disastrous price rise on the  home market. "We are witnessing the emergence of a market  economy and rising private enterprise that the government should  support, by passing the necessary laws, in the interest of the  nation and not against it. Any other type of thinking is  retrograde and seeks to play on the real hardships of ordinary  Bulgarians", says the release. In conclusion, the release  expresses a hope that "the president's overstatement on Saturday  is not so much a conviction as a suggestion by advisers on and  off his payroll".</p>

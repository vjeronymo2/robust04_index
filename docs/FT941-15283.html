			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Analysts expect - The Week Ahead On Thursday analysts will be expecting a good rise in interim profits from Carpetright, from about Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 5.5m, although as it was not a public company a year ago, forecasting numbers is difficult. But last October the company said sales had been above expectations since the May 1 year end. Gestetner Holdings, the office and photographic equipment distributor, is expected to announce full-year pre-tax losses of up to Pounds 38m on Thursday after taking a Pounds 48.3m provision at the interim stage, mainly to cover the restructuring of its European operations. The results will be the last before Inchcape, which bought a 15.3 per cent stake in Gestetner in May, must decide whether to exercise its option to acquire convertible unsecured loan stock enabling it to lift its stake to 24.6 per cent. The exercise price on the option, which expires on July 1, is equal to 172p a share - well above the current 140p level. On Tuesday Photo-Me International, the world's largest photo-booth manufacturer and operator, is likely to report first-half pre-tax profits little changed from last years' level of Pounds 10.5m. Slack summer demand for Christmas goods is expected to hold back the performance of Park Food Group, which specialises in supplying Yuletide hampers through a network of commission-paid agents. Analysts are predicting interim losses on Friday of at least Pounds 4m in the six months to September 30 compared with a Pounds 3.69m pre-tax loss at the half-way stage in 1992.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Buoyant Refuge ups dividend to 9.6p Refuge Group, the life assurance company, increased its interim dividend from 9p to 9.6p. Total revenue premiums for long-term business for the six months to June 30 increased by almost 14 per cent to Pounds 108m (Pounds 94m) and sales of regular premium business rose to Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 16m). The strongest growth was seen in single premiums, which rose 35 per cent to Pounds 26.5m (Pounds 19.6m). However, general domestic insurance remained static at Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 6.5m) and poor results from the Douglas Allen Spiro estate agency business were unlikely to show any improvement.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT 96, FEUDING MATRIARCH OPENS NEW BUSINESS  </P> <P> Tiny grandmother Rose Blumkin belongs alongside giants in the pantheon of  entrepreneurial chutzpah.  </P> <P> At age 96, Blumkin is starting over again in business. A legend among  Midwestern shoppers, founder of what became the nation's largest single  furniture store, the personification of the 20th Century immigrant experience  and fulfillment of the American dream, she is not going back to work to acquire  more wealth.  </P> <P> "I don't need no more money," says the matriarch of a phenomenally successful  family in her thick Russian-accented English.  </P> <P> She's doing it for revenge.  </P> <P> Blumkin wants to get even with two of her grandsons, who she says forced her  out as chairman of the Nebraska Furniture Mart, a $150-million-a-year furniture  and carpeting empire she founded a half-century ago.  </P> <P> It's a vendetta worthy of "Dallas" or "Dynasty," this Battle of the Blumkins  that has been the talk of Omaha for months now.  </P> <P> "I wish to live two more years and I'll show them who I am," said the feisty  4-foot, 11-inch woman everybody calls Mrs. B. "I'll give them hell."  </P> <P> "Them" are grandsons Ron and Irv Blumkin. "They told me I'm too old, too  cranky," said Mrs. B. "I gave my life away for my family. I made them  millionaires. I was chairman of the board and they took away from me my rights.  I shouldn't be allowed to buy anything. No salesmen should talk to me. So I got  mad and I walked out.  </P> <P> "Maybe I lived too long. Maybe they're tired of me," she said of Ron and Irv.  </P> <P> "Whatever she says is fine," an unsmiling Ronald Blumkin said. He is 41 and  president of the Nebraska Furniture Mart. "It makes a better story when you  only hear one side." Irvin, 38, is vice president. He refused to meet with a  reporter.  </P> <P> Other family members, unwilling to be identified, support the version of the  feud recited by Mrs. B, whose business philosophy is "sell cheap and never  lie."  </P> <P> Mrs. B did not just walk out. She walked directly across Jones Street on the  west side of Omaha where, three months ago, in a 360,000-square-foot building  -- the size of a Midwestern cornfield -- she opened Mrs. B's Warehouse to  compete with "my high-class grandsons . . . who only know fancy things and to  always take vacations." (There is no room for vacations in Mrs. B's work  ethic.)  </P> <P> It is not exactly an even match. "They are the elephant. I am the ant," she  recently told her granddaughter, Claudia Boehm, who is helping in the new  venture. The grandsons' Nebraska Furniture Mart is well stocked with brand-name  merchandise and a selection that meets the needs of everyone from college  students in their first apartment to established business executives.  </P> <P> Still, last month, with a relatively small inventory, with major manufacturers  refusing to sell her merchandise and before she ran a single ad or officially  opened, Mrs. B grossed $256,000.  </P> <P> "I'm a fast operator," said Mrs. B. "Thank God, I still got my brains, my  know-how, my talent . . . but it's not so easy."  </P> <P> Her grandsons have retaliated, she says, telling furniture and carpet  manufacturers that if they sell to her the Blumkin boys will not carry their  merchandise.  </P> <P> "All the national companies won't sell (to) me. It's a boycott," said Mrs. B.  "And they are telling carpet layers that they shouldn't have nothing to do with  me."  </P> <P> "Suppliers have to make their own marketing decisions," said Ron Blumkin. "It's  their decision to make."  </P> <P> "Any time you're in the middle of internecine warfare it's difficult," said a  salesman willing to deal with Mrs. B. "They made it plain they didn't want us  to come over here. But she's terrific. She knows carpets better than anybody in  the country. It's her specialty."  </P> <P> Flattery did not help.  </P> <P> "There's a time to be drunk and a time to be sober. Today I'm sober," Mrs. B  said, sending the salesman on his way.  </P> <P> "Anyone that works lives long," said Mrs. B, who turned 96 last Friday and  works 50 to 60 hours a week.  </P> <P> As she did for years at her other store, she races around her new sprawling  warehouse in a three-wheeled electric golf cart looking more like a Jewish  R2-D2 than the bubbee of 12 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren. She darts  along the rows of reclining chairs and the stacks of carpeting alternately  yelling at employees ("Dummy. Stupe. What do you know?") and charming customers  ("Honey, what are you looking for? Whatever you want, I'll give you a real  bargain . . . the best deal.")  </P> <P> "She is the 20th Century on three wheels," said Jerry Pearson, who sells  furniture and carpeting at Mrs. B's and who believes the woman's life story  reflects not only the immigrant experience but the energy that fueled America's  entrepreneurial machine during much of the 20th Century.  </P> <P> "For her, the ethos is the sale," said Pearson, whose job as a salesman belies  his studies in business and economics. "Everything is the sale. It's her  thrill. The sale has to be made. It's her kick."  </P> <P> "Thank God I can multiply," said Mrs. B. "I can multiply quicker than any  computer. . . . When a customer comes in, I tell them what to buy. I teach them  economics."  </P> <P> "I like the way she does business," said retired truck driver Edwin A. Oeltjen  of Ames, Neb. "She'll tell you right up front what she'll do on price. There is  no foolishness, no double talk."  </P> <P> "I've dealt with her for 30 years," said Judd Gillespie, an Omaha businessman.  "She was always the final authority on every carpet sale at the Nebraska  Furniture Mart. The salesman made the sale, but she closed it."  </P> <P> Business has been Rose Gorelick Blumkin's life since she was a teen-ager in a  village near Minsk in Russia. Her father, a rabbi, "was too religious to make a  living." Her mother supported the family selling groceries. At 13, Rose went to  work in a dry-goods store to help the family. At 16, she was the manager with  six employees working for her. She fled Russia in 1917.  </P> <P> "I told the Russian guard (on the Siberian-Chinese border) that I was going to  buy leather for the army and that I would bring for him a big bottle of vodka.  He's still waiting," said Mrs. B.  </P> <P> With little money, she made her way through China and Japan, eventually getting  passage to Seattle on a peanut boat. Rose joined her late husband, Isadore, who  had settled in Ft. Dodge, Iowa. They soon moved to Omaha because it was the  closest place where Rose could speak Russian and Yiddish, her only languages  until she learned English from her oldest daughter, Frances, who was learning  it in kindergarten.  </P> <P> The Blumkins bought and resold used clothing. Rose went into the furniture  business in the basement of her husband's store in 1937. In a short time,  furniture became the main business and Mrs. B the family's main business  person, building the Nebraska Furniture Mart into the country's biggest single  furniture outlet.  </P> <P> "I had a talent. I had ambition," said Mrs. B. Last year the Furniture Mart had  sales of $152 million.  </P> <P> In 1983, Mrs. B sold the Furniture Mart for $60 million to millionaire investor  Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway,  which holds major interests in companies ranging from See's Candy Shops to  Capital Cities/ABC. The Blumkins retained 20% ownership in the business.  </P> <P> Mrs. B does not approve of what big business did to her big business.  </P> <P> "Now there are too many executives, too many meetings, too many vacations, and  all that is costing them money," Mrs. B said. "I told Buffett when I ran it  expenses were $7 million. Now they are $27 million. Now every stupe is a  president, a vice president."  </P> <P> "The tragedy is that when they kicked her out it was like a death sentence,"  said Pearson. "She's a workaholic."  </P></p>

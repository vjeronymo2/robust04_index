			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Roundup of interviews with Aleksandr Chuyev, chief of the </F> Russian Christian Democratic Party; Vladimir Lysenko, cochairman  of the Russian Federation Republican Party and member of the  "Yabloko" faction; and Gleb Yakunin, cochairman of Democratic  Russia: "Party Leaders on State Duma's Work"]    [Text] Aleksandr Chuyev, chairman of the Russian  Christian Democratic Party Political Council    [ROSSIYA] Did your party contest the elections?    [Chuyev] Of course. We nominated 108 candidates, but the  Central Electoral Commission ruled that we did not collect the  100,000 votes in our support required for registering our bloc,  although we disagree with that. Yevgeniy Fedorov, our candidate  from Leningrad Oblast, was elected in a one-mandate district,  and another two deputies, who were elected as independents, have  raised the question of joining our party. For us, the elections  continue. I personally and another two representatives of the  Russian Christian Democratic Party are running for the  Federation Council in Chelyabinsk Oblast. In addition, we will  participate in municipal elections in Moscow. We hope that two  or three of our candidates will make it.    [ROSSIYA] Which faction at the State Duma will express your  interests?    [Chuyev] Hard to say, but definitely not "Russia's Choice."  In all likelihood, it will be a faction of independent deputies,  because there are people there who sympathize with us. We may  also form our own group there. There are deputies whose views  are close to ours in the Russian Democratic Reform Movement and  in Sergey Shakhray's Party for Russian Unity and Accord.    [ROSSIYA] What do you think about the State Duma's future?    [Chuyev] Unfortunately, it will be even less effective than  the previous one. All decisions will be blocked by large  factions.  <H3>  Vladimir Lysenko, cochairman of the Russian Federation  Republican Party and member of the "Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin"  faction </H3>   [ROSSIYA] From the first day, everyone has been urging  constructive work at the State Duma. How real is that?    [Lysenko] Given the list of demands published in SOVETSKAYA  ROSSIYA by opposition electoral blocs requesting that the  Belovezhskaya Forest agreement be abrogated, the president's  actions in September-October be deemed as criminal, the results  of the vote on the Constitution be reviewed, and so forth, this  is an unlikely prospect. Large blocs are politicized  throughout, and they are intent on achieving their own  objectives. Zhirinovskiy is dreaming about the presidency, and  the communists will try to deal the final blow to Yeltsin and  the current government lineup. They will try to force a vote on  starting an impeachment procedure against the president, because  in this case the latter will not have the right to dissolve the  State Duma. Here a dramatic tug-of-war may break out. Either  Yeltsin will manage to dissolve the Duma on the basis of Article  111, or it will demand impeachment. My fears may not  materialize, however, because the interests of Zhirinovskiy and  the communists do not fully coincide.    [ROSSIYA] Does your organization have a package of  legislative initiatives?    [Lysenko] So far we have not been able to agree one page of  our political statement. It concerns the Constitution. Some  argue that it should be accepted as a political reality, while  others demand that we should go to court so that it will rule  its adoption as unlawful. On other matters we are unanimous.  We oppose the commissions about which I spoke earlier. We  believe that we should deal with the rules of procedure and with  committees.    [ROSSIYA] Will your faction be able to preserve itself?    [Lysenko] Everything will depend on whether the faction will  pay heed to the parties on whose bandwagons these deputies  entered the Duma.  <H3>  Gleb Yakunin, cochairman of the Democratic Russia movement  and member of the "Russia's Choice" faction </H3>   [ROSSIYA] How do you assess the future of the State Duma?    [Yakunin] I think it will be ineffective owing to  substantial political differences. It will hold on for hardly a  year. But at least it must resolve the fundamental question --  to demystify Zhirinovskiy's party and the man himself. To show  the people that they made a mistake in electing him. To  demystify his team made up of state security and Main  Intelligence Administration officers and so forth. I think that  Lukyanov and Kryuchkov must shed light on the subject.</p>

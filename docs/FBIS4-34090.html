			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "First Thing" program] </F>   [Text] Last night, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro arrived  in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, to attend the fourth  Ibero-American summit 14-15 June. Fidel arrived in the company  of Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National  Assembly of the People's Government, and Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina. Fidel was greeted at the foot of the Cubana  plane by Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin and writer  Gabriel Garcia Marquez, winner of the Nobel Prize for  Literature. Colombian Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez and  Communications Minister William Jaramillo were also present.    After reviewing the honor guard and speaking with  approximately 20 reporters, Fidel said he was very pleased to be  in Colombia and replied to a question by saying it would be too  optimistic to hope the U.S. blockade would end during the  summit. Fidel added that he has several things he wants to say  but we have to wait until 14 June, when he will address the  heads of state of the 21 Ibero-American nations.    Last night, along the route of the caravan taking Fidel and  Foreign Minister Sanin to the hotel, numerous people gathered to  shout support and welcome slogans. Some of the slogans  displayed along the route of the caravan read: Welcome Fidel!  With Cuba for all Times!</p>

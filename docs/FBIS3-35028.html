			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "The Israeli Illusion,"  AL-THAWRAH writes: The Washington talks have resumed on the  level of the heads of delegations amid discouraging atmospheres.  Israel is still barricading itself behind its futile ideas and  continues to put spokes in the wheel of the peace process.    The paper stresses that Israel is not only avoiding decisive  answers on the substance of the peace process regarding the  question of complete withdrawal, but also proposes absurd ideas,  which constitute an attempt to escape forward. This is  especially the case after it was pushed into a difficult dilemma  by the Syrian position and the Geneva summit. Israel now does  not have the chance to avoid, for very long, these answers.    AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Despite the ability it was  provided by the Oslo and Cairo agreements with the PLO to  promote separate solutions, Israel will be very mistaken if it  thinks it can subjugate Syria and the other tracks to separate  deals which it can tailor to fit its economic, military,  political, and security interests. Peace, as Syria has always  said, must be just and comprehensive or else there will be no  peace.</p>

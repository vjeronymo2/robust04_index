			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HUSBAND IS GUILTY OF TRYING TO KILL MAN HE SAID WAS WIFE'S LOVER  </P> <P> A jealous husband who pumped three bullets into the man he thought was having  an affair with his wife was found guilty of attempted murder Thursday.  </P> <P> Sentencing for Henry Ngo Wu, 33, was set for Valentine's Day, Feb. 14, by  Torrance Superior Court Judge John Shook. The maximum penalty is life in  prison.  </P> <P> Wu, an El Monte real estate appraiser, stalked and shot Jonathan Baron, a vice  president of CCH Computax Inc., the nation's largest computer tax processing  firm. The attack took place last April 7 in the parking lot of the firm's  national headquarters in Torrance.  </P> <P> Baron, 37, formerly an avid runner, is confined to a wheelchair after being  shot just below the chest, in a thigh and the buttocks. He testified that he  never had an affair with Wai Wu, wife of Henry Wu, who had worked for him.  </P> <P> There was no dispute that Wu shot Baron.  </P> <P> Wu's defense admitted that Wu, who had contracted gonorrhea, thought he had  gotten it from his wife and suspected Baron of having an affair with her.  </P> <P> Arguing that personal revenge for marital infidelity is a cultural tradition  for Wu -- an ethnic Chinese who emigrated from Vietnam -- the defense contended  that Wu sought merely to wound Baron to cause him to lose face, not to kill  him.  </P> <P> At trial, Wu testified he wanted to shoot Baron in the genitals, according to  Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Hall.  </P> <P> The defense presented an expert on Chinese culture to bolster its argument.  But, on cross-examination, Eugene Cooper, a USC professor of anthropology,  testified that a man in Wu's position would want to kill someone believed to be  having an affair with his wife, Hall said.  </P> <P> "If anything, (the cultural argument) helped my case," Hall said. "It was an  uphill battle for the defense."  </P> <P> In an interview after the verdict, Baron said, "I have absolutely no idea how  my name got associated with this . . . because I can tell you honestly and  openly that there was no affair going on. . . .  </P> <P> "What we have here is a jealous husband who got a crazy idea in his head and  plotted for more than 14 months to take my life, totally unknown to me."  </P> <P> Almost a year after the attack, Baron, whose spinal chord was partially severed  in the attack, goes to therapy every day to strengthen weakened leg muscles.  </P> <P> "Nothing is going to bring me back to where I was," he said.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the Wu relationship appears to be holding up.  </P> <P> At the trial, Wu's wife invoked her spousal privilege not to testify against  her husband. In a hearing out of the presence of the jury, she said the couple  remains married.  </P> <P> Wu testified that his wife visited him every weekend in jail, Hall said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri informed reporters  today that information provided by the United States regarding  its case against MP Thanong Siriprichaphong to his ministry has  been forwarded to the Interior Ministry. The relevant laws will  have to be consulted on whether it is possible to extradite the  MP for trial in the United States.    [Begin recording] [Prasong] There was a discussion this  morning regarding the relevant laws. We will look into every  angle.    [Unidentified reporter] What is the government's position?  Will the MP be tried here or extradited to the United States?    [Prasong] If there is a law that allows an extradition, we  will probably have to cooperate with the United States to  preserve our country's reputation. If the law does not allow  this, then we will not be able to extradite him. The legal  specialists will consult the law in case the United States  requests an extradition.    [Reporter] In most previous cases, the United States was  able to bring major drug traffickers to trial in its courts.    [Prasong] Most of them were arrested in the United States or  in third countries.    [Reporter] What if there are other officials involved in  this case?    [Prasong] [Words indistinct]. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Eagle eye turned on Whitehall's secrecy: The quiet Scot aiming to be the scourge of mandarins MANY ministers and civil servants might think they can operate behind Whitehall's veil of secrecy after the rejection of a Freedom of Information Act in July's white paper on open government. If so, they should check the record of Mr William Reid, the ombudsman who will have responsibility for enforcing the new code of practice on open government. In pursuing complaints of maladministration against government departments the quietly spoken Scot has already demonstrated a tenacious determination to expose senior mandarins who hide their mistakes behind official secrecy. Top mandarins at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are still reeling at the strictures he recently levied against them over a complaint about payment of compensation to farmers whose poultry flocks were slaughtered during the 1988 salmonella-in-eggs scare. He revealed that they had tried to keep secret information about compensation to conceal their failure to pay adequate amounts. 'I see no difficulty in applying the same kind of regime in future in relation to information,' Mr Reid says. He acknowledges that much of his work on enforcing the code of practice on open government will come from the list of exclusions. These allow government information to be withheld from the public if, for example, it was given in confidence or counts as advice to ministers. 'Some of the exclusions are very clear,' he says, 'but there are bound to be some areas of doubt. I will look at the complainant's version of the problem, look at the government department's version, and try to resolve the difference.' In his new task of enforcing open government Mr Reid has several strengths developed during the 26 years since the creation of the parliamentary commissioner for administration, or ombudsman. First, he is an officer of parliament, with the powers of a High Court judge to inquire into matters before him, to call for official papers and to interview any relevant witnesses. Unlike the courts, he cannot be stopped from reading papers by the public-interest immunity certificates issued in the Matrix-Churchill case to withhold documents connected with government policy over the sale of arms to Iraq. Second, he can negotiate redress when government departments have broken the rules. In the slaughter of poultry case, Mr Reid not only negotiated adequate compensation for the farmer who had lodged the original complaint. He also insisted that the agriculture ministry compensate another 120 egg producers. With open government he will be able to force departments to publish information they have withheld if he believes that they should do so under the code of practice. Third, he publishes details of his findings in quarterly and annual reports, to encourage good practice in government administration. The same will happen on open government, encouraging all departments to follow the principles he lays down in individual cases. 'I can try to change the culture of Whitehall more readily than if in a confrontational system involving the courts,' he says. In pursuing these tasks, the ombudsman is acting as a servant of parliament and has the backing of a Commons select committee. If he cannot reach agreement with a department over resolving a complaint, he reports to the committee which can summon the officials for an explanation. 'That sanction is very, very rarely applied: the knowledge that it may be applied concentrates the mind of the department concerned,' he says. This greatly strengthens his hand in rooting out maladministration and changing Civil Service practices. 'There have been examples of where my findings of maladministration have not been accepted by a government department. But I almost invariably find that by the time the department's permanent secretary appears before the select committee, surprise surprise, the redress has been given.' It is open to ministers to issue a certificate that stops the ombudsman publishing information on the grounds that publication would not be in the public interest. Yet such a decision would be referred to the select committee, an deterrent for ministers tempted to muzzle him. He says: 'I have never been so muzzled, my predecessor was not so muzzled; his predecessor was not so muzzled. That covers the last 13 years.' Mr Reid is a career civil servant who served in the education department, the Cabinet Office and the Scottish Office, where he was head of the home and health department, rising to deputy-secretary level. He believes that the standard of public administration in the UK is high, but feels 'passionately' about rudeness by public servants or inattention to people who need attention. 'Government organisations are there to help those at the bottom of the social heap, and to help them politely and quickly. If I find that they are not helped, their letters are ignored, their telephone calls unanswered, I will criticise that severely. But I will equally criticise matters where policymakers have acted in the wrong way.' Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, believes that his cabinet colleagues may be surprised and discomfited by the powerful engine of openness released by the white paper. If Mr Reid is true to form, he could be right.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol by </F> Piotr Andrzejewski and Piotr Gabryel; place and date not given:  "Political Economics"]    [Text] [WPROST] You have completed negotiations with the  striking unionists of the hard-coal-mining branch. You have  also ended negotiations with the "lignite" branch. What other  negotiations remain?    [Pol] There is still the sector of liquid fuels, the  shipbuilding industry, heavy chemistry, the fertilizer industry,  perhaps the metallurgy... I hope, however, that the talks will  not be held with strike committees. I suppose that we will  discuss the necessity of restructuring these branches with the  directors of enterprises and the unionists.    [WPROST] The agreement reached with the striking lignite  miners does not change the fact that the establishment of coal  partnerships has not curbed the growing costs of coal  extraction. The earning capacity of the mining sector has been  decreasing since the beginning of the year and so has coal  extraction, the demand for which is rather limited in the  country. As a matter of fact, the 300,000 employees might lose  their jobs.    [Pol] I do not think the future is as black as that. Due to  the scale of employment, production, and exports, mining is  still one of the most vital sectors of our economy. In the  future, it will be able to maintain itself and to make  investments from its own resources.    [WPROST] For the time being, the profitability of the coal  partnerships is "negative."    [Pol] Their financial results are still affected by an  enormous indebtedness, which is now being reduced. The program  of restructuring the mining sector has not ended at the stage of  establishing new organisms. It already resulted in a decrease  in employment by 20,000 people last year, and this process is  being continued--without any pressure or group layoffs, which is  important. Every year 20,000 people begin to receive retirement  pensions. The miners working in the mines that are being  liquidated are offered jobs at other mines, or the system of  social protection is built up for the period in which the  laid-off workers acquire new skills. We are trying to see to it  that economic requirements do not come into too great a conflict  with the social ones.    [WPROST] Demand for coal today is only half as great as it  was in the times of "prosperity," when the yearly extraction  volume neared 200 million tons.    [Pol] As far as domestic demand is concerned, it will not  really increase in the next few years. However, exports and  profitability will be very important.    [WPROST] Our extraction costs are two or three times as high  as those borne by American, Australian, or South African  exporters.    [Pol] The Australians have their coal a few meters under the  ground; they often need nothing more than a good bulldozer to  get free access to it. To get our coal, we have to dig deeply  into the ground, hundreds of meters, which costs a lot of money.  However, in the western German union lands, for instance, in  mines that are geologically comparable to ours, the extraction  process is "overmechanized," and, as a consequence, their  extraction costs are higher than ours. Thus, figures are not  always "fair." As exporters, we also have an edge over others  thanks to the "geographic rent," which lowers the cost of  transportation from Poland. All things considered, I would not  demonize the situation.    [WPROST] However, are we not creating a dangerous "museum"  by setting up coal partnerships in which the low efficiency of  some mines is "neutralized" by other mines of a given group? As  a result of agreements with the European Union and the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in a few years, after reducing  or entirely lifting tariffs, we will become defenseless against  our competitors, whose products will be much cheaper.    [Pol] I do not think our mining sector is a museum. Please  note that extraction is subsidized in many countries but not in  Poland. Subsidies concern only the costs of mine liquidation  and social protection for those who are forced to change jobs.  It is certainly one of the duties of the coal partnerships to  protect some of the unprofitable mines. In mining, one mine is  never profitable forever. As a result of only one cave-in, a  mine may lose its earning capacity for several years. Thus, the  partnerships are made up of both good and poor mines. In the  long run, however, the partnerships will want to lower costs,  and, naturally, they will "push out" the latter, the poorest  ones. They will want to close them down, especially the mines in  which deposits have already been almost entirely exploited.    [WPROST] For the time being, however, extraction costs are  not observed to be decreasing considerably, and the earning  capacity of mines is becoming increasingly lower.    [Pol] My advice is: More patience. Coal partnerships are  now at the stage of concluding agreements with their creditors  and with the budget; they are all working on a system of paying  off the mines' debts. Apart from that, mining is gradually  getting rid of the nonproductive property. So far, it has been  burdened with the duty of maintaining streets, stadia,  hospitals, sanitariums, health centers. This year, all of this  should yield a financial result that is slightly positive or  near zero.    [WPROST] Now that you have signed an agreement with miners,  are you not expecting an escalation of pressure from other  "vital" branches?    [Pol] In many countries much more developed than Poland, the  restructurization of strategic sectors was accompanied by great  tensions, discussions, and conflicts. Success was or was not  achieved through compromise. There are countries where  restructurization of the power industry was suspended because  the initial attempts brought about such tensions that the  authorities decided to wait for a better atmosphere.    [WPROST] Should the 40 percent of industrial enterprises,  whose financial results are negative today, wait for a better  atmosphere, as well? What do you intend to do with the  "socialist dinosaurs" of our economy?    [Pol] Unfortunately, you are now repeating stereotypes.  When you are speaking about "socialist dinosaurs," you mean...    [WPROST] The FSO Automobile Factory, for instance.    [Pol] This "dinosaur" contributes well over 1 trillion  zlotys to the state budget annually.    [WPROST] The demand for these products is protected by  outrageous customs duties, excise, and import tax.    [Pol] The customs duty is not all that outrageous at all.  In India, for example, it is as high as 150 percent of the  value of a given car. I would like to caution against the  vision of "let us plough this all up and create a beautiful,  modern automobile industry meeting world standards." This is  utopia. Unfortunately, we live off what we have. If some day  we really opened our borders--and there were such attempts in  1991 and 1992, when the customs duty did not exceed 4  percent--the Polish economy would collapse immediately. It is  worth recalling that thousands of enterprises whose debt burdens  we are now trying to reduce somehow found themselves in trouble  in that particular period. You can certainly say: Let us not  reduce the debts; let them collapse. The problem is that, along  with them, the whole of Poland would collapse because no one  would be able to maintain such a large army of unemployed people.    [WPROST] Is it not utopia, as well, that all of this can be  rescued?    [Pol] Certainly not all enterprises will make it. I  believe, however, that, in the case of the sectors that are  subjected to the restructurizaiton process, the situation will  be similar to the second year of studies: Generally, everyone  should survive it, but there is always some percentage that  fails the exams. In the case of companies, this is an extremely  slow and difficult process. First, they must come up with "a  survival idea," and then they can count on the state to help  them. Unfortunately, the state has also contributed to the  difficulties they are going through. This is the result of  certain mistakes that were made in the preliminary stages of  free-market reforms.    [WPROST] However, it is probably difficult to support  enterprises without finding ways to communicate with their  employees. In recent weeks, you have been at the forefront of  the battle between the government and the unions. Did you not  get the impression that Poland is becoming increasingly more  deeply divided into two separate worlds, the interests of which  it will be increasingly harder to reconcile?    [Pol] It is certainly difficult to reconcile interests. I  believe, however, that it is still one Poland with one way of  thinking. It is obvious that, if you suddenly begin "tampering"  with the labor-and-wage system of someone who considers his  situation to be stable and his future to be safe, this will make  him protest. Concrete information gets across to some people  more easily than to others. If you add to this such factors as  politics and the activities of competing trade unions, all of  this will make for an explosive combination.    [WPROST] However, I cannot see the government trying to  effectively scatter these fears by presenting a coherent and  clear activity schedule. You were practically alone in  negotiations with the striking lignite miners.    [Pol] I think this looked worse than it really was. Because  the demands of the strikers concerned one of the strategic  branches of the industry, I moved to the foreground of events.  However, later there was cooperation. I cannot really complain  about being alone.    [WPROST] What will the talks on the restructurization of  other branches look like? Will they be held under a threat of  strikes?    [Pol] We are striving to maintain the configuration that was  agreed upon in the last negotiations: the government-trade  unions-employers.    [WPROST] However, Solidarity ["S"] is demanding separate  talks with the government.    [Pol] I believe that "S" will finally understand that we are  not in a position to talk with each union separately. Each of  them is quite strong, and favoring one of them triggers a chain  reaction that consists of demands for separate negotiations.  This is unacceptable to the government.    [WPROST] The use of the "trilateral" model at the nationwide  forum of the commission, which is supposed to be set up by a  separate law, also creates a danger: It may lead to some kind of  "corporationism" if not "unioncracy." As a matter of fact, the  most vital social decisions may be made outside the government  and the parliament.    [Pol] No. I think that it is simply a slow and difficult  procedure for reaching the final shape of the configuration of  influence on state affairs. Neither the government nor the  parliament will agree to be substituted for by the trilateral  commission; they will not agree that the unions should decide  issues that are of utmost importance to the state. It so  happens that it is the government and the parliament that bear  all responsibility. On the other hand, however, no government in  a country that has such large union structures as ours can make  decisions exclusively on its own. It should discuss with the  unions any moves they are by nature interested in--from social  issues to issues related to wages.    [WPROST] Much seems to suggest that the consecutive  governments, both the "S" governments and the present Cabinet,  have not worked out any strategy for resolving the problems of  "the vital" branches. It seems that the strategy has been  replaced by the tactics of deferring conflicts and gradually  neutralizing them in negotiations and strikes.    [Pol] Definitely not. Programs concerning restructurization  have been prepared in detail. They were worked out partially by  my predecessors, who, however, did not manage to accomplish much  because they were frequently recalled too soon. Today we are  preparing a program of restructurization of the liquid fuels  sector. If this program fails, the Polish fuel industry, which  is today in pretty good condition, may be obliterated from the  face of the earth within just a few years--when the contingents  for fuel imports are lifted and the customs duty is lowered.    [WPROST] However, the consciousness of this fact is not  common.    [Pol] Hence the scale of social opposition, whose  enormousness I realized during negotiations with the lignite  miners. Hearsay, false information, and mistrust were so  concentrated there that the union activists, even though they  realized that the threat caused by the restructurization is not  really great, did not have the courage to be frank with the  strikers. Thus, there is a great need to make everyone realize  the necessity of transformations; people must realize that they  bring not threats but possibilities for surviving.</p>

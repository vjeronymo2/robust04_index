			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 13 (CNS) -- Assistant Minister of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Mr. Long Yongtu,  speaking at a press conference held here today, said that China  hoped the UNited States ruled out political factors affecting  economic and trade relations between China and America. The two  sides should rebuild mutual- trust relations to overcome  obstacle to the talks on China's return to GATT.    Mr. Long said that the United States had an important role  in  the process of resuming China's status in GATT. If the issue of  China's MFN status could be solved in June, a better tendency  for Sino- American negotiations on China's return to GATT would  occur.    It is disclosed that China and America had agreed to have  another negotiations on China's return to GATT in early June.    In the Marrakech meeting held in April, American Vice  President Mr. Al Gore had told GATT Chief Mr. Peter Sutherland  that America would take an active and constructive stance to  participate in negotiations on China's return to GATT. There  was no reason to considerthe American stance as an obstacle to  the above matter. Mr. Sutherland conveyed the American stance  to Chinese leaders during his visit to China.    Head of China's delegation for China's return to GATT and  Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Mr. Gu  Yongjiang, also said that today it had been 8 years since China  applied for return to GATT. The GATT contracting parties put  forward some requirements on China regarding reduction of tariff  and non-tariff barriers for imports and exports and transparency  of foreign trade, China had earnestly made preparations for and  replied to these matters.    Mr. Gu said a main obstacle was that some GATT contracting  parties had asked for some excessive demands on China. China  was a developing country and it was undertaking obligations set  for developing countries as well as enjoying rights offered by  the world trade organization. In conformity with China's  present economic development situation, he said, China may also  shoulder some obligations which only developed countries should  undertake.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DENTIST MAKES A BID FOR FAME WITH HOLLYWOOD MEMORABILIA;  </P> <P> AUCTION: GEORGE REEVES' 'SUPERMAN' SUIT AND A PAIR OF MUNCHKIN SHOES FROM  'WIZARD OF OZ' WILL BE AMONG 840 ITEMS OFFERED IN THE BIGGEST HOLLYWOOD AUCTION  IN NEARLY 20 YEARS.  </P> <P> Barry Vilkin, a dentist who specializes in root canals, purchased his first  movie poster 18 months ago. This weekend, his auction company, Camden House  Auctioneers, is conducting the largest movie memorabilia auction since the MGM  sale nearly two decades ago.  </P> <P> On Saturday and Sunday at the Ebell Club in Los Angeles, Vilkin will take bids  for 840 items, ranging from George Reeves' "Superman" costume from the '50s TV  series with an estimated price tag of $50,000, to a rare pair of Munchkin shoes  worn in 1939's "The Wizard of Oz," valued at a more modest $3,500. What's  unusual about the auction is that every item that goes up on the block is  genuine Hollywood.  </P> <P> "I'm a believer in specialization," the 34-year-old Vilkin said, who still  maintains his dental practice three days a week. "In the medical field, I  specialize. I saw the same need in movie memorabilia. It bothered me that  auction houses across the country were throwing movie memorabilia in with other  collectibles, like dolls, toys and plates."  </P> <P> Two years ago, Vilkin was collecting California fine art. When the prices  soared too high for his pocketbook, he began searching for an alternative art  form to collect.  </P> <P> "I loved movies, so I started collecting movie posters," he said. "Almost  immediately, I began meeting people who collected posters and other  memorabilia, and I kind of detected this undercurrent of energy that seemed to  be building. I found out about different trade publications devoted to people  who collect movie memorabilia. You open them up and there's thousands of ads in  there of people buying and selling."  </P> <P> Sensing that he had stumbled upon a hot market, Vilkin took a week off from his  dental practice and went to California Auctioneers School in Los Angeles to  learn about the business and obtain an auctioneer's license. Next, he took out  ads in trade and movie magazines asking people for movie memorabilia to sell in  an upcoming auction.  </P> <P> "Initially, I ran the ads to see if anyone would call," Vilkin said. "I didn't  even know if the phone was going to ring. But in the first week it rang about  50 times. The next week, it rang probably 200 times. Then the word of mouth  started, and pretty soon I couldn't keep up with the people who were contacting  me."  </P> <P> This is Vilkin's second auction. His first was in May with 550 lots. 'Barry is  becoming extremely popular," said Michael Shaw, a former MGM childhood actor  whose memorabilia collection includes one of the five pair of ruby slippers  from "Wizard of Oz." "He's being taken seriously by collectors. What he is  doing right now is establishing credibility and building a reputation in the  world of Hollywood memorabilia, which is becoming bigger all the time."  </P> <P> It was in the early '80s that lost and forgotten Hollywood bric-a-brac began  surfacing in public auctions, after being sold and traded privately for years.  The Hollywood artifacts were culled largely by collectors who salvaged them  from studio dumpsters.  </P> <P> The potential for financial windfall was first realized in 1982, when Steven  Spielberg paid $61,000 at a Sotheby's auction in New York for one of the  Rosebud sleds from "Citizen Kane." But the floodgates opened wide in June,  1988, when a pair of ruby slippers was auctioned off by Christie's New York for  $165,000.  </P> <P> Soon after, Sotheby's sold one of the two pianos from "Casablanca" for  $154,000; a 1938 radio script from Orson Welles' "War of the Worlds" for  $143,000; and a black-and-white animation cel from the early Walt Disney  cartoon "The Orphan's Benefit" for $135,000.  </P> <P> "I'm a little afraid of the market right now," said Beverly Hills dentist Gary  Milan, the seller of the "Casablanca" piano. Milan still owns a second piano  from the film, as well as the leaden statuette from "The Maltese Falcon," which  he claims is worth more than $250,000.  </P> <P> "This is the time to buy, not to sell," Milan said. "The economy is pretty flat  right now. I think when there's another jump in inflation and people have  dollars that they don't know what to do with, this stuff is going to take off  again."  </P> <P> Items Vilkin has up for auction this weekend include the Marx Brothers'  personal family photo album, with photos from 1876 to 1925 (estimated value:  $6,000 to $8,000); Leslie Howard's script from "Gone With the Wind" ($8,000 to  $10,000); what is believed to be the only surviving theater display banner for  the 1937 release of Disney's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" ($3,000 to  $5,000); a photo album from the Hal Roach Studio Archives that contains dozens  of test photos of early screen stars ($2,000 to $3,000); and more than 500  vintage movie posters and lobby cards dating back to 1910.  </P> <P> "With each auction, more things kind of get finessed out of the woodwork, which  is great, " Vilkin said. "Because a lot of people who have these items don't  look at them as historical artifacts. The 'Superman' costume was donated to Cal  State Fullerton by the director of the television show and held there for 10  years. They didn't take care of it, and now it's moth-eaten. These items should  be preserved and shared."  </P> <P> Camden House has scheduled a public exhibition today from noon to 9 p.m. at the  Ebell. Poster and lobby cards will be auctioned Saturday beginning at noon,  with the rest of the items going on the block Sunday at noon.  </P> <P> The Ebell Club is at 4400 Wilshire Blvd. Information: (213) 476-1628.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BLACK PANTHER ARCHIVES RESCUED  </P> <P> Former Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver paid $500 to retrieve a set of  documents he says "will tell the story that hasn't been told," about the  now-defunct militant group.  </P> <P> Cartons of Cleaver's books, files and other belongings were nearly sold by the  AAAAA Rent-A-Space company last month for $25.  </P> <P> Cleaver, 55, owed more than $900 in overdue rental fees.  </P> <P> But the documents were returned to Cleaver on Monday after he agreed to pay the  storage company $500.  </P> <P> "This is the most comprehensive collection in private hands of what the Black  Panther Party was up to," Cleaver said.  </P> <P> "This will tell the story that hasn't been told . . . and will be a vindication  of a lot of slander and lies that have been told about me personally," he said.  </P> <P> Cleaver, one of the founders of the Oakland-based Black Panthers in 1966, said  the items include photographs, papers and pamphlets documenting the group's  activities between 1966 and 1975.  </P> <P> Cleaver said he will donate them to the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley.  </P></p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Datrontech placing postponed The planned flotation of Datrontech, a supplier and distributor of computer memory and other PC components, has been postponed because of adverse market conditions, the magazine Electronics Times reported yesterday. The placing was expected to value the company at Pounds 50m and raise about Pounds 5m. The Aldershot-based firm confirmed the delay but said the float would eventually go ahead. It is believed the share placing will take place in the first half of 1995. The company, formed in 1987 by Mr Steve King, managing and marketing director, and Mr Ian Boyle, sales director, reported pre-tax profits in the half year to June of Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 1.4m). Memory products accounted for 88 per cent of last year's Pounds 46m turnover. Datrontech has a close relationship with Kingston Technology of the US, whose products account for about 40 per cent of its sales.</p>

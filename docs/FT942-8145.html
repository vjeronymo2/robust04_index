			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Transferring securities With reference to EU bearer securities (ie, BASK AG shares), would you please clarify the following points: 1. If held by the trustees of a company profit-sharing scheme, can they be transferred at the end of the five-year term into a single company personal equity plan? 2. Is it a legal requirement for them to be held in a custodian account at a bank? 3. Is it true that the collection of dividends is not difficult and involves only a bit more paperwork? 4. Would you expect to pay a fee, however small, to the custodian to get physical possession of shares held for five years in a company profit-sharing scheme? 1. No. 2. No. 3. In our opinion, the answer is No for most people. 4. Yes, if the sponsoring employer has not undertaken to meet such expenses. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

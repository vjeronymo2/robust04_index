In view of the circumstances, the Council deems it necessary  to state the objective and patriotic position of the Armed  Forces to the Honduran people to prevent continued speculation  on the subject by sectors not necessarily interested in social  peace or the national well-being. Therefore, we hereby state  our position under the following terms:    1. The Honduran Armed Forces, as a part of Honduran society,  have developed and will permanently develop a plan to  participate in actions for our homeland's modernization,  reconciliation, social peace,and human and economic development.  Our only interest is promoting the people's well-being and  Honduran progress. We are aware of the fact that without our  participation, we would not have reached the state of human  solidarity and the opportunities for development we can justly  expect today.    2. The historical circumstances that existed in our country  during the eighties cannot and should not be radically analyzed  or isolated from the ideological, political, and economic  context that characterized the Cold War. During that period,  antagonistic forces maintained a climate of confrontation not  only in Honduras, but in the entire world.    3. Therefore, within the fast moving process of society's  transition toward total respect for human rights within a  pluralist and participative democracy, the Honduran State and  its national institutions have clearly defined the levels of  participation and responsibility in the efforts to reconcile the  Honduran family and consolidate democracy. We feel we have  contributed to those lofty objectives and we are proud of the  role played by our institution, with loyalty, honor, and  sacrifice.    4. We categorically reiterate our commitment to abide by the  Constitution and laws as the essence for our professional duties  and responsibilities. Within that concept, we believe that the  entire process for investigating the actions that motivated this  communique must be carried out based on legal grounds, and not  on sectarian positions and obscure interests.    5. The actions carried out by Division General Luis Alonso  Discua Elvir, commander in chief of the Honduran Armed Forces,  have been and continue to be consistent with the task of  democratizing and modernizing the Honduran State. The military  institution takes part in the process of modernization and  professionalization. Hence, we publicly express our strongest  "vote of confidence" to him, supporting his actions. We also  believe he should continue performing his constitutional duties  as commander of the "people's armed branch." Hence, it should  be clearly established that the Armed Forces and its commander  in chief constitute an indestructible unity at the service of  our homeland, and that it will act within the framework of the  law to defend the institution's unity, permanence, and  stability, for the benefit of the national community.    6. Finally, we believe that our fatherland should come first  in our plans and goals. The Armed Forces have faith in the  nation's future and will continue to be a decisive factor for  the achievement of the people's aspirations, guided by the  principles of national reconciliation and respect for the law.  Consequently, we clearly and categorically affirm that it will  not be the differences that separate us, but the ideals that  unite us, which will help Hondurans build the fatherland we all  want: high in the eternal dream of our civic glories and great  in the minds of its best children.</p>

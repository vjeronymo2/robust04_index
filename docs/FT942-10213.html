			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Do It All cuts The long-awaited restructuring announcement from Do It All, the home improvement group owned by WH Smith and Boots, disappointed the market and shares in the parent groups retreated. Around 100 stores are to be closed or sold and provisions of Pounds 60m will be taken by Boots and Smith. But retail analysts commented that contracts had been exchanged on only about half of the 40 stores actually sold, and expressed concern over the likelihood of many more being bought. There were also worries over further trading provisions to come from the unsold stores. Smith shares were the worst hit, tumbling 9 1/2 to 506 1/2 p, mainly because Do It All is a bigger part of the company's trading than Boots. The latter, which rose 12 initially with the market, closed 3 up at 556p. Smith is likely to remain in the news, with stores specialists predicting an announcement from the retailer in the next few weeks that it is to restructure its shares. Smith 'B' shares, which receive one fifth of the dividend of the 'A' stock, are currently trading at a 16 per cent premium to the 'A's. A move to consolidate the shares would probably involve a slight dilution of the 'A's and could be accompanied by a dividend or share issue sweetener.</p>

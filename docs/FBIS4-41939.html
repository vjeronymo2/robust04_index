			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Omer Kebapcioglu in Baku] </F>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] President Geydar Aliyev was  pleased with the Turkish prime minister's parliamentary motion  requesting authority to participate in the multinational force  in Azerbaijan and to set up installations in Turkey to extend  support to this force. Replying to our questions, Aliyev said  that a multinational force including Turkey would prevent  efforts to impose solutions on the problem. Turkey is the  greatest guarantee for Azerbaijan, he said, adding that the  latest move by the Turkish Government proves this once again.    Aliyev expressed the belief that Turkey's participation in  the multinational force will help solve the Nagorno-Karabakh  problem quickly and justly.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Nicaraguan economic developments monitored through 25  January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item.    Officials at the Economy and External Cooperation Ministries  said that despite current government optimism and expectations  for renewed economic activity in 1994, Nicaragua's economy is  still perceived throughout Central America as the worst in the  region. The sources indicated that conditions during 1994 will  be determined primarily by the agricultural cycle and  international cooperation, both of which show decreasing  tendencies. Funds received from international cooperation will  be used mostly to pay $250 million in foreign debt. Of the $250  million liquid funds to be received as part of the international  assistance package, only $70 million has been contracted as  loans while $150 million is coming from the Enhanced Structural  Adjustment Facility (ESAF) program. In the meantime, unions  continue to protest government plans to privatize several state  enterprises, including utility companies such as the Nicaraguan  Institute of Energy and the Nicaraguan Telecommunications and  Postal Services Institute. (Managua EL SEMANARIO in Spanish 20  Jan 94 p 3)    Social Action Minister William Baez, Carlos Noguera,  director  of the Social Emergency Investment Fund, and Maria Hurtado,  director of Small Business Support, announced plans to create  approximately 28,000 provisional and permanent jobs this year.  The three officials agreed that one of the biggest causes of  unemployment in Nicaragua is the government's structural  adjustment program. The same sources said that unemployment in  Nicaragua is expected to reach 60 percent of the economically  active population. (Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO in Spanish 20 Jan  94 p 6)</p>

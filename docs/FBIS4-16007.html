			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Defense Ministry press service reports,  the Azerbaijani Army resumed its combat operations along the  northeastern border of Armenia last night. The enemy opened  tank, howitzer, and machine gun fire from his military base in  (Garadash) in Tauzskiy Rayon on Movses and Aygepar and the  defensive positions around these villages in Tavushskiy Rayon  between 1830-2030. There are injured among the peaceful  population.    The Azerbaijani armed formations at Dhzafarli military base  in Kazakhskiy Rayon opened intensive artillery fire on Aygehovit  and Vazashen in Idzhevanskiy Rayon at around 1900. Half an hour  later, a large enemy infantry formation, supported by tanks,  tried to break through the Armenian defensive lines and invade  Aygehovit. Following fierce battles, the Armenia's border guards  managed to halt and then repulse the enemy's surprise tank  attack. There are losses on both sides, and material  destruction in Aygehovit and Vazashen.    Two Azerbaijani bombers flying low over Karabakh airspace  intruded on the Armenian Republic's airspace at around 2228.  Azerbaijani planes dropped two bombs on Goris and another two on  Kapan. They flew off over southern part of Karabakh. The  Armenian air-defense forces could not retaliate effectively  because the planes were flying low.    We have not yet received any information on today's  situation  on borders and in Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

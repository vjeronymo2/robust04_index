			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, June 15 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  Kampuchea Party (DKP), or Khmer Rouge, has agreed to fully  support a cease fire proposed by Cambodia's King Norodom  Sihanouk.    The declaration was made by Chan Youran, the head of a DKP  delegation to a round table meeting of a peace working committee  which opened at the royal palace Phnom Penh this morning under  the chairmanship of Nhiek Tioulong, the representative of the  king.    Chan Youran said: "Our nation and people are definitely  tired  of war. Continuing it would only make the situation in Cambodia  worse."    However, the DKP delegation did not agree the deadline of  June 30 for the cease fire which was proposed by the government  and national assembly at today's meeting.    Chan said mutual concessions and compromises should be made  through discussions as suggested by the king. "On that common  basis, we will discuss what the DKP should hand over to the  royal government and what the government should in turn give to  the DKP." he said.</p>

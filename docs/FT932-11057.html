			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown predicts 80 council-seat gains for Lib Dems MR PADDY Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday predicted up to 80 council-seat gains for Liberal Democrats in the local elections. 'Liberal Democrats do better in the ballot box than in opinion polls, especially in local council elections,' he said. Decisions on the future structure of local government in Scotland will be announced in a white paper before the summer recess, it was announced last night. Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish local government minister, said the new authorities were expected to assume 'full control' in April 1996.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET FOCUS ;  </P> <P> U.S. EXPORTERS EXCITED BY OPENING UP OF BRAZIL;  </P> <P> 'A SLUMBERING GIANT IS WAKING UP . . . ,' SAYS THE COMMERCIAL COUNSELOR AT THE  EMBASSY IN BRASILIA. THE REVIVAL SHOULD INCREASE THE COUNTRY'S IMPORTANCE ON  THE WORLD MARKET.  </P> <P> The good news for American exporters is spreading fast: Latin America's biggest  national market is opening its doors to foreign imports.  </P> <P> The U.S. Foreign Commercial Service office at the American Consulate in Sao  Paulo is being swamped with inqueries from businessmen looking for ways to take  advantage of the new opening. The phone there "is ringing off the hook, and  people can't get any work done," said Kevin C. Brennan, commercial counselor in  the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia.  </P> <P> Brennan views the Brazilian move to liberalize import policy as part of an  economic "sea change" that will increase this country's importance on the world  market. "As I see it, a slumbering giant is waking up in Brazil," he said.  </P> <P> With a population of 150 million, Brazil has one of the world's 10 biggest  economies, accounting for half of the industrial base in Latin America.  Brazilian industry was built up during decades of "import-substitution" policy  that protected domestic producers from foreign competition.  </P> <P> But President Fernando Collor de Mello, who took office in March, has rejected  protectionism and has begun lowering tariffs and other import restrictions as  part of sweeping economic reforms. Since the United States already is Brazil's  No. 1 source of imports, with sales of $4.8 billion in 1989, American industry  is in a good position to take advantage of the new opening.  </P> <P> "I think the story of Brazil is as exciting as what's going on in Eastern  Europe in many ways, and for U.S. manufacturers, Brazil is a much more  lucrative market," Brennan said.  </P> <P> He said U.S. exports to Brazil increased by 11% in the first half of 1990 and  are expected to rise 5% to 8% in the next year.  </P> <P> "That is a conservative estimate based on the fact that there is a recession  going on in Brazil," he noted. "The long-term trend is very favorable."  </P> <P> Brennan said some potential U.S. exporters are scared off by Brazil's  $117-billion foreign debt and how it might affect supplier financing. But, he  added, "As far as I'm aware, there hasn't been any problem with short-term  credits."  </P> <P> After Mexico, Brazil has the second-largest portfolio in the U.S. Export-Import  Bank, which currently lists $3.2 billion in outstanding credits for exports to  the Brazilian market. And last week, Brazilian authorities announced that this  country is dropping a requirement that all imports of $200,000 or more must be  financed abroad.  </P> <P> The U.S. Foreign Commercial Service, an agency of the Commerce Department, has  representatives in the Brazilian cities of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Brasilia,  Belem and Belo Horizonte, and has district offices in Los Angeles, San Diego  and San Francisco. They all offer services to businessmen interested in  exporting to Brazil.  </P> <P> One of the services is "industry sector analysis" reports on different segments  of the Brazilian market. For $750, the Foreign Commercial Service will prepare  a tailored market research report called a "comparative shopping survey" that  analyzes opportunities, price ranges and competition in Brazil for a specific  line of products.  </P> <P> The U.S. agency also helps line up Brazilian companies to serve as  representatives and distributors for U.S. manufacturers and exporters. But  Alexandre Barros, a consultant to foreign companies doing business in Brazil,  predicted that many exporters will find it necessary to train their  representatives to market new products.  </P> <P> "Brazilian representatives don't know how to get to the consumer," Barros said.  "I think marketing is the key to success."  </P> <P> The first major move in Brazil's opening to imports came at the beginning of  July, when the government abolished a list that had barred imports of 1,800  product categories, from boats to motors to toys.  </P> <P> Since then, the Economy Ministry has been issuing new orders twice a month or  so, lowering tariffs on long lists of import products. Many are produced by  Brazilian monopolies and oligopolies at prices up to four times international  levels.  </P> <P> Joao Cunha, national undersecretary of economy, said a task force in the Trade  Department of the Economy Ministry is preparing a reformed tariff master list  of 20,000 items that will be ready at the end of the year and will be  implemented over the next four years. He said imports will be divided into  three categories:  </P> <P> * Products that have no counterpart produced in Brazil will enter the country  without tariffs. More than 1,300 products already have been given "zero-tariff"  status.  </P> <P> * Common products, including consumer goods, will enter with tariffs averaging  20%. Some will be as low as 5%, and many will be lowered gradually over four  years to give domestic industry a chance to adapt.  </P> <P> * Products similar to those being produced by "nascent industries" considered  to be in Brazil's national interest, including ones that need time to develop  competitive high technology, will be charged tariffs averaging 40%.  </P> <P> A separate policy is planned for Brazil's computer industry, called  "informatics," which has been heavily protected. While most informatics items  have now been removed from the list of banned imports, the government is  studying a proposed list of more than 60 that would continue to be prohibited.  </P> <P> The list includes microcomputers, video monitors, magnetic discs, keyboards,  electronic cash registers, transistors, fiber optics, facsimile machines and  electronic telex terminals. The ban would expire in October, 1992, with  Brazil's informatics "market reserve."  </P> <P> As in other industries, foreign companies will be permitted to form joint  ventures with Brazilian informatics firms, importing technology and some  components. Commercial counselor Brennan said he assumes that computer  components not produced in Brazil, such as semiconductor chips, will end up on  the zero-tariff list.  </P> <P> Foreign manufacturers and exporters of hundreds of products are applying for  and receiving "zero-tariff" status. Brazilian manufacturers have 30 days to  challenge such an application, but new regulations make it more difficult for  them to justify tariffs.  </P> <P> The reformed tariff list due at the end of the year will include many new  zero-tariff items, taking effect immediately, and more will be added as new  applications come in, Cunha said. He said manufacturing machinery and equipment  have priority for zero-tariff status.  </P></p>

Pyongyang successfully test-fired the Nodong-1, a  sophisticated Scud missiles with a range of about 1,000  kilometres (600 miles) in May, according to Japan.    The colonel said Tehran was trying to develop aircraft and  missiles ``directly threatening'' Israel and at the same time  continuing a long-term nuclear programme.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said in August that Syria and  probably Iran had received deliveries by Russian aircraft of  North Korean Scud-C missiles with a range of 600 kilometres (370  miles).    However, the colonel said Syria had not ordered any SA-10 or  SA- 11 Russian surface-to-air missiles because of economic  difficulties and a ``certain pause'' in the arms race linked to  the Middle East peace process.    The colonel also said Iraq ``apparently'' still had missiles  and launchers which U.N. disarmament inspectors had failed to  locate.    Iraq launched 39 Scud missiles at Israel during the 1991  Gulf  War killing one person, injuring hundreds and damaging thousands  of homes.</p>

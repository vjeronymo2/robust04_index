			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Panic in Amman over Iraq's border closure with Jordan The closure of Iraq's border with Jordan and an announcement that the pre-Gulf war 25 Iraqi dinar banknote was to be withdrawn from circulation caused panic in Amman yesterday, James Whittington reports from Amman. Thousands of Jordanians gathered around the city's official foreign exchanges for information on what to do with the millions of banknotes held in the beleaguered Iraqi currency. Many Jordanians hoarded Iraqi dinars on the assumption that when UN sanctions were lifted the dinar would regain its former strength and huge profits would be made. The Iraqi authorities have issued a deadline of one week during which the banknotes can be exchanged for valid currency within Iraq, but the offer does not apply inside Jordan. 'There has been mayhem. So many people have lost all their savings. They can't believe what Saddam has done,' says a money changer who had to call in the police to control crowds around his office. Around ID120m was exchanged each day on the Jordanian market, according to foreign exchange dealers. One finance ministry official estimates that at least JD60m (Pounds 56m) was lost overnight. Traders said the local branch of Iraq's state-owned Rafidein Bank refused to take the notes from them and transfer them to their accounts in Iraqi banks. Calls from anguished dealers poured into Jordan's central bank asking if Amman had any plans to intervene to help them change the Iraqi money. The Iraqi dinar has been popular with currency speculators and private investors in Jordan since the Gulf crisis. Its rate against the dollar has fluctuated from between 45 to 104 over the past four months. The official fixed rate is ID0.31 to the dollar. The original Swiss-printed 25 dinar note, as opposed to photocopied versions printed after the Gulf War was the most popular denomination with private investors. Its withdrawal has caused bitterness from many in a nation which was Iraq's closest ally during and after the Gulf crisis.</p>

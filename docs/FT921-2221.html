			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Arts: Straight and Narrow - Wyndham's Theatre Straight and Narrow is an undemanding family comedy of the kind that one thought nowadays was confined to television, from where most of its stars come. The most striking fact about it is the social change that must have taken place about what is acceptable in the West End theatre over the last decade or so. Jimmie Chinn's play treats male homosexuality as normal. There is no attempt to be daring or to shock. As one of the female characters remarks, the homosexual couple has a way of life just as 'dreary and respectable' as the rest of the family who are married. Indeed it appears that homosexuality has been running in the family for years. The dead father is revealed to have been prone to it. One of the married male characters admits to having an uncle who goes on marches for gay rights in Manchester. Another, who has just returned to his wife after a fortnight's fling with an oversexed (female) shop assistant at Boots the chemists, reflects that he has often thought that he might like to be gay. This ought to be interesting stuff. The trouble is that the female character is right: all the couples are dreary and respectable, regardless of their sexual proclivities. The setting moves between Manchester and Malta, though without a change of scenery. What drama there is hinges on a possible break-up between the homosexuals. One of them, Jeff, has previously had relations with women. He hankers now after another, if only to father a child. Curiously, it turns out that he has already done so, but failed to keep in touch. The plot has the odd surprise. There are some good performances. Carmel McSharry, who appears in In Sickness and in Health on television, plays the mum deliberately dressed as a lower middle class version of the Queen Mother. She is a very accomplished actress. Nicholas Lyndhurst plays her homosexual son, Bob, partly in the guise of a stand-up comic telling sad stories, but adding the occasional joke. Only Neil Daglish as Jeff, however, suggests that there might be a world beyond the Manchester suburbs, and even he succumbs to routine in the end. Straight and Narrow is directed by the immensely experienced Allan Davis who achieved such a long-running success with No Sex Please - We're British. One assumes that he knows what he is doing here, but I wouldn't bank on it.</p>

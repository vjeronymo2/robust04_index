			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CZECH SWIMMER GETS CANADA OK  </P> <P> Czechoslovak swimmer Marcel Gery was given approval to swim at the 1990  Commonwealth Games when the federal Cabinet accepted his application for  Canadian citizenship, a Swimming Canada spokesman said today.  </P> <P> Gery, who defected in October, 1986, is a world class freestyle and butterfly  swimmer. He is expected to boost Canada's medal hopes at the Jan. 24-Feb. 3  Commonwealth Games at Auckland, New Zealand.  </P> <P> Gery, who qualified for the Games in the 100-meter freestyle and 100-meter  butterfly, missed the 1988 Olympics because the Canadian government rejected  his request for early citizenship, bypassing the customary three-year waiting  period. He missed the 1984 Olympics when Czechoslovakia boycotted the Los  Angeles Games.  </P></p>

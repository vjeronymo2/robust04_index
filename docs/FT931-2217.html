			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Anheuser in joint venture to sell Budweiser in Japan ANHEUSER-BUSCH, the US brewer best known for its Budweiser brand, has joined forces with Kirin Brewery, Japan's largest beer company, to set up a joint venture to sell Budweiser in Japan. Anheuser will provide 90 per cent of the Y9bn (Dollars 77m) capital of the new company, while Kirin will hold a 10 per cent stake. Anheuser plans to boost its market share in Japan from the present 1.2 per cent to 5 per cent by distributing Budweiser through Kirin's network. The US brewer will terminate its current distributing contract with Suntory, a medium-sized Japanese beverage company, in September. The move comes after extensive negotiations with Japan's Fair Trade Commission, the country's anti-monopoly watchdog. Kirin already has almost 50 per cent of the Japanese beer market, and in an unusual move, the FTC advised that Kirin take a small stake in the new company. The agreement comes as Japan's beer market is showing signs of shrinking due to the slowing economy. However, Kirin said the joint venture was a long-term commitment, and it believed that the new company would revitalise the market.</p>

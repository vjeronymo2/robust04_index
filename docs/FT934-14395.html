			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Travel Focus - Caribbean &amp; South America: Next stop: the world's end - Andrew Anderson explores the wild remoteness of Tierra del Fuego YOU KNOW you are headed somewhere special as soon as you begin the descent into Ushuaia, the toytown capital of Argentinian Tierra del Fuego. The aircraft swoops down the Beagle channel, skimming over snowy peaks peeping through the clouds, stands suddenly on a wingtip to bank left, whips to the right and judders to a halt on the runway, a few feet from the icy waters of Ushuaia bay. Those first-time passengers who are still conscious break into applause. Old hands merely yawn: these Argentinian pilots always fly the way they drive . . . The airport setting soon soothes shattered nerves. Jagged peaks soar above the bay and encircle the town in a snowy embrace. The neat, prefabricated houses curve round the harbour, each with its little front garden filled with lupins and poppies, a Sussex vicarage scene with added glaciers. Fishing boats and yachts ride at anchor. The air is so crisp and clean you can take bites out of it. As yet there is no sign saying: 'THIS IS IT - THE END OF THE WORLD', but there is no mistaking the 'last frontier' feel: step off the harbour wall and it is next stop Antarctica. Tierra del Fuego, a jumble of islands at the very end of South America now split roughly equally between Argentina and Chile, deserves its place in travel mythology. Like the Silk Road or Easter Island, it conjures up its own image: wild, remote, mysterious. Any schoolboy knows the history of the name. Ferdinand Magellan, the Portuguese explorer, first found the Ireland-sized archipelago in 1520 as he travelled through the nightmarish seas of the straits which now bear his name. He spotted the campfires of the Yahgan Indian inhabitants and named it Tierra del Humo: the Land of Smoke. Later his patron, Charles V, king of Spain, reasoned that there could be no smoke without fire, so the Land of Fire it became. Magellan had found the western route to Asia, but the discovery and subsequent stampede of foreign ships brought no joy to the Indians, who had scraped a living from the harshest of landscapes for thousands of years. Charles Darwin, who came this way on the Beagle in 1834, wrote that the difference between the Fuegians - 'among the most abject and miserable creatures I ever saw' - and the Europeans was 'greater than that between wild and domestic animals.' Those Indians who did not succumb immediately to imported smallpox or measles were forced to prey on the livestock of the settlers who had summarily taken their land. The settlers put a bounty on each Indian head, hunted them down and shot them like animals. By the early 20th century they were all dead. Ushuaia's small but excellent museum on the waterfront tells the sorry tale well. The Argentine government made Ushuaia a duty free port in an effort to boost its economy. Today it is a semi-boom town of some 30,000 souls who race around in huge tax-free Jeeps and, together with the wealthy cruise ship passengers passing through on their way to Antarctica, do a roaring trade in the bars and liquor shops. There is also a strong naval presence. Ushuaia played its part in the Falklands war, and there are many sad memorials to those who fell in the 'Malvinas conflict.' Being so far south does strange things to the summer nights, roughly November-February. Outside those months the cold sweeps in with a vengeance. At midnight one can read a paperback by natural light and the town is just beginning to bop. At 2.30am, when most of the cruise ship passengers are long since asleep, the light fades only slowly amid a cacophony of car horns and carousing along the narrow strip of Ushuaia's main street. Bedtime is around 4am. It is a good town in which to indulge in one of Argentina's gastronomic highlights, the parrillada - a selection of meat grilled over an open fire. The Argentinians are carnivores on the scale of Tyrannosaurus Rex; if it has red blood and moves, they eat it. In the Cafeteria Ideal, where you can stuff yourself for Dollars 12, there was cold starters, sliced beef, chicken legs, pasta, potatos, haunches of lamb, fields of salad, followed by the parrillada itself: black sausage, white sausage, fried intestines, more chicken and a beef steak so large that it came with a leg at each corner. I measured it: 7in x 3in x 1 1/2 in deep. 'Eat it before it jumps over the moon,' advised my wife. You can walk off a parrillada in the mountains behind Ushuaia. The tarmac road soon peters out at the foot of a chair lift (skiing is a growing industry) and becomes a rough track winding past the tin shacks of local crab fishermen and newly-built holiday chalets. There is a glacier on the peak at the back of the town, the path to it strewn with alpine flowers: saxifrage, house leeks, tiny yellow drumstick primulas, nodding Icelandic poppies. From the Martial glacier there is a splendid view of the Beagle channel, millpond still, reflecting its encircling peaks. Cape Horn lies on the horizon; only those with cast-iron stomachs should attempt the boat trip to this storm-lashed rock. Hardy souls, who must possess their own tent and a decent sleeping bag, can take a two-hour minibus trip into Tierra del Fuego national park, a wilderness of mountains and lakes reminiscent of the Scottish highlands  - and just as wet. There is a cosy cafe and a well-run campsite by the shores of Lago Roca, and some splendid walks amid the smaller peaks and lakes, up to the border with Chilean Tierra del Fuego. One walk that is not recommended is the five-hour slog up the peak behind Lago Negra, an inky-black pool surrounded by a sphagnum moss bog. The view from the top is stunning, but it involves trekking through a forest of lenga, a type of beech that grows, dies, rots and grows again until it forms a near-imprenetrable barrier of semi-rotten wood. On and on we blundered, crashing through foot-thick trunks that snapped like twigs, sinking knee-deep in a puff of sawdust into seemingly solid logs. Down and down came the rain. The slog back was even worse: a stray branch snapped my precious telescopic trout rod even as I hove in sight of Lago Negra, boiling with feeding fish. I threw the rod down in a furious fit of pique, cursing and stamping through the bog. 'Don't worry, darling,' soothed my wife, fixing the rod with a twist of dental floss and a couple of matchsticks. I snatched it from her and cast; the water heaved; I struck; a 5lb rainbow trout virtually leapt into my arms. 'I love you]', I told my wife. 'You prat,' she said. Getting there: Ushuaia has frequent air connections to Buenos Aires; the five-hour flight costs approximately Dollars 500. By land, buses take about two days from BA to Rio Gallegos in the far south of Pategonia, from where it is an hour's flight to Ushuaia. From Chile, there is an arduous route from Punta Arenas in the far south of that country, a ferry across the Straits of Magellan to Porvenir, and then a 10-hour bus ride to Ushuaia. A good hotel in Ushuaia, such as the Hotel Canal Beagle, which caters mainly for cruise passengers, will cost upwards of Dollars 50 for a double room. Staying at a casa de familia, a family B &amp; B, is cheaper and much more fun; ask at the information office on Avenida Maipu.</p>

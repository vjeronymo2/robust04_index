			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Congratulatory message" of the WPK Central Committee to </F> the participants in the national coal industry functionaries'  meeting delivered by Han Song-yong, member of the Political  Bureau and secretary of the WPK Central Committee, at the  first-day sitting of the meeting held at the People's Palace of  Culture in Pyongyang on 20 April--read by announcer]    [Text] A congratulatory message to the participants in the  national coal industry functionaries' meeting:    The national coal industry functionaries' meeting is  convening at a time when all the party members and working  people are vigorously waging the battle of the first year of the  period of adjustment with wholehearted unity around the party  and the leader to implement our party's revolutionary economic  strategy. The meeting is a significant meeting to display the  militant spirit of our people and the working people of the coal  industry sector who are vigorously advancing along the road of  the revolution's victory by demonstrating the invincibility of  our-style socialism under the chuche revolutionary banner  unperturbed by the imperialists' vicious challenge.    The Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee sends  warm congratulations to the participants in the meeting and all  the functionaries and coal miners of the coal industry sector  who have registered great labor exploits in implementing the  party's chuche-oriented coal industrial policy by waging a  devoted struggle for the growth and prosperity of the socialist  fatherland and the happiness of our people with high loyalty to  the party and the leader.    The coal front is one of the most important fronts for our  people's economy, and a lifeline for bringing a breakthrough in  the struggle to implement the revolutionary economic strategy  put forth by our party. The party members and working people of  the coal industry sector have actively contributed to the  enhancement of the country's wealth, power, and development and  the people's happiness with a devoted struggle and creative  labor under the wise leadership of the party and the leader with  firm faith in socialism, and have attained great success in  developing the country's coal industry.    The functionaries of the coal industry sector and the coal  miners have reconstructed and expanded in a modern way the  large-scale coal mines in Anju, Sunchon, Pukchang, and Tokchon  districts within a short period, displaying an indomitable  fighting spirit with high self-awareness befitting the master of  the revolution. Developing numerous coal mines in promising  districts, they have registered a proud exploit of drastically  increasing coal production capacity.    The functionaries and working people of the coal industry  sector built strong mining facility production bases and coal  prospecting and coal mine construction force all over the  country highly displaying revolutionary enthusiasm and creative  enterprising spirit. By so doing, they attained brilliant  success in strengthening the coal industry's material and  technological base.    The workers and technicians of the coal industry intensified  their creative cooperation so that they could enhance the  mechanization standard of coal mining work and extensively  introduced advanced technological processes and work methods.  By so doing, they are modernizing coal mines and producing more  coal while working more joyfully.    Today, the coal industry of our country has great production  potential capable of smoothly satisfying the need of the  people's economy for coal. At the same time, it dependably  ensures the strengthening and development of a self-reliant  socialist national economy and invincible might. This proud  success attained by the coal industry sector is the noble effort  of the coal industry sector functionaries and coal miners who  are working diligently in underground pits thousands of fathoms  deep devoting their clean conscience and sincere labor in  upholding our party's coal industry policy for the party, the  revolution, the country, and the people, irrespective of whether  someone recognizes their hard work.    The WPK Central Committee highly appreciates the great labor  exploits of the functionaries and working people of the coal  industry sector that were attained in the struggle to increase  coal production by implementing the party's coal industrial  policy of upholding the leadership of the party and the leader.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Coal plays  a very important role in the country's industrial development  and the people's livelihood.    The struggle to attain great upsurges in coal production  today is a very important and honorable struggle to accelerate  overall socialist construction by implementing the party's  agriculture-first policy, light industry-first policy, and  trade-first policy. At the same time, it is a sacred struggle  to crush [chitpusida] the maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists and  reactionaries who are going wild to blockade [pongswae] and  stifle [chilsik] our country-- the fortress of socialism--and to  defend, adhere to, and add further luster to our country's  socialism centered on the popular masses.    All the functionaries and working people of the coal  industry  sector should protect the party by increasing coal production as  the steel fighters upheld the party by increasing the production  of steel during the difficult post-war period and defended the  line of socialist economic construction. In so doing, they  should protect the party with coal production, and defend  our-style socialism more firmly and add further luster to it.    The functionaries and coal miners of the coal industry  sector  should firmly arm themselves with our party's chuche idea,  uphold the party wholeheartedly and loyally. With firm faith  that our socialism, enjoying the great party's leadership, will  certainly be victorious, they should thoroughly implement the  party's coal mining policy on the principle of absoluteness and  unconditionality.    Highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude that overflowed the majestic Mt.  Paektu during the period of anti-Japanese revolutionary  struggle, all functionaries and coal miners should courageously  overcome all kinds of difficulties and barriers facing them in  coal production. With a firm determination to resolve  everything with one's own strength, even if the higher echelons  do not supply the necessities--although it would be better if  the higher echelons did supply them--they should wage the  struggle to increase coal production earnestly and persistently,  filled to overflowing with revolutionary optimism.    They should actively wage the struggle to reinforce the  repair and maintenance bases at coal mines and ensure, on their  own, the necessary conditions for production of facilities,  parts, supplies, and light tools necessary for coal production.    They should accelerate the modernization of coal mines and  achieve endless upsurges in coal production by more forcefully  carrying out the technological revolution.    They should put effort into the replacement of facilities  with large, modern, and high-speed ones in carrying out the  technological revolution and into the mechanization and  comprehensive mechanization of the work inside mining pits, and  diversification of transport.    They should widely accept advanced mining methods and  technological procedures while producing more modern machine  units fit for our country's coal fields and revamping the  structure and framework of mine pits in this connection.    They should try to actively solve scientific and  technological problems arising from developing and introducing  modern machine units and production methods while putting forth  more innovations of new technologies, creative designs, and  rationalization plans by bringing together the wisdom and  efforts of workers and technicians, introducing them into  production on a timely basis, and decisively enhancing the role  of scientists.    The functionaries in the coal industrial sector should have  the production proceed in accordance with the production process  by conducting well the technological management of facilities,  increasing their utilization rate, dovetailing the production  processes with each other in a thorough-going way, and solving  pending problems on a timely basis.    The functionaries in the coal industrial sector should  increase the coal production per coal mining site and build more  of new coal mines and mining pits by reconstructing and  expanding the mining pits of the existing coal mines, focusing  on production, and simplifying the transport system.    Giving priority to exploring, digging, and mining is an  inviolable rule in the development of coal industry. The  functionaries in the coal industrial sector should create more  new coal fields by carrying out scrupulously the work to  increase exploring capability, reinforce technological  equipment, and to introduce advanced exploration methods,  thereby endlessly increasing the efficiency and speed of  exploration, securing more coal deposits, and forcefully  carrying out the high-speed digging movement.    Much attention should be paid to conserving coal resources  and making an effective use of them. With a deep understanding  of the justness of our party's policy to develop the economy in  a chuche-oriented way on the basis of coal resources, coal mines  should wage an active struggle to dig coal thoroughly without  loss, completely dig the shallow coal bed, and widely use  low-calorie coal.    The functionaries in the coal industrial sector should pay  great attention to the labor security and safeguard in  conformity with the characteristic of the work inside the mining  pits and solidifying the indoctrination of labor security and  safeguard for coal miners, thus having them strictly abide by  standard manufacturing procedure and labor security and  safeguard.    Rear-area services for coal miners should be further  improved. Thoroughly realizing the party's intention not to  spare anything for the coal miners, the functionaries should  give priority to supplying coal miners with (?workers' supplies)  and subsidiary food on a priority basis, and firmly manage the  rear-area bases of supplies including meat, eggs, and vegetables  at coal mines, produce more subsidiary food of various kinds, on  their own, and supply them for the coal miners.    They should help give top priority to supplying facilities  and materials so as to normalize coal production at a high  level, to give solid priority to the coal industry, and to  further accelerate the country's overall economic development.  Various sectors of the people's economy, such as metal,  machine, and forestry industries, should also carry out well the  work of insuring the necessary conditions for production of  various machine units including compressors, (?electric cars and  railroad ties) on a timely basis, and of supplementing (?labor  force) and technicians to coal mines.    The party work in the coal industrial sector should be  further solidified in conformity with the demands of the  developing realities. By firmly putting together functionaries  and workers around the party and waging the organizational  political work in a fresh fashion, the party organizations in  the coal industrial sector should foster all coal miners as coal  warriors endlessly loyal to the party and have all of them  become creators of exploits and innovations in the  implementation of the party's coal policy. Along with this, in  conformity with the demands of the Taean work system, they  should further improve the management and operation of coal  mines, firmly build the production system in which the mining  pits are the basic battle units. They should strengthen the  party- oriented guidance so that all problems arising from  production can be solved on a timely basis under the unified  command of the planning staff of mining pits.    Today, the coal industrial sector is facing a heavy and  honorable duty. Our party is expressing much confidence in and  expectation to the functionaries and workers in the coal  industrial sector. The WPK Central Committee firmly believes  that all functionaries and coal miners of the coal industrial  sector will wonderfully repay the party's great confidence and  expectation by achieving fresh revolutionary upsurges in coal  production and giving solid priority to the development of coal  industry, upholding the party's revolutionary economic strategy.    [Signed] WPK Central Committee    [Dated] 20 April 1994</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Abu-Salih by </F> Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given]    [Text] [Abu-Husayn] First of all, who, in your view, is  responsible for the eruption of Egyptian-Sudanese differences,  especially after the start of the dialogue between the two sides?    [Abu-Salih] Sudan has done nothing wrong against Egypt and  it will not sacrifice its relations with Egypt, which should be  special. I have come to Egypt six times to tackle the Hala'ib  triangle dispute. The second round should have been held in  Khartoum. It was postponed several times by the Egyptian side.  More than once we appealed to [Egyptian Foreign] Minister 'Amr  Musa to make the visit urgently so that we could carry out the  task entrusted to us by Presidents Husni Mubarak and 'Umar  al-Bashir at the time of the African summit in Cairo last  summer. I believe that dialogue and meetings are essential for  the settlement of the Hala'ib dispute, which, we believe, is a  constant source of provocation and tension between the two  countries. As far as we are concerned, postponement of the  dialogue is unacceptable because it means continuation of the  present situation.    [Abu-Husayn] But Minister 'Amr Musa said more than once that  the reason for the postponement was the fact that he was too  busy at home and abroad.    [Abu-Salih] I believe that Cairo and Khartoum are no more  than two hours apart. Is it conceivable that visits to  countries other than Sudan are more important than the current  tense situation between the two countries? We insist on urgent  dialogue because relations should not remain as they are for a  long time. We believe that the present Egyptian Government is  stronger than previous governments and more serious about  establishing good relations between the Egyptian and Sudanese  peoples. To us, that is a strategic objective and neither of us  should lose sight of it.    We will never forget Egypt's support for us on the question  of Sudan's territorial integrity and against partition of Sudan,  but we want to cooperate and coordinate and we want to move  forward and settle any dispute which might undermine the  situation in Sudan. We see the Hala'ib problem as much too small  a problem to be a major obstacle in the way of special relations  between the two countries.    [Abu-Husayn] Has a date been set for Minister 'Amr Musa to  visit Khartoum?    [Abu-Salih] Regrettably, no date has been set yet. I have  talked to him about everything I have said regarding ties  between the two countries, their importance, the need to end  this abnormal situation, and the need to move on to a better  situation in the interest of both countries, particularly as  there is much talk these days about Arab solidarity. The  question is how is that to be achieved. There are differences  between one state and its neighbor. That is unacceptable in a  world which does not respect small entities. There must be  cohesion and solidarity for the present and the future.    [Abu-Husayn] But how is that going to apply to your  relations with Egypt after the Sudanese president's appointment  of a governor for the Hala'ib triangle?    [Abu-Salih] If we just looked at what both the Egyptian and  Sudanese sides are doing in Hala'ib, the problem would never be  solved because it is disputed territory and, in the present  situation, each side can do what it likes. That is why the  dispute must be settled.    [Abu-Husayn] Pardon me, but Egypt emphasizes that Hala'ib  is Egyptian and Sudan says it would never forfeit it. So, how  is the dialogue to be resumed?    [Abu-Salih] Dialogue is the only way of creating a positive  atmosphere. We would never forfeit the Hala'ib triangle by  force or through the imposition of a fait accompli. We could  possibly give it to Egypt through cordial means and provided we  agree and the dialogue begins on the basis of mediation,  international arbitration, or any sensible solution agreed upon  by the two sides.    [Abu-Husayn] It seems that Sudan's declaration that Hala'ib  is Sudanese was sufficient reason for Egypt to lose interest in  dialogue.    [Abu-Salih] And Egypt's creation of electoral constituencies  is also unacceptable to us. We had previously agreed to stop  such practices. That Egyptian measure actually was sufficient  proof that Hala'ib is Sudanese. Why were these constituencies  not created in Hala'ib dozens of years ago? Why now? That is  the question. We do not wish to discuss that in the media. We  must arrive at practical solutions through dialogue. With  goodwill, the dispute can be settled.    [Abu-Husayn] What do you think of the Sudanese media claim  that President Mubarak secretly visited Nairobi and met with  John Garang?    [Abu-Salih] That is ridiculous. I do not believe that  President Mubarak did such a thing. No one in the Sudanese  Government has accused or would ever accuse him of doing that.  That was just a report which confused the Egyptian press. The  Sudanese press reported that Mubarak al-Fadil, not President  Mubarak, met with Garang. So, we should not pay any attention  to such reports. The Sudanese media are tired of me going after  them for the reports they publish because I always investigate  any incident which might be harmful to our relations with any  state. You now have the correction to the report carried by the  Sudanese media.    [Abu-Husayn] Have you requested Arab League intervention in  the war in southern Sudan?    [Abu-Salih] Sudan has submitted a memorandum, not seeking  mediation or intervention but informing the Arab League of what  is going on in southern Sudan and of the attempts to partition  Sudan and undermine its territorial integrity, particularly as  the Arab League has for over a year been contemplating calling  for pan-Arab security integration. We consider Sudan to be part  of that security. We emphasize that we will never allow the  rebels and gunmen to fulfill their demands and  self-determination because that constitutes an open call for the  partition of Sudan, which is impossible. The Sudanese Army  would never allow that. The Army is doing its duty against the  rebels to promote stability and is giving them the punishment  they deserve. Despite that, we have offered dialogue and  negotiations to arrive at a comprehensive and just peaceful  solution that would end the war, which is hurting everyone. The  negotiations began on 17 March. The next round will be in May.  The aim is to solve the problem on the basis of the Sudanese  Government's program on the distribution of power and  development but within the framework of a united Sudan, with  exemption from application of the Islamic Shar'iah.</p>

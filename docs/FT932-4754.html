			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs approve panel for child asylum-seekers THE COMMONS last night approved a government proposal to establish a non-statutory advisory panel to assist children who, unaccompanied by an adult, flee to Britain to seek asylum. Mr Charles Wardle, Home Office junior minister, said the new body, to be funded by the government for one year in the first instance, would be established and administered by the Refugee Council. A Lords amendment to the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Bill which sought to establish a statutory advisory panel - strongly supported from the opposition benches - was defeated by a government majority of 48 (274-226). A Refugee Council spokesman, commenting later on the government's preference for a non-statutory advisory panel, said: 'We would have preferred it to be statutory. From our experience we know the vital need for this sort of help to minors. 'Our job now is to make it work.' Mr Michael Howard, on his first appearance on the government front bench as home secretary, ignored opposition demands to repudiate the recent speech by Mr Winston Churchill (C Davyhulme) calling for a halt to the 'relentless flow of immigrants' into Britain. Replying, Mr Wardle said he had taken issue with Mr Churchill in the media over his remarks. Mr Wardle later said the government was accepting another Lords amendment that children asylum-seekers could be fingerprinted only in the presence of someone independent of the immigration authorities or police, and whose role it was to look after the interests of the child.</p>

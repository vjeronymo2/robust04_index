			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Observer: Ritzy More bad news for Trafalgar House. The Ritz, earmarked for disposal, now faces a Pounds 3m claim for personal liability damages after losing a long-running court battle involving a guest's 45ft plunge from the hotel's terrace. The House of Lords has found the hotel to be at fault in not having a high enough balustrade. The case hinged on whether the Ritz had raised the floor of the terrace, as the unfortunate guest, who sustained a fractured skull, asserted. To prove the point, his solicitor had examined old lithographs at the British Museum to establish that an extra step up to the terrace had appeared; won a court order to dig up the terrace; examined the tiles; tracked them down to the factory in Germany where they were made; and obtained a statement from the man who made them in 1976.</p>

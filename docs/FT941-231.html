			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Balladur to subsidise youth jobs Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday decided to dip deep into the public purse to subsidise youth jobs - as the alternative to the ill-fated wage-cutting law that he abandoned in the face of student protest earlier this week. A statement said that 'to give employers an incentive to anticipate the emerging economic recovery', a subsidy of FFr1,000 (Pounds 117) a month would be paid for the first nine months to any company giving a young worker a first job lasting at least 18 months. The monthly subsidy would be doubled for young people hired before October 1. This move appeared partly to pre-empt the mission Mr Balladur gave Mr Michel Bon, head of the ANPE national employment agency. Mr Bon was to take a week to consult unions and employers and to propose a successor plan to the abandoned 'contrat d'insertion professionelle' (CIP), which would have allowed unskilled youths in job training to be paid less than the minimum wage. Mr Bon said yesterday that the subsidy should help 500,000 young people find a job at a cost of FFr6bn. But Mr Balladur said he was still looking to Mr Bon to propose ways of improving his agency's services to the young unemployed, though the prime minister backed away from the idea of a separate employment agency to cater for young job-seekers. In the wake of the government's humiliating climbdown on the CIP, Mr Bernard Pons, parliamentary leader of the ruling Gaullist RPR party, said that ministers were served 'as fuses' and when 'blown' should be replaced. He appeared to be referring to Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister. Mr Balladur's unexpectedly rapid announcement of his subsidy plan, as well his formal repeal yesterday of the CIP, seemed designed to head off a planned student march in Paris today. But the march still looked likely to go ahead. Students again demonstrated yesterday in the western city of Nantes. Meanwhile, Mr Francois Perigot, president of the Patronat employers' federation, said it was necessary 'to show courage, even if little by little, to deal with the problem of labour costs'. But he said this could be done either by reducing wages, as envisaged in the CIP, or by reducing social welfare charges on payrolls, as the Balladur government is already doing slowly. The Patronat has kept a very low profile throughout the whole row over the CIP. This is partly because it did not want to join the government in being pilloried by students and unions but also because it believes that existing forms of apprenticeships are adequate. Young workers entering these apprenticeships are also paid below the minimum wage, but they have accepted this pay cut because the training they get is more formalised and for a longer guaranteed period than envisaged under the CIP. Last summer, the Patronat pledged to put an extra 200,000 young people through these apprenticeships by the end of 1994. So far, from July 1993 to February 1994, it has increased the number of apprentices by only 25,000 over the comparable period of 1992-93. But the Patronat claimed yesterday this was a big improvement over the 'free fall' in apprenticeships in the 1990-93 period, and was confident that it would hit its target of an extra 200,000 this year.</p>

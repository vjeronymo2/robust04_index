			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (4): State looks to private sector stake in projects - Big changes in infrastructure planning may be needed Attempts by the financially-troubled state of Sao Paulo to privatise or contract out public services have met with delays, legal constraints and opposition by the state government and its companies. But supporters of privatisation believe economic necessity will still force a radical change in infrastructure planning. They regard the state as ripe for development by private companies, sometimes in partnership with the public sector, and predict billions of dollars of private investment in projects over the coming decade. The belief stems from Sao Paulo's attraction as the wealthiest and most industrialised Brazilian state and the fact that the squeeze on public finances makes building new motorways, power plants and other infrastructure projects increasingly difficult for the state, which has a total debt of around Dollars 31bn and a budget deficit this year of 25 per cent. 'We are seeing a shift in the balance between public and private sector, with private companies being given more space,' says Mr Carlos Roberto Silvestrin, executive director of the Tiete-Parana Development Agency (ADTP) and a former commercial manager at Cesp, the state-controlled power generation company. The ADTP represents around 100 private and public sector companies interested in projects in the Tiete-Parana region. This includes six Brazilian states plus Paraguay and Bolivia, although projects are concentrated in the key market of Sao Paulo. The ADTP envisages development projects totalling Dollars 20bn by the end of the century, particularly in energy but also in motorways, railways and public sanitation. Much of the development is linked to plans for a gas pipeline between Bolivia and Sao Paulo. The pipeline plan foresees delivery of an initial 8m cubic metres of natural gas a day by 1997 to the Brazilian market, particularly Sao Paulo. But financing and final feasibility studies have still not been defined, although both sides hope to reach agreement by the middle of next year. Another important project is the opening to navigation of the Tiete and Parana rivers. Cesp, which draws hydro-electric power from both rivers, says it will complete the construction of locks along the waterway by the end of the year, making it navigable from the heart of Sao Paulo to the border with Paraguay and up to the Brazilian state of Goias. The ADTP believes the waterway will become a catalyst for development of light industry and will be helped by the Mercosul common market that starts on January 1. Private sector involvement will be especially important in energy projects, since Sao Paulo may encounter an 'energy deficit' by the end of the decade. Cesp estimates that it will need to increase its installed capacity, now about 10,000MW, by about 600MW a year to the end of the decade to cope with demand. 'It will be impossible for the public sector to pay for this expansion and the only alternative is to attract private investment,' says Mr Antonio Jose Zagatto, Cesp's planning and development manager. Although state-owned companies such as Cesp and the sanitation company Sabesp are involved in the ADTP venture, the state government's record in linking infrastructure projects to private investment has so far been disappointing, according to Mr Venilton Tadini, executive director of the Paulista Development Company. This was created in 1992 by Sao Paulo businessmen, with the support of the state government, to produce viability studies for public sector concessions. At the same time the state government passed a law allowing such concessions. 'We have worked on reports including prison privatisation and highway concessions but often very little has happened once we have sent them to the state,' says Mr Tadini, who blames opposition to privatisation among state officials and politicians. Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury, the state governor who leaves office at the end of the year, also blames internal opposition as well as the lack of a federal law on concessions. The only important result of Sao Paulo's 1992 law has been the beginning of tender processes for the concession of three stretches of motorway. Under these, private companies will be offered toll revenues for 20 or 25 years in return for maintaining the roads and building new stretches. As well as resistance to change among old guard officials, other factors that have so far restricted private involvement in infrastructure projects include Brazil's economic instability and high inflation, which last year hit 2,500 per cent, and the lack of a federal framework in areas such as private energy production. A federal government decree authorising independent power production (IPP) has been expected for months but so far not been issued. This measure is likely to allow private companies to build and operate power plants, selling the electricity to state-controlled distributors and, in special cases, directly to customers. Mr Joao Magalhaes president of the Brazilian subsidiary of US engineering company Bechtel, has been working on plans for an electricity station in Paulinia, Sao Paulo, for eight months, but says that uncertainties still include the lack of legislation and potential project finance problems. Brazil's lack of experience in non-recourse project finance, also known as 'stand alone' schemes, under which those undertaking to build a plant are not held liable by banks for delays or cost overruns, could prevent private and foreign companies taking on IPP schemes, says Mr Magalhaes. Under non-recourse financing, which was used for US independent power plants, banks make sure projects are watertight before giving loans. In Brazil projects often run into problems because loans are made for badly planned projects since the banks know they can recover their money from the building consortium whatever happens to the development of the project, he says. But in spite of the uncertainties Mr Magalhaes is convinced that sooner or later Sao Paulo will have to embrace private infrastructure projects such as IPP: 'The market is there, the big question is when it will all start happening. I just hope they don't wait until there's an energy crisis before taking action.' Mr Silvestrin, while accepting that progress in developing projects could have been quicker, argues a big change is occurring in Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole. The country's current economic stabilisation plan and the probable election as president of Mr Cardoso, as well as the increasing interest being shown by private and foreign companies projects, are all evidence of this, he says. 'We have even signed a memorandum of understanding between the ADTP and Mr Ron Brown, the US secretary of commerce, which shows the interest in Sao Paulo's potential,' he says.</p>

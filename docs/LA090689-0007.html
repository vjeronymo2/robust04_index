			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERVENING IN ULSTER  </P> <P> There is something about Ireland that makes politicians, particularly  Americans, take leave of their senses. Usually the results of these flights of  fancy are harmless or merely vulgar. Occasionally they are mischievous and,  potentially, dangerous.  </P> <P> Such is the case with the California Legislature's ill-considered passage of a  bill that would compel the state's public employee and teachers' pension funds  to ensure that the companies in which they invest conform to the so-called  MacBride Principles when doing business in Northern Ireland. All that stands  between this irresponsible and pointless gesture and the statute books is the  veto we believe Gov. George Deukmejian should exercise.  </P> <P> The measure at issue, AB 2443, was introduced by Democratic Assemblyman John  Burton of San Francisco. If signed, it would force the two retirement funds to  report yearly on what the companies in which they invest had done "toward the  achievement" of the nine points in the MacBride program.  </P> <P> That program takes its name from one of its authors, the late Irish statesman  and jurist, Sean MacBride, a Nobel Laureate, co-founder of Amnesty  International and one-time chief of staff of the Irish Republican Army. Some of  its principles are inarguably anti-discriminatory, others -- including those  that seem to demand quotas -- are illegal under British law, while at least one  -- a requirement that employers be responsible for their workers' security as  they travel to and from their jobs -- is patently silly.  </P> <P> For those reasons, none of the 25 U.S. firms operating in North Ireland has  agreed to sign the MacBride Principles, which are opposed not only by the  governments of Great Britain and the United States, but also by the Social  Democratic and Labor Party to which the majority of Ulster's Catholics belong.  Unlike the promoters of the Burton bill, they understand that the American  companies, which provide 11% of all Ulster's manufacturing jobs, are regarded  as the province's leaders in ensuring equal opportunity.  </P> <P> They also know that the burden of living up to the unworkable MacBride  guidelines could deter the job-creating foreign investment desperately needed  in Northern Ireland, where unemployment is more than 15%, and Catholic men are  more than twice as likely as Protestants to be jobless. Perhaps most important,  they know that the British government already has enacted a strict new  equal-opportunity law. The new statute was drafted in consultation with the  SDLP and the Irish government, and its implementation is to be monitored by  both Dublin and London under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  </P> <P> In Ulster itself, the only organized support for the MacBride Principles comes  from Sinn Fein, the political voice of the murderously anti-democratic IRA.  That is sort of company in which California will find itself unless Gov.  Deukmejian vetoes Burton's AB 2443.  </P></p>

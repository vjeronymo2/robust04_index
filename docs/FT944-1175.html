			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Chirac homes scheme warning Mr Herve de Charette, France's housing minister, yesterday warned Mr Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris and presidential candidate, that his call for compulsory requisitioning of vacant houses and flats for the capital's homeless would deter property investment. Instead he proposed to Prime Minister Edouard Balladur that the government pay special premiums to get landlords to let vacant properties and to housing associations to help the poor with rent. To dramatise the plight of the homeless at Christmas, the venerable Abbe Pierre, long-time champion of France's homeless, last weekend led a squat of a company-owned property in a smart Paris district, a move promptly exploited by Mr Chirac and his presidential rival, Mr Balladur.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, June 17 (CTK) -- The Visegrad Four countries  (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland) have set on  the best way to democracy and market economy, SPD [Social  Democratic Party of Germany] Chairman Rudolf Scharping told  today an SPD conference devoted to Western assistance to the  reform-minded states.    Scharping espoused President Vaclav Havel's statement that  these states should not be considered post-communist states any  longer and spoke in favor of their fastest possible joining the  European Union [EU].    It is important for Germany to establish a dense network of  contacts with the Eastern states and not to be confined only to  official political contacts, Scharping stressed. In connection  with this he criticized Helmut Kohl's cabinet and other Western  countries for their reluctant assistance to Central and East  European countries.    Scharping also criticized Kohl's cabinet for the way in  which  it was coming to terms with the compensation to the Nazi victims  in the Czech Republic and Germans expelled from Czechoslovakia  after World War Two. Havel's proposal to settle these issues  was "very generous," while Bonn "set it aside," Scharping said.    Scharping did not mention what proposal he had in mind. He  was probably referring to Havel's 1991 initiative which wanted  to grant Czechoslovak citizenship to Sudeten Germans, provided  they drop their property claims in their former homeland and  that Bonn acknowledges that the 1938 Munich accord was not valid  since the very beginning, and to Havel's later proposals to  compensate the Czech victims persecuted by the Nazi regime.    The Federal Government has never responded to the proposal,  Scharping stated. The unresolved problems in bilateral  relations are "the hotbed of new nationalism." "Nationalism is  something we need the least in Europe," he added.    SPD deputy Gernot Erler stressed that Germany had to strive  to eliminate the West's protectionist trade measures towards the  reform-minded countries.    He rejected the claim that given the present economic slump,  East European exports would threaten Western economic  development. The 1992 East European exports to the EU countries  made up only 4 percent of the total volume, which was about the  same as Norway's share, Erler reported.</p>

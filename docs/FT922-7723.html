			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Taxing an expatriate IN 1990, after being in full-time employment outside the UK continuously since 1973, I changed jobs. My new employment was also full-time outside the UK. My employer is based in the US but because my salary was denominated in sterling, I was paid in London by a UK subsidiary. Some time after starting work, I discovered that UK tax at 40 per cent had been deducted from my salary, together with national insurance contributions. I was told this was a legal requirement and that gross payments could not be made until a tax code had been issued. After six months my employer started to make the salary payments from an offshore subsidiary, without deductions. it took a further 11 months before I received a full refund of the tax deducted. 1) Was my employer correct that it was legally obliged to make the deductions? 2) Do I have any claim on the Revenue for interest on the sum refunded? 1) Yes, so far as we can tell from the bare facts. 2) No: successive Chancellors of the Exchequer since 1975 have refused to authorise the Inland Revenue to pay interest (repayment supplement, as it is called in the Taxes Acts) to nonresidents. You may like to write to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Treasury Chambers, Great George Street, London UK SW1P 3AG, setting out the bare facts briefly (including the name of the tax office and their reference number, and the name and address of the UK subsidiary), and ask how the discriminatory restriction of section 824(1)(a) of the Taxes Act to residents of the UK can be reconciled with the spirit of the Citizens Charter. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

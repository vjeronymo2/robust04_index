			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Deeper in debt - Student loans / The Budget and You Students will have to borrow more heavily to get through university - a consequence of the sharp rise in their numbers. The chancellor asked: 'Why should the bus driver or the pensioner pay higher taxes to finance the living costs of tomorrow's lawyers?' Grants, frozen in 1990 when student loans were introduced, will be cut by 10 per cent next year and by similar amounts for the next two years. Instead, the money available through the Student Loans Company will rise so the total funds available to students will rise by 4 per cent. For the 1994-95 academic year, the loan limit from the SLC will increase to Pounds 1,375 for students in London, Pounds 1,150 for those elsewhere and Pounds 915 for those living at home. The maximum maintenance grant for students in London will fall from Pounds 2,845 to Pounds 2,561. If the process of cutting the grant and increasing the loan continues as planned, by the beginning of the academic year in September 1996, the proportion of grant and loan for a student's living expenses will be roughly equal. The chancellor also cut the amount paid to universities for students' tuition, which may prompt some institutions to introduce tuition fees. The National Union of Students said the full grant and loan are often not enough to live on, obliging many students to borrow from a bank or parents instead. A Barclays survey found the average student had debts of about Pounds 1,670.</p>

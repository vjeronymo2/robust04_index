			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Size of UK theatrical business no justification for subsidies Sir, Mr Cameron Mackintosh (Personal View, October 14) protests too much about the virtues of subsidies to the arts and the evil effects of their reduction. The size of the British theatrical business and the revenue earned from subsidised productions are not justifications for subsidy. Every business in Britain could claim that it would perform better if it had more aid from the government: but who would then finance the subsidies? And experience of other industries suggests that subsidies reduce rather than increase efficiency - improvements in which are the source of economic growth. Any economic benefits from the theatrical business are likely to be local; theatres may attract visitors to one place rather than to another. That is one reason why I suggest that any subsidies should result from local decisions, not come from central government (Personal View, September 30). It is not surprising that talented artists and entrepreneurs have gravitated towards the cheapest and most abundant source of funds, the subsidised sector, or that unsubsidised theatres show productions which have, to varying degrees, had their costs reduced by subsidies. But it is improbable that all the talent in the subsidised sector was drawn to the theatre by subsidies, or that it would all leave the theatre if subsidies were withdrawn. The British theatre managed to attract quite a lot of talent before it first received subsidies in the 1940s, and there is a much richer and better-educated public to support it now. The present strength of the British theatre must be at least partly attributable to this increasing wealth and sophistication of its audience, which is also the strongest guarantee of its future health. If educational standards and incomes continue to rise, the market for the arts will continue to grow - and the case for national subsidies will become progressively weaker. I believe that the government should promote knowledge of the arts through the educational system, so more people can appreciate them. It is not just high-profile theatres that attract upper-class audiences, as Mr Mackintosh suggested. A survey of audiences in Glasgow, Merseyside and Ipswich in 1985 found that 73 per cent came from social groups A, B and C1, although they formed about 33 per cent of the population. A reduction in subsidies might reduce the profitability of new productions, so their number and cost would be reduced, and producers would seek a larger audience for each play. The earnings of those concerned with production might fall; but their incomes do not deserve taxpayer support. Any reduction in choice seems unlikely to reduce the audience significantly, because theatre-goers on average attend only two or three performances a year. Loss of national subsidies should not be the disaster Mr Mackintosh believes. David Sawers, Crosby, 10 Seaview Avenue, Angmering-on-Sea, Littlehampton, West Sussex BN16 1PP</p>

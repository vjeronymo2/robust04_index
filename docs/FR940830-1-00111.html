			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is also proposing that 7 CFR 273.7(d)(1)(ii)(A) be amended by removing the current $160 cap on dependent care reimbursements. Instead, State agencies would reimburse participants in the E&amp;T program for dependent care expenses up to the actual cost of dependent care, the local market rate, or the statewide limit, whichever is lowest. Fifty percent Federal funding will continue to be available to State agencies for the actual cost of dependent care up to the local market rate or the statewide limit, whichever is lower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proration of Benefits_7 CFR 273.10(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.10(a)(2) require that if an application for recertification is submitted after a household's certification period has expired, the application shall be considered an initial application and the household's benefits for the first month shall be prorated in accordance with 7 CFR 273.10(a)(1)(ii). Section 13916 of the 1993 Leland Act amended Section 8(c)(2)(B) of the Food Stamp Act, 7 U.S.C. 2017(c)(2)(B), to eliminate proration of first month's benefits if a household is recertified for food stamps after a break in participation of less than one month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.10(a)(1)(ii) require that a household's benefit level for the initial month of certification be based on the day of the month it applies for benefits and that the household receive benefits from the date of application to the end of the month. Prior to the enactment of the 1993 Leland Act, ``initial month of certification'' referred to the first month for which an allotment is issued to a household following any period in which such household was not participating in the Food Stamp Program. Section 13916 of the 1993 Leland Act, however, revised the definition of ``initial month'' to now mean the first month for which an allotment is issued to a household following any period of more than one month in which such household was not participating in the Food Stamp Program. Therefore, if a household reapplies for benefits after a break in participation of less than one month, that month of application is not considered an initial month, and the household's benefits for that month cannot be prorated. Current regulations already prohibit the proration of first month's benefits for migrant and seasonal farmworker households that apply for benefits within 30 days following the end of their last certification period. The Department is proposing to revise 7 CFR 273.10(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(i) to prohibit the proration of first month's benefits for all households that apply for benefits after a break in participation of less than one month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is also proposing to remove from the regulations paragraphs (a)(2) (ii) and (iii) of 7 CFR 273.10. Both provisions, which prohibit proration in the first month of a household's new certification period, have been made moot by Section 13916 of the 1993 Leland Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 13971 of the Leland Act requires implementation of the provisions contained in this proposed rule on September 1, 1994. Therefore, we are proposing that the amendments made by this rule be effective and implemented on September 1, 1994. State agencies would be required to adjust the cases of ongoing households at the next recertification, at household request, or when the case is next reviewed, whichever comes first, and provide restored benefits back to the required implementation date. If for any reason a State agency fails to implement on the required date, restored benefits shall be provided, if appropriate, back to the required implementation date or the date of application, whichever is later. Variances resulting from implementation of the provisions of the final rule would be excluded from error analysis for 120 days from the required implementation date, in accordance with section 13951 of the Leland Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 271  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Food stamps, Grant programs-social programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 273  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedures, Aliens, Claims, Food stamps, Grant programs-social programs, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Social security, Students.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, 7 CFR Parts 271 and 273 are proposed to be amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

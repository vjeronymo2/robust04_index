			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP / ROCK  </P> <P> New Band Aid Version: Pop stars have finished a new version of the 1984 hit  song "Do They Know It's Christmas?" to raise money for African famine victims.  More than a dozen singers worked into the early hours Monday to remake the Band  Aid song that topped the charts at Christmas, 1984, organizers said. The  participating artists included Tina Turner, Cliff Richard, Chris Rea,  Bananarama, Jason Donovan and Tears for Fears. The original record raised some  $10 million for starving Africans and spawned the transatlantic Live Aid rock  extravaganza on July 13, 1985, which brought in more than $100 million.  Producer Peter Waterman got involved last week when he was approached by Irish  rocker Bob Geldof, who conceived the 1984 single. Waterman said he will  consider a Live Aid II next year. The new single is expected to go on sale Dec.  11. DANIEL CERONE and SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares slip as big investors hold fire THE record-breaking run by UK equities, that has seen the FT-SE 100 Index move up by around 5 per cent since the start of the month, stalled yesterday as the big domestic and international institutions held back from pushing more cash into a market seen by many observers as having run too far too fast. 'The big funds are holding off until there is a much clearer picture about a rate cut in the UK,' said one institutional salesman. He said the market had virtually factored in a one percentage point cut in domestic interest rates, but was uncertain about how the authorities would implement such a reduction. A rather untidy session in the UK equity market saw share prices come off sharply as the second half of the two-week trading account got underway. The FT-SE 100 ended one of the quietest sessions in the past two weeks 14.2 lower at 3,184.8. The lack of direction in the second liners was emphasised by the performance of the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which finished the day unchanged at 3,547.0. Official turnover levels published by the Stock Exchange emphasised the contraction in the levels of activity around the market yesterday. Turnover was put at 482.6m shares, the lowest daily level for two weeks amd a good 10 per cent below recent average levels of business, which has often topped 700m shares daily. Turnover in non-Footsie stocks yesterday topped 300m shares, dwarfing business in the leaders. The value of customer business in the market last Friday reached Pounds 1.645bn, at the top end of the recent range of activity in the market and a strong indication, dealers said, that UK and overseas funds had continued to pump money into the market. The lack of impetus in the market was evident from the outset of trading, with sentiment said to have been undermined by Wall Street's failure to establish new closing highs last Friday, despite a powerful opening performance. The FT-SE 100 kicked off almost four points lower and stayed in negative territory all day, with small flurries of selling plus weakness induced by pressure on the Footsie future, driving the 100 index down to a low point of 3,176.2 in mid-morning. A lacklustre opening by Wall Street, unsettled by another uninspiring performance by the US bond market, did little to underpin sentiment in London, although a minor bout of short covering helped prices stabilise at the close. Leading dealings around the top UK securities houses were not surprised at the downturn in the market. 'There has been no real downside pressure, and turnover was by no means substantial,' said one trader. 'We still feel okay, although there is still some profit-taking to come in this market.' He stressed, however, that the underlying feel to the market was sound. There is evidence of a sharp increase in unit trust sales which is bound to impact on the market, said a senior salesman at one of the European banks. He took the view that much of the big fund raising activity via rights issues, had already been carried out. International funds were said to have been instrumental in driving bank stocks sharply lower yesterday, and were said to have been aggressive sellers of drug stocks.</p>

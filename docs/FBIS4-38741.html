			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Phone-in interview with Supreme Soviet Chairman Myacheslaw </F> Hryb by ZVYAZDA readers: "Our Diligent and Hard-Working People  Should Not Live Poor Lives"]    [Excerpts] [Reader from Minsk] One often reads and hears  that Belarus owes large sums to foreign states in the near and  far abroad, and that we are living at the expense of our  children. What is the actual state of things? Official data  are not published anywhere.    [Hryb] According to Finance Minister Yanchuk, the foreign  debt of Belarus, excluding interest, amounted to $1022.2 million  as of 1 April 1994. Taking into account interest, our debt  reaches $1288.5 million. The Supreme Soviet adopted a  resolution on 26 February 1994, determining the ceiling of the  debt at $2 billion. Aside from this, the issue of mutual debts  among former Soviet republics remains unresolved. According to  National Bank estimates, other republics owe us 25830.1 million  Belarusian rubles. However, these issues have not been  confirmed by appropriate commitments. Is this a lot or a  little? The world practice uses the system of foreign debt  evaluation. Its primary characteristic is the correlation  between the sum of the foreign debt, the GNP, and yearly export  revenues. When correlation between foreign debt and the GNP  amounts to 50 percent, the situation is believed to be critical.  If our foreign debt reached $2 billion, this figure would still  be 29 percent, while in Bulgaria it is 111, in Poland 54, in  Hungary 65, and in Turkey 51 percent respectively. If we  compare the correlation between our foreign debt and export  revenues, where 257 percent is considered to be the critical  figure, it is currently only 37 percent, while in Bulgaria it is  203, in Hungary -- 157, in Poland -- 301, and in Turkey -- 193  percent respectively. Thus, the facts testify to the  contrary.[passage omitted]    [Reader from Minsk] Do you think that the dismissal of  former Ministers Uladzimir Yahoraw and Eduard Shirkowski was  just? If this is not a secret, how did you personally vote?    [Hryb] The decision to dismiss those two ministers was made  by the Supreme Soviet and not me personally. However both  violated the laws of the Republic of Belarus on the procedure of  detaining foreign citizens on our territory and extraditing  foreign and Belarusian citizens. This had been done many times.  We had warned the ministers but the latter did not draw any  conclusions. Thus they received what they deserved. [passage  omitted]    [Reader from Vitebsk] As the Supreme Soviet chairman, do you  consider yourself the guarantor of the observance of the  Belarusian Constitution? Why were certain articles of the  Constitution violated when the treaty on the unification of  Belarusian and Russian monetary systems was being signed? Why  did the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers remain  silent? Why has Kebich not yet been sued?    [Hryb] As the Supreme Soviet chairman I have done everything  in my power to guarantee the protection and observance of the  basic law of Belarus. The Supreme Soviet did not discuss the  issue of the unification; it was not on the agenda. The  agreement can become valid only following a ratification by the  legislature. The Belarusian Prosecutor's Office has  investigated whether the prime minister violated the Belarusian  Constitution while signing the agreement. The case was closed  because of a lack of corpus delicti.[passage omitted]    [Reader from Minsk] Whom will we be electing -- a president  or a governor general? After we have surrendered our National  Bank and currency to Moscow, we will surrender our sovereignty  too. This is evident. My second question is: Where does  Kebich take money for all kinds of compensations, allowances,  and the like? Who is financing his electoral campaign?    [Hryb] The Supreme Soviet and I have already stated that we  do not promote any of the candidates. It is each person's  personal business for whom to vote. On the other hand, the  money earmarked for the electoral campaign was equally divided  among the candidates. In the event of any embezzlements, the  Central Electoral Commission will sort things out.[passage  omitted]    [Reader from Minsk] I am worried and even enraged with the  way signatures in support of Kebich were collected. Collective  farm managers, village soviet chairmen, and all other empowered  people scared people into signing the lists. Can these facts be  investigated and those guilty punished? I am afraid that this  may continue during the course of the elections -- there might  be all kinds of fraud, pressure, or even unregistered  ballot-boxes....    [Hryb] We have requested that Central Electoral Commission  Chairman A. Abramovich investigate these facts.[passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Investors 'avoiding cheap-labour states' FOREIGN investors are no longer hunting for cheap labour in developing countries - they want big markets, quality infrastructure and high skill levels, according to the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private lending arm. Strongest growth in private investment has occurred in Chile, Papua New Guinea and Thailand over the five years from 1986 to 1990, the study shows. All three countries saw private investment more than doubled. The strongest magnets for foreign direct investment are also countries with high savings, the IFC says in its third annual study of trends in private investment in developing countries. 'Most of the countries whose savings ratios improved, typically by virtue of cuts in the public sector deficit, show a strong investment response by the private sector,' it says. Foreign investment has grown in the past decade, now accounting for 10 per cent of all private investment in the 40 developing countries examined. Low labour costs 'have been of diminishing importance', largely because they account for a dwindling share of overall manufacturing costs, on average 10-15 per cent. 'Foreign investors are strongly influenced by structural factors such as market size, the quality of infrastructure, the level of industrialisation and the size of the existing stock of foreign investment,' the report adds. Foreign investors display a 'herd' mentality in following where others have invested. This is partly because the presence of other foreign companies raises the likelihood of reliable suppliers and a pool of trained labour. Political risk has not deterred investors where returns are sufficiently high.</p>

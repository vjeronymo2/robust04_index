			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 5 (AFP) -- PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat has  agreed to drop the title "president of Palestine" when he enters  the self-rule regions of Jericho and the Gaza Strip.    According to a letter annexed to the Cairo accord on the  launch of self-rule signed Wednesday, he will use the title  "Chairman (Ra'is in Arabic) of the Palestinian Authority" to run  Gaza and Jericho.    The Palestinians have referred to 'Arafat as president of  Palestine since a session of their parliament-in-exile in  Algiers in 1988.    But the letter, a copy of which AFP received here on  Thursday  [5 May], allows the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman  to use the Arabic title "Ra'is" which also means president.    Also in the letter from Arafat addressed to Israel's Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, a co-signatory of the accord, the PLO  agrees to inform the Israeli government of the names of the  Palestinian Authority.    In Israel, the head of the government press office Uri Dromi  on Thursday quoted Rabin as telling 'Arafat in Cairo to stop  globe-trotting and "get prepared for serious things."</p>

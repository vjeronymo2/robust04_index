			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (4): Monetary brakes applied - Finance Government deregulation has changed the shape of Jamaica's financial system, and made it a growing sector of an overall sluggish economy. Rapid inflation has reinforced the trend. But the shift last year to high real interest rates has been making the environment tougher for many financial institutions. Even before the government applied the monetary brakes, slow growth in the economy as a whole was taking its toll and competition was intensifying. The financial sector grew only 4.2 per cent in 1992, the last year for which figures are available, after double digit growth every year since 1987. Financial services grew because of liberalisation of the Jamaican economy, which started as long ago as 1986. Growth in the early years was spectacular. 'Now that the market is becoming less protected and more competitive, margins are narrowing,' says Mr Delroy Lindsay, chairman and chief executive of the Corporate Group, a financial holding company. For banks, in particular, times have got tougher. Mr Charles Ross, executive director of Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica, says: 'High interest rates have put the financial system under a fair amount of strain. Banks have been accustomed to a fairly accommodating stance from the Bank of Jamaica. Now with penal interest rates on overdrafts at the Bank of Jamaica  -on overdrafts for over three days, rates are 120 per cent - they have to manage their liquidity very closely.' Mr Jacques Bussieres, the Canadian governor of the central bank, says the Bank of Jamaica has been slightly more accommodating since the new year, but with nominal interest rates still above 50 per cent, there is little real evidence that pressure is easing. Bankers admit that high interest rates put pressure on some of their borrowers, but there is no sense that any bank is in trouble. The Bank of Jamaica's powers of regulation and supervision were substantially increased under a law passed in December 1992. Banks have been helped by the very generous margins which have provided a cushion for these harder times. They have also been assisted, says Mr Paul Chen-Young, executive chairman of the Eagle Merchant Bank group of 16 companies, by those savers slow in moving their funds out of low-yielding savings accounts. Banks are paying 15-18 per cent on savings deposits with inflation at 30 per cent and treasury bills at 50-52 per cent. There is some JDollars 17bn in such savings accounts, which, in effect, means a transfer of resources to banks from individual savers of about JDollars 2.5bn a year. But there is a widespread view that further mergers in the banking system are likely. The merger of the largest bank, National Commercial, and the third largest, Mutual Security, may have set this trend under way. 'Eleven commercial banks and 40 merchant banks seems a bit excessive for a country with 2.5m people,' says Mr Lindsay. Nonetheless, the large Jamaican population overseas, which remits home (it is estimated) anywhere between Dollars 250m and Dollars 400m a year, may help sustain a larger financial system than would otherwise be warranted. Overseas and foreign currency business is becoming an increasingly important part of the business of Jamaican financial services companies. Since the liberalisation of the foreign exchange laws, funds held in foreign currency accounts in Jamaican banks have grown to USDollars 500m. Many of these accounts - paying interest rates of 6 to 8 per cent - are held by Jamaicans resident in the US. There are, says Mr Chen-Young, 'a lot of Miami addresses' on these accounts. Having access to dollars allows the banks to provide trade finance without having to obtain lines of credit from overseas, and permits direct lending to exporters in dollars. The banks have had to place 25 per cent (now coming down to 22 per cent) of these funds on deposit with the central bank, a factor which has helped the country's net international reserves to turn positive for the first time in years. To encourage longer term flows, the central bank has decided that foreign currency deposits of longer than 366 days will not attract reserves requirements. The moves overseas by financial groups have been helped by an improving perception of Jamaican risk in the international financial market. Whereas Jamaican commercial bank debt traded around 35 per cent of face value in 1987, it now trades at over 80 per cent in the secondary market. A commercial paper market is growing which, if it continues, will tend to deprive banks of some better quality borrowers. A housing finance market is in place, although high interest rates obviously deter borrowers. The insurance business is growing, although stagnation in the economy has meant that the pension fund business has been slow. Yet while mechanisms are in place to provide long term finance in local currency and to underwrite share issues, it will not do so again until inflation falls substantially - along with interest rates.</p>

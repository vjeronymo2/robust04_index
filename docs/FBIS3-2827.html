At the ongoing NPC annual session, deputies today continued  to discuss the government work report delivered by Premier Li  Peng.    Speaking to deputies from Hebei Province, Premier Li  expressed the hope that Hebei, a major grain and cotton producer  in China, will pay particular attention to the expansion of a  water-efficient farming sector, the promotion of scientific  farming and development of a diversified economy on the basis of  increased grain and cotton production.    Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, listened  to  several deputies from China's most populous province of Sichuan  speaking on agricultural production.    He said that Sichuan has a great potential for expanding the  farming sector, with large areas of mountainous and hilly  region, plains and a large rural workforce.    He said that Sichuan should vigorously expand production of  cash crops in hilly regions and pursue a diversified economy.    State Councillor Chen Junsheng also urged Sichuan Provincial  authorities to readjust the province's agriculture structure on  the basis of stabilizing grain production.    Speaking to deputies from Jiangxi Province, Vice-Premier Zhu  Rongji repeatedly emphasized the importance of agriculture and  grain production.    He expressed the hope that Jiangxi officials and people will  try to step up agricultural production in a bid to promote  economic growth and social stability.    Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee,  delivered a speech on agriculture to NPC deputies from Jilin  Province, the largest commodity grain producer in China. Jilin  harvested 15 million tons of grain in 1993.    According to Tian, agricultural development, rural  prosperity  and the rising income of farmers are essential to the success in  deepening reforms, opening China wider to the rest of the world,  promoting economic development and maintaining social stability.    He made the following proposals to expand agriculture  production:    -- Taking the road of seeking high yields, and improving the  product quality and farming efficiency;    -- Achieving an all-round development in farming, forestry,  animal husbandry, sideline production and fisheries;    -- Vigrously expanding rural industries to increase farmers'  incomes; and    -- Pushing farm products onto the market and encouraging  farmers to become involved in commodity circulation.    Speaking to deputies from Inner Mongolia, Vice-Premier Li  Lanqing said that China must rely on its own efforts to feed its  huge population.    "So long as we ensure a sufficient supply of grain,  vegetables and other daily necessities and keep prices under  control, our society will be stable," he said.    State Councillor Li Tieying and Wen Jiabao, an alternate  member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party  Central Committee, also spoke of the importance of agriculture  to deputies from Gansu Province.    Li Tieying, who is also the minister in charge of the State  Commission for Restructuring the Economy, said that agriculture  serves as the basis for Gansu to achieve a sustained and rapid  economic growth and narrow the gap between it and developed  areas in eastern China.    Wen Jiabao, who is also a member of the secretariat of the  party central committee, stressed the need to maintain a  sustained increase in grain production by stabilizing the  acreage sown to grain crops and pursuing a diversified rural  economy.    Where possible, it is necessary to expand the acreage sown  to  cotton, plant more fruit trees and develop livestock breeding,  he said.</p>

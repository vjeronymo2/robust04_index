			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / 'Safe' leader to replace Craxi A BITTERLY divided Socialist Party yesterday chose Mr Giorgio Benvenuto, a former trade union leader, as a compromise candidate to become secretary-general following the resignation on Thursday of Mr Bettino Craxi. The choice of the dour 55-year-old Mr Benvenuto underlined the turmoil in the party as a result of poor performance at the polls and damage caused by the Milan corruption scandal. Mr Benvenuto, for 14 years leader of the UIL, the Socialist-controlled trade union confederation, emerged as a possible successor to Mr Craxi earlier this month. According to party insiders, he was chosen as a 'safe pair of hands', winning out against Mr Valdo Spini, a 47 year-old protestant intellectual on the left of the party. Mr Benvenuto got 306 votes against 223 for Mr Spini, with 14 other votes either invalid or blank. Mr Spini lost out because he came from a minority faction and his opponents considered him likely to take an active part in redefining the party's role. In contrast Mr Benvenuto is not expected to impose his own views so strongly on the party. His chief virtue is his proven integrity and honesty. Coming from a middle class family near Naples (his father was an admiral), Mr Benevenuto studied law but on graduating joined the trade union movement through the UIL and remained there until 18 months ago, earning the reputation of a dogged but moderate negotiator. Latterly he has been working in a specially created post of director general in the finance ministry, helping to propagandise tax reforms. Mr Craxi was obliged to step down after having lost the confidence of the party and when he faced six warrants from Milan magistrates advising him he was under investigation for alleged corruption. The election was also conditioned both by the refusal of Mr Giuliano Amato to mix the office of prime minister with the party leadership, and by Wednesday's resignation of Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister, once considered the front-runner. The Socialists got 5.3m votes, 13 per cent of the total, in last April's elections. But since then, on the basis of municipal polls, the percentage has slipped to below 10 per cent, and it has lost many paid-up members. Mr Amato last night announced that Mr Giovanni Conso, a distinguished judge and a leading criminal law expert, had been appointed justice minister to replace Mr Martelli.

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> U-TURN OPENS WAY TO FOREIGN INVESTORS;  </P> <P> ZIMBABWE SHIFTS AWAY FROM SOCIALISM  </P> <P> Zimbabwe has made a U-turn on the road to socialism set out by President Robert  Mugabe and is opening the way to foreign investors, a Cabinet official said.  </P> <P> "Even dreaming of socialism is a non-starter," Hebert Ushewokunze, the minister  of political affairs, told businessmen assembled here recently. "We won't see  true socialism here. Nor will our children."  </P> <P> Mugabe came to power after independence from Britain in 1980 vowing to lead the  former colony of Rhodesia on a Marxist-Leninist path, and his government  introduced sweeping social and economic changes.  </P> <P> Those changes included cheap schooling, free health care, price controls on a  broad range of commodities and stringent, protective labor laws that critics  said promoted inefficiency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mixed Economy  </P> <P> But Mugabe had inherited a mixed capitalist-style economy that has remained  largely in the hands of a 100,000-member white minority that favors the free  enterprise system.  </P> <P> For years, government and the business community coexisted uneasily. All the  while, the economy stagnated and unemployment increased.  </P> <P> Next year, experts say, about 300,000 students will leave school and enter an  economy that is producing only 7,000 new jobs a year. Unemployed voters will  outnumber employed voters 3 to 1 in the 1990 parliamentary election.  </P> <P> So in May, after months of speculation that something of the sort was coming,  Mugabe announced a new investment code.  </P> <P> It was expounded by Ushewokunze to the businessmen in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's  second largest city after Harare, the capital formerly called Salisbury.  </P> <P> "We have lifted the lid by inviting external investors," he said. "I don't see  this investment atmosphere as conducive to the goals of a socialist state."  </P> <P> The investment code, Zimbabwe's first, has brought a mixed reaction. Many  businessmen say it is too little, too late, while radical students and others  have condemned it as a sell-out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Professor Detained  </P> <P> On June 9, Kempton Makamure, a university professor and an outspoken Marxist  ideologue, was detained by police for questioning after criticizing the code on  state radio as a violation of socialist principles. Two journalists involved in  the broadcast were suspended.  </P> <P> While Makamure and his disciples think the code strays too far from socialist  philosophy, a great many businessmen believe it doesn't go far enough.  </P> <P> "We have been given a bone, but there's not enough meat on it," said Arthur  Chapman, a business executive in Harare.  </P> <P> A black entrepreneur, who requested anonymity, said the state's ideological  dilemma created an investment policy that "was not dramatic enough to attract  the high rollers we really need."  </P> <P> The code allows foreigners to hold 25% of the share value of new investments,  up from 15%. It also permits them to send 25% to 100% of their profits to home  offices in hard currencies, depending on the type and priority of the  investment.  </P> <P> Mugabe also pledged less state interference in business affairs and set up a  "one-stop center" to approve investment applications within a maximum of 90  days. He also proposed lifting most price controls, scrapping fixed wages in  favor of collective bargaining and liberalizing labor laws.  </P> <P> In the past, an employer had to have Labor Department approval to fire any  worker, and most such applications were turned down.  </P> <P> "We are not neocolonialists looking for vast hard currency returns," said one  Western investment expert, speaking on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> "What we want is a strong economy we can do business with. Zimbabwe has not  made the quantum leap, but they've made a start."  </P></p>

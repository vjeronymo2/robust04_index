			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NORTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> 4.4 AFTERSHOCK RATTLES BAY AREA  </P> <P> An aftershock of the devastating Oct. 17 earthquake jolted Northern California  from San Francisco Bay to Watsonville. The magnitude 4.4 aftershock was felt in  San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Watsonville. There were no immediate reports of  damage or injuries. "It rattled pretty good at first and then kept on kind of  rolling. You could feel the foundation swaying," said Watsonville resident Ani  LeRitz-Murphy. "It's been the second longest one we've had since the big  quake." The aftershock at 9:50 p.m. Wednesday was centered slightly north of  the epicenter of the magnitude 7.1 main temblor, according to the U.S.  Geological Survey in Menlo Park. Of the thousands of aftershocks, 84 have  measured at least magnitude 3.0, and 21 registered magnitude 4.0 or greater.  The strongest was 5.2, just 37 minutes after the initial jolt.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by 'Adi Talmor, </F> at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem on 25 March; from  the weekly "In the Current Situation" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Talmor] Good day and a happy Passover to Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.    [Rabin] Good day and a happy holiday to all the Israeli  people.    [Talmor] Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad is undoubtedly no  al-Sadat or Mubarak. Are you convinced that he really seeks a  full peace agreement with Israel or is he just pretending to  want peace in order to secure U.S. economic aid?    [Rabin] First of all, it is my pleasant duty to recall the  past 15 years, which have proven that it is possible to achieve  a lasting peace with a large, leading Arab country like Egypt  even in a region as turbulent as the Middle East. I telephoned  Egyptian President Mubarak yesterday. I expressed my  appreciation and gratitude to Egypt for signing the peace  agreement and for proving its ability to adhere to it. The  Egyptian president said he was happy that I called and said that  Egypt and Israel had set an example on how to overcome past  hatreds and build a viable peace. Mubarak expressed the hope at  this stage that Israel and the other countries engaged in the  peace process would attain the same accomplishment.    I hope and believe, in light of the fact that the talks in  Cairo ended yesterday on a positive note and will resume in  Cairo next Tuesday [29 March], that we will first of all  overcome the issue of security arrangements for the Palestinians  in Hebron and then of course continue the negotiations to reach  agreement on the implementation of Gaza-Jericho First, in order  to show the world that it is possible to reach agreements and to  implement them. I hope that the agreement's implementation will  help change facts on the ground, at least in those areas where  it will take effect in the initial stage. I therefore have  faith in the future.    Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon have already agreed to resume the  Washington talks at the end of April. I also believe that the  talks will take a somewhat different form. There will no longer  be algebraic-like formulas defining what constitutes peace and  what constitutes withdrawal, but rather a far more comprehensive  view of peace and withdrawal as packages, withdrawal in stages  without committing oneself to a final line, and of course  security arrangements and the subsequent U.S. aid.    [Talmor] You may have your faith, Sir, but in south Lebanon  only this week there were serious terrorist attacks in which  Katyusha rockets were fired at Israel. The same al-Asad you pin  so many hopes on was supposed to stop this.    [Rabin] There is no doubt that just as you mentioned  earlier, al-Asad is no al-Sadat. Al-Asad has a different  approach which makes progress in the peace process more  difficult. The State of Israel and its people are democratic.  The Israeli public has to be convinced that the Arab leader it  is negotiating with really means peace and is willing to hold  public meetings at the most senior levels....    [Talmor, interrupting] And this is not happening.    [Rabin] At this stage of the negotiations with Syria, only  relatively low-level contacts have been held. If this does not  change at some stage -- if higher-level contacts are not held,  if the Syrian media does not show greater openness, if Syrian  leaders do not issue clearer public statements on their  intention to reach peace -- it will be very difficult to make  progress in the negotiations. Clearly, and as a further  projection of this, Syria also has the capability to keep things  quiet along Israel's northern border.    [Talmor] Why did Israel not come out with a more vigorous  and aggressive reaction to this week's Katyusha attacks against  the Israeli border and even against areas inside Israel?    [Rabin] First of all, we did react. Last week's Katyusha  firing was an exception because there are understandings which  are basically kept. According to these understandings, no  Katyushas are to be fired at Israel's northern border  settlements.    [Talmor] But the Katyushas could have fallen on Israeli  settlements?    [Rabin] Nothing can be hermetically sealed. In general, the  residents of the northern settlements along the Lebanese border  live in greater security and tranquility today than they did  before July 1993. I am sure that this Passover, tens of  thousands of Israelis will safely spend their holiday in the  Galilee.    [Talmor] Mr. Rabin, you mentioned the telephone conversation  you held with President Mubarak to mark 15 years of peace. Does  Mubarak's regime appear stable from Jerusalem's perspective. Is  there no danger of an Islamic revolution similar to the one  which swept Iran?    [Rabin] I think that the Egyptian reality is completely  different than that of Iran although a terroristic, radical,  Islamic movement exists there as well. I believe that the  majority of the Egyptian people support President Mubarak's  regime, would like to see continued economic development, and do  not exhibit any leaning toward the Iranian brand of  nationalistic or religious-nationalistic extremism. Terrorist  attacks are carried out here and there. That, regrettably, is a  part of Arab society and the Islamic world. Terrorism is a fact  of life in most of the neighboring countries as well as in more  distant ones.    I have confidence in the strength of President Mubarak's  government and have no doubt that he adheres to his  comprehensive policy of both encouraging peace and extending  Egypt's assistance to Israel and to its Arab interlocutors in  reaching peace. We see this for a fact: most of the recent  contacts have taken place in Cairo or at other Egyptian  locations.    [Talmor] This interview is taking place immediately  following the return of the Israeli delegation from Cairo. Now  that you have been briefed and held consultations, can you tell  us what the Palestinians will ultimately receive in return for  their agreement to continue the talks in Cairo next Tuesday?  Will Hebron be awarded an almost equal status to that of  Jericho and Gaza?    [Rabin] No, Hebron will not be given a similar status to  neither Gaza nor Jericho. Nevertheless, I cannot ignore the  horrendous massacre which took place at the Cave of the  Patriarchs. I cannot ignore the fact that we have been keeping  Hebron under curfew for almost one month in order to prevent  friction between the approximately 120,000 Arab residents of  Hebron and the 415 Israeli Jews who live there, whether as  permanent residents or as students at the Shavey Hebron Yeshiva.  This state of affairs is unacceptable and I am talking as a Jew  and an Israeli. It is totally unacceptable that the  Palestinians be the ones to suffer on account of this despicable  massacre, which was committed by a Jewish criminal. At the same  time, I want to make sure that the war against the enemies of  peace, such as Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the  Islamic Jihad, will continue full blast. Even while our  delegation was sitting down with the PLO representatives in  Cairo, we did not hesitate to carry out an operation which led  to the elimination of at least three Hamas terrorists who had  participated in the murder of Jews and were continuing to plan  additional murders.    We will guarantee the security of the Israelis living in  Hebron but it is difficult to explain to the world and to  ourselves why the burden for this despicable massacre in the  Cave of the Patriarchs should fall, and has fallen for the past  month, on the 100,000 Arab residents of Hebron. Therefore, we  must offer reasonable security arrangements for the Palestinian  residents of Hebron. We agreed to a temporary international  presence in Hebron, which will help the town return to normal  life and report to the Palestinian-Israeli liaison committee,  the mayor, and to the military governor.    [Talmor] Do you not fear that Hebron may set a precedent  for subsequent Palestinian demands in Nabulus and other cities?    [Rabin] I believe that what happened in the Cave of the  Patriarchs was really a despicable, murderous, aberration, which  will not be repeated. Therefore, there will be no need for such  a precedent.    [Talmor] Is Israel still considering moving all the Jewish  settlers in Hebron to one location or perhaps even evacuating  the Jews from the town?    [Rabin] I do not think that at this stage we, or at least I,  have any intention of evacuating the Jews living in Hebron. All  the rest is not an issue for public statements. This is an  Israeli decision which should not fall within the framework of  returning life to normal in Hebron or resuming the negotiations  on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement.    [Talmor] Any discussion of the Hebron massacre inevitably  leads us to the state commission of inquiry investigating it.  In your opinion, Mr. Rabin, how has the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] and the defense establishment portrayed themselves so  far in the state commission's hearings?    [Rabin] At this stage, I do not intend to discuss issues  being discussed in detail by the commission. A state  commission, made up of distinguished and experienced people, has  been established, and I am sure that it will do the kind of job  expected from such a commission and present its recommendations  to the government. Then I will be able to comment. Right now,  I would like to merely state in general that the IDF is the  sovereign body in the territories on behalf of the Israeli  Government. Ever since the inception of the intifadah, the IDF  has been facing challenges it never had to face before. Seven  years have passed and it has learned to handle these challenges.  It has had to enforce law and order under the special  circumstances of a civil uprising by the Palestinians in the  territories against the Army. This is not an easy task.  Elsewhere in the world, armies are not usually employed for  this kind of job, which is mainly police work in addition to  confronting terrorist squads. I do not believe that any other  army in the world would have met this challenge while retaining  its moral caliber, the values of the IDF, and the authentic  values of the Jewish people -- not those of the murderer from  Qiryat Arba'. I admit that mistakes have been made and mishaps  have occurred. I am talking about widespread activities, day  and night, 365 days a year for over seven years. Hundreds of  thousands of IDF soldiers have served dutifully despite all the  difficulties. I have nothing but praise for the IDF.    [Talmor] Sir, you are probably aware that the public  believes that the commission could ultimately find you, as  defense minister, responsible for what happened in Hebron and  perhaps even topple the government.    [Rabin] As prime minister and defense minister I bear  ministerial responsibility for whatever happens in the framework  of my duties. I am talking about responsibility in the correct  sense of the word. I am not responsible for every slip-up by a  sentry, battalion commander, or even brigade commander -- if the  appropriate orders had indeed been issued in a timely fashion.  Not everything falls under the framework of collective  responsibility and I believe that what you described earlier  will not come to pass.    (Talmor] Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister,  thank you very much and a happy holiday.    [Rabin] Happy holidays. I would like to use this  opportunity to express my thanks, appreciation, and holiday  greetings to the IDF soldiers, the Border Police, the Israeli  police, and to all those who guarantee the security of Israel's  civilians.</p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Letter From Berlin: Together again underground Snow was falling fast, but Mrs Erike Bruhn hardly cared as she entered Pankow U-bahn (underground) station. 'If I had to change trains on the U-bahn, as I did before, you would not find me in a good humour,' she said, tucking her silver grey hair under her woollen hat. Mrs Bruhn lives in Prenzlauer Berg, east Berlin, the heart of east Germany's avant-garde and intellectual life before the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989. Above the gentle hum of the orange-coloured train, Mrs Bruhn said she did not believe the city was truly united until a few weeks ago: 'Every time I wanted to visit my friends in the western part of the city, I had to keep changing trains. I am 70 years old, so I don't like going up and down all those stairs.' The holiday season has brought a particular delight for Mrs Bruhn - and other inhabitants of Berlin. For the first time since 1961, the two parts of the city's main underground line have been reconnected beneath the heart of the Mitte, the centre of prewar Berlin. The U2 now runs west from Ruhleben, near the former Olympic Stadium in west Berlin, cuts through Potsdamer Platz, for decades part of the 'death-strip' that flanked the Berlin Wall, to end in Pankow, in the north of east Berlin. 'I really feel, now that the old stations have been opened, we Berliners are at long last united,' said Mrs Bruhn. Until 1961, Berliners used the line to cross the city, though their movements were restricted by regulations imposed by the four allied powers, particularly the Russians who controlled the eastern sector. 'The line linked Kurfurstendamm, the fashionable shopping district and its smart coffee houses, with the old, historic heart of east Berlin,' said Mr Wolfgang Gobel, spokesman for Berlin's public transport department. 'You could do your shopping, get off at Potsdamer Platz, walk over to the Brandenburg Gate, and still manage to stroll down Unter den Linden'  - one of Germany's finest streets until the second world war. But once the Wall was built, the underground stations which had run through the centre of Berlin were closed off by east Germany's communists. Its border guards, in knee-high black leather boots, patrolled the desolate, damp and rat-infested stations, to ensure no easterner used the underground as an escape route. Few ever did. 'It is my first time on the line for over 33 years. To tell you the truth, it's wonderful and it's so good for the city's morale. It feels like one city,' said Mr Reinhard Schulze, a mechanical engineer. Mr Schulze and his friend, Mr Andreas Fieberger, had just travelled the length of the line, east to west, from Pankow to Ruhleben. Both work for a small machine-tool manufacturer located in west Berlin. More than 380,200 people commute from the eastern to the west German states  -120,000 coming from east Berlin. 'There is no doubt that linking the two parts of U2 has economic and psychological consequences,' said Mr Gobel. 'It's not only good for the commuters; there's more of an incentive for west Berliners, who for many reasons have been slow to see the other part of Berlin, the museums, to see how easterners live, simply to explore their own city.' Such sentiments, however, sometimes fall on deaf ears in the west of the city. 'Why should I bother to go over to east Berlin? There's nothing to see,' said Heinz, a 53-year-old engineer, travelling on the western part of the line. 'I've never been over there.' But he appeared to be in a minority. Most Berliners, appear uncommonly enthusiastic. Ms Helga Wetten, a vintner, said: 'The existence of the Wall forced the administrations of both cities to prove each side was better than the other. We don't have to prove anything any more. The U2 is at last making us slowly become a normal city again.'</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Arts: Cork Street puts on a merry face - Off the Wall THE TURNER Prize fulfils one of its major aims in getting contemporary art, and the Tate Gallery, widely discussed, usually unfavourably. Much of the criticism is blinkered, but as the sculptor Grenville Davey collected his Pounds 20,000 on Tuesday night you could not help wondering whether the claque behind the Turner was even more blinkered. All of the last five winners have been sculptors, with four coming from the same gallery, the Lisson. Nicholas Logsdail, who runs it, has been largely responsible for the currently exalted global reputation of British sculpture, but there must be other developments in art happening in the country. Most people have an old fashioned idea that art has something to do with paint: it would be nice if an artist working in this medium was given a look in, among the short list for starters. It might also be a good idea to choose a work of art that a private collector could buy: most of the previous winners, like Davey, produce art aimed at museums. It is vast, public, didactic, impersonal. An opportunity for change is presenting itself. Current sponsors of the event, Channel 4, seem set to withdraw after 1993. A new sponsor, a new set of guidelines, a new type of winner? In the meantime grab your Davey, still modestly priced at Pounds 8,000-Pounds 20,000. Logsdail took ten calls on Wednesday from potential buyers. This weekend London should offer an extraordinary sight - people in Cork Street. This brief West End thoroughfare has become synonymous with the modern art trade, and modern art dealers like to be away to their country cottages by lunch time on Saturdays. But pressure of events, namely a severe shortage of customers, has encouraged them to stay open through until Sunday evening, just this once. All 16 galleries will be offering a bewildering array of art, from the pop screenprints of Roy Lichtenstein at the Mayor gallery, which has been in Cork Street since 1933, to the aboriginal art at the street's latest occupant, Corbally Stourton. In between there is a figurative, traditional 'Sickert and the Theatre' show at Browse and Darby; Sean Scully and a whole host of moderns at Lelsie Waddington's four Cork Street outlets; and so much more. Cork Street is putting on a merry face partly because dealers are sick of sulking in lonely galleries waiting for the occasional browser and are going on the offensive; and partly because it feels it gets an unfairly bad press. 'Cork Street' is used as shorthand for the art trade, which is going through its worst recession for 60 years. But the Cork Street dealers, a varied and quite friendly crowd, are faring better than most. Only three galleries have disappeared and two were immediately replaced. Two of the three went because the owners, Kasmin and Nicola Jacobs, got fed up with excessive business rates and preferred to trade privately. Odette Gilbert just folded, but her gallery has been taken over by an art book shop, Atrium. In terms of numbers Cork Street is just one gallery off its peak. Most dealers reckon that trade has picked up since the devaluation of sterling, especially those who cater for a mainly foreign clientele. Will Darby, for example, has just sold important sculptures by Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. Significantly he was handling both on consignment for the owners; significantly both went to the Tate - museums are still buying in a modest way. Other dealers confirm that there is now a trickle of business. For Leslie Waddington the trickle has almost grown into a rivulet. In the last month he has sold Pounds 2m worth of art, including paintings by Leger, Dubuffet and Rauschenberg. But, perhaps ominously for the future of Cork Street, the great majority was sold at Fairs in Paris and Hong Kong. Waddington has already signed up for eight overseas fairs in 1993. Waddington moved quickly to adapt to hard times, and over the past two years has written down the value of his stock by 35 per cent, which he reckons is the rough fall in the value of modern art. He has saved on staff and other costs. As a result he expects to break even in 1993, and to return to profit in 1994. The devaluation has prompted the change. A painting priced at Pounds 200,000 cost Dollars 400,000 (the art world deals in dollars) in the summer, and only Dollars 300,000 now. Hence the flurry of trade. But it is has little to do with Cork Street, which is rapidly becoming two market places. One group of dealers concentrates on regular British buyers (many of whom, in the good old days, spent their Lloyds of London dividend on art), while the others sell overseas. While business rates remain around three times higher than in comparable art centres like Paris, a dealer like Leslie Waddington, most of whose sales are overseas, must be asking whether he really needs four outlets in Cork Street (plus one round the corner in Clifford Street). There is another worry overshadowing the Open weekend. The Government seems intent on imposing 17.5 per cent VAT on the work of living artists sold in the UK as against nearer 7 per cent VAT levied on artists in Germany and France. For Cork Street, it is another unnecessary cost increase and part of a vendetta against the arts world, apparent in the unsatisfactory budget negotiated by the Heritage Secretary, Peter Brooke, in the recent expenditure round. So go along to Cork Street this weekend and cheer up the depressed dealers.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Arts: Night after Night - Theatre Neil Bartlett is a playwright, translator, director and performer, and this sheer diversity makes him one of the more ubiquitous figures in British theatre. The National has presented his translations: Racine's Berenice in 1990 and Marivaux's The Game of Love and Chance (current). Last year, the Lyric, Hammersmith, presented his adaptation of Ruth Rendell's A Judgement in Stone. He also co-directed the latter two: which, like several other shows involving him, were produced by Gloria - a production company set up in 1988 to present work by him and three other artists. Much of Bartlett's work advances pro-gay sentiments, and all of it expresses a gay sensibility. His latest offering, Night after Night, is the most direct treatment of gayness that I have seen by him. Also the most autobiographical. A one-man show (with accompaniment by Nicolas Bloomfield), it begins with the premise that he, Bartlett, bears a close physical resemblance to his own father. And then he flips back to become his father in 1958, the year of his birth. His father-to-be is taking his mother-to-be to a musical. 'The show is about to begin.' Bartlett then becomes the theatre manager, the coat-check man, and the barman: who are all - well, confirmed bachelors. So are most of the chorus-boys. Yes, 1950s musicals are wonderfully touching, but isn't it funny how they speak to gay people as directly as to straights? And isn't it ironic that a ritual as heterosexual as a 1950s musical should be framed by so many gay men (front of house, in the chorus, and so on)? And didn't Bartlett pere ever notice this then? But it is 1958, the year in which Bartlett fils will be born. A reexamination of art and history and family biography is a standard and necessary part of gay liberation. But Night after Night's use of self is thoroughly awkward. It wants to be (a) a tour de force in which Bartlett impresses us by being several different men; (b) a private argument (Didn't you ever see any gayness around that straight illusion, Dad?) shared with us all; and (c) Bartlett's treatment of the theme of homosexual participation in heterosexual art. It wants its audience to cry: (a) 'Bravo, star'; (b) 'Us too, Neil'; and (c) 'Alpha plus, Bartlett.' You need to be a larger artist than Bartlett to bring all this off. Bartlett can impersonate the gay front-of-house theatre staff with some malicious panache. As his own straight father, however, he is a cypher. Night after Night tickles its audience's fancy, but it reeks too of a tricky mixture of self-indulgence, what-about-me self-pity, and self-advertisement. Bartlett talks of the heterosexual world as if it existed beyond the green baize door, and as if he inhabited the servants' hall downstairs. He imagines being part of it, and yet he cannot imagine its nervous system. Royal Court, Theatre Upstairs, until February 13</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 14 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina said today the government of President Fidel  Castro will not make concessions to negotiate with the United  States, and he accused the United States of not complying with  the 1984 immigration agreements.    "Cuba is willing to talk with the United States but is not  begging and will dialogue with the United States only on an  equal footing," Robaina stated this Monday when he called Cuban  emigrants who are living in the United States and other  countries to a meeting to be held from 22 to 24 April.    The Havana conference, entitled "The Nation and Emigration,"  will attempt to regularize the ties between the Cuban community  abroad and their relatives and local institutions. The  organizations that are hostile to the Cuban Government have been  excluded from this conference.    During a news conference, the foreign minister expressed  regret that contacts to further immigration negotiations with  Washington have not advanced much, and he said this situation  "is not due to the Cuban position."    According to the Cuban foreign minister, the White House  "systematically and repeatedly" breaks the immigration agreement  signed 10 years ago, which mandates the United States will grant  20,000 visas a year to Cubans who want to travel to that country.    An official Cuban memorandum yesterday accused U.S. special  services and Miami exiles of spreading rumors that visas were  being granted in order to trigger a massive entry of people to  the U.S. Embassy in that capital city.    Special operations police and Defense of the Revolution  Committee members cordoned off the diplomatic mission, and more  than 80 people were arrested in several incidents, official  sources have revealed.    Robaina clarified that the differences between Washington  and  Havana and the relations with the community of Cuban exiles "are  two separate issues" and that they cannot wait to solve the  first issue to start broaching the second problem.    The head of the Cuban foreign office urged the Washington  government to understand that the Cuban immigrants in the United  States include a much wider spectrum than the conservative  National Cuban American Foundation, headed by Jorge Mas Canosa.</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAKING IT WORK;  </P> <P> WAYS TO RECOGNIZE INTRICACIES OF MISUNDERSTANDING  </P> <P> There are many ways for couples to misunderstand each other, and recognizing  them is the first step toward better communication, says Bobbi Nesheim, a  psychotherapist who founded the Center for Creative Growth in Fullerton and  also practices in San Clemente. She also advises:  </P> <P> * Constantly be aware that everyone is unique.  </P> <P> Being different doesn't mean one of you is right or wrong. Honor your  differences.  </P> <P> * Never assume that you know what the other person is thinking or the rationale  for his or her behavior. When in doubt, ask.  </P> <P> * Remember that you have a right to request and a right to refuse.  </P> <P> * Stop and think before you blurt something out. Mean what you say and say what  you mean.  </P> <P> * Take time out to listen.  </P> <P> * Confrontation is good because it clears the air, but don't put each other  down or bring up the past. And choose a time when you're both strong and ready  to talk.  </P> <P> * Cultivate your sense of humor. SHERRY ANGEL  </P></p>

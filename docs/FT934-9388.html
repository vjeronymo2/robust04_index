			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Italian bribes case warrants Naples magistrates investigating bribes in the Italian pharmaceutical industry yesterday issued more than 10 arrest warrants for alleged payments made by six drug companies to obtain favours, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The payments were all made to Mr Duilio Poggiolini, the senior health ministry official who controlled drug authorisations and distribution and who is at the centre of one of the biggest investigations in Italy's wave of corruption scandals. The latest payments allegedly uncovered came from companies that included the Alfa Wasserman, Glaxo and the Recordati group which is quoted on the Milan bourse.</p>

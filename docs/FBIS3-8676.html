This was stated  today by Slovak President Michal Kovac in an exclusive interview  for Slovak Television. He added that the National Council  [parliament] made a clear-cut decision to continue strengthening  the system of parliamentary power. Thus it has sent a very  positive signal abroad, where doubts were sometimes cast as to  whether we really try to strengthen democracy and constitutional  rule, President Kovac said. At the same time, he emphasized  that the parliament decided freely, democratically, and without  pressure.</p>

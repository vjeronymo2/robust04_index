			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Talks to continue on coalition for Malawi Malawi's new president, Mr Bakili Muluzi, is due to continue talks on forming a coalition government, with five key parliamentary seats still in dispute, Reuter reports from Blantyre. Officials of Mr Muluzi's United Democratic Front (UDF), which is just short of a majority with 84 seats in the 177-member parliament, said they were awaiting a response from a northern-based party on whether it wanted to join in a coalition government. 'No talks have been opened with Aford (Alliance for Democracy). The position of the UDF is that we have no major problem in working with Aford if they are willing to work with us,' UDF publicity chief Kassam Chilumpha said. AFORD, which won 36 seats in last Tuesday's elections, is led by veteran trade unionist Chakufwa Chihana, who draws support from his home area in northern Malawi. Former President Hastings Banda's Malawi Congress party, the sole legal party from independence in 1964 until the first multi-party election last week, took 52 seats, mainly in central areas.</p>

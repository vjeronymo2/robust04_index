			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The president of the Congolese Republic is  continuing his high-level political talks in Paris. Pascal  Lissouba went to see Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. Yesterday  he was received by President Mitterrand. He also had talks with  Michel Roussin, the minister of cooperation. To sum up for us  so far on Pascal Lissouba's visit to Paris, here is Monique Mas:    [Mas] Pascal Lissouba has decided to turn the page on the  Franco-Congolese quarrel. He hopes that French severity was  perhaps the expression of the fact that it had entertained too  high hopes of him, and the Congolese president is stressing that  he has already taken a first step by settling the oil dispute to  the benefit of French interests and to the detriment of the  American Oxy oil company. He also denies having tried to play  on Franco-American rivalries. In Lissouba's view, the Cold War  is over anyway, and no one is interested in Africa any more.    Nevertheless, Congo greatly misses its oil revenue. With a  70 percent debt to France [as heard], Lissouba's predecessor had  obtained advances from the French oil company Elf, and Congolese  oil is mortgaged until about 2010. The coffers are empty, but  President Lissouba has no choice but to rise to the challenge  both economically and as far as domestic politics are concerned.  Having got his fingers burned by his first experiment with a  government with 60 percent of the ministers coming from the  opposition, he is now counting on decentralization to ensure  civil peace.    [Announcer] Congolese students in Paris invaded the premises  of their embassy this morning to protest at the nonpayment of  their scholarships for 16 months.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Browning-Ferris wins the day over Attwoods Attwoods yesterday surrendered to the hostile Pounds 391m cash bid from Browning-Ferris Industries, after a last-minute diversion which threatened to throw the US waste giant's offer off course. Just five hours before BFI's offer closed, an unknown private Canadian company stepped in with the promise to bid Pounds 433m for the UK waste group. The pledge came from Ikotek, a waste recycling subsidiary of Sieber, which is a private Canadian agricultural group owned by an Austrian-born businessman. Ikotek's decision to enter the fray at such a late stage took the market and the bid protagonists by surprise. Even Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods' chief executive, described it as an 'unfortunate diversion'. The shares jumped sharply on the news of a possible white knight, from 117p to 127p, but fell back by the end of the day to close 3p up at 120p. In the end, the diversion had little effect on BFI's offer of 120p per share. Shareholders representing less than 1 per cent of Attwoods withdrew their acceptances and BFI finished the day with an estimated 60 per cent stake. This includes Laidlaw's 29.8 per cent stake which it has agreed to sell to BFI under the original offer of 109p. Ikotek was forced to withdraw from the race. Attwoods yesterday claimed a moral victory, with less than half the independent shareholders accepting the offer. 'It is nice to know it was not a landslide victory,' the company said. The defence is believed to have cost up to Pounds 8m, inclu-ding paying legal fees in the US and UK and charges for printing. Attwoods' three advisers, SG Warburg and Robert Fleming of the UK and Smith Barney of the US, are thought to have agreed to divide a set fee. BFI is thought to have paid about Pounds 5m in fees. Unusually, BFI retained just one adviser for its bid, CS First Boston. It is believed to be the first time a foreign bank has advised on a successful hostile takeover in the UK. BFI said yesterday it did not expect to make any changes in the management team right away. Mr Foreman, who is on a five-year rolling contract, could be entitled to compensation payments of more than Pounds 500,000. He also owns just under 1m shares. 'So I suppose you could say I won't go broke,' he said.</p>

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation of the provisions of the Act, as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the Act requires that States adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the Federally approved SIP. In addition, the Act directs the EPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title V of the Act. In February 1992, the EPA issued ``Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments'' to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and to provide further guidance to the States on submitting acceptable SIP revisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to gain full approval, the State submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the PROGRAM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to satisfy the requirements of section 507, on November 11, 1992, January 8, 1993, and November 12, 1993, the State of Michigan submitted a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program as a revision to its SIP. The November 12, 1993 submittal included the Michigan Small Business Clean Air Assistance Act of 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Small Business Assistance Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 507(a) sets forth six requirements <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  that the State must meet to have an approvable SBAP. The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting, and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A seventh requirement of Section 507(a), establishment of an Ombudsman office, is discussed in the next section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State has met this requirement by establishing the Air Quality Small Business Assistance Program (AQSBAP) and requiring it to develop this aspect of the SBAP. The AQSBAP outreach program will coordinate activities with existing groups that represent small businesses' interests and/or come in contact with large numbers of small businesses. As new standards and requirements are promulgated, the AQSBAP will translate the requirements into understandable terms and disseminate the information through these organizations, which include the Michigan Department of Natural Resources Air Quality Division (MDNR AQD), the Small Business Clean Air Ombudsman (SBCAO), the Michigan Department of Public Health, local emergency planning committees, trade associations, chambers of commerce, newspapers, business and trade journals, economic development groups, universities, and electronic databases. The AQSBAP will also seek participation in these organizations' conferences and meetings. In addition, the AQSBAP will develop a client tracking system to help assess program needs, and to develop small business mailing lists. To address reactive information needs, the AQSBAP will assist in operating an ``800'' telephone clearinghouse service which will be able to provide technical assistance. To address the program's technical resource needs, the AQSBAP will provide its own technical specialists, as well as develop mechanisms for obtaining additional technical support from appropriate Federal, State, and other organizations. The AQSBAP will also develop an air quality resource center, which will be available to the AQSBAP technical specialists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

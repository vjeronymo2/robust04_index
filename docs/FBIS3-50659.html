			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Julian Rodriguez Marin] </F>   [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez (Mexico), 4 Jan (FE) -- The Army on  Tuesday reinforced surveillance in Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of  Chiapas State, and recommended the people not leave the city in  view of the lack of security prevailing in the area due to the  actions by the Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN).    The 120,000 residents of Tuxtla Gutierrez, located 680 km  southeast of Mexico City, are nervous about the presence of the  EZLN and they fear being involved in combat between the rebels  and the Army.    At the military airport of Tuxtla Gutierrez, which is near  the civilian airport, there have been approximately 20  helicopters since the conflict first began last Saturday. The  helicopters are moving troops to the area of conflict. The  atmosphere on the city streets is tense and most of the  residents prefer staying at home. The highways to San Cristobal  de las Casas, one of the main centers of the conflict -- which  is about 50 km from here -- are nearly deserted for fear of the  firefights and the Army has set up checkpoints.    Rumors are circulating to the effect the soldiers and rebels  are fighting just 10 km from Tuxtla Gutierrez. Other rumors say  rebels have been seen near Chapa de Corzo, 15 km from Tuxtla  Gutierrez, and that the guerrillas reportedly plan to storm the  jail at Cerro Hueco, on the outskirts of Tuxtla Gutierrez.    Residents from Tuxtla Gutierrez told EFE that the majority  of  the people in this city reject the rebel actions, although there  might be some support in the mountain area where the majority of  the people are Indians. The people say there is little  information on the clashes, radio communications are bad, and  the situation is difficult in the rural areas where there are  Indian chiefs.    A civilian source pointed out that in Las Margaritas, the  Indian chiefs do not allow the Indians who work on farms to wear  clothing similar to military uniforms as they fear being  attacked. The source told EFE that the people in this area are  extremely neglected and abandoned as the Indian chiefs are akin  to feudal lords who manage the lives of the Indians and  practically keep them as slaves. It is believed that there are  areas in Chiapas where one Indian dies every day as a result of  the violence generated by the Indian chiefs and the police  forces, the source added.    In his New Year's message to the people of Chiapas, acting  Governor Elmar Setzer said that "it is regrettable that the  subversive groups have generated such actions of violence and  vandalism that have broken the juridical order and disrupted the  social peace and public harmony to which we are accustomed in  Chiapas." He added that "these actions have been rejected by  all sectors of the population, and various groups have called  for a dialogue and a peaceful solution to the situation created  by the armed aggressor group."    Setzer asked the people to be prudent and not be overcome by  panic and rumors, and facilitate the work of the Army that seeks  to reinforce protection and security in the affected areas.</p>

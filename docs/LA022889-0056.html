			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: YOU COULD SEE FUTURE BY LOOKING IN MIRROR  </P> <P> "TYSON STOPS BRUNO IN 5," screamed the headline in Britain's Daily Mirror.  </P> <P> Not particularly creative, true, but then again it did appear five days before  last weekend's celebrated fight in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> The Mirror, stretching the definition of journalism to new lengths, not only  called the fight but provided a round-by-round description and even published  "post-fight" quotes.  </P> <P> The Round 5 description included the following:  </P> <P> "Britain's dazed hero tries to fight his way back to the centre of the ring,  but a thundering left hook sends him falling back into the ropes.  </P> <P> "The referee leaps between the two boxers and leads brave, battered Frank back  to his corner.  </P> <P> "It is all over after 1 minute 40 seconds of the fifth round."  </P> <P> It was 2:55 into the round, actually, but who's counting.  </P> <P> Add Tyson-Bruno: Best line of the HBO telecast came from Larry Merchant,  although it's doubtful the folks in Glasgow or Edinburgh would have appreciated  it.  </P> <P> "If (Bruno) lasts another two rounds, they may give him Scotland," Merchant  said.  </P> <P> Trivia time: What two things do Joe Sambito, Tim Lollar, Sammy Stewart, Steve  Crawford, Dave Stapleton and Don Baylor have in common?  </P> <P> Batter up: The Washington Post's Tony Kornheiser was less than impressed by  Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser's remark after signing his $7.9-million contract  that he was "back to being warm and goosey about being a Dodger."  </P> <P> Said Kornheiser: "I should hope so. For $7,000 a day, I could be warm and  goosey about being a lab rat."  </P> <P> Now on the mound, Rick Rodent?  </P> <P> Words to live by: Iran Barkley, discounting rumors that he was not perhaps the  fighter he imagined, had quite a bit to say before his bout with Roberto Duran.  </P> <P> "Let 'em all talk about me," he said. "And let Duran believe it all. Let it  boost his ego up. That way it will be even more of a shock when I kick his  butt."  </P> <P> He didn't stop there, either.  </P> <P> "I'm glad he's in shape," Barkley said. "That will make it easier for him to  fit into his coffin."  </P> <P> Nor was that all. Barkley even scoffed at a possible Sugar Ray Leonard-Duran  rematch.  </P> <P> "Forget Leonard-Duran," he said. "It'll never happen. There's no way I'm going  to let this fat old guy beat me."  </P> <P> Sometimes it's best not to anger fat old guys.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: All six were members of the Boston Red Sox 1986 American League  championship team and all six are out of baseball.  </P> <P> Quotebook  </P> <P> Dick Beaty, NASCAR-Winston Cup director, on the 24-hour cars that run at  Daytona: "They don't resemble anything on earth. . . . When Kyle Petty ran one,  it had so many switches he had to pull off the track to figure out how to turn  the lights on."  </P></p>

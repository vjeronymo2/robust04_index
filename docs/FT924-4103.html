			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Turkey gets central Asia on the line - How Ankara has plugged ex-Soviet republics into its network AN ambitious project linking Turkey's telephone network with that of the five republics of central Asia was formally inaugurated this week with a visit to the region by Yasar Topcu, the Turkish communications minister. Telecommunications is proving the industrial frontiersman in Turkey's efforts to forge ties with its cousins to the east. Under a turnkey arrangement, the PTT, Turkey's state-owned telecom monopoly is supplying public exchanges with 2,500-line capacity to each country - Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Through earth stations also supplied by the PTT, the five existing networks will be linked via the Intelsat satellite to the Turkish gateway exchange and the outside world. The PTT has contracted Netas, a Turkish subsidiary of Northern Telecom of Canada, together with Teletas, part owned by Alcatel of France, to deliver the switching equipment. The deal is a straight donation at a cost of Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.4m)  - a considerable sum given Turkey's budget problems. In the long run the PTT will comfortably recover the cost in transit revenues. As the republics look to upgrade their infrastructure, bigger gains should be had by Turkish suppliers. Turkish companies already have considerable experience in the former Soviet Union, on the back of a Dollars 300m-a-year gas protocol under which Turkey receives gas from former Soviet republics in exchange for Turkish goods and services. As a location for foreign joint ventures, Turkey offers cheap labour costs. Moreover Turkey and the central Asian republics speak broadly the same language. Turkish telecommunications has long enjoyed priority status in a country where the president used to boast there was a telephone in every village. Between 1986-1991 the number of lines installed increased by 163 per cent, faster than anywhere. As growth in Turkey's domestic phone market slows with the PTT cutting investment, sales to the republics will provide welcome revenues. 'We've learned our lesson, not to be too reliant on a single customer,' says Mr Tanju Argun, Netas president. In 1988 the company recorded losses resulting in large scale lay-offs. Today the corporate structure is much more robust. Thanks in large part to the former Soviet market, exports now account for about 10 per cent of turnover, which in 1991 is estimated at around Dollars 230m. Mr Argun's target is to boost exports to a third of total sales. Netas has long been testing the waters. In 1986 its engineers were working with the Leningrad Institute of Technology to create a signalling system for the southern republics. 'We were present in Moscow. We'd had relations with the Ministry of Communications for a long time. But we were reluctant to go to the republics independently,' says Mr Argun. The demise of the Soviet Union accelerated the company's plans. In October last year the company connected the Northern Telecom-designed DMS switch in Azerbaijan, the first foreign digital switch to be installed in the former Soviet Union. Mr Argun was in Baku again earlier this month to see the installation of a third digital exchange, with cables being laid along the city's underground. Netas has also opened a DMS in Kazakhstan. The export effort has been spurred by substantial investment in home-grown research and development. Netas for example, devotes between 6-10 per cent of sales revenues to R&amp;D. The company earned Dollars 2.7m exporting software to both Northern Telecom and Bell Northern Research. It also contributed to London's Mercury gateway system. Netas has joint ventures in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan to manufacture its DRX-4 digital switch used for exchanges in rural areas, which the company developed in its Istanbul laboratories. Netas is excited by the prospects for this product which it feels is ideally suited to the ex-Soviet market. 'It has been designed by customer input - it is not a technology driven product,' says Mr Argun. The DRX comprises a 512-line cabinet structure easily assembled in a small office, and, unlike many systems, it will function in extremes of temperature. Netas has already delivered test equipment and started construction work near Baku. Ultel, its 51 per cent owned venture in Azerbaijan, has produced 150,000 handsets, and expects to be selling the switch soon. Finance remains a bigger headache. Payment for the Azerbaijan deal involved a complex telephone-sets-for-oil countertrade. Mr Argun hopes also to be able to tap the Dollars 1bn line of credit extended to the republics by Turkey's Eximbank.</p>

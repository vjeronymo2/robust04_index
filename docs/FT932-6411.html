			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Letter: Science: real markets and knotty problem (2) Sir, In your editorial on the science policy review ('An attempt to see the future', May 27), you unwittingly highlight a knotty problem in industrial R&amp;D funding. There is no point, you say by way of example, in backing a Pounds 10m laser research project if there is no UK industry to make the advanced lasers developed by it. This argument was put forward by the 1992 Fairclough report on information technology R&amp;D, and used to recommend abandonment of silicon microelectronics research. However, life is really not so simple today. The world of high technology knows no national boundaries. Your 'UK industry' may be a UK-owned multinational with R&amp;D in New Jersey and production in Osaka. Or it might be a small Canadian group with manufacturing in Birmingham. Furthermore, your laser project might be part of an international collaboration - the Jessi semiconductor programme is a good example - with research and exploitation spread over many countries. The 'no UK industry' argument is a dangerous oversimplification and must be rigorously tested whenever used.

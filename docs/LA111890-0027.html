			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ELEKTRA'S LEGACY FULL OF SURPRISES ** VARIOUS ARTISTS "RUBAIYAT:  ELEKTRA'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY" ELEKTRA  </P> <P> Good idea: Today's Elektra artists remake the recordings of yesterday's Elektra  artists to celebrate the illustrious label's 40th anniversary.  </P> <P> Mediocre record: The 38-track collection is inevitably so sprawling and  unfocused that the occasional good cuts seem like random strokes of luck.  </P> <P> Whatever Elektra was and is goes undefined, as "Rubaiyat's" excessiveness  neutralizes the company's identity.  </P> <P> For those who bite, here's a guide to help get a grip on it:  </P> <P> Hottest commercial formula: the Cure + the Doors . . . Best metal-plating:  Faster Pussycat's "You're So Vain" . . . Most imaginative transformations: the  Gipsy Kings' Catalonian "Hotel California" . . . Mismatch (singer over song):  Ernie Isley doing the Cars' "Let's Go" . . . Mismatch (song over singer):  Love's "Seven &amp; Seven Is" by Billy Bragg.  </P> <P> Pleasant surprise (song and singer): Dennis Linde's "Hello, I Am Your Heart,"  sung by Sara Hickman . . . Pleasant surprise (general): Jackson Browne's  singing on the Incredible String Band's "First Girl I Loved" . . . Perfect  matches: They Might Be Giants doing Phil Ochs, 10,000 Maniacs doing Jackson  Browne, John Zorn doing the Stooges . . . Worst song: "I'd Like to Teach the  World to Sing."

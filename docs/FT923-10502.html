			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Bonds: EIB launches DFl 500m FRN offering IN an otherwise quiet session in the Eurobond market, the European Investment Bank launched a DFl 500m offering of floating rate notes via Rabobank. Dealers said the issue was targeted at Italian investors, for whom EIB paper is tax-exempt. The notes pay 60 basis points less than the three-month Amsterdam interbank offered rate. According to traders, there was little demand for the paper in the Netherlands, where floating-rate notes are not a favoured investment, as most institutional investors were keen to ensure fixed returns. In the Euroyen sector, Mazda, the Japanese car company, launched two offerings totalling Y30bn. Elsewhere, Swiss Bank Corporation is to tender for up to Dollars 150m of outstanding New Zealand Eurobonds. The 8 per cent bonds due 1997 were issued in April 1987 and are believed to be held largely by European retail investors. The price of the tender, which starts today and runs until Friday, will be fixed initially at 48 basis points above the 6 3/8 per cent US Treasury due 1997, but may vary during the tender period. At current market levels, the indicated tender price is 107.10. SBC has tendered for Commonwealth of Australia and Australian Wheat Board Eurobonds. An official said the bank would either hold the bonds on its own account, or sell them to investors. Banque Paribas, France's fifth largest bank ranked by assets, has had its long-term debt rating lowered from AA to AA- by IBCA, the European credit rating agency. The agency cited Paribas's exposure to difficult markets, such as French real estate, predicting that 'loan loss provisions are bound to remain high'. However, the agency added that the bank should be able to keep up its revenue stream.</p>

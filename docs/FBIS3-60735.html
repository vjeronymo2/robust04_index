			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Framatome Chairman Jean-Claude Leny, by </F> Elisabeth Rochard; date, place not given: Jean-Claude Leny:  ``We Propose a Joint Venture With Chinese Partners'']    [Text]    Rochard: You have just returned from China where  Framatome [Franco-American Atomic Construction Company] is  completing the construction of two nuclear stages at Daya Bay  [placename as published]. When is production of electricity  expected to start?    Leny: In fact the first stage has already started  to produce electricity in the framework of the tests scheduled  in the contract. It has even operated at 100 percent of its  power, but it is not contractually finished and it will only be  taken over by the client in January [1994]. This first stage is  therefore currently being run experimentally. It has passed the  most important test, which consists of operating for 100 hours  at full power, without interruption. The second stage will  start in the spring, in other words, this summer the nuclear  power generated on the site will reach almost 2,000 megawatts.  However, our teams will not all return to France. Indeed, we  have just signed a maintenance contract which will necessitate  the presence on the site of around 20 people, which is far from  the 400 European expatriates that we had at the peak period out  of a staff of 4,000 people.    Rochard: When the contract was signed in 1986,  constructing a nuclear power station of this size in China must  have seemed like attempting the impossible?    Leny: It has not always been easy. But we had  considerable experience abroad, because we have constructed  nuclear power stations in Belgium, in Korea, and in South  Africa--power stations which break world records for  uninterrupted operation. The most difficult thing is to  construct a nuclear power station on the spot with local labor;  it is not like a plane which would be built in our factories.  By the transfers of technology made, the Chinese have acquired  some experience in the nuclear sphere. We think that it would  be opportune to continue.    Rochard: Does China have adequate technology to  construct a nuclear power station and does it intend to pursue  its nuclear program?    Leny I think that the Chinese still need us to  construct a large-scale nuclear power station. But they will  certainly do more on the next power station, and so forth.  China has very big energy requirements. We were told that by  all the officials we met, including Prime Minister Li Peng.  These requirements can be satisfied by coal. But coal is  difficult to transport and it raises problems of transportation  within the country. For the southern provinces, nuclear power  is the best means of producing electricity in quantity and  cleanly. We have offered to help our Chinese interlocutors to  build a nuclear industry and to create a joint venture with  Chinese partners. This joint company would be formed with a  substantial program. Its role would be to do in China what we  have done in France. This proposal interests Beijing greatly.  But there is a political problem to be solved first. It was not  concealed from me.    Rochard: Do you think that the right conditions  exist for a settlement of the dispute which resulted from the  supply of Mirage planes to Taiwan?    Leny: The prime minister, who received me on a  private basis, was friendly and he said that he was ready to  welcome positive gestures which the French Government might make  with a view to restoring confidence. This confidence reigned,  he stressed, when we signed our contracts. I had the impression  of people who were open to reconciliation provided the French  Government initiated it. I found the atmosphere markedly less  tense than a year ago but it is up to the French Government to  take action. Moreover, there is no shortage of opportunities,  whether it be the official opening of Daya Bay which is due to  take place in February or March or the 30th anniversary of  China's recognition by France. But it will take more than a  symbolic gesture.    Rochard: Do you have the impression that the  Chinese nuclear program is being established and that there will  be a follow-up to Daya Bay?    Leny: China is indeed busy establishing its  nuclear program with all the hesitations and considerations that  it involves. For instance, in Guandong province, two sites are  being envisaged. Which should be started first? The answer has  not yet been given. The other question is the degree of  participation by Chinese industries. Some people think that  China can do everything immediately, others that it still needs  help. But it is now that the thinking is taking place. It is  therefore preferable not to waste time if we want to join this  circuit.    Rochard: Is foreign competition fierce?    Leny: Of course. The American company  Westinghouse has just made an official visit to China. The  Japanese have a strong presence. As for the Germans, we are  associated with them and the situation is different. In  Guandong province, where Daya Bay is situated, it is planned  that it will be Framatome and GEC Alsthom which reply to the  invitations to tender. On the other hand, everywhere else in  China, it is NPI [expansion not given], our joint subsidiary  with Siemens which is operational for the nuclear sector. But I  still think that we have a good position in view of what we have  just done.    Rochard: Let us return to Europe. Do you think  that the freeze on the German nuclear program is irreversible?  Industry Minister Gerard Longuet said last Friday [10 December]  that, if that was the case, your association with Siemens no  longer had much sense.    Leny: I greatly regret this situation which I do  not think corresponds to anything rational or reasonable. The  SPD [Social Democratic Party] and the German Greens have a  totally unjustifiable position with regard to nuclear power.  This being the case, Siemens, our partner, which knows the  hidden forces of its country better than I do, is fairly calm.  This wait-and-see situation has no effect on our cooperation.  But we would obviously like the situation to be more dynamic in  Germany for the sake of our agreement.    Rochard: What progress has been made in the plans  to change your capital leading to Alcatel Alsthom taking control?    Leny: I know absolutely nothing about it. We are  in the position of any company which has shareholders. They are  free to buy and sell. It is up to the management to adapt to  that, and to ensure that these changes do not affect the smooth  running of the enterprise. This is what we are doing. I have  simply said that, if that was the decision of the public  authorities, we would ensure that it goes smoothly. We have not  expressed any wish in either direction.    Rochard: Alcatel Alsthom is a serious competitor  for Siemens. Would a majority share held by Pierre Suard's group  not be likely to jeopardize your cooperation with your German  partner?    Leny: Do not think that. Big groups can be  competitors in one or two spheres and be linked in a third.  This is not contradictory.    Rochard: What will Framatome's results be in 1993?    Leny: I will stand by the forecasts made. The net  profit should be slightly less than Fr900 million. But in 1994,  the turnover should take a leap forward, because we will invoice  the two Chinese stages in the next financial year. The turnover  should increase from Fr16 billion in 1993 to Fr20 billion in  1994.</p>

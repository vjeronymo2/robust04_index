			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eric Dupin: "Thumbs Up to Research, the </F> Environment, the Currency"]    [Text] With less than a month to go until 12 June, French  public opinion seems "confused about Europe." The wave of  anti-European sentiment which the fervent supporters of the  European Union [EU] feared until recently has not emerged.  However, judging by the survey carried out by LIBERATION and  CSA and which we are publishing today, the French do not show  any enthusiasm for continuing with European integration as it  has been conceived so far. The harsh criticism expressed during  the debate on the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty in  September 1992 is coupled today with the more or less clear  aspiration for a different Europe.    Has European integration gone too far, or not far enough?  This question causes some discomfort. Half of those surveyed  refused to let themselves be pigeonholed in one of the two  traditional categories of "European" or "anti-European": 39  percent seemed to feel that European integration has gone far  enough, while 12 percent had no feelings on the matter. Another  statistic shows that an absolute majority of those surveyed (56  percent) had questions about the need to move forward with  European integration. This is a major reservation, in view of  the fact that it looks like European integration will be  deepening.  <H5>  Three Sectors Out of Nine Deemed Positive </H5>   The number of those who are biased in favor of Europe in  principle has dropped somewhat. At this point, only one-third  of the French want to go "further" into the European adventure.  This Europeanism remains both elitist and leftist. (Footnote  1) ("Pro-Europeans" are defined as those surveyed who said they  wanted to vote on the basis of European issues and who feel that  European integration has not gone far enough. The  "anti-Europeans" are defined as those who will vote on the basis  of European issues, but who think that European integration has  gone too far.) Those who most feel that Europe has not gone far  enough are senior executives and professionals (40 percent),  industrial and commercial employers (39 percent), as well as  leftist sympathizers (40 percent). On the other hand, farmers  (38 percent) and National Front sympathizers (38 percent) are  proportionally the most numerous who feel that European  integration has gone too far.    The results of a more detailed assessment of the EU, based  on  its performance in various sectors, were rather lukewarm. It  was deemed positive in just three sectors out of nine: research,  the environment, and currency. In two other areas (defense and  education), the negative opinions almost balanced out the  positive opinions. In the four remaining sectors, which are  very important in terms of public opinion (consumption, social  protection, employment, and agriculture), the majority sentiment  is that the EU "is not heading in the right direction."  Significantly, it is in the more abstract areas that Europe  gets high marks.    The relative harshness expressed by those surveyed regarding  education is a rather new development. The number of university  graduates who felt that the EU's educational policy was going in  the right direction equalled that of those who thought it was  heading in the wrong direction (36 percent). European  employment policy was criticized in particular by young people  aged 25 to 34 years (72 percent), as well as by workers (73  percent). It should also be noted that 68 percent of farmers  think that European agriculture has gone astray.    The French would welcome a Europe that moved away from the  guidelines of the Maastricht Treaty in order to give priority to  reviving the economy instead of fighting inflation. Two-thirds  of those surveyed (67 percent) say that it would now be  desirable "to renegotiate the Maastricht Treaty" (19 percent do  not think it desirable to renegotiate, while 14 percent have no  opinion). This opinion, defended at the time of the referendum  by certain supporters of a "no" vote, is supported by a broad  majority in all the social categories and among all political  leanings. Those who voted "yes" on Maastricht Treaty say that  they support (59 percent) a renegotiation of the treaty. It is  true that the defenders of Maastricht are currently referring to  the fact that it is being "overtaken."    Faced with worrying massive unemployment, the French would  like Europe to stop giving the priority to fighting inflation.  The theme of a revival of European consumption is a popular  one, especially among employers (63 percent), mid-level  professions (66 percent), and workers (62 percent). Senior  executives are more hesitant about a recovery that is likely to  see a reemergence of inflationary tendencies..    The poll as clearly reflects a desire to see the EU better  protect employment by backing the idea of Community  protectionism. Almost three-fourths of those surveyed (72  percent) would like to see the EU protect its borders "from  products coming from countries that have a low level of social  protection." This proposal is applauded by all the French,  regardless of their socioeconomic status or their political  views.    The idea of enlarging the EU beyond the four countries  which are just about to be included (Sweden, Norway, Finland,  Austria) is much more controversial. The majority of leftist  voters (64 percent) or Greens is seduced by the idea, whereas  only a minority of rightist voters is (45 percent). The  conservative electorate is therefore not in favor of a large  Europe that would welcome the less-developed countries of East  Europe. All in all, the common denominator in the various  replies is a certain rejection of the status quo. The French  don't seem particularly attached to maintaining a Europe as  defined by the Maastricht Treaty, which is resolutely free-trade  oriented and ardently monetarist.  <H5>  Semi-European Election </H5>   The French attitude toward Europe, however, is not their  only  criteria for 12 June -- far from it. As usual, the "European"  elections will only partly relect their title. Less than half  of those surveyed said that their vote would be based on  "European policy issues." Indeed, there will be more people  voting with a view to domestic politics than the 41 percent who  admitted that this is what they intend to do.    Torn between Bernard Tapie [leftist "Radical Energy" list]  and Bernard-Henri Levy ["Sarajevo" list], the current campaign  is having major difficulties dealing with current European  issues. The positions of various electoral lists on strictly  European issues are largely unknown. Very few voters  distinguish between the positions on national policy and on  European policy, as can be confirmed by the various lists.  Moreover, on 12 June, a not insignificant minority will seek to  express its discontent rather than express its approval of a  political orientation: One-fourth of those surveyed stated that  they would primarily like to show their "opposition to the other  lists."    The various lists are involved in the European debate to  much  different degrees. In view of the positions expressed by his  supporters, Michel Rocard's [Socalist "European Solidarity"  list] list easily wins the prize for the most pro-European list.  The proportion of voters who say they are "close" to Rocard is  48 percent among the "pro-Europeans," whereas they would give  Dominique Baudis [majority's "Union" list] only 41 percent of  the vote. True, Rocard attracts the intellectual and well-off  Left, the very Left that is the most sensitive to the issue of  Europe: 43 percent are "close" to him among university  graduates and 47 percent among senior executives and  professionals. Jean-Pierre Chevenement ["Alternative Policy"  list] and Bernard Tapie are both linked to the crisis on the  Left, which they each express in their own way. This positioning  is perhaps not alien to the modest score given to the Socialist  list by opinion polls.    The leading anti-European list is headed by Philippe de  Villiers ["The Other Europe" list]. This deputy from the Vendee  brilliantly incarnates the Right's "no" as expressed by  nonsalaried workers and the elderly. The proportion of those  who say they are "close" to him is 36 percent among the  "anti-Europeans." His potential voters are easily those who are  most hostile to the EU.    Dominique Baudis' list is buoyed along by an image of  unanimity. The sociological profile of his supporters is quite  clearly centered on "people of the Right" (with the same index  of proximity to the UDF [French Democratic Union] and the RPR  [Rally for the Republic], but his position on Europe is notably  ambiguous. The proportion who feel they are close to Baudis is  virtually the same among the former supporters of a "no" vote  (44 percent) and of a "yes" vote (46 percent) on Maastricht. On  most European issues, the ratings given by Baudis' voters are  very close to those of the electorate as a whole. Hence, 19  percent of the voters for the UDF-RPR list think that European  integration has gone "too far," 30 percent "not far enough," and  38 percent "neither one nor the other." Baudis is comfortably  planted at the center of French hesitation about Europe.    The lists of Bernard Tapie and Jean-Pierre Chevenement look  like two different reflections of the same crisis of  representation on the Left. Their audiences are not deeply  divided on the issue of Europe. Tapie's voters are no more  intimately federalist than those of Chevenement are hostile to  the EU: 33 percent of "anti-Europeans" say they are "close" to  Tapie, whereas 32 percent of "pro-Europeans" say they are  "close" to Chevenement. The voters for these two lists can be  characterized by their attraction to the idea of Europe, which  is coupled with a harsh criticism of Community policies.  Together with the ecologists, they are distinguished by the  highest proportion of voters who vote, above all, against the  other lists.    Lastly, the lists of the PCF [French Communist Party] and FN  [National Front] are essentially focused on domestic politics.  Their voters are those who, by a vast majority, will make their  decisions on the basis of national interests. Their electoral  potential is highly limited: 10 percent of the electorate in  both cases. The lists of Francis Wurtz and Jean-Marie Le Pen  have an isolated but loyal electorate. Their criticism of  Europe is merely the logical extension of their respective  radicalism.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley outlines anti-fraud plan MR Peter Lilley, social security secretary, yesterday outlined the extent of his crackdown on benefit fraudsters, which is expected to save up to Pounds 1bn a year. His department is conducting an anti-fraud operation to save about Pounds 500m this financial year and up to Pounds 1bn in future years. Mr Lilley was amplifying the details disclosed in the Autumn Statement to MPs on the Commons select committee on social security. Extra investigators using better computer systems able to cross-check claims and identify 'risk categories' will be deployed, he told the committee. Local authorities will get incentives to join in the crackdown, possibly saving Pounds 50m on housing and council tax benefits alone.</p>

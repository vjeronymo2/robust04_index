			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Nigerian government to control allocations of foreign exhange Nigeria's military government is to allocate all foreign exchange directly to importers, in a move which will tighten state control on the economy and further alienate its international creditors, with whom the country has debt arrears of about Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn). The Paris Club of official creditors, which are owed more than half Nigeria's Dollars 28bn external debt, are awaiting the outcome of an International Monetary Fund visit to Nigeria which ends next week before starting to reschedule the debt for the fourth time. The budget forecast additional arrears of about Dollars 2.5bn in 1994. The fund has urged deregulation, but management of the foreign exchange market has been one of the main obstacles to agreement between Nigeria and the IMF, which is a pre-condition of external debt relief and fresh credit. The new system is a setback for Mr KI Kalu, finance minister, and Mr Paul Ogwuma, central bank governor, whose free-market policies have been overruled by the rest of the government's economic committee, chaired by Mr Lateef Jakande, minister of works. The guidelines issued yesterday in effect return Nigeria to the import licensing system which became notorious in the 1980s for the corruption it encouraged in ministers and senior civil servants. All foreign exchange earned by both private and public sector exporters will have to be sold, at the fixed rate of 22 naira to the US dollar, to the Central Bank of Nigeria, which will make direct allocation of foreign currency to 'importers/end-users'. Eighty per cent of the currency is set aside for manufacturing industry and agriculture, but the individual allocations will be made by the cabinet's economic committee. 'It is a return to import licensing by another name,' said a banker in Lagos last night. 'In some ways, it is a relief because now the government is completely responsible for the foreign exchange system so, when it goes wrong, they will have no-one else to blame.' During various experiments with deregulation in the past eight years, Nigeria had increased the role of the banks in the foreign exchange market but never completely relinquished control, especially of the exchange rate. From now on, the banks will be agents of the central bank, there will be no facility to sell dollars earned by exporters at competitive exchange rates, the parallel market will be illegal and bureaux de change will only be allowed to buy foreign currency at a fixed rate and pass it on to the central bank. Some manufacturers argued, before the budget presented this month, for a guaranteed supply of foreign exchange at a stable rate, but the exchange rules have already slowed exports and inward investment. This will further depress Nigeria's balance of payments.</p>

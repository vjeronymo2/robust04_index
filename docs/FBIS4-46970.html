			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Malinkovich under the rubric "Ukraine": </F> "Dangerous Games"]    [Text] When journalists asked the leader of one of  the Ukrainian parties, Volodymyr Filenko, last Friday "Does the  decision of the Crimean parliament to restore the Crimean  Constitution adopted on 6 May 1992 mean war?" he answered: "I  think it does."    Could there really be a war between Ukraine and Russia over  the Crimea? It is impossible to believe. However, reports are  coming from Simferopol about the appearance of dozens of armored  personnel carriers in the outskirts of the Crimean capital. I  see from my window a nationalist demonstration descending toward  the Khreshchatyk, with the demand to strip the Crimea of its  autonomy written on the banners. In a television picture from  the chamber of the Crimean parliament: The deputies are  delighted by their own courage. I cannot understand what they  are happy about. As it is, they have put the country on the  brink of a war between the fraternal peoples (I will not shrink  from this combination of words, which has suddenly fallen from  grace) whereas they could have resolved everything amicably. Did  the Crimean deputies really fail to understand that they have  fallen into a trap set by those who do not wish the election to  be held on schedule?    Leonid Kravchuk has been talking for a long time now about  the need to cancel or at any rate postpone the June presidential  election.    The president played by old rules, but the situation in the  country began to change. A new Ukrainian parliament has operated  for just two weeks, but the possible direction of the country's  political life after the election is already emerging. Two  events have been particularly indicative.    By an impressive margin, a majority of the Supreme Council  voted to strip the well-known liberal, Volodymyr Hrynyov, of his  deputy credentials because, through the fault of the Central  Electoral Commission (and contrary to his will!), he ended up  without a competitor in the second round. The credentials of two  Communist deputies who had been elected to the parliament in the  exact same manner as Hrynyov were confirmed. In essence,  Volodymyr Hrynyov was punished for his liberalism. Here is what  is interesting: Not only the "Reds" voted against Hrynyov but  also the nationalists who feared Hrynyov's adherence to the idea  of a rapprochement between Ukraine and Russia and other CIS  countries. It suddenly came out that the national forces that  were defeated in the election are prepared under certain  circumstances to form an alliance with not only the former  nomenklatura Communists who have given up their party membership  cards, but also with the Communists who have remained faithful  to their dogmas. One would think it was no accident that  immediately after the election, the Rukh [Ukraine People's  Movement] leader, Volodymyr Chornovil, stated that the MBR  [Interregional Reform Block] of Kuchma and Hrynyov appeared to  him more dangerous than the communists.    Nonetheless, there will not be a strong alliance between the  nationalists, even moderate nationalists, and the communists.  They will not agree on the issue of an attitude toward Russia.  On this score, the leftists have more in common with the  centrists from the Kuchma-Hrynyov bloc, as was revealed by  voting for candidates for the post of parliament chairman. At  first, there were nine contenders. However, later five of them,  including the leaders of the moderate nationalists, Chornovil  and Yavorivskyy, withdrew their candidacies. The  national-democrats understood that they would not corner the  position of speaker; for this reason they supported the former  Deputy Speaker Durdynets whose career was made in the Youth  Communist League and subsequently in the militia--anyone but a  proponent of integration processes. However, the chances of the  radical nationalist from the extremist organization UNA-UNSO  [Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian People's Self-Defense  Forces], Yuriy Tyma, to win were none, just as those of a  representative of the MBR, Oleksandr Karpiv, whose presentation  in the parliament made a very good impression. The point is that  the Kuchma-Hrynyov reformist bloc conducted the parliamentary  campaign poorly, betting on the election of the president.  Correspondingly, the deputy faction of the MBR turned out to be  quite small. This is how it happened that in reality only two  persons competed for the seat of parliament chairman--the leader  of the bloc of leftist forces (communists, socialists,  agrarians), Oleksandr Moroz, and the man of the nomenklatura,  Vasyl Durdynets. The votes of their direct supporters were  clearly insufficient for either. The nomenklatura man was  supported by the nationalists, and the socialist by the  centrists, including several deputies from the Kuchma bloc. They  were the ones to ensure the victory of Oleksandr Moroz.    It is obvious that the centrists of L. Kuchma did not at all  support O. Moroz selflessly. Of course, they are counting on a  reciprocal step by the left. As it were, Oleksandr Moroz is one  of seven candidates for the post of Ukrainian president. Leonid  Kravchuk, Leonid Kuchma, Ivan Plyushch, and Volodymyr Lanovyy  are his main rivals. Recently, Kravchuk's rating has declined.  Kuchma's rating has been the highest for half a year now. The  number of supporters of Plyushch and Lanovyy is now growing.  They are supported by the nationalists; I will add that many  people from Kravchuk's team are now going over to Plyushch,  including the chiefs of the official mass media. The rating of  Moroz is relatively low. However, the leftists are the most  disciplined people and will certainly take an active part in  voting. Generally, Moroz could get 25-30 percent of the vote;  however, this is not enough to become president. However, if  Moroz withdraws his candidacy, the chances of L. Kuchma will be  preferable because only he and Moroz favor the reinforcement of  the CIS, the Economic Union, and other forms of integration,  which is what 80 percent of the citizens of Ukraine want. To my  mind, the tandem of President Leonid Kuchma and Chairman of the  Supreme Council Oleksandr Moroz is currently the optimal  scenario for Ukraine in which it is plainly impossible to not  reckon with the leftists' influence at present, and, at the same  time, it is extremely undesirable to yield full power to them.    It is safe to suggest that the current president feels the  most uncertain from among the "big five" candidates. By all  signs, Leonid Kravchuk' time is coming to an end. However, the  president does not want to go, all the more so because, in  keeping with our rules, everyone tries to kick those who are  leaving where it hurts. Kravchuk is doing everything he can to  prevent the presidential election in June. It appears that it  will be quite difficult, or virtually impossible to do at this  point. Aware that a majority on the issue of canceling the  election will not be gained without the leftists, L. Kravchuk is  beginning to flirt with O. Moroz, and not unsuccessfully at  that. Moroz has expressed his willingness to consider this  problem in the parliament on the condition that the president  comes out with the relevant initiative. In addition, the leftist  leader proposed to discuss in the Supreme Council the issue of  reducing presidential powers to the level of the head of state  rather than the executive authorities. I think that Kravchuk  would have agreed to that in order to keep anything at all.  However, in this case, an amendment to the Constitution is at  issue to which end 300 votes are necessary in a parliament that  now has just 336 deputies. Therefore, the success of this  endeavor is unlikely. Leonid Kravchuk cannot fail to understand  this, and for this reason his main bet is on the destabilization  of the general situation in Ukraine, which will give him a  pretext to impose a state of emergency and reschedule the  elections. This is why the "Crimean card" is being played now.    The wars in Nagorno-Karabakh, the Dniester area, Ossetia,  Ingushetia, Chechnya, and Abkhazia have claimed a great many  lives of the citizens of what once was a united state...where  the right of the people to self-government clashed with another  right--the right of the newly formed independent states to  sovereignty. Only the experience of Tatarstan in this area may  be considered favorable. I think that it should be used in  solving the Ukraine-Crimea problem, the Crimea being within  Ukraine but on a treaty basis. A treaty always envisions the  participation of at least two parties rather than unilateral  actions by the Kiev or Simferopol authorities.    On 24 May, Leonid Kuchma made a statement in which he  proposed a quite constructive scenario for solving the Crimean  problem. In particular, this statement says: "I am convinced  that the territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders  of Ukraine can and should be preserved while building relations  with the Crimea on the basis of a treaty and the Constitutions  of Ukraine and the Crimea." Considering Kuchma's good chances in  the election on 26 June, we may count on the successful  resolution of the conflict in the interest of both the Crimea  and entire Ukraine in the immediate future. To be sure, the  degree of readiness of the members of the Crimean parliament for  negotiations is not quite clear.    At the same time, the situation in the Supreme Council of  Ukraine has been sharply aggravated because the leftists and the  Unity faction that supported them have managed to elect their  people to the deputy speaker positions by majority votes. I  think that, for now, the words of the Rukh leader, Vyacheslav  Chornovil, to the effect that the Communists have accomplished a  parliamentary coup are nothing but a hyperbole; however, the  fact that the leftists have taken control of the entire  leadership of the parliament cannot but give rise to serious  concern.</p>

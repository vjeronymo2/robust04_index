			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Leading Article: After the round The US Senate's approval of the Uruguay Round has removed a great uncertainty overhanging the future of the world trade system. The trade deal's passage through Congress guarantees that it will go ahead, and that the World Trade Organisation will be set up as planned. Now that the foundations of the new order have been secured, work on its construction must get under way in earnest. The first priority is for other Gatt members, many of which have held back from ratifying the round until Congress voted, also to complete the process. The EU bears a particularly heavy responsibility, since any slippage on its part could delay implementation of the round. But it is desirable that as many other countries as possible also be ready to participate in the WTO from the outset. The second priority is to appoint a leader for the organisation. Gatt members are due this week to try to choose between three contenders: Mr Carlos Salinas, Mexico's former president; Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister; and Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade minister. However, regional and political rivalries risk producing a stalemate. That threat must be averted if the WTO is to fulfil the ambitious mandate given it by governments. The organisation's success depends crucially on strong and clear-sighted leadership, particularly in its early years. Failure to agree quickly on a candidate could leave it directionless. At least as damaging would be a repeat of the recent compromise over the top job at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, where Mr Jean-Claude Paye will continue as a caretaker for a further two years. The third pressing task is to conclude negotiations on China's WTO entry. China's effective integration into the multilateral trading system is vital to the future of the world economy. However, progress in the talks has been hampered by obduracy in both Washington and Beijing. The former continues to insist, unreasonably, that China join the WTO as a developed country. However, the latter still seems to be balking at the basic obligations of Gatt membership and the constraints they impose on policy. Congressional approval of the Uruguay Round should allow the Clinton administration more scope for flexibility on this issue. However, Beijing must also provide more convincing evidence that it is genuinely committed to respecting international rules. If the gap cannot be narrowed soon by the two governments' trade negotiators, their leaders may need to intervene directly in an effort to reach a political settlement.</p>

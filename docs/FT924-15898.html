			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / US Senate votes on military aid to Bosnia The US Senate voted on Wednesday to authorise Dollars 50m (Pounds 28m) in military aid to Bosnia in a signal of frustration and anger at new reports of massacres and aggression by Serbian attackers. The aid for Bosnia - military material from Defence Department stocks - would be conditional on lifting of a UN ban on supplying arms to the combatants and US allies being prepared to join the aid effort. Senator Joseph Biden, a Delaware Democrat, proposing the aid, said the UN embargo had left the people of Bosnia-Hercegovina unarmed against a ruthless and heavily armed enemy.</p>

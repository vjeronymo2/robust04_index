			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: American Airlines warning depresses shares in sector SHARES in the US airline sector fell heavily yesterday after American Airlines, one of the nation's 'big three' carriers, warned that second-quarter earnings would be 'significantly' below market expectations. Most analysts had been predicting a small profit - perhaps Dollars 75m - in the three-month period to end-June. This would have represented a significant improvement on the same period of 1992, when AMR, American Airlines' parent company, made an after-tax loss of Dollars 166m. Even excluding one-off charges from this figure still left last year with an underlying Dollars 48m deficit. Yesterday, however, American said that it had experienced slightly lower-than-anticipated traffic in May, and found that this trend was continuing into June. 'International performance continues to be very weak,' added the carrier. 'Yields are consistent with prior assumptions, so they are not offsetting the updated lower traffic estimates.' American's warning comes one day after USAir, the smaller US carrier in which British Airways holds a minority stake, warned that it would show after-tax losses for both the second quarter and for 1993 overall. Earlier this year, there had been hopes that the heavily loss-making airline sector was finally turning the corner, and airline shares took the latest news badly. AMR fell Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 61 1/2, Delta lost Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 48 1/8, and UAL, parent of Chicago-based United Airlines, shed Dollars 5 1/4 at Dollars 121 1/2 at the close. USAir, which had suffered on Wednesday, fell a further Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 16.</p>

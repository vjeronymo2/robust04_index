			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> In Moscow, the Supreme Soviet has drafted a decree that will give amnesty to  Soviet soldiers who were taken prisoner during the war in Afghanistan, the  government newspaper Izvestia reported. The amnesty also will offer a chance to  return home to soldiers who fled service in Afghanistan and ended up in the  United States and Canada, the newspaper said. Izvestia did not give any  numbers, but the Soviets officially list 311 soldiers as missing in action in  Afghanistan. The Soviet Union fought for nine years in Afghanistan, withdrawing  the last of its estimated 115,000 soldiers last February.  </P></p>

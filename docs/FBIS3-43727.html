			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The French ambassador today addressed a diplomatic  note to the Ministry of External Relations and Cooperation in  which he deeply deplored the fact that during a political  demonstration on 12 January some participants, after being  dispersed by the security forces, concluded their demonstration  by stoning the French Embassy, especially the offices of the  Mission of Cooperation and Cultural Action. A number of windows  were broken.    He also expressed his concern that the demonstrators later  moved on to the Rwandan Embassy and that stones were thrown at  other buildings situated on Uprona Avenue and at stationary  cars. The ambassador sent a strong protest against the actions.  He expressed to the competent Burundi authorities the wish that  steps be taken in the future to avoid a recurrence.    In a communique, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  Cooperation of the Republic of Rwanda has expressed its feelings  to the Ministry of External Relations and Cooperation of the  Republic Of burundi and informed the latter that it was dismayed  to learn of the violation, resulting in great damage, of the  premises of the Embassy of the Republic of Rwanda in Bujumbura  yesterday by Burundian citizens.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation also  protested most vigorously against this lapse by the Government  of the Republic of Burundi, given the provisions of the 18 April  1961 Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, especially  Article 22, Paragraph Two. [passage omitted]    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the  Republic of Rwanda insisted that the Ministry of External  Relations and Cooperation of the Republic of Burundi assume its  responsibilities by ensuring the security of the personnel,  property, and premises of the Rwandan Embassy in Bujumbura and  by quickly proceeding to repair all the damage caused to the  Rwandan Embassy in Bujumbura.    It is also worth noting that today Jean-Marie Ngendahayo,  Burundian minister of external relations, Rwandan Ambassador to  Burundi Sylvestre Uwibajije, and other diplomats accredited to  Bujumbura visited the buildings of the Rwandan and French  Embassies damaged during demonstrations yesterday by youths from  opposition parties. They took the opportunity to assess the  extent of the damage. At the end of the visit, the Rwandan  ambassador to Burundi said that yesterday's attack on the  premises of the Rwandan Embassy in Bujumbura was an act of  provocation, but since Rwanda supported peaceful and  good-neighborly ties, it refuses to be led into hostilities  provoked by groups of antidemocratic people.    Burundian Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo regretted  the violence which occurred yesterday. He called on Burundian  political parties to instill in their members the ideals of  democracy. He regretted that the violence took place at a time  when those in charge of the main Burundian political forces are  discussing at the office of the president an accord on the  principle of a truce aimed at allowing the return of peace in  the country.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Books: Private life of the Master / Review of a fresh appraisal of Noel Coward's life and work NOEL COWARD by Clive Fisher Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 17.99, 288 pages I SUPPOSE there still are one or two people in their eighties or nineties who remember seeing Noel and Gertie in the original production of Private Lives in 1930. Many of us have listened to their surviving recording, now available on cassette and CD, of the the balcony scene. Somehow even at the umpteenth hearing it never fails to raise a chuckle or two. No later Amanda  -not even the wonderful Kay Hammond - could invest the lines with quite the degree of murderous innuendo conveyed by Gertrude Lawrence. HE: You said Norfolk was flat. SHE: That was no reflection on her, unless she made it flatter. The joke there shifts a gear from marital discord to encompass Coward's urge to make fun of the female form. It was not finally her lack of talent that debarred the daughter of Mrs Worthington from a stage career but, you will recall, 'the width of her seat/ That would surely defeat/ Her chances of success . . .' The songs, which in his new book about Coward Clive Fisher tends to undervalue, gleefully describe women who make fools of themselves; such as the elderly American widow, Mrs Wentworth-Brewster by name, who discovered (pause) 'just in the nick of time (pause) that life was for living . . .' and, to the dismay of her family, allowed herself to be goosed by Italian sailors in a bar on the Piccolo Marina on Capri. The Master was not just gay; he was - let us face it - beneath the veneer of charm an old-fashioned male chauvinist pig to boot. In 1985, while he was making his farewell appearance in London in Suite in Three Keys, Coward gave a revealing piece of advice to John Osborne: ' 'I understand you've been a very silly boy. You must never trust a woman.' 'But you've so many women friends,' I protested. More than I had. 'No matter. Never trust 'em and never, never marry them. Which you appear to do.'' (from Osborne's Almost A Gentleman) There were, though, as Clive Fisher points out, two or three women who were of crucial importance in Coward's life. The first and most important was Violet (nee Veitch) who married Arthur Coward, a travelling piano salesman, and in December 1899 gave birth to Noel Peirce Coward at their house in Waldegrave Road, Teddington. He remained devoted to her for the remainder of her long life. Then there was Mrs Astley Cooper, the Edwardian hostess based in Rutland, who took up the young Noel Coward before he was famous, and gave him his first insight into the mores of the country house set (see Easy Virtue). And lastly there was Esme Wynne, the child performer who trained with him for the stage. She seemed all set for success but then abandoned the stage on her marriage to Lynden Tyson. As Esme Wynne-Tyson she became a devout Christian Scientist and pursued a new career as a writer on ethical and religious matters. Fisher's book contains a charming photograph of Noel and Esme during the First World War. The information Fisher has gathered from Jon Wynne-Tyson, the publisher, about the bond that formed between Coward and his mother in these obscure early years sheds a sharp little ray of fresh light on our hero's hard slog before success came with The Vortex. Fisher is also able to be much franker than was Sheridan Morley about Coward's male lovers, notably Jack Wilson, the good-looking American stockbroker who became (disastrously) his business manager and (successfully) his sexual partner for many years. Otherwise the biographical facts are mainly taken from secondary sources: Coward's own autobiographies and diaries; Sheridan Morley's biography; and the published diaries of friends like Cecil Beaton. Among the theatre critics Tynan is quoted ad infinitum and so is Agate, who was Coward's direct contemporary and often shrewd about his plays. The value of Fisher's book is partly as a concise biography but more in the detached view it offers of Coward's whole career. It is the first Coward book from a member of a generation for whom Coward is now an established part of theatrical history. This writer about Coward would have been a child of 10 in 1973, the year Coward died. He is coolly immune to the myth of the Master woven so assiduously and lucratively by Coward during his lifetime. From this detached perspective Fisher goes thoroughly through the canon, dealing perceptively with the forgotten or suppressed plays like the torrid Maughamesque Point Valaine, with the late half-successes like Relative Values and Nude With Violin as well giving the smash-hits, Hay Fever, Blithe Spirit, etc. a fresh appraisal. In all this Fisher has some valuable apercus on Coward's range of subject-matter, much wider than you might suppose, and he points to some of the glaring contradictions in Coward. He was both a cynic and a sentimental patriot, the utterer of that resounding tear-jerking toast to 'this England of ours' in Cavalcade but who ultimately opted to live abroad as a tax exile in Switzerland. And like Rattigan he was a homosexual who was always careful to play it straight before his adoring public. Fisher pays a handsome concluding tribute to the 'solipsistic energy' and magical gifts that gave rise to these discrepancies.</p>

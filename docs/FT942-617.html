			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Mexicans aim to raise Dollars 600m Three Mexican companies plan to offer a total of more than Dollars 600m in equity on international markets this week. The offerings will test the receptiveness of investors to Mexican paper in the light of recent political instability and less than two months before presidential elections. Grupo DESC, a large industrial conglomerate, will float 10.5 per cent of its capital via an American depositary shares (ADS) offering, being co-ordinated by Goldman Sachs, and a domestic offering underwritten by Inver Mexico. The company hopes to raise between Dollars 200m and Dollars 235m, with proceeds to be used primarily for new investments in car components, property and food. 'Analysts have been telling us that they are looking less at Mexico as a whole and more at company particulars,' said one adviser to the offering. 'We hope that is the case here because we believe our risk is lower than that of Mexico in general,' he added. Banpais, a medium-sized bank that recently bought Asemex, the country's largest insurance company, from the Mexican government, plans to sell around 20 per cent of its capital for about Dollars 170m. The ADS offering, accounting for 85 per cent of the shares being offered, is underwritten by S. G. Warburg. Grupo Sidek, a constructor specialising in tourist developments and hotel operations, also expects to raise Dollars 200m this week with its own ADS offering being co-ordinated by James Capel. Sidek originally considered a Eurobond issue instead of a share offering, but felt that the bond market was treating Mexican companies too 'generically'. The success of these issues is being watched closely by a number of other Mexican companies which are anxious to raise money via equity offerings but unsure of how to time them effectively in view of the August 21 election.</p>

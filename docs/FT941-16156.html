			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Thais ease rules for foreign banks Thailand's cabinet yesterday approved a financial liberalisation package which allows foreign banks with offshore banking licences to open branches outside Bangkok, relaxes foreign exchange controls, and encourages Thai finance and securities companies to separate the two sides of their business. The reforms, which fulfil government promises made last year, were approved a week before a visit to Thailand by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary. Mr Bentsen is expected to ask Thailand to open its protected financial services sector to more foreign competition following last month's completion of the Uruguay Round of Gatt world trade talks. Foreign banks with offshore licences under the Bangkok International Banking Facility will be allowed to establish two branches outside Bangkok, and each branch will be able to lend up to Bt1bn (Pounds 26m) in Thai baht as well as granting foreign currency loans. Some foreign bankers were doubtful about the advantages of opening BIBF branches outside Bangkok, but the government is expected to announce further reforms which would permit foreign banks to operate full conventional branches in the provinces. 'What we are really waiting for is the day when we can handle payments and do foreign exchange like a full branch,' said Mr Anders Lundquist, chief representative of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken in Bangkok. 'We see the BIBF as a stepping stone to a full branch.' Mr David Hendrix, general manager of Citibank Thailand, said he thought some bankers would act on the proposal for upcountry BIBF branches, particularly since multinational and other companies were tending to move out of Bangkok to less congested locations in the provinces. 'It's all healthy and it's all moving in the right direction,' Mr Hendrix said. As well as confronting Thailand's 15 commercial banks with limited competition from foreign banks, the government has decided to allow Thai finance companies to open provincial loan offices. Initially, they will be able to lend money, and after two years those that are sufficiently sound will be permitted to take deposits. Ultimately they may be upgraded to banks.</p>

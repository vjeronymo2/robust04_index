			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The report prepared by Turkish security circles  about relations between the PKK [Kurdistan Workers' Party] and  Armenia--about which we wrote based on material from ZAMAN--is  the subject of a front-page article in today's CUMHURIYET. The  article notes that the PKK, in collaboration with ASALA  [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] will launch  an attack on Turkey next spring. The article also says that  Armenian villages near the Turkish border offer support of all  types to the PKK.    Goksel Polad writes [in CUMHURIYET] that the Turkish  security  circles assume that PKK guerrillas trained in camps in Armenia  will launch attacks against Turkey from the Armenian border in  the spring of 1994, together with ASALA militants. The report by  the Security Directorate General notes that the PKK has  established camps in Armenian villages near the Turkish border  inhabited by Armenians of Kurdish ancestry hostile to Turkey.    PKK militants train in camps in the Bekaa in Lebanon and  Zeli  in northern Iraq, together with ASALA militants. The said report  provides the following information about Armenian-PKK relations:    ASALA militants are trained in PKK camps in Jordan and  Syria.  Trained ASALA militants recruit new guerrillas and procure  armaments [for the PKK]. This assistance continues today.    [PKK leader] Abdullah Ocalan [Apo], who receives aid from  Armenia and ASALA, conducts ties with Armenia personally. He has  established training camps in Armenian villages near the Turkish  border, and training is under way in those camps today. These  activities are carried out with the knowledge and complicity of  the Armenian government. The camps are in villages inhabited by  Armenians of Kurdish ancestry hostile to Turkey.    The PKK and ASALA militants trained in these camps will  attack Turkey from Armenia's borders in the near future,  probably in the spring of 1994.    The report also enumerates the names of the villages that  support the PKK. Those are: Mirek, Reya, Taze, Elegez (Alagiaz),  Shengani, Derik, Afshin, Suphan, Chumushvan, Senger, Amritaze in  the Aragadz region; Barazh, Hako, Delto, Sorik, Kabaktepe,  Tellik, Sichanli, Baysich in the Talin region; Ferik in the  Echmiadzin region; and Shamran in the Ashtarak region (these  names are given as published in CUMHURIYET).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Li Nanling (2621 0589 3781) and Zhang Yijun </F> (1728 4135 0193)]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- "Chinese-invested  enterprises' active participation in Hong Kong's economic  development has continually enhanced the `China factor' in Hong  Kong's economic growth in recent years and helped ensure Hong  Kong's smooth transition and economic prosperity," said Huang  Diyan, deputy to the Second Session of the Eighth National  People's Congress who is vice chairman of the Board of Directors  and concurrently director of Hong Kong and Macao Office of the  Bank of China, when he assessed the role of Chinese enterprises  in Hong Kong's economy.    He said: Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong have expanded  rapidly in the past nine years since it entered the transitional  period in 1985. Thanks to the opportunities provided by the  hinterland's reform and opening up, old Chinese enterprises --  such as the China Resources Group, Merchants Steam Navigation  Group, International Travel Service, Bank of China, and People's  Insurance Company -- have advanced by leaps and bounds, each  with a total asset reaching from 1 to as much as several hundred  billion Hong Kong dollars [HK$]. The groups' business  activities have become internationalized and diversified. For  example, the Bank of China Group, with over HK$400 billion in  deposits and HK$700 billion in assets, has become the second  largest financial group in Hong Kong. New Chinese- enterprises  -- such as the International Trust and Investment Corporation,  Everbright, Construction International, Guangdong Enterprises  Group, and many others -- have developed vigorously and  attracted broad attention.    He said: Chinese enterprises are playing an increasingly  important role in Hong Kong's economic activities. The China  Resourses Group and other enterprises, which transport and  manage all kinds of basic means of subsistence, especially those  supplied by the hinterland, have played an active role in  stabilizing the livelihood of the compatriots and curbing  inflation in Hong Kong. The China Merchants Steam Navigation  Company and Guangdong Enterprises Group have also occupied a  very important position in Hong Kong's maritime and inland  navigation, especially navigation linking to the hintherland's  ports. The Bank of China Group has channeled its more than  HK$200 billion loans to support Hong Kong's industry, commerce,  and infrastructure, and to meet the demand for capital by  various sectors of society. Last year, the group issued loans  amounting to HK$16 billion to support local industry and HK$100  billion to help local residents buy housing units in installment  payments. The Bank of China Group has also actively helped the  local authorities stabilize Hong Kong's financial markets many  times and maintain the sound operation of Hong Kong banking and  stock businesses, thereby winning praise from Hong Kong society.    Huang Diyan concluded: In the future, Chinese enterprises in  Hong Kong should step up efforts to build up their strength and  strengthen the economic foundation for Hong Kong's smooth  transition. He added: Chinese enterprises should not only play  an important role in economic activities but also strive to be  their own spokesman politically and have their own  representatives in the Legislative Council's function groups.</p>

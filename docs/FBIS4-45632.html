			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, April 25--The Prime Minister, Mr P.V.  Narasimha Rao, today underlined the need for a proper balance  between development and environment, reports PTI.    Presiding over the first meeting of the National Environment  Council (NEC) here, Mr Rao reiterated government's commitment to  alleviate poverty through development but cautioned that the  race for development should not be at the cost of damaging the  nature.    The Prime Minister stressed for a proper blend of  technological advances with the ancient wisdom to ensure that  one could live in harmony with nature. "We must look for our own  innovation to meet the pollution control requirements," he said,  adding that the choice of methods should be limited to least  pollution ones.    The 112-member body was constituted recently by the  government to function as a "think-tank" on important  environment policy matters and to advise the ministry of  environment and forests. The Prime Minister is the chairman with  minister for environment and forests as the vice chairman.    The council includes all state and Union territory ministers  for environment, secretaries of several ministries and  departments of Central government, heads of national  institutions and representatives from commerce and industry,  eminent environmentalists, journalists and activists.    The Prime Minister said that the role of the ministry to  control pollution and promote balanced growth through  environmental impact assessment should not be considered as an  impediment in development. It should be viewed as an enabling  one, he said.    Calling for greater efforts towards afforestation, he  expressed his happiness that the scheme has started bearing  fruits as shown by satellite imagery.    He recalled that the late prime minister, Ms Indira Gandhi,  was the only head of government in 1972 to focus the world  attention on environment which has caught the attention of the  whole world today.    Saying that co-operation at international level was the only  way for survival, the Prime Minister said the developed world  has the technology to deal with the situation while the  developing countries like India have the traditional ethos and  "there the two have to supplement each other."    Welcoming the delegates, the minister of state for  environment and forests, Mr Kamal Nath said the NEC has been  constituted as the protection of environment was not the sole  preserve of a single ministry.    He said it was not even within the exclusive capability of  the government system as a whole, whether at the Centre or the  states.    Mr Kamal Nath said that there is a feeling that his ministry  should present an environment survey of the country to  Parliament every year, parallel to the economic survey. This  survey should project the extent of nature of the "environmental  deficit" together with the strategy to reduce it.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Oil-rich Nigeria queues for petrol At first glance, business seems to be booming at the Mobil filling station in Awolowo Road, Lagos. The forecourt is jammed with cars in a queue which stretches two abreast a quarter of a mile down the road. But the pumps have been dry for nine days and this month's sales are about 80 per cent below average. 'Some of these drivers have been waiting here for nine days to buy fuel. I am getting to know some of them quite well,' says Mr Alex Enwesi, the manager of the Mobil station. 'I don't know when the next delivery of fuel will come, and these people are prepared to wait because they know that here when I have fuel they can buy it at the official price.' Mr Enwesi has four kinds of insurance for staff, cash, stock and equipment, as well as the Mobil corporate cover, and life assurance for himself. The risk of fire with all these vehicles, fights when tempers get short or even riots are never far away. The police and the army are not far away either but sometimes they are more of a hindrance than a help. The sight of a military patrol van and armed troops at the head of an irate queue raises the temperature every time. Overnight queues for fuel have become a common sight for among Nigerians who, for years, have taken very cheap fuel for granted. The strike against military rule by Nigeria's oil workers is in its seventh week and in Africa's richest oil producing country petrol, diesel and kerosene are precious commodities. Oil marketing companies estimate that fuel supply is less than 20 per cent of normal demand in the Lagos area, which accounts for about 40 per cent of Nigeria's demand. Other than on foot, there is no alternative to road transport and for most of the estimated 6m people in the sprawling city there are three choices: queue and hope to buy fuel at the official price of N3.25 (a mere 5p) a litre; buy it on the black market for anywhere between N30 and N50 a litre; or do without fuel. Nigeria's main oil refinery, in Port Harcourt, is out of action until Monday at the earliest due to a strike by workers in protest at action by heavy-handed army guards. The next biggest refinery, Warri, has not resumed operation since an overhaul in April and the small refinery in Kaduna in the north produces little fuel. Most of the 16 state-owned depots have very little product, tanker drivers in the south are still on strike and the private sector's terminals in Apapa port, Lagos, get occasional imports by ship. All of this is bad news for the filling stations who play by the rules. 'Being a dealer is not a lucrative job at present' admits Mr Enwesi, who took over his service station after a successful career in marketing with Mobil Nigeria, one of the big six fuel marketing companies in Nigeria. 'I make my living as a dealer from commission selling Mobil's products. When supply is not made regularly, when you want it, it is hard to cover overheads. Before the strike I sold about 800,000 litres of petrol and kerosene a month, now I am getting about 150,000.' Unlike some dealers, Mr Enwesi does not put fuel aside. If a station is caught hoarding or selling into jerry cans the military Task Force on Petroleum Products can close him down. The phone in his office rings. 'Yes, the workshop is open. Fuel? that is a scarce commodity.' Mr Enwesi apologises to the caller, not a regular customer just someone desperate. Mr Enwesi's predicament is typical of millions in Lagos. 'They are striking for civilian rule and democracy, which I support, but it is hurting the common person. What pains me most is that there is no sign that the government and opposition are sitting down to talk. I don't see an end to it.'</p>

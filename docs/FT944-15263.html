			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Further defence likely from Attwoods Attwoods, the waste services company fighting a hostile Pounds 364m bid from Browning-Ferris Industries of the US, is expected to publish a second defence document towards the end of next week. Much could depend on this document, with US investors expecting to take a firm view on the offer after its publication. 'At this stage, the question is will Attwoods be able to put enough arguments in the second document or give a profits forecast to keep investors in the shares', one shareholder said. The document is likely to include further details on prospects for 1995 and indications on the value of Attwoods' assets and business. A third document, which could include its first quarter results, is also expected before November 11. This is the last date for publication of new financial information and should reinforce earlier indications on 1995 profits. This could put BFI under increased pressure to raise its bid, following Attwoods' results last week which showed improvements in core operations. Institutions are believed to want either an increase, or an equity alternative. An equity option is unlikely, however, given the effect on BFI's earnings. BFI is offering 109p in cash and has received acceptance from Attwoods' 29.8 per cent shareholder, Laidlaw of Canada. A further 25 per cent is held by two institutions in the US, Fidelity and Templeton Investments. Fidelity has recently reduced its stake from almost 14 per cent to less than 12 per cent. Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods' chief executive, is due to begin a round of presentations in the US today. He will argue the bid undervalues his company. It is already clear that institutions accept BFI's argument that future growth will come through providing integrated waste services.</p>

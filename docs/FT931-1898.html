			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / EC pact on monitoring emissions EC ENVIRONMENT ministers last night agreed standardised mechanisms to monitor the Twelve's commitments to cut carbon dioxide emissions. Policing this main greenhouse gas will highlight whether measures planned so far can meet the EC's undertaking to stabilise CO output at 1990 levels by 2000. It could thus underline the need for the European Commission's controversial carbon/energy tax if conventional energy efficiency measures, designed to cut emissions and combat global warming, prove insufficient. Agreement was held up by British insistence that a clear difference be established between monitoring and implementation, and that responsibility for measuring emissions should lie squarely with each member state. But wider differences among the Twelve over the EC strategy to fight global warming while protecting competitive advantage in the middle of a recession were also on display. How to share out the cuts has not been resolved. EC environment commissioner Ioannis Paleokrassas said that national programmes to cut CO output would still see emissions at 3 per cent over 1990 levels in 2000, underlining the need for the tax Brussels wanted. The tax would put Dollars 3 (Pounds 2.10) on each barrel of oil equivalent, rising to Dollars 10 by 2000, with half on the fuel content of all non-renewable fuel and half on its carbon content. Industry is hostile to the tax because of its implications for competition, despite the US administration's recent proposal to tax fuel. But northern countries such as Germany, Holland and Denmark strongly back the tax. They have set themselves higher emission reduction targets - and some countries fear these more difficult goals could creep into any form of monitoring which bordered on policing. The UK is reticent, and more so after its recent decision to levy its own fuel taxes. Spain is strongly opposed to the tax, arguing that richer countries that emit more CO should be set higher cuts.</p>

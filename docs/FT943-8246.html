			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Job support scheme for disabled is a concession, not a subsidy Sir, Your report ('Whitehall error over disabled workers', August 17) incorrectly links the Priority Suppliers Scheme, which Mr Portillo has just scrapped, with 'subsidised schemes for the disabled'. The Priority Suppliers Scheme allows companies employing mainly disabled workers a chance to make a second bid for government contracts to match the winning tender. As such, it is not a subsidy but a concession. Government contracts secured through the scheme are always at the lowest price. Therefore, the government will achieve neither savings nor lower tenders as a result of scrapping the scheme. However, the jobs of hundreds of disabled people, such as the 200 people employed in our supported workshops at Papworth, will in fact be put at risk because, as you report, Whitehall officials made a mistake. Mr Portillo and his officials should now move quickly to mitigate the worst effects of the new directive, something they admit should have been done in the first place. Harpal Kumar, chief executive, The Papworth Trust, Papworth Everard, Cambs, CB3 8RG</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Macmillan Bloedel warns of losses MACMILLAN BLOEDEL, 49 per cent owned by Noranda Forest, Canada's biggest forest products group, warned that British Columbia's five-week-old pulp-and-paper strike could curtail its sawmill and logging operations. This would have a heavy financial impact on Macmillan's third quarter, said Mr Robert Findlay, president. Macmillan is a large timber exporter to the US, Asia and Europe. 'The impact of the strike was not significant in the second quarter, but the short-term outlook depends directly on the length of the strike,' he said. Two unions representing 13,000 pulp-and-paper mill workers have shut down 19 British Columbia mills, including most of Macmillan's operations. Chips are piling up at sawmills across British Columbia, threatening timber production cuts. Macmillan reported a first-half loss of CDollars 18.1m (USDollars 15m), or 20 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 7.5m, or 13 cents, a year earlier. Sales were CDollars 1.49bn against Dollars 1.4bn. Second-quarter loss equalled 8 cents a share, against a loss of 13 cents a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 775m against CDollars 728m. Pulp prices improved but newsprint remained weak.</p>

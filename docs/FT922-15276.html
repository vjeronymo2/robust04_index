			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Harrisons Three years ago, Harrisons &amp; Crosfield's then chairman proclaimed that the main objectives of the business were consistent growth of earnings per share and a dividend on average twice covered. That petard duly blew up when yesterday's annual results showed the lowest earnings per share since 1983, and a maintained dividend which was a mere four-fifths covered. Were it not for the 10 per cent yield on its shares, H&amp;C might be in danger of finding itself friendless at a vulnerable point in the economic cycle. Granted, last year saw vigorous cost-cutting and a cash flow strong enough to justify the pay-out. Barring a sudden recovery in the economy, that trick will be harder to pull off this year. More disposals will be needed to generate sufficient cash for another 9p dividend, especially after the Pounds 67m acquisition of BOCM-Silcock from Unilever. H&amp;C management clearly wants to play to its strengths in agriculture. The deal looks good value, even though it takes gearing to an uncomfortable 52 per cent. The question for shareholders is whether it will pay to wait around until the cyclical chemicals and building materials businesses are making a better return. Long-term holders have seen their investment decline by more than half relative to the market since 1982, but have also stumped up money for a steady flow of acquisitions. Now they must regard the shares as a fixed-income investment at least until the end of next year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Feb. 13, IRNA -- A Persian daily Sunday  commented on the 10-day ultimatum given by the NATO to the Serbs  and termed it as a propaganda maneuver to deceive the world  public opinion.    In a statement released on Wednesday, the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization (NATO) issued a 10-day ultimatum calling the  Serbs to withdraw their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo  within a radius of 20 kms.    In its editorial, 'JOMHURI ESLAMI' said that on the first  encounter, the statement was expected to be a response to the  demands of the world public opinion to end atrocities against  Bosnian Muslims.    However, a careful study of the context of the statement  shows that once again NATO is following the policy of  procrastination and is only posing as a decisive organization.  Furthermore, it wants to make the world believe that it has  made an effective and resolute decision.    The evidence available indicates to the fact that the main  objective of the statement is mere publicity and that NATO would  never enter into the scene against the Serbs who are carrying  out the same mission favored by the U.S. and Europe.    It said that the U.S. and Europe were making efforts to  provide further grounds to facilitate implementation of the  mission by the Serbs.    NATO's goal is to pretend it has managed to take a stance  against the Serbs while under the status quo the United States  and Europe are working on an agreement to dismember Bosnia.    It turned to the statements issued by the Non-Aligned  Movement (NAM) and the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC),  calling for a severe stand by the Security Council and the NATO  against Serbs, and said that NAM has never shown decisiveness at  decisionmaking level.    If NAM and the OIC use their deterrent levers to settle the  Bosnian crisis, they have the necessary potentials, the daily  noted, adding that this will be materialized in practice when  all members have unity of expression and determination.</p>

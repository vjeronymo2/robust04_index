			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Sutcliffe Speakman keeps up momentum as loss falls SUTCLIFFE Speakman, the carbon filter and environmental protection systems group rescued from bankruptcy early last year, continued its strong recovery in the six months ended September 30, but failed to make it back to profit. Pre-tax losses fell from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 560,000, on lower turnover of Pounds 13m (Pounds 14.6m). Operating losses were reduced to Pounds 235,000 (Pounds 842,000) and an improving cashflow helped to cut borrowings from Pounds 7.07m to Pounds 6.2m. Interest charges fell to Pounds 338,000 (Pounds 624,000). Losses per share were 0.5p (1.6p). Mr Shaun Mahony, finance director, said the group made an operating profit in the second quarter which was maintained in October and November, despite 'poor trading conditions'. There were encouraging signs of economic recovery in the US, where Barnebey &amp; Sutcliffe improved profits and won new orders from the nuclear and water industries. An increasing contribution from the environmental protection division would benefit second half results with the completion of Pounds 5.5m worth of contracts in the UK and US, first announced in July. Mr Mahony said Sutcliffe had recently restored links with Lanka Carbons. The group will assist Lanka in developing and manufacturing a range of higher-value carbons which would help Sutcliffe restructure its UK and US manufacturing operations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Mateus; from the "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Rear Admiral Hernan Gruber Odreman, leader of the 27  November 1992 military uprising, as well as four other officers  and a civilian were released this morning. They were all  beneficiaries of the pardon announced by President Rafael  Caldera.    Rear Admiral Gruber Odreman abandoned his sickbed at the  military hospital and before going home to continue resting on  the recommendation of his doctors, who had performed surgery on  him, he stopped to talk to journalists. At that time he  justified the military uprisings in many ways. He said his  plans were for the president's pardon to benefit him once all  the subordinates who accompanied him during the 27 November  uprising are released. However, since that is not currently the  case, he did not ask for a discharge.    [Begin Gruber recording] Undoubtedly, no one should be  afraid. I -- and I am sure the same went for my companeros --  never had the idea of rebelling against the government. I want  to emphatically state, however, that we have always observed the  laws and the regulations of the armed institution. We heeded  the spirit of Article 28 of the National Armed Forces Law, which  more or less states: No one is forced to do more than is  demanded of him but in all unforeseen accidents or incidents  military officers must join the ranks leading toward the banners  that are most fitting for military honor. We, therefore, ask  ourselves: What banners are we going to follow? I am referring  to the circumstances under which we were forced to rebel.  Should we join the black banner of the nation's moral and  physical rottenness or the banner of dignity, honor, and  justice? That was the feeling and spirit of all my companeros  that led us to rebel at that time. I do not believe the same  conditions exist under the present circumstances because the  leader of the nation is a man in whom all Venezuelans and  especially the officers of the National Armed Forces have placed  their trust. [end recording]    Later, General Raul Alejandro Salazar, chief of the 3d  Infantry Division, pointed out that President Caldera also  pardoned the following persons:    [Begin Salazar recording] Today the president of the  Republic  pardoned Rear Adm. Hernan Gruber Odreman, Aviation Lieutenant  Luis Miguel Magallanes Andrades, Aviation Lt. Rafael Arturo  Brito, Aviation Lt. Edgar (Cruz) Arteaga, National Guard Lt.  Franklin Garcia Duque, and citizen German Robles. [end recording]    Rear Adm. Gruber Odreman said that he is willing to request  his discharge from the Armed Forces just as he had announced  when he met with the president of the Republic.</p>

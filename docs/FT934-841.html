			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dutch gas deal threatens 'horizon pollution' - Ronald van de Krol on plans for exploratory drilling in a much prized nature reserve The Dutch are bracing themselves for a short bout of 'horizon pollution' in one of their best-loved nature reserves. Last week, under a deal worked out with three natural gas companies, the government cleared the way for exploratory drilling in the Wadden Sea, a much prized beauty spot that each year attracts millions of migratory birds  -as well as thousands of Dutch and German tourists. The prospect of drilling platforms has prompted environmental campaigners in this intensely flat country to decry what they see as 'horizon pollution', a uniquely Dutch preoccupation. However, they are far more concerned about the long-term dangers of seabed subsidence, the possibility of an oil and gas 'blow-out' and disruption to wildlife, both in the sea itself and on the Wadden (or West Frisian) Islands. In keeping with the environmental sensitivity of the area, the government has said that actual commercial exploitation of the gas fields beneath the sea must be done 'laterally' for at least the next five years. This means that any production platforms will have to be located elsewhere, probably on the Dutch mainland, the Wadden Islands or the North Sea, with drilling taking place at an oblique angle from some distance away rather than straight above the gas field, as would normally be the case. The drawback to lateral drilling is that it may be able to extract only about 70 per cent of the Wadden Sea gas. The rest will have to be considered unrecoverable, unless direct drilling in the sea is permitted after the year 2000. This month's agreement, which must be worked out in detail in early 1994, is a delicate and controversial compromise between economic and environmental considerations. It means that, although there will be no permanent drilling sites in the Wadden Sea over the next five years, there will be exploratory drilling at 21 sites over the period. Of these sites, about half will be in the sea itself, with the rest planned for the surrounding area. Exploratory drilling will be limited to the winter months, when the area is not visited by as many migratory birds, and to about three months per exploration site. The three energy companies - Elf Petroland, Mobil and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, a joint venture between Shell and Esso - are confident that they can produce gas from the Wadden Sea without running environmental risks. In 1984, the three companies, which hold long-term concessions in the area, agreed to a 10-year moratorium on exploration and drilling. The voluntary stand-still expires on January 10, and the new agreement will cover the next five years until 1999. What is still unclear, however, is whether the gas companies will be able to drill directly in the Wadden Sea once the latest agreement expires. The Wadden Sea's environmental significance means that little detailed work has been done until now on assessing its natural gas riches. The area clearly has potential to yield natural gas because it is sandwiched between the huge Slochteren gas field in the Dutch province of Groningen and the gas fields in the North Sea and the continental shelf. Rough estimates for the amount of gas located between the Wadden Sea range from 72bn to 221bn cubic metres, representing a monetary value of between Fl 14bn (Dollars 7.4bn) and Fl 44.2bn. Well over the half of the proceeds would flow into state coffers. If the Wadden Sea proved to contain 221bn cu m, this would be equivalent to nearly three full years of Dutch gas production at current rates of extraction. The government says that its cautious opening of the Wadden Sea to exploration is motivated not so much by financial gain as by the desire to bolster its 'small fields' strategy for the natural gas sector. This strategy aims to preserve, as far as possible, the Groningen field, which is still the largest gas field discovered so far in western Europe. Unlike most gas fields, Groningen can quickly raise or lower its output in response to seasonal or other types of fluctuation in demand, making Dutch gas sales more flexible than they would otherwise be. By giving priority to finding and exploiting smaller fields in places like the Wadden Sea, the Netherlands hopes to be able to use its Groningen gas to greater effect. 'Seen in this light, the potential gas reserves under the Wadden Sea are of great importance,' the ministers of economic affairs and of the environment said in a letter to parliament.</p>

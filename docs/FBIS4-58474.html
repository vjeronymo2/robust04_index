			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of "exclusive" interview with Musavi-Nezhad, </F> director general of internal security at the Information  Ministry, by unidentified IRNA correspondent; place and date not  given]    [Excerpts] The director general for internal security at  the Information Ministry Musavi-Nezhad participated in an  exclusive interview with the IRNA correspondent and answered  questions on some terrorist actions inside Iran. The text is as  follows:    [IRNA] What are the results of the follow-up by the  Information Ministry regarding the assassination attempt against  the acting Mashhad Friday imam, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin  'Aba'i?    [Musavi-Nezhad] On 22 April Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin was  attacked by an armed person from among those praying after the  Friday prayers ended. An investigation revealed that the  assailant was named 'Ali Huri Papi, from Haft Tappeh in  Khuzestan Province, who had joined the Monafeqin [meaning  hypocrites--pejorative term for Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization,  MKO] and had managed to acquire a Makarov through some common  acquaintances. The Monafeqin continue their armed terrorist  actions because of their inherent nature, as they have not  evolved a definite political form. [passage omitted on previous  MKO operations].    [IRNA] Where did the arrest of Sa'idi-Sirjani--the  well-known writer of the idolatrous [shah's] era take place?  Could you give us some details of the inquiry that has taken  place and its outcome?    [Musavi-Nezhad] Sa'idi-Sirjani was arrested along with  another person Mohammad Sadeq Sa'id, alias Niaz Kermani. He was  traced to a network of drugs and immorality and was arrested by  the antidrug officials. Both have confessed to their guilt.  However, after an investigation into their past records, Sa'idi  and Niaz Kermani were found to have links and collaboration with  the SAVAK and were handed over to the Information Ministry.    According to the SAVAK documents, Sa'idi-Sirjani has a shady  past and was mentioned in these documents as one who had been  reporting about revolutionary and combatant elements to the  SAVAK. In a letter in 1348 [year beginning 21 March 1969]  written to the SAVAK, he clearly admitted to writing in favor of  the shah's regime and of cooperating with the SAVAK. There is  also evidence of his links with foreign intelligence services.    Niaz Kermani was also a SAVAK official and continued his  links with the covert network of SAVAK elements even after the  victory of the revolution. For quite some time, he has been  living in hiding since the discovery of a coupist network [not  further identified]. Both the accused have admitted to the  following charges in the interrogation:    1. The transport, distribution, and use of narcotics and  inducting new members into the network in Kerman and Tehran by  means of clandestine agreements according to which the drugs  were delivered to them.    2. The production, storage, and distribution of alcoholic  beverages.    3. Indulging in immoral, obscene, and homosexual orgies  codenamed "Kashk va bademjan" [literally dried curds and  eggplant].    4. Links with the network of former SAVAK officials involved  in the Nowzheh coup attempt, planting bombs, and membership in  the espionage network of the Rafizadeh brothers in the United  States.    5. Receiving considerable sums in foreign exchange from the  counterrevolutionary networks based in the United States and  Europe and foreign remittances which were deposited in  Sa'idi-Sirjani's accounts in the United States and Britain.    [IRNA] At the conclusion of the interview, the director  general for internal security of the Information Ministry  clarified that the inquiries are continuing in order to identify  their internal and external links. The outcome of this inquiry  will be divulged at a later date.</p>

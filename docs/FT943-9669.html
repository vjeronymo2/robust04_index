			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Complaints to City regulator at record low The number of complaints against members of the Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulating body for the securities industry, fell in 1993-94 to its lowest annual level. The authority's complaints commissioner, who is independent of the watchdog, said 393 complaints were received last year, down from 421 in 1992-93 and 678 in 1991. The most frequent type of complaint involved the administration of a member, with 36 per cent of complaints falling into this category. Complaints about dealing accounted for 18 per cent while poor investment advice accounted for another 15 per cent. The number of cases referred to independent arbitration fell to 20 from 34 in the 1993-94 year. Members of the body successfully defended themselves in 10 of these cases, with only five decided in favour of the complainant. Meanwhile, the watchdog announced disciplinary actions against six individual members, including terminating the registration of Mr James Cesareo who was found to have borrowed a friend's British Rail season ticket and to have forged and used a copy of it. Mr Simon Ian Farquharson, an equities dealer at Credit Lyonnais Securities who was dismissed last year, was reprimanded by the watchdog and fined Pounds 15,000 for accepting two cash payments from a client totalling Pounds 30,000. Mr Jolyon William Money had his registration terminated and was fined Pounds 3,000 after falsely claiming a US qualification and inaccurately portraying his previous employment history. Mr William Muir Grant, formerly employed on the Euroyen desk at UBS, was reprimanded for 'seriously mismarking' positions to conceal losses and reporting valuations to UBS Tokyo which were different from those reported in London. He had been ordered to pay Pounds 5,000 costs.</p>

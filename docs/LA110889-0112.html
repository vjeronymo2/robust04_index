			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRO-M CAMP PREDICTS BLEAK FUTURE FOR DRIVERS  </P> <P> The sponsors of Measure M, who invested two years crafting their proposal and  spent more than $2 million to sell it, said sadly Tuesday that their dream of a  streamlined Orange County freeway system in this century is dead.  </P> <P> "I think it will be a substantial setback for transportation in Orange County,"  said a glum Tom Rogers, a leader of the pro-M campaign, as no votes slowly  overtook an early surge of yes votes. "There seems to be in this county a solid  number of voters who resist taxes."  </P> <P> Bruce Nestande, chairman of the campaign for Measure M, said: "Other counties  are going to be successful in dealing with their transportation crisis because  they have the funds to do so, but we won't have that option.  </P> <P> "There's no money sitting out there," he said. "There's no dollar at the end of  the rainbow."  </P> <P> Bill Ward, who was host of a gathering Tuesday night for the measure's  opponents, said government officials are to blame for traffic problems, not the  failure of a sales tax. About predictions of highway gridlock, he said: "If  they keep control of the transportation in Orange County, that's probably  true."  </P> <P> Jerry Yudelson, another opponent, said those who worked against Measure M "are  going to be getting together in the next couple weeks to form a watchdog group.  People who don't like a sales tax approach have got to offer an alternative for  what you can do with less money."  </P> <P> Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, a supporter of the measure, said: "We're in deep  trouble. There are no finances to build the improvements we're going to need in  the next decade. It puts us in a catastrophic position."  </P> <P> County transportation experts also predicted gloom and gridlock.  </P> <P> The Orange and Riverside freeways will remain major problem areas, they  predicted in interviews Tuesday. And plans to create so-called "super streets"  such as Katella Avenue, which would zip commuters through cities and serve as  alternatives to freeways, will -- at best -- be stalled for years, if not  permanently, they said.  </P> <P> "We're in serious trouble" if Measure M fails, said Keith McKean, director of  the Caltrans district office in Orange County.  </P> <P> "There will be no funds available for new construction projects," he said in an  interview before Tuesday's result were in. "By early next year, perhaps in  January, February or March, we will have committed all of the cash available  for new construction. We will have to decide how much maintenance to defer, we  will cut back on consultant contracts, cut back on preventive maintenance, and  then we'll have to decide how many people to lay off."  </P> <P> Nestande also predicted an abrupt halt in the county's progress toward better  traffic if the measure is not successful.  </P> <P> "I would say that anything where a contract has been awarded is safe," said  Nestande, who serves on the California Transportation Commission, the state  board that oversees state transportation spending. "Anything else is up for  grabs."  </P> <P> Nestande and other transportation officials are hopeful that the proposed  9-cent-a-gallon increase in the state gasoline tax on the June, 1990, ballot  will pass. But Orange County's share of that additional revenue, if approved by  voters, would be far below what Measure M would generate.  </P> <P> "If the state ballot proposition doesn't pass, I don't know what we're going to  do," Nestande said.  </P> <P> Officials said, however, that some highway construction will continue.  </P> <P> That includes the widening of the Santa Ana Freeway and the extension of the  Costa Mesa Freeway; $240 million in developer-funded roads through southern  Orange County and three planned tollways.  </P></p>

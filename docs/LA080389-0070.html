			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PEGGY BUCKEY SENDS NEARBY MURDER JURY BACK TO SQUARE ONE  </P> <P> In a rare courthouse occurrence, a defendant in the McMartin Pre-School  molestation trial caused jury deliberations in a neighboring murder trial to  start all over again Wednesday.  </P> <P> The jury in the murder trial of Harvey Rader was ordered to begin its  discussions anew after one of its members was dismissed from the panel because  of remarks she overheard Peggy McMartin Buckey make Tuesday in a courthouse  elevator.  </P> <P> Buckey, 63, was called as a witness Tuesday in the trial of Rader, accused of  multiple murders, after it was reported that a juror in the case overheard  Buckey discussing the case.  </P> <P> Under questioning from Superior Court Judge Lorna Parnell, Buckey said she  briefly spoke about the case with a lawyer in an elevator in the downtown  Criminal Courts Building.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Felt Sorry  </P> <P> "I said something like, 'I feel sorry for them (the parents of one of the  murder victims). My heart goes out to them,' " she testified.  </P> <P> Buckey said a woman in the elevator then identified herself as a juror in the  Rader trial and Buckey ceased her conversation.  </P> <P> However, the juror later told the court that she only heard Buckey say  something about "Sol (one of the alleged murder victims)" going to England.  </P> <P> The remark could be construed as giving credence to the defense, since the  bodies of the four people Rader is accused of murdering have never been found.  </P> <P> Rader, 41, a British citizen, is on trial in the murders of Israeli immigrant  Shlomo Salomon; his wife, Elaine, and their two children, Michalle, 15, and  Mitchell, 9, who disappeared from their Northridge home Oct. 12, 1982.  </P> <P> Parnell ruled Wednesday that the juror had been "contaminated" by Buckey's  remarks and dismissed her. Jurors in criminal cases are only to consider  evidence given at the trial.  </P> <P> The juror was replaced by a male alternate and the panel, which had been  deliberating almost two weeks, began the task anew.  </P> <P> Rader's attorney, Mark Lessem, said the problems with the juror may hurt his  client's chances for acquittal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Voices Concern  </P> <P> "I'm frightened to death about what's going on here. I'm not sure my client's  getting a fair trial," Lessem said.  </P> <P> He also indicated that Buckey's comments may not have been accidental.  </P> <P> "Before Mrs. Buckey testified (in the Rader trial Tuesday), I believed it was  just a pure accident. . . . I could not believe a person could be that devious.  After hearing Mrs. Buckey testify, I'm not so sure," he said, adding that he  was "not a person who looks under the bed for conspiracies."  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend that the portly, gray-haired Rader was a business associate  of Saloman and killed the family after an argument with him. If convicted, he  could face the death penalty.  </P> <P> In a 15th floor courtroom, down the hall from Rader's trial, Buckey and her  son, Raymond, have been on trial for more than two years on charges they  molested 11 of their pupils at the now-closed McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan  Beach from 1978 until 1983.  </P> <P> Raymond Buckey has been testifying since July 25.  </P></p>

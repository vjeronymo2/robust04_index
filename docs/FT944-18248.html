			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (12): Germans act on media control - An owner's total share of the television audience will be limited After months of bitter internecine feuding, Germany's 15 regional media authorities last week recommended a radical set of reforms to regulations which are supposed to guard against the building up of ownership concentrations in the commercial television sector. At present, restrictions are placed on the size of shareholdings and the number of channels in which an owner has an interest. Different rules apply, depending on whether a channel has been awarded a 'full service' or a 'thematic' licence. This complex system is to be replaced by one in which the total share of the television audience gained by the channels in which an owner has an interest is limited to 25 per cent. The basis of media ownership regulation, according to one television executive, will be switched to one of 'how many people watch the channels, not how many channels you own'. In the UK the lack of such a regulatory framework has led to the development of a satellite broadcasting market which is largely controlled by BSkyB. Germany's post-war federal structure was designed to ensure that the media can never again fall into the hands of any single political or commercial organisation. Yet existing regulations have not prevented privately-owned commercial television from being dominated by three big media groups, each with stakes in a number of channels: Bertelsmann, Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion and the Kirch Group. Germany's two public service broadcasters, ARD and ZDF, are in decline through overmanning, political sensitivities over the licence fee and fierce restrictions on the amount of advertising time available to them. The country has developed the largest cable network in Europe, with 14m homes already connected. In addition, about 7m homes have satellite receivers. The consequence has been a scramble in recent years to exploit the enormous advertising potential of the united Germany by starting new commercial channels. This has been encouraged by Germany's federal regulatory system, which devolves the licensing of channels to the regional media authorities. Lacking a nationally agreed licensing policy, and fearful of being accused of driving away investment and jobs from their own region, the authorities have mostly been prepared to grant a broadcasting licence to anyone that applies for one. And if one authority will not grant a licence - for instance because it believes the shareholding in a proposed channel leads to a concentration of media ownership - another authority can usually be found that will. Once the channel is licensed, the other authorities must accept it, even if they disagree with the award. But even the new simplified formula for limiting media ownership concentration will not solve all of the authorities' regulatory problems. For instance, the Kirch Group is engaged in a long-running dispute with most of the media authorities over the ownership of the Pro 7 film channel, which is 47.5 per cent owned by Mr Thomas Kirch, son of Mr Leo Kirch, the group president. Most authorities believe the channel should be seen as belonging to the Kirch media empire. Under current regulations, this would mean that Kirch's stake in the channel would have to be pruned to below 25 per cent, since an owner may hold more than 25 per cent of just one full-service channel - and this quota has already been achieved through its 43 per cent stake in Sat1. But the son argues that his interest in Pro 7 is independent of the Kirch Group, and should not be counted as part of its holdings. This dispute has been running for over a year, despite the efforts of the Direktorenkonferenz der Landesmedienanstalten, a regular meeting of the directors of the 15 authorities, which has held several inconclusive votes in an attempt to resolve it. The publication of the authorities' new proposals is likely to intensify the dispute. If the Kirch Group were to lose its case, adding Pro 7 to its channel portfolio would take its audience share above the limit - the only media group to be so affected. In a section clearly aimed at Pro 7, the authorities attempt to address the question of ownership identity by recommending that the media authorities should be given powers equivalent to the German monopolies and mergers commission, the Kartellamt, to investigate the real influences at work within a channel. It warns that the question of 'relationships' should be treated with particular caution. The proposed changes will contribute to a detailed parliamentary review of the state broadcasting treaty. If accepted, they could become law by January 1996. Bertelsmann, Kirch and CLT are already organising their defences. Bertelsmann has issued a statement claiming that it is unfair that a channel in which it has an interest should count equally towards the calculation of its overall audience share, regardless of the size of the stake. But the authorities have three big advantages on their side. For once, they are said to be unanimous; they have support from politicians of both the left and the right; and they are likely to be backed up by the EU, which is also considering legislation based on the so-called 'audience share model'. With this muscle behind them, the authorities could, at last, be about to curb the power of Germany's media giants. The writer is senior reporter on New Media Markets, an FT newsletter</p>

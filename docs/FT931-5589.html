			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Pit review progress goes underground: The delays to an eagerly awaited white paper on mine closures IT WAS meant to be short and sharp. When the government buckled under backbench pressure in October and agreed to review its decision to close 31 coal pits, the widespread assumption was that it was aiming for completion in January. When that proved impossible Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the coal white paper would be published as soon as possible in February. Now it is unlikely anything will appear before late this month. After a flurry of activity in the first six weeks of the year the team of ministers and civil servants leading the coal review has gone quiet. The heads of the electricity, nuclear and gas industries affected by the review have heard nothing substantial for weeks. They are puzzled. After all it is more than three weeks since leaked details of the draft white paper showed that the government was planning a relatively simple way out. It rejected the option of reining back nuclear and gas power, in favour of cutting imports of coal and orimulsion, the bitumen-based fuel, and persuading electricity generators to buy more home-produced coal. The generators' negotiating stance is the main reason for the delay. They say there is a guaranteed market for only about 40m tonnes of coal over five years and the government must pay a price if it is to achieve anything near its 65.5m target. Ministers are thought to have conceded that extra tonnage must be subsidised to make it competitive with imports, but arguments remain about what the subsidy should be, and who should pay the stocking costs for coal surplus to generators' requirements. PowerGen, the smaller of the two generators in England and Wales, estimates stocking costs over five years will be more than Pounds 140m and it wants the government to pay. The trade department has been considering its response to Powergen and National Power for more than two weeks. The delay does not signal that the government has abandoned its draft white paper plans and is looking for a more radical solution. It is more likely that the trade department is attempting to square difficult circles elsewhere before returning to the generators with a compromise. FIRST it must win acceptance from Brussels for subsidies to keep pits open. The new competition and energy commissioners are more relaxed about state aid than their predecessors, but problems remain over any subsidies to coal after 1995, when the German government plans to reduce its aid to coal. More difficult still are the trade ministers' problems arising from the government's slender 20-seat majority in the Commons. The Thatcherite wing of the Conservative party is uncomfortable about any proposals to prop up industry with government money, although ministers' preferred solution is much cheaper than many at first thought - the subsidies and stocking together are likely to cost less than Pounds 800m over five years. In delaying full cabinet discussion of the white paper proposals Mr Heseltine will be able to strengthen his claim for government aid. He will be able to argue that his department re-examined all the options previously rejected. Delaying publication of the white paper could also help deal with potential dissidents on the left of the party. Even the full 65m tonnes would be likely to provide a lifeline to fewer than half the threatened pits. Some Tories have said that is not enough. Some ministers feel their expectations will fall the longer the review goes on. In addition, Mr Heseltine may be able to take advantage of this week's ballots by the National Union of Mineworkers and Nacods pit deputies union on industrial action, including a one-day strike. If miners vote 'yes' he can argue that they are out to wreck the industry as in the bad old days. He can argue that a 'no' means they are past caring. However close the solution is, it is highly unlikely the white paper will be published next week. As the Budget will take up ministers' and parliament's energy and time in the following week, the week beginning March 22 looks likely. Publication after April 1 would mean further problems for British Coal - its three-year contracts with the generators run out on that date and replacements are unlikely until the white paper is published. Nonetheless, few MPs would be surprised if publication slipped further.</p>

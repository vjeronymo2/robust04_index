			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder bows to rebel investors to head off proxy battle Goodman Fielder, the troubled Australian food group, yesterday bowed to the demands of dissident shareholders and agreed to appoint three of their nominees to its board, so avoiding a proxy battle next month. Goodman said Mr Jon Peterson, a former chairman of Unilever Australasia, Mr Neil Lister, a director of Melbourne-based Agrifoods, and Mr Ken Neilsen, formerly an executive with Mars Australia, had been invited to join the board at its October 6 meeting. Mr Terry Arcus, a former McKinsey director, and Mr John Landerer, a solicitor, two non-executive directors of Goodman, will stand down at the same time. Mr Peterson will become deputy chairman. In addition, the group's current chairman, Mr John Studdy, said the board would search for a new independent chairman. He will retire when a successor has been found. As a result of the deal, the extraordinary meeting, requisitioned by the unhappy investors, will now be cancelled. Shareholders will get their chance to approve the new board appointments at the AGM in November. Yesterday's agreement follows a push for board changes by Mr Doug Shears, a Melbourne-based businessman whose Agrifoods group has a small shareholding in Goodman, and three large institutional shareholders - the Australian Mutual Provident, Bankers Trust Australia, and State Superannuation Investment and Management Corporation. They have been distressed by Goodman's static profits and sagging share price.</p>

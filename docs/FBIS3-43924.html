Sporadic  shooting from heavy artillery and bursts of automatic machinegun  fire were heard this morning in the southern district of  Brazzaville, especially at Bacongo and Makelekele districts,  which have been sealed off for the past three days by government  forces. Armored cars have been deployed at Makelekele district  over the past three days in an attempt to prevent new clashes  between the opposition coalition militia and government forces.  These clashes have claimed about 75 lives in southern  Brazzaville since mid- December.    The cordoning off of Bacongo is the result of the kidnapping  of Lieutenant Jonathan Mabiala, an officer of the presidential  security, who has still not been found. The presidential  security has accused the private militia of opposition leader  Bernard Kolelas of carrying out the kidnapping. The opposition  has denied any involvement in this affair.    Meanwhile, about 100 armed supporters of the presidential  group gathered around the seat of the ruling party, the  Pan-African Union for Social Democracy this morning. They are  demanding their integration into the Army. According to  witnesses, the police did not intervene.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / North campaigns to keep aid status ALL OF the 82 greenfield inward investment projects won by businesses in north-east England and Cumbria since 1987 have settled in 'assisted areas', a delegation from the regional regeneration body told Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, yesterday. The Northern Development Company supports the case for the region's 11 assisted areas to retain their status. It said the government's regional industrial incentives were vital for the continuation of economic regeneration in the north. The company said that the regional policy map, which the government is reviewing, should be extended to include parts of the north-east coal areas that face more pit closures. It also said the Copeland and Barrow districts of Cumbria should be included, having borne the brunt of heavy job losses at the Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing site and VSEL, the builder of Trident submarines. Expected job losses in the offshore industry, which employs 20,000 people in the region, should also be considered, the company argued. Today is the deadline for submissions on the government review, which it has indicated is more likely to shrink than to expand the assisted-areas map. The new map should be published early next year after consultation with the European Commission. The company's 15-page lobbying document presented to Mr Sainsbury says assisted-area designation should respond to long-term structural unemployment, not short-term fluctuations in the trade cycle.</p>

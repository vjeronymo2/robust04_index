			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Nuclear Electric hopeful of levy-free profit NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned nuclear power generator, is on course to make a profit without help from the nuclear levy, Mr John Collier, its chairman, claimed yesterday. Reporting the state-owned nuclear generator's latest six-monthly results, he said Nuclear Electric 'has been able to point to clear evidence that we are making nuclear power in this country a commercial success.' Yesterday's results come as Nuclear Electric is fighting suggestions that it should be cut back to make more room in the energy market for coal. The crisis over pit closures and the government's review of energy policy have raised questions about the level of financial support that Nuclear Electric receives. But Mr Collier emphasised yesterday that nuclear power can compete in the free market, and has environmental benefits when compared with fossil fuels. In the six months to September, Nuclear Electric made an operating profit of Pounds 255m, an increase of 21 per cent. That included income of Pounds 632m from the controversial levy on electricity bills to help Nuclear Electric finance the heavy decommissioning costs of its nuclear plant. Dr Bob Hawley, the chief executive, stressed that the levy was not a subsidy, but cover for liabilities NE had inherited from the Central Electricity Generating Board. He said the company was well on its way towards its target of making a profit before levy income by 1995. In the six months, NE increased electricity output by 7 per cent, and its revenue from electricity generation by 20 per cent to Pounds 618m. Improved productivity had also reduced unit costs. Further cost reductions would be implemented to cut staff from 12,500 to 9,000 by 1995.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Little succour for the stricken: Andrew Jack examines growing pressures to reform corporate insolvency law The threat of further job losses hanging over British workers at Leyland Daf, the commercial vehicle maker in receivership, is a striking reminder of the destructive process of insolvency creeping across corporate Britain. The introduction of the 1986 Insolvency Act after nearly a decade of debate was seen as an important support for struggling businesses. But after being put to its first real test in the recession, that belief is now being called into question. Mr Chris Hughes, head of insolvency at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's largest accounting firm, reflects this pessimism. He says that all too often the law amounts to a prescription to 'bayonet the wounded' among companies in financial difficulty. He calls for wholesale reform of the law. His remarks had important symbolic value, since the 1986 Insolvency Act was based on a report by a committee chaired by the late Sir Kenneth Cork of Cork Gully, the insolvency firm which merged with Coopers 13 years ago. The report called for measures to help businesses in debt survive and preserve their employees' jobs. Its proposals proved highly controversial, and the legislation had 1,200 amendments before it was passed. The evidence suggests Sir Kenneth's hopes have not been realised. Figures from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the corporate information group, show 16,600 business failures in 1982, in the middle of the last recession. In 1992, the number was 62,800. Failures as a proportion of all companies paying value-added tax jumped from 1.2 per cent in 1982 to 2.8 per cent in 1991. Several insolvency firms have started to call for modifications to the law. Their primary concerns focus on improvements to the operation of two procedures introduced by the 1986 act: administration orders and company voluntary arrangements (CVAs). More radical suggestions would weaken the power of creditors. Administration orders offer the chance for a company to survive by keeping it trading and protected from its creditors while it restructures. Companies apply to the courts for such protection and, if the application is successful, an insolvency practitioner is appointed to oversee the process. Well-known examples include Mr Asil Nadir's group Polly Peck International, British &amp; Commonwealth, the financial services group, and Olympia &amp; York, the developers of Canary Wharf. In some cases administration has proved successful. Chancery, a small financial services company, was successfully reconstructed at the end of 1991. But most companies under administration have failed to emerge intact. Mr Hughes argues that more companies should be encouraged to apply through the courts for protection, by simplifying the procedures and by removing disincentives. These include the requirement for the administrator to report on the conduct of the company's directors. He would also like the law to permit creditors to apply for administration orders and the courts themselves to propose them. Few want to see the procedure become more like the protection from creditors offered under Chapter 11 in the US. This leaves the management in charge of the company, generates a complicated series of creditors' committees and results in large professional fees over years. 'Chapter 11 is frightful,' says Mr Mark Homan of Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm. 'The debtor is lawyered to death.' Insolvency practitioners are equally eager for reform of company voluntary arrangements, under which the management puts up a restructuring proposal to creditors and continues to run the company. CVAs have to be approved by court order but the system is far less bureaucratic than other insolvency procedures. However, under the current CVA system, a company has no protection from its creditors once it has informed them of its need to renegotiate its debts - unlike under the system of administration. Neither do CVAs offer protection to directors against wrongful trading prosecutions if they operate insolvent businesses. As a result, CVAs are only normally used once an administration order is coming to its end. 'We need a stay of execution of about a month under some supervisory authority during which directors have the chance of renegotiating their debts,' says Mr Homan. During that period, the company would be protected from any action by its creditors. The problems with administration orders and CVAs are illustrated by the fact that since the 1986 law went into effect they have been used in less than 1 per cent of all insolvency procedures (see table). Many companies entering receivership do not end up in liquidation, but are ultimately sold as running businesses without the loss of all their employees. But the process is still destructive, since it may jeopardise the survival of other small businesses or individuals who are creditors to the company and are unlikely to be paid in full. 'One company's bad debts are another company's failure,' says Mr Paul Shipperlee of accountants Levy Gee. A more radical approach to cutting the number of insolvencies, advocated by some practitioners, would be to reduce the incentive of creditors to appoint receivers. That could be achieved by abolishing floating charges - the system whereby banks secure their loans against all of a company's assets. This gives the receiver the power to raise funds on behalf of the creditor from across the business. In most other countries, by contrast, banks can only secure loans with fixed charges on specific named assets. Receivers, which are appointed by the banks, are therefore more restricted in their ability to raise funds from the business concerned. The various calls for insolvency reform have, until recently, received little official support. But late last year, the Department of Trade and Industry announced a wide-ranging reform of company law. A part of this review, according to Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, would include an examination of CVAs. Further details are expected later this year. But there is still much disagreement about how extensive reform should be. Mr Nigel Hamilton of Ernst &amp; Young and the president of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, believes that the procedures of administration and CVAs need some amendments. However, he says radical reform is not necessary and that the existing law can be made to work. Insolvency practitioners are also reluctant to endorse publicly reform of floating charges, since so much of their business is awarded by banks. Banks would resist any move to curb their power over borrowers. But the ideas are being discussed by bodies such as the insolvency lawyers association. Equally, Mr Nigel Hamilton argues that a 'rescue culture' cannot be achieved by changes in the law alone. He says that the Inland Revenue and Customs &amp; Excise - typically large creditors to companies in trouble - are often too inflexible in negotiations which could save a business. More generally, he says that by the time insolvency practitioners are called in, it is often too late to achieve a rescue. A recent survey by the society estimated that the most important reason for company collapses was management failure. Many left it far too late to seek professional assistance in paying their debts, leaving little alternative to receivership. Mr Chris Morris, head of corporate special services at Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, says he frequently comes across directors who have pursued lavish lifestyles, written cheques to creditors but then stuffed them into desk draws, and failed to send out invoices. 'We suffer from a lack of competent management to steer companies through difficult times,' he says. The quality of management is unlikely to improve quickly. But with reform of insolvency procedures also expected to be a protracted process, many more companies, their creditors and employees will face the prospect of collapse.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Corporate Insolvency  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         1989     1990     1991     1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Compulsory liquidations                4,020    5,977    8,368    9,732 Creditors' voluntary liquidations      6,436    9,074   13,459   14,692 Total                                 10,456   15,051   21,827   24,424 Proceedings related to insolvency - England and Wales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Receiverships                          1,706    4,318    7,515      n/a Administrator appointments               135      211      206      120 Voluntary arrangements                    43       58      137       76 Members' voluntary liquidations        3,966    4,092    3,719      n/a Company insolvencies - Scotland  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Compulsory liquidations                  229      251      304      n/a Creditors' voluntary liquidations        199      219      312      n/a Total                                    428      470      616      n/a Proceedings related to insolvency - Scotland  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

More from our reporter David Stahlavsky.    [Stahlavsky] Vaclav Havel received the Georgian president  for  an approximately hour-long meeting at Prague Castle and welcomed  this opportunity to discuss bilateral relations. For example,  Georgia will open an embassy in Prague that will also deal with  other Central European countries. For its part, the Czech  Republic will open a Consulate General in Tbilisi, and both  diplomatic representations will be preparing a system of  treaties to secure wider cooperation. At their meeting, both  presidents exchanged their views on the situation in Georgia,  which is being troubled by civil and ethnic war, in Russia, and  in other parts of the world.

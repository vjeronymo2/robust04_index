			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 3d Corps report from Zenica] </F>   [Excerpt] Much more is needed for peace than just  signatures on a piece of paper, most of all it requires the  goodwill of the commanders of military units on the ground. We  do not want to believe that one thing is agreed at the  negotiating table while another thing is told the military  commanders, those who implement the cease-fire. However, how  else can we explain the bombing of the Novi Travnik Bratstvo  [Brotherhood] factory from aircraft of the Croatian Army, as  happened this morning at 0648 [0548 GMT]? Is there any  justification for daily overflights of helicopters of the  Croatian Army over the Vitez region, which drop military  hardware to the extremist units, as happened yesterday over  Jardol and Nova Bila?

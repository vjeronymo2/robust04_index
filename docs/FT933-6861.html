			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Tiphook in loss but directors paid more MR ROBERT Montague, executive chairman of Tiphook, the container and trailer rental group, had a pay rise from Pounds 842,000 to Pounds 851,000 in the financial year to end-April, when the group fell into a net loss of Pounds 66.5m - from a retained profit Pounds 31.7m - following changes to accounting policies. Other directors also received higher salaries. The accounts, published yesterday, show that all the directors' contracts are subject to three-year notice periods. Such contracts are increasingly unpopular with institutional investors. However, the board has already taken a 10 per cent pay cut from the beginning of the current financial year and will take a further reduction once a review of salaries by the remuneration committee is completed. The committee, chaired by Mr Rupert Hambro who last week was confirmed as non-executive deputy chairman of the company, is also looking at the notice period in the contracts. Last week Mr Roger Braidwood resigned as finance director. He received less than a year's salary in compensation, despite his three-year contract, which will be shown in next year's accounts. He is understood to be the director whose salary is shown in the accounts at between Pounds 545,001 and Pounds 550,000. Mr Montague holds 3.46m shares in the group, entitling him to dividends totalling Pounds 668,000 if the proposed final dividend of 14.4p is approved at the annual meeting. The accounts include a photograph of the board without Mr Braidwood, which Tiphook was able to slip in before the final print run. However, Mr Andrew Chandler, the new finance director, is pictured separately because a photograph of the board including him had not been taken. The accounts also show the results under US accounting principles, which show a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.9m compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 21.8m on the UK accounting basis. The group is moving to reporting in dollars, with quarterly results and monthly sales figures, to meet the needs of its US investors, an increasing proportion of the total.</p>

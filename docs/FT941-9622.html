			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / People: Noto follows well-oiled path If the future for the US's oil giants rests overseas, then Lucio Noto looks well qualified to head Mobil, the country's second-biggest oil group, writes Richard Waters. Noto, 55, takes over the reins at Mobil on March 1, when veteran chairman and chief executive Allen Wallace retires. Unlike other US oil industry chiefs, Noto has spent most of his working life outside of the US. Mobil is already one of the most internationally active of the big oil groups. Given the diminishing returns from exploration in the US and the high costs of refining there, most oil groups have their sights set on investment overseas, and Mobil is no exception. Noto, whose parents emigrated to the US from Sicily, is a native of Brooklyn and New Jersey. After joining Mobil in 1962, he held senior marketing and planning jobs in Japan and Italy before running Mobil's operations in Saudi Arabia. During those years, he gained a reputation as both a skilled diplomat and tough businessman. It was Wallace, with Mobil for 41 years, who brought Noto back to the US in 1985 and prepared him for the top job. He was made head of planning and economics, then chief financial officer in 1989 and president and ceo last year.</p>

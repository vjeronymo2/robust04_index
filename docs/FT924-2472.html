			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / N Korea names premier NORTH Korea yesterday appointed Mr Kang Song-san, one of the country's chief economic reformers, as its premier. Mr Kang, who also served as premier in the mid-1980s, has since governed North Hamgyong province, where he established special economic zones for foreign investment. He also developed local economic ties with neighbouring Russia, and is a proponent of the UN-sponsored project to develop industrial and port facilities in the Tumen River delta in North Hamgyong. The return of the 61-year-old Mr Kang - believed to be a cousin of President Kim Il-sung - to Pyongyang is likely to lead to reforms for the troubled North Korean economy and new measures to attract investment from abroad. Mr Yon Hyong-muk, the current premier, was probably dismissed because of the country's growing economic problems, according to South Korean analysts. Mr Kang introduced North Korea's first foreign joint venture law.</p>

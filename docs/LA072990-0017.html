			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS SPLIT ON BAR ASSN. ABORTION VOTE  </P> <P> Bob Sipchen, when referring to the pro-life contingent of the bar association,  raises the question, "What do religious beliefs have to do with the law?" He  later writes, "If it were only a legal issue, though, there might be more room  to compromise."  </P> <P> The point is that both sides of the issue hold their positions religiously,  which is evidenced by the fact that neither side has any intention of  compromise.  </P> <P> Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines religious as "relating to or  manifesting faithful devotion to an acknowledged ultimate reality . . . "  </P> <P> In the debate over the legitimacy of abortion, both sides admittedly manifest  "faithful devotion," while only one side is ever referred to as religious  zealots. Do both focus their faithful devotion on "an acknowledged ultimate  reality?" The answer is without doubt yes.  </P> <P> CHARLES A. HICKEY  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

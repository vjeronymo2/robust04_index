			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Arts: Women on the college walls - Artists brighten up New Hall, Cambridge Few who have dined in an Oxbridge college beneath the fearsome and dyspeptic stares of several centuries' ranked portraiture, mostly of college dignitaries, will have been particularly uplifted by the experience. Most of the pictures are cross-looking, blackened and dingy. Almost all are of and by men. But fix an invitation to lunch at the women's college of New Hall in Cambridge, and a vary different scenario awaits. For a start, on your way to the dining hall you will pass a waist-high pink saucepan in the grounds. It is made by Judith Cowan, and is one of more than 70 pieces of 20th century art by distinguished women artists which now enliven the austere geometry of the college. The domed dining hall itself is a dramatic backdrop for works by Mary Kelly, Sophie Ryder and Vivien Blackett, among others. In the recess behind the low stage, Evelyn Williams' painted relief of an anguished woman lying awake in a bed, 'All Night Through', looks like a large ivory altar to the trials of womanhood. What is going on? A year ago, the college walls were bare, except for a few pieces of work on loan (all of which were by men). In a move not only to brighten the place up but to present a positive image of it as a women's college, the college decided to approach leading women artists around the country and ask them to donate a piece of work. The response was massive. Christopher Stevenson, the bursar, estimated that there was a five per cent refusal rate 'and some of those were our fault because we sent the letters to the wrong addresses'. Maggi Hambling was one of the earliest to commit herself. Her painting 'Gulf Women Prepare for War' was not done specifically for the college, 'but', she says, 'I just had this strong feeling that it was the right one for them. I painted it in 1986-87 after I saw a picture in the paper. 'I was deeply shocked by the image of those women in clothes which I associate with a nun's habit, holding rocket launchers. I'd never seen the desert but I knew it was pink; I deliberately made it the colour of women's make-up.' But although much of the work on display does deal with women's roles, women's bodies, it would be misleading to herd all the donated works into a feminist questioning of gendered identity. Hambling would not welcome the feminist label: 'I'm an artist and I happen to be a woman.' Why such a startlingly positive reaction to the project? As Ian Shaw, a Fellow of the college, explains: 'The lesser known artists were being offered a platform for their work. 'The famous names were simply doing the college a favour, but we saw a snowball effect, as those who had refused at first heard who else was getting involved and asked if they could be included too.' So prestige has become a consideration - the collection's size and specialisation make it unique in Britain. But there are other factors significant for the working artist. The works are promised permanent showing, in carefully chosen spots around the college: we generally like to ask the artist to come and pick a site, says Christopher Stevenson. And - unlike work in many major galleries, these pieces will never be consigned to the storeroom.</p>

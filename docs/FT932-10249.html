			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Letter: The pricing of CDs in the US and the UK Sir, Your leader on compact disc prices proposes amendments to the Copyright Act to allow parallel importation as a means of controlling the price of CDs in the UK. This proposal fails on at least two grounds of practicality and displays inadequate comprehension of copyright law. Parallel importation traditionally refers to articles lawfully made in the country of origin. However, what, say of Belgium or Poland, where copies of foreign sound recordings can be lawfully made without the permission of the original producers: are these to be excluded from the UK? If so, how can the copyright law distinguish between different categories of lawfully made product? Further, if, as your article suggests, the removal of copyright import controls has a direct effect on pricing, why is it that domestic CD prices in Japan, where no copyright import controls are possible, are among the highest, while in the US, where prices are constantly cited as among the lowest, the copyright law provides full control over parallel importation? The link between parallel importation and pricing is far more complex than this superficial proposal suggests, as I believe Australian consumers will soon discover.

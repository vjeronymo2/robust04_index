			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Rail users face big cuts in services RAIL PASSENGERS face big cuts in timetables this winter as British Rail tries to weed out uneconomic services in the approach to privatisation. Worst hit will be regional Sunday services - some of which will lose all their trains - and early morning and late-night services on Network SouthEast. British Rail admitted that as many as 2.5m seats may go from the winter timetable, but said there is no question of the cuts having been imposed by the board. BR said winter timetabling was an issue for the three BR divisions, Regional Railways, Network SouthEast and InterCity, and decisions were taken at local level. But it had to match resources to demand, it added. The subsidy to BR for running socially necessary services has been cut by 25 per cent this year from Pounds 1.15bn to Pounds 850m so BR had little choice but to make cuts. 'There has been a significant decline on some services and there is no point in running empty trains,' it said. Sunday services in central England appear to be bearing the brunt of the cuts, with the city of Lincoln particularly badly affected. Regional Railways confirmed that from October there would be no Sunday service between Lincoln and Cleethorpes, no direct service between Lincoln and Nottingham and only an afternoon service between Lincoln and Newark and Grantham. Sunday services between Derby and Matlock, a gateway to the Peak District, are also being withdrawn because the service carried an average of only 12 passengers per journey last winter, it said. In Wales the Pwllheli/ Machynlleth Sunday service is being withdrawn and the number of return trains from Aberystwyth to Shrewsbury on a Sunday is being cut from three to two. In East Anglia an agreement with Norfolk and Suffolk county councils on subsidising local routes safeguarded the Sunday services betweeen Norwich and Sheringham, Lowestoft, and Great Yarmouth and between Ipswich and Lowestoft and Cambridge, it said. Network SouthEast denied that it was cutting any services but did admit that re-timetabling to meet demand might result in the number of off-peak trains on some routes being reduced. The London/Weymouth line had been given as an example of a cut in service, it said. But there was little point in running three trains an hour if there was only demand for two. Rationalising the timetable would only inconvenience someone wishing to travel to Weymouth by delaying their journey by a maximum of 10 minutes. Any reduction in the number of early morning and late evening trains was purely to reflect falling demand. The number of commuters travelling to London on Network Southeast each day had fallen from 473,000 in 1989 to 377,000. But even with this winter's further reduction in the number of trains Network SouthEast expects to have 9 per cent more seats than passengers in the mornings.</p>

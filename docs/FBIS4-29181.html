			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by political reporter Yasunori Matsuno: "Different </F> Appraisals of Kakizawa's Visit to China"]    [Text] Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa recently visited  South Korea and China to discuss measures to deal with North  Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. However, his  first trip abroad since becoming the foreign minister has been  assessed variously. A negative appraisal has been given to the  result that his visit clarified differences between Japan, the  U.S.-ROK group, and China in their stands toward a UN resolution  calling for imposing economic sanctions against the DPRK.  Meanwhile, the fact that his visit enabled people to understand  somewhat why China is negative about sanctions has been assessed  positively.    In a series of talks, Kakizawa stressed the importance of  resolving the DPRK nuclear issue "through dialogue." He also  indicated that the study of "measures, including sanctions" at  the UN Security Council would back up efforts for a peaceful  solution to the problem.    During talks with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Tarnoff,  Seoul stressed that "UN-led economic sanctions are necessary."  But in talks with Kakizawa held at a later date, it supported  the idea of "the United Nations taking gradual steps," such as  adopting a resolution of warning, instead of immediately  imposing sanctions.    As such, South Korea took different attitude toward the DPRK  issue in talks with Japan than it took in talks with the United  States. This seems to be because Seoul gave consideration to  the Hata cabinet, which is persuading the Social Democratic  Party of Japan to return to the ruling coalition, and it thought  it was not good to press Kakizawa hard over the sanctions issue  prior to his visit to China, which is negative about sanctions.    In China, Kakizawa asked Beijing to "actively participate in  studying sanctions at the United Nations." "He thus tried to  have China join in positive discussions on measures to deal with  North Korea, including economic sanctions," (according to a  senior Foreign Ministry official). However, Beijing did not  change its negative stand toward sanctions.    Through a series of talks, "it became clear that there is a  difference of policy toward the DPRK in the U.S.-ROK group,  which thinks economic sanctions to be inevitable; China, which  is negative about sanctions; and Japan, which stands in between.  Kakizawa's visits have brought about this bad result,"  according to a diplomatic source in China.    On the other hand, Kakizawa's talks with Beijing clarified  that China questions the effectiveness of economic sanctions and  is opposed to UN-led sanctions, although the nation considers  the current situation surrounding the DPRK nuclear issue as  serious, noting, "It is a difficult, worrisome situation." A  source, who accompanied Kakizawa on his trip, evaluates this  result highly, saying: "We now know China is still undecided.  This gives us a hint as to how we should approach the PRC."    It is said that "moves by Japan, which stands in between the  U.S.-ROK group and China, will become more and more important"  in dealing with the nuclear issue, (according to a Foreign  Ministry source). If the United Nations adopts a resolution  calling for sanctions, the situation will become more serious.  How should Japan cope with such a situation? "Kakizawa  diplomacy will likely face a crucial moment at the time,"  (according to the same source).</p>

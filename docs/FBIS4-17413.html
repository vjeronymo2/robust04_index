			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 22, BNS -- More than 53 percent of  Lithuania's people work in the private sector, but the  contribution of private enterprises to economic growth and  efficiency is still hardly felt, Lithuanian President Algirdas  Brazauskas said in his speech at an international conference in  Bucharest Friday [22 April].    The four-day Crans-Montana conference, devoted to  all-European and regional problems, is attended by  representatives of 86 countries and 19 international  organizations.    In his speech, Brazauskas said the Lithuanian gross domestic  product constantly decreases: by 3 percent in 1990, by 13  percent in 1991, by 38 percent in 1992 and by around 35 percent  in 1993. He said a major problem is that the part of the GDP  consumed inside the country is growing: 75 percent in 1991, 80  percent in 1992 and around 85 percent in 1993.    The president said attempts to liven up the investment  process in Lithuania have been unsuccessful so far. Brazauskas  noted that profit taxes were reduced three times in order to  stimulate investments from internal sources. In his words, the  part of profit or income used for investments may be completely  exempted from taxes for 2 or 3 years. Brazauskas also noted  that Lithuania intends to adopt a new law on foreign investments.    Discussing the initial stage of state property  privatization,  the Lithuanian leader said it will have to extended until the  end of this year, even though it was supposed to be completed by  July. Brazauskas said the process of privatization should be  controlled more strictly. But "assertions by some political  forces in Lithuania that privatization is hindered, state  property is plundered and so on, are unfounded."    The president said "the mass of economically poorly educated  shareholders" that formed in the process of privatization for  investment checks "does not have any major influence on  improving the management of enterprises."    Brazauskas said the standards of living began to improve,  although slowly, after inflation and the rise in prices were  slowed down last year.</p>

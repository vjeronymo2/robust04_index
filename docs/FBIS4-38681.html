			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yuliy Semenov from the Kremlin in </F> Moscow -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Twenty minutes ago an official  meeting ceremony was held for South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam and his wife in the St. George Hall of the Moscow  Kremlin. What can I tell you? Our guest is very dynamic and  smiles a lot, but at the same time he is known as a gifted and  far-sighted politician who, among other things, began to  establish contacts with the Soviet Union and Russia even before  official relations between Russia and South Korea were  re-established.    Ten minutes ago a tete-a-tete meeting between Presidents Kim  Yong-sam and Yeltsin started in the so-called Green  Drawing-Room. Whereas they had an unofficial meeting last night  in Staro-Ogarevo, today's meeting opens a formal negotiating  process. Simultaneously, the foreign ministers are holding  talks at the so-called Yellow Drawing-Room. There they are  expected to sign the first agreement on the protection of  migratory birds, together with a protocol on the consultations  between the foreign ministries. At the same time, two more  agreements -- on environment protection and on preventing  incidents at sea -- will be initialled. They will be signed but  a subsequent approval of the presidents will be required.    Then there will be talks in St. Catherine's Hall attended by  the delegations in full and at about 1130 in St. Vladimir's Hall  of the Kremlin, President Yeltsin is to hand over to his guest a  package of documents relating to the so-called Korean war of the  1950's. These are archive documents, many of them secret, and  they should help create a fuller picture of the events of the  period.    Then a Russian-Korean declaration will be signed. This is an  extensive and serious document. I can tell you that one of its  highlights is Russia's proposal that a conference on making the  Korean peninsula a nuclear-free zone should be held with all  interested states taking part.    When this official program has been completed, Russia's  president and his guest are to move to a building next door  where a news conference of the Russian and Korean presidents  will take place.

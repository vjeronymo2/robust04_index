			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (3): Reforms spark a credit crunch on bankruptcy, banking and accountancy. The legislation looked so innocuous that it slipped past without great controversy or even much consideration. After all, the laws were taken straight from the west European book. That missed the point. The laws have given the market economy critical mass in Hungary and the result both shocking and sudden. 'The country is going through a big bang,' says Mr Gyorgy Suranyi, who was president of the National Bank of Hungary when the laws were being drafted. The irony is that Hungary's conservative government, which came to power on a platform of gradual reform, appears to have sleep-walked into the big bang that it always decried. 'It was an absolutely unintentional move - but a good one,' says Mr Suranyi. The bankruptcy act gave companies a legal duty to declare their insolvency and shut down loss-making activities. At the same time, the law on financial institutions obliged banks to make provisions against doubtful loans, allowed them to write off the sums against tax and set exacting international standards for capital adequacy. The final piece was the new regulation of accounting practices which allowed companies to depreciate investment far more rapidly than before. This cocktail, whose plain ingredients disguised its punch, has brought the balance sheet burdens of Hungarian banks and companies into the open - and dumped them on the government's lap. Gain there may be someday, but for the moment the finance ministry at least is feeling the pain. The wave of bankruptcies that hit this spring has had a direct effect on government tax revenues. More significant is the knock-on effect of insolvency. Banks have provisioned heavily against non-performing assets at the expense of their taxable profits and the state budget. Policymakers reckon the authorities will be lucky to collect an eighth of the Ft60bn planned for 1992 in revenue from banks. To make things worse, the new depreciation allowances for companies have cut the yield from corporation tax. The outcome: a budget deficit which soared past the 1992 target of Ft70bn after just four months, broke Hungary's accord with the International Monetary Fund, and is heading towards Ft200bn or 7 per cent of GDP by year-end. Even that figure is obtained only with an accounting trick which flatters Hungary's state finances: the government pays interest at well below market levels on funds it has borrowed from the central bank. While stimulating domestic demand, the budget deficit has halted the fall in interest rates and threatens to crowd out any substantial recovery in investment. In any case, the rates which apply to companies have proved sticky downwards. The financial reforms come into play again here. Banks, desperate to build up reserves, have brought down lending rates far more slowly than deposit rates to the point that spreads approach 10 per cent. That is when the banks lend at all. They are busy also reducing lending to meet capital adequacy requirements and because they have been burnt by bankruptcy among clients. Hungary is in the middle of a credit crunch that puts the western variety to shame.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Australian Minister of Trade Bob  McMullan expressed optimism yesterday that Indonesia will open  its investment opportunities more extensively.    McMullan told reporters after meeting here with Minister of  Trade Satrio Budiarjo Judono that over recent years, Australian  investment in Indonesia has sharply increased due to the more  conducive investment climate which has rapidly deved.    He also said the trade relationship between the two  countries  has been overwhelmingly harmonious and successful.    "Our Prime Minister (Paul Keating) said there is no country  whose bilateral relationship is more important to Australia than  our relationship with Indonesia," McMullan remarked.    He acknowledged, however, that disagreements between the two  countries have occurred at times.    "But we have a history of a close cooperative trade  relationship. We have had a decade of rapidly growing bilateral  trade and we see it continuing to grow," said McMullan, who  arrived here Saturday for a three-day visit.    Responding to questions on his meeting with Judono, McMullan  said talks in the meeting focussed mainly on how to continue to  open up economies of both countries, make them more competitive  and win more business in each country.    "We also discussed how to work together in the Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) and how to take full advantage of  the competitiveness the two countries have created," he said.    McMullan said he had invited several ministers, including  Minister Judono, to visit Australia.    After making a courtesy call on President Suharto earlier  yesterday, McMullan said he sees good opportunities for  Australian finance, insurance, legal and accounting services in  Indonesia.    Other fields in which he found potential for development by  Australian investors are mining and food processing.    According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, bilateral  trade between Australia and Indonesia sharply increased from  US$871.7 million in 1988 to $2.15 billion in 1992. Australia  enjoyed a trade surplus of $666.8 million from its exports of  $1.4 billion to Indonesia in 1992, while its imports from  Indonesia reached only $746.1 million.    During the first 11 months of last year, the two-way trade  reached $1.96 billion.    In 1992, Australia was Indonesia's 11th largest export  market. Its imports from Indonesia included synthetic fiber,  shoes, wood products, rattan, textiles, coffee and rubber  products.</p>

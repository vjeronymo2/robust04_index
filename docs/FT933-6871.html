			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace McDonnell Douglas almost got to the altar with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation before being jilted, so it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that British Aerospace's proposed joint venture could collapse. TAC's previous failure will doubtless spur officials to great efforts, since a reputation as an unreliable partner would hardly help Taiwan gain a foothold in aerospace. Even so, a lack of political consensus could still scupper the deal. Failure would not be as heavy a blow to BAe as would have been the case six months ago. The management has delivered on several other promises. Perhaps even more importantly BAe has renegotiated its banking lines so that the previous constraint on the net worth of the group has been removed. That had curbed the company's ability to rationalise its businesses by limiting the amount which could be written off from its balance sheet. So while BAe hopes to use some of the provisions set aside for the regional jet business if the Taiwan deal succeeds, reorganisation of its missiles and turboprop operations can go ahead regardless. Failure would, however, carry a cost. BAe would lose the Pounds 120m which Taiwan was to have paid into the joint venture, and the company would have to use between another Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m of the provisions it set aside to close plant. There would also be a blow to the carefully constructed credibility of the new management team. That would be unfortunate, given that many investors are only now being lulled into forgetting BAe's past.</p>

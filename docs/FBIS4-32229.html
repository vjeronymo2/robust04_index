			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Kragujevac, Yugoslavia, June 19 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav  Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said Sunday that U.N. Envoy  Yasushi Akashi's statement, in which he said that the U.N. would  pursue a "stick and carrot" policy towards the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia, confirmed that some members of the world  organization were pursuing a partial policy.    The countries represented on the Contact Group for  Bosnia-Herzegovina have a great responsibility not to allow to  be drawn again into the trap of partiality and belief that they  could achieve something by pursuing the "stick and carrot"  policy, Jovanovic said in a radio interview broadcast from  Kragujevac in central Serbia.    Referring to hints that the new maps for  Bosnia-Herzegovina's  territorial division would be submitted to the warring sides as  an ultimatum, Jovanovic said that this was not yet clear and  that everybody should wait.    However, if it would be merely a continuation of the earlier  policy of favouring the Bosnian Moslems and Croats and punishing  the Serbs, then it would obviously not lead to any results,  Jovanovic said.    The Contact Group is soon expected to present the maps for  Bosnia's division, according to which 51 percent of the  territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina would go to the Moslem-Croat  federation and 49 percent to the Bosnian Serbs.</p>

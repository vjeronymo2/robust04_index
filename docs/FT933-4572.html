			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Expamet moves back into the black with Pounds 1.95m EXPAMET International, the building, industrial and security components supplier, reported pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 of Pounds 1.95m, against losses of Pounds 6.81m. The comparative figure was restated from profits of Pounds 2.45m for FRS 3. During the period the company completed the sale of non-core activities resulting in exceptional gains of Pounds 303,000, against a charge of Pounds 9.08m. Group turnover for continuing businesses advanced to Pounds 62.8m (Pounds 57.4m) with a further Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 15.1m) from discontinued activities. Continuing operating profits were 15 per cent ahead at Pounds 3.34m (Pounds 2.89m) with discontinued losses of Pounds 338,000 (Pounds 823,000 profits). A breakdown of continuing operating profits showed security division at Pounds 700,000 (same), industrial Pounds 1m (Pounds 700,000) and building Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.5m). At the end of the period borrowings were Pounds 18.7m against shareholders funds of Pounds 16.7m. The company said that continental Europe being in recession and the UK and US unable to show other than a fragile and patchy recovery did not help prospects. Considerable costs were being incurred to cut overheads and improve efficiency. The full benefit of these measures would not be felt until next year. Earnings were 2.49p (losses 11.81p). The interim dividend is cut to 1.25p (2.09p).</p>

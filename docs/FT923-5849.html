			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Pioneering road-rail freight service collapses A REVOLUTIONARY rail freight service launched just 11 weeks ago by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, collapsed last night as the operator, Charterail, called in the liquidators. The service had been cited by Mr MacGregor as an example of how freight could be switched from road to rail. He said it would take 10,000 lorry movements a year off the roads. Failure of the experiment will not only deeply embarrass him, but will also cast severe doubts on the long-term prospects for rail freight in the UK - particularly after rail privatisation. The revolutionary aspect of the collapsed freight operation was that it offered a door-to-door rail service by switching lorry trailers on to specially adapted rail wagons for the long distance part of their journeys. Launched on June 11, it ran nightly each way between rail depots in London and Glasgow with a stop at Warrington, Cheshire, to serve the Manchester area. Customers included Coca-Cola, Nestle, Ranks Hovis McDougall and Safeway. The service was not making money. Charterail, 78 per cent owned by the private sector and 22 per cent by British Rail, said the critical element had been the high price charged by BR for the haulage of its trains. BR, which has no active involvement in Charterail's management, said proposals put to it by Charterail for a cut in its haulage rates were unacceptable. Charterail also had a contract to deliver petfood from the Pedigree Petfoods plant in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, to London. This potentially profitable service seems likely to be taken over by BR's Railfreight Distribution subsidiary. The service's collapse highlights the difficulties faced by private sector railfreight operators in trying to compete with road transport when their costs are much higher. The problem is likely to be exacerbated after privatisation when BR must adopt a new system of charging rail users the full commercial cost of access to its tracks. Last night the Department of Transport was distancing itself from the collapse, saying it was purely a commercial matter. Mr Roger Freeman, the public transport minister, said on the BBC's Nine O'Clock News that the failure would not shake the government's resolve to press ahead with BR's privatisation.

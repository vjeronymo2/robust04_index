			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT SIGNS BILL LAUNCHING COLLIDER  </P> <P> President Bush on Friday signed a 1990 spending bill that will launch the  $5-billion super collider research project, an experimental atom smasher to be  built in Texas.  </P> <P> The $225-million down payment on the super collider was included in a  compromise measure Congress approved to provide $18.6 billion for next year's  federal energy and water programs.  </P> <P> The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act is the first of 13  appropriations bills for the 1990 fiscal year, which begins Sunday, to reach  Bush's desk.  </P> <P> Most of the 1990 money for the superconducting super collider is for initial  construction expenses of what ultimately will be a 53-mile circular underground  tunnel about 25 miles south of Dallas. The rest is for research and  development.  </P> <P> The facility, expected to take up to seven years to complete, would hurl beams  of protons into each other in a search for the basic building blocks of the  universe.  </P></p>

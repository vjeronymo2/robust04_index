			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "China Races To Catch Up In Hi-Tech </F> Circuit Production"]    [Text] China is determined to catch up with the world in  the production of integrated circuits, the core of the modern  electronics industry.    The Electronics Industry Ministry (MEI) describes China's  integrated circuit sector as being about 15 years behind  international standards.    Without effective measures, they warn, China will fall even  further behind.    Last year, the country's 15 manufacturers produced 170  million sets of integrated circuits, only 0.4 per cent of the  world total.    Lacking capital investment, the industry has crawled along  over the past decade, MEI officials said in a recent interview.    By contrast, the United States, Japan, Western Europe, South  Korea and Taiwan have all injected billions of dollars into  their industries.    Integrated circuits serve as the brain for most electronic  projects. They are also the most difficult piece of electronics  to manufacture.    In 1990, the government realized the strategic importance of  integrated circuits and worked out an ambitious development  programme.    The ministry hoped to invest 3 billion yuan ($345 million)  to  improve their technology and manufacturing capabilities.    However, government officials acknowledge that the programme  has not gone smoothly.    Hi-tech equipment has been tough to import because of  restrictions on the transfer of strategic Western technology  imposed by the now-defunct Coordinating Committee on  Multilateral Export Control.    The State has revised its strategy to rely more on producing  integrated circuits domestically, officials said.    MEI will try to spur industry growth by 30 per cent annually  in the coming years. Its target is to produce 1 billion  integrated circuits by year 2000.    They noted that some factors favour the development of the  industry.    Integrated circuit production will be stimulated by the  ministry's intensified efforts to develop programme-controlled  telephone exchanges, video cassette recorders, fax machines,  copy machines and mobile telephones.    China is also proceeding with the three "Golden Projects" to  form a national information network, which would create a  massive market for integrated circuits.    China will need about 2 billion to 3 billion integrated  circuits by 2000.    The ministry has set up 10 design and development centres  and  plans 30 to 40 more.    With the recent demise of the Coordinating Committee on  Multilateral Export Control, importing technology and equipment  will be easier, officials said.    In March, Huajing Electronics Company of Jiangsu Province  signed a contract with American chipmaker Intel Corp to assemble  386 microprocessors.    The ministry hopes in a few years to form some large  companies each with annual production exceeding 100 million  integrated circuits.</p>

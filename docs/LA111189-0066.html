			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WALL CRUMBLES;  </P> <P> BUSH SHEDS HIS CAUTION, CITING PROOF OF REFORM;  </P> <P> POLICY: THE PRESIDENT SEES NEXT MONTH'S SUMMIT WITH GORBACHEV AS EVEN MORE  SIGNIFICANT.  </P> <P> Shedding the cautious tone he adopted only a day earlier, President Bush said  Friday that East Germany's decision to open its borders proves that the force  of political reform in Eastern Europe is real and "deserves our continued  encouragement."  </P> <P> Speaking to the National Assn. of Realtors in Dallas, Bush said that his  Mediterranean summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev next month  "takes on even more importance than when I conceived the idea."  </P> <P> "We're living in fascinating times," the President said, "and we will seize  every opportunity to contribute to lasting peace and to extend democracy. And  in doing so, I will conduct the foreign policy of this great country with the  prudence that these fascinating times -- times of change -- demand, and with  imagination."  </P> <P> Bush's comments were considerably less measured than his earlier observations  about events in East Germany. And they underscored the importance of the summit  at sea on warships off the island of Malta on Dec. 2 and 3.  </P> <P> When the Administration announced plans for the Bush-Gorbachev meeting a week  ago, White House officials called it a preliminary get-together rather than a  negotiating session intended to produce substantive decisions.  </P> <P> The President did not elaborate on his comment that events in East Germany and  the rest of Eastern Europe would make the summit more important. But Secretary  of State James A. Baker III said that Bush and Gorbachev will "share respective  viewpoints" on the fast-developing situation.  </P> <P> Baker, interviewed on the ABC-TV program "Good Morning, America," added, "The  purpose of this pre-summit meeting between President Gorbachev and President  Bush is not to sit around a table and talk about dividing up in any way Eastern  Europe or the future of Eastern Europe."  </P> <P> Major Impact  </P> <P> Even so, it seems unlikely that the superpower leaders could conduct  face-to-face talks without either adopting joint measures to assure stability  in Eastern Europe or failing to do so. Either way, the summit would have a  major impact on the region.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush spoke by telephone  Friday with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He said the two men had said  the Mediterranean meeting has taken on added significance and that they had  agreed to consult closely in the weeks preceding the session.  </P> <P> "Bush should be very careful at the summit not to sign anything that his staff  hasn't parsed thoroughly," said George Carver, who was deputy CIA director when  Bush headed the agency in the mid-1970s.  </P> <P> "Bush has to be very careful not to be mousetrapped into doing something that  has not been thought through thoroughly or, conversely, to be put into a  position where he appears to be the only obstructionist," Carver said. "Bush is  sitting down with a very heady chess player, a man who always thinks at least  five moves ahead. We (Americans), by instinct, are not chess players."  </P> <P> Since the day the Berlin Wall was built 28 years ago, U.S. officials have been  demanding its destruction. But Administration officials now acknowledge that  they are unprepared to deal with such sudden and dramatic success.  </P> <P> "Were we surprised by the speed of it?" Baker asked. "You bet your life. And so  was everybody else, as far as I can determine. I don't know anybody who's  suggested that they predicted this was going to happen."  </P> <P> As a result, the Administration is struggling to devise a new strategy toward  Eastern Europe. So far, U.S. policy-makers have taken a very cautious approach,  with Bush warning that the possibility still exists of a crackdown on the  reform movements by the region's Communist governments.  </P> <P> Everyone Surprised  </P> <P> In an interview with a small group of reporters Thursday, Bush spoke of the  "dramatic happening" in Eastern Europe and said that he is "elated." But he  appeared reluctant to assess whether the reform effort will indeed be lasting.  Friday's remarks indicated that the Administration's skepticism is waning.  </P> <P> "The changes in recent months make clear that the process of reform initiated  by the East Europeans and supported by Mr. Gorbachev and by America and by our  allies is real, offers us all much hope (and) deserves our continued  encouragement," Bush said.  </P> <P> Later, in a speech at a political fund-raising dinner in Dallas, Bush seemed to  back off a bit.  </P> <P> "Of course, we all look now with hope in our hearts at the amazing changes in  Eastern Europe -- indeed in the Soviet Union itself -- with encouragement and  hope," he said. "Yet this country must not and cannot base its foreign policy  or its national security on the aspirations of one man inside the Soviet Union,  or anywhere else."  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney added a note of caution in an interview with the  Associated Press. "The opening of the (Berlin) wall, it's a major event, but  it's important for us to think about what comes after that," Cheney said. "We  need to digest these changes. Clearly we welcome them, but we have to be a  little reserved about formulating major policy shifts until we have an  opportunity to see what happens."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the Administration is coming under increasing pressure to take  some action to reinforce the process of change.  </P> <P> The Administration and the Democratic-controlled Congress already have agreed  that the United States should provide economic aid to the reformist governments  in Poland and Hungary, although they have haggled over the proper amount. It  seems likely that the U.S. government will at least consider extending  assistance to East Germany as well.  </P> <P> Some non-government experts are urging Bush to take steps that would support  Gorbachev's Soviet reforms and reward him for permitting dramatic changes in  Poland, Hungary and East Germany.  </P> <P> "One should realize that the Soviets are quite serious," said Yahia Zoubir,  professor of international relations at American University in Washington.  "What they have allowed in East Germany proves their sincerity. If we want to  help Gorbachev, it's the time to do it. The Soviets have done all that they can  do."  </P> <P> California Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), interviewed on NBC-TV's "Today Show,"  expressed similar sentiments. "I think we need to give tangible expressions of  our support (to Gorbachev)," Lantos said. "Without Gorbachev, what we are  seeing at the Berlin Wall would not be taking place."  </P> <P> Baker, interviewed on Cable News Network, agreed that East Germany would not  have opened its borders "had the Soviets not tacitly approved it or called for  it or welcomed it." But Baker stopped short of suggesting a conciliatory  gesture from the West. Instead, he called on East Germany to follow up its  relaxation of travel rules by conducting "open and free and fair democratic  elections."  </P> <P> Kempster reported from Washington and Gerstenzang from Dallas.  </P></p>

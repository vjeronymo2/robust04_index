			<p>BFN     [Text] The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] commissioner, Mrs. Helen  Suzman, says she never wants to hear the words up and running  again for as long as she lives. Speaking at Gallagher's Estate  in Midrand on the counting of ballots in the PWV region, she  said she doubted whether the results would be out before  midnight tonight. Mrs. Suzman said she'd visited the Nasrec  [National Exhibition Center] Counting Center, and that dozens of  ballot boxes had not even been opened yet. She jokingly  referred to her job as commissioner as the most terrible job she  had ever had. She said that although it was the smallest  province, it was the most densely populated, and she'd only  received the assignment three weeks before the election had  started.</p>

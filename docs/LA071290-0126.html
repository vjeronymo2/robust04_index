			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> PRESIDENT'S CAREFUL GROUNDWORK PAYS OFF;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: BUSH ACHIEVED NEARLY ALL HIS GOALS. AND HE DID IT WITHOUT STIRRING  RANCOR OR RESENTMENT AMONG THE ALLIES.  </P> <P> President Bush's kinder, and more accommodating, style of personal diplomacy  brought him no end of grief from critics in Congress and elsewhere during his  first 18 months in the White House.  </P> <P> But it is finally beginning to pay off in America's relations with its economic  allies.  </P> <P> That is the message emerging from the annual seven-nation economic summit  conference that ended Wednesday: After 2 1/2 days of hard bargaining among the  allied leaders, Bush achieved virtually all his goals. And he did it without  stirring rancor or resentment.  </P> <P> Bush spent much of his first year and a half in office accommodating the  allies, especially the two most important ones, West Germany and Japan, on key  issues. He also worked tirelessly to build personal relationships with Western  leaders that increased the harmony among the major powers and left many of them  in the President's debt.  </P> <P> "What Bush did at Houston was to begin calling in his IOUs" from the six other  heads of government, says J. Paul Horne, the European-based international  economic analyst for the New York brokerage, Smith Barney, Harris Upham. "The  guy has a very high credit rating abroad."  </P> <P> Albert Bressand, director of Promethee, a Paris-based think tank, agrees.  </P> <P> "There's a deep appreciation here in Europe because Bush was willing to pay the  price for allied solidarity before," Bressand says. "As a result, none of the  other leaders wants to make things difficult for him now."  </P> <P> The chronology is plain enough:  </P> <P> Bush was the first to support West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the drive  for German reunification -- and, in the process, to boost Kohl's chances for  election as the first leader of a unified Germany.  </P> <P> He skillfully helped Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu avoid a serious  scrap with Congress that might have resulted in the imposition of U.S. trade  sanctions.  </P> <P> He quickly acceded to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's plea to begin a joint  U.S.-Canadian effort to reduce acid rain, reversing the intransigence of the  Reagan Administration and ending years of mounting friction between the two  countries.  </P> <P> And he encouraged European leaders to expand the portfolio of the  Brussels-based European Community to include some diplomatic as well as  economic powers -- part of the "new architecture" of the post-Cold War Europe.  Last year, the United States let the community take the lead in coordinating  international aid to Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Painfully for Bush, however, the reaction in Congress has been lukewarm, at  best. Democratic lawmakers frequently have charged that the soft-treading  President has been too lackluster in pressing America's interests and has  failed to exert enough leadership around the world.  </P> <P> But the White House may be getting the last laugh as it begins to reap the  benefits of the President's more collegial strategy.  </P> <P> "Bush may have seemed to be old-fashioned, but he actually has been playing a  critical role," Smith Barney's Horne asserts. "He has been protecting the  Western Alliance from losing what it has accomplished" in previous years as  Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand begin producing ambitious new  proposals in their competition for the leadership of post-Cold War Europe.  </P> <P> Bush's ability to cash in IOUs has been especially apparent here in Houston,  where the summit leaders acceded to U.S. wishes on agricultural trade, breaking  an impasse that could have stymied the current round of global  trade-liberalization talks.  </P> <P> They agreed to back away from establishing a $15-billion fund to aid the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> They scrapped a measure that Bush had opposed for setting long-range targets on  reducing carbon dioxide emissions worldwide.  </P> <P> And they confined any changes in the Third World debt strategy to limited  reductions in debts owed to Western governments.  </P> <P> In no small measure, the Administration's more accommodating posture in its  early months helped lay the groundwork for those successes. The U.S. victory on  the farm trade issue, for example, came largely because a grateful Kohl broke  ranks with his fellow Europeans to support Bush on what he knows is an  important issue to the United States.  </P> <P> And Kohl, Kaifu and Mulroney took political risks of their own to help  Washington on other issues, from the Soviet aid question to the environment.  </P> <P> In the end, even the European Community was less insistent on holding to its  established positions than had been expected.  </P> <P> Bush virtually acknowledged those crosscurrents during his press conference  Wednesday. Asked whether the fact that Kohl supported him on trade, even though  he faces a pan-German election in early December, constituted a pay-back to  Washington, the President was candid, to a point.  </P> <P> "I do think that the Germans appreciate the fact that we have stood at their  side on this question of German reunification," he said, and then mused, "The  relationship . . . is hard to explain."  </P> <P> To be sure, not all the U.S. successes at the Houston summit stemmed from  Bush's new personal diplomacy. As might be expected, in each case, the other  leaders acted as a result of domestic pressures as well.  </P> <P> For instance, Kohl backed the U.S. stand on farm subsidies partly to repay Bush  for having supported him on unification. But he also was wary about having to  support East Germany's inefficient farmers if the existing European Community  subsidy program were to continue.  </P> <P> And much of Kaifu's opposition to lending to the Soviets stems from Moscow's  refusal to return four islands in the southern Kuriles that it took from Japan  after World War II.  </P> <P> To some extent, Bush's "success" in fending off more sweeping proposals by the  summit leaders was made easier by the fact that the allies were divided. As a  result, many of the leaders' differences were resolved by agreeing only on a  broad framework that allowed each country to go its own way on specifics.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the United States achieved virtually all of its objectives in  Houston, and it did so without rancor or bitterness. That came partly because  the allied leaders read Bush's lips -- and usually saw a smile.  </P></p>

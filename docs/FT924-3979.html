			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Letter: Effects of European law on contracting for public services Sir, I wonder if I may contribute to the debate in your letters column on employees' rights in respect of contracting for public services. There are two main issues on which the applicability of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 (TUPE) to contracting-out situations have traditionally depended. First, the TUPE regulations were drawn to exclude transfers of non-commercial ventures. The European Court in Dr Sophie Redmond Stichting v Bartol has, however, ruled that there is no such exclusion under European law (Directive 77/187). In appropriate cases a tribunal may be invited to apply European law. And, in any event, the government has provided in the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill for the abolition of the requirement of a commercial venture. This obstacle for employees will therefore shortly cease to be a problem. The second issue, however, is that TUPE requires a transfer of an undertaking or part. According to the European Court this means there must be an economic entity (whether or not commercial in nature) which has retained its identity, before the legislation can apply. In some cases of contracting out of ancillary services (whether in the private sector or the public sector) what is granted to the contractor amounts, by contrast, to nothing more than a contract for services. However, quite clearly, each case depends on its own facts. There will be many situations where, on contracting out, an employee's rights are transferred under the legislation. Perhaps the latest example is the European Court case of Rask v ISS Kantineservice (Case C209/91) in which the advocate general delivered an opinion, only this October, that Directive 77/187 is perfectly capable of applying to the contracting out of a staff canteen facility from an employer to a contractor. The sole question for the national court being, in his view, whether the undertaking's identity has been maintained. It is therefore far from clear that, as Mr Forysyth states in his letter (November 30), 'there is not normally a transfer of an undertaking' in the context of compulsory competitive tendering legislation. It entirely depends on how the activity has been structured and the nature of the contract given to the contractor. The position of parties involved in contracting is therefore at best uncertain and will continue to be so until a sequence of illustrative cases passes through the courts taking into account the recent European Court decisions mentioned.

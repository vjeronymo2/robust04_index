			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Taking the modernist medicine  -Political Notebook So there we have it. Mr Tony Blair's social-ism is a creed tailored to Britain's aspirant classes. The Labour party is being made safe for the sitting rooms of respectable Britain. The decision to bury the legacy of Sidney and Beatrice Webb was a momentous one in terms of his own authority. The youngest leader in the party's history is in command. Even his enemies in Blackpool admit that. But the real significance lies not in this week's headlines, wonderful though they were. Mr Blair's judgment was that Labour had one more chance to make the electoral breakthrough that has eluded it since Mr Neil Kinnock hauled it back from the cliff-edge of extremism in 1983. Since then the most damaging and recurrent refrain on the doorstep has been a simple one: 'You say you've changed but I'm not sure I believe it.' A new statement of aims and values to replace the statism of Clause 4 will allow Mr Blair to chip away at that deadly doubt. There is a wider significance. The Labour leader plans to present the voters with a social democratic manifesto. His party has now begun to understand that. There will be grumbles. Some will fight him. But the majority - even the dinosaurs at the TGWU and GMB general unions - have nowhere else to go. The inevitable comparison between Blackpool and the Bad Godesberg conference of West Germany's social democrats in 1959 is in some ways a superficial one. Then the SPD burned its Marxist baggage in a single act of expurgation. Labour has spent a decade dumping the policies which once gave substance to the dream of Clause 4. But Mr Blair's decision may well have the same powerful symbolism as Bad Godesberg. Blackpool 1994 already has a place in the history books. There will be much argument about the precise terms of the new statement that Mr Blair will present in draft to the national executive committee. Mr John Prescott, his traditionalist deputy, will be joined by other influential figures on the party's soft left in insisting that it must acknowledge a pivotal role for the state in realising its new ambitions. The obstacles are surmountable. Mr Blair has already made the elision between acceptance of a dynamic market economy and a role for government in creating the conditions for economic success and social stability. There is nothing unique in his prescription. Not many years ago it could be found buried between the lines in the speeches of one-nation Tories such as Mr Chris Patten. The wordsmiths around the Labour leader should not have too much trouble in crafting a statement incorporating Mr Blair's touchstones of opportunity, responsibility, fairness and trust while genuflecting in the direction of the soft left. It is a fair bet that the statement will land on every doorstep in the weeks preceding the general election. The manner of this week's announcement was also important. Mr Blair decided at the outset of his leadership that he would have to take a bold initiative. A new statement of values to give credence to the idea of 'new Labour' was an obvious choice. But it was a brave rather than a rash move. In every job he has done during his meteoric rise Mr Blair has been as calculating as he has been bold. He has covered his back and reinforced his flanks before advancing. He did so again this week. Mr Prescott initially was unenthusiastic. He had been instrumental in saving John Smith's leadership during last year's conference struggle over party democracy. He did not see the case for another constitutional battle with his friends on the left. The party had chosen him as deputy to sit in the guard's van behind Mr Blair and apply the traditionalist brake. But Mr Prescott acknowledged the case for a bold move; and once he understood that Mr Blair was determined to press ahead, he determined that he had to back him. The deputy leader will campaign for the change. Key figures on the soft left, such as Mr David Blunkett and Mr Robin Cook are expected to acquiesce. Others will be smart enough to realise that opposing Mr Blair now would not be the smartest career move. Several important union figures were carefully squared in the last few hours before Mr Blair's speech. Mr Prescott helped with the final wording to ensure that opponents had the narrowest possible angle of fire. Mr Bill Morris, a prisoner of his executive on the TGWU, will today ceremoniously cast its block vote in favour of Clause 4. It will be ignored. Mr Blair would be mistaken though to rest on his laurels. There are policies to be crafted on the principles he expounded this week. He needs to enthuse the electorate as well as to reassure it. There will be serious internal battles over the minimum wage and over full employment. The culture of struggle and betrayal live on in the Labour party. There have been serious undercurrents of disagreement this week over tax. Mr Prescott and his allies are not ready to accept a strategy which could lock Labour into supporting any tax cuts the government cares to announce before the general election. Tax will be a bloody internal battleground. But the party has understood this week that even if it does not like the taste of Mr Blair's modernist medicine it has no choice but to take it.</p>

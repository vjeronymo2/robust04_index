			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / International Company News: O'Reilly again gets the bounce of the ball - The international media ambitions of the former rugby player Mr Tony O'Reilly first shot to fame as an 18-year old in South Africa, as a member of the British Lions rugby team nearly 40 years ago. The ball bounced well for him, and for a time at least, the unknown Irish teenager, was considered the best wing threequarter in the world. The ball is bouncing well again in South Africa for Mr O'Reilly, chairman and chief executive of HJ Heinz and also chairman of the media company he controls, Independent Newspapers of Ireland. Around the same time as the Dublin-based company was making its play for Newspaper Publishing, the lossmaking company that owns The Independent in the UK, and buying a 29.9 per cent stake, it pulled off a far more significant deal in South Africa. Mr O'Reilly agreed to buy nearly a third of Argus Newspapers of South Africa, arguably the most influential newspaper group on the continent from Anglo-American Corporation and Johannesburg Consolidated Investment. The key initial 31 per cent stake cost the Irish about IPounds 20m (Pounds 19.6m). Mr O'Reilly will pay R11.50 a share, but with the shares already trading at up to R15 there is already a paper profit of more than IPounds 6m for Mr O'Reilly. The performance on the South African rugby field and on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange 40 years later are connected. When Mr O'Reilly charged down the wing in the crowd was a Mr Mandela. A young player in one of the warm-up games before the big match was a Mr de Klerk. The Irish businessman's position in Africa was later consolidated when as Heinz chief executive he decided to construct a food plant in Mr Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe. When Anglo-American decided they did not wish to be in the media in South Africa any more, they came to Mr O'Reilly, as a newspaper publisher likely to be acceptable to a new South African government to see whether he would be interested in investing in the Argus group, whose titles include The Star and the Sunday Tribune. 'There are 15 high speed presses in all of Africa and we have got 11 of them. The equipment they have could print 12m papers (a week). We're printing 5m. We have vast spare capacity,' says O'Reilly. Before the recent South African elections it was a move that could have been risky. It looks much less so now. Mr O'Reilly believes he will be able to produce there a company with a market capitalisation of Pounds 200m. The move into South Africa is the most dramatic example so far of the international media ambitions of both Mr O'Reilly and the Independent Newspapers group. At its recent annual meeting, Mr O'Reilly, who bought control of Independent for Pounds 1.1m 21 years ago, was able to tell shareholders that IPounds 1,000 invested then would, together with dividends being reinvested in the company, be now worth IPounds 154,000. Pre-tax profits rose 81 per cent last year to IPounds 29m. Mr O'Reilly moved on Friday to strengthen the management of the group's Irish newspapers by appointing Mr David Palmer, former chief executive of the Financial Times group, to the vacant post of managing director. Yet apart from the core business in Ireland, which now includes investments in cable and microwave television distribution, as well as newspapers, the company has expanded into France, Mexico, the UK and Australia. The investments range from billboards in Mexico, through local and regional papers and advertising on buses to local newspapers and the stake in The Independent in the UK. Mr Brenden Hopkins, who runs the UK business and is responsible for international acquisitions, notes the change in the nature of the group. 'Three years ago we were an Irish group with international interests and now we are an international group with interests in Ireland, Australia, France and the UK,' says Mr Hopkins. He hopes he will be able to buy more in the UK regional press in the next 12 months or so. So far only between 12 and 13 per cent of the company's shares are held in London, although it says London stockbrokers are starting to take more interest following the acquisition of the stake in The Independent. Mr O'Reilly plans to take a more direct interest in running the company when he retires from Heinz in about two years. At the moment it is in the hands of Mr Liam Healy, the quietly spoken, but tough-minded chief executive who has worked for the group for 30 years. Mr O'Reilly hopes he can create a group with a total capitalisation of Pounds 1bn within the next three years, although that would include consolidating existing minority stakes. He is also ambitious to expand his newspaper interests, possibly including United Newspapers, publishers of the Daily and Sunday Express. 'If someone like Michael Green (chairman of Carlton Communications) wanted the Daily Express as the standard bearer for his communications company and I could find a way in which he would buy at a higher multiple and I got the (United's) regionals at a lower multiple, it would be a good deal,' says Mr O'Reilly.</p>

Shemyakin at Russia's Academy of Sciences,  Moscow; UDC 577.112]    [Abstract] The role of human interleukin-4 as a growth and  immune system cell differentiation stimulant which regulates the  immune response and the difficulty of obtaining large quantities  of interleukine-4 necessary for in depth studies and practical  applications from natural sources make the use of genetic  engineering and biotechnology methods especially promising.  Chemical enzymatic synthesis of the human hIL4 gene at the  Bioorganic Chemistry Institute lab is reported and this gene's  expression in E. coli cells is described. The  pKK223-3 commercial plasmid (by Pharmacia) containing a strong  controlled tac-promotor, a binding segment with  ribosomes of the lacZ gene, EcoRI-HindIII  polylinker of the pUC18 plasmid, and a strong transcription  terminator of the rrnB gene is used as the expression  vector while the EcoRI-HindIII fragment  containing the hIL4 gene is cloned into the pKKhIL4-12  polylinker segment. The factors which affect the gene expression  are examined, and it is noted that the expression level depends  on the distance between the ribosome binding segment (RBS) and  the starting ATG codon. The resulting TG1/pKKhIL4-9 strain was  used to isolate hIL4 which is produced in the E. coli  bacterial cells in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies. The  highest production level is observed in the structure where the  RBS distance corresponds to nine nucleotide pairs. The hIL4 was  solubilized, renatured, and purified in a biologically active  state with a yield of 2 mg per 1 g of moist cells. According to  amino acid sequencing data, the resulting hIL4 has an N-terminal  Met-His-Lys-Asp-He-Thr-Leu sequence which is consistent with the  human interleukin-4 sequence with an additional Met.

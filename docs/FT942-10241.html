			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Lloyds Bank funds C&amp;G bid Lloyds Bank's Pounds 400m two-tranche transaction of subordinated debt dominated a relatively busy day in the international bond market yesterday. Of the total, which Lloyds said would satisfy all its loan requirements in relation to its proposed takeover of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, Pounds 300m was raised through an offering of five-year floating-rate notes - exchangeable at the bank's option into a further 10-year issue - priced to yield 70 basis points over three-month Libor. The balance was made up of an issue of 15-year fixed-rate bonds priced to yield 110 basis points over the 9 per cent UK government bond due 2008. Dealers noted that the spread on Lloyds' 10-year subordinated bonds launched in February stood at 90 basis points yesterday, so it was paying an extra 20 basis points for the additional five years. Mr John Gillbe, chief manager group finance at Lloyds Bank, said the structure of the deal was designed to keep the average cost as low as possible. In addition, the call option on the FRNs gave the bank flexibility with its capital requirements. 'We may not need the capital for that long,' he said. Syndicate managers said the greater proportion of FRNs and the generous pricing reflected Lloyds' desire to overcome difficult market conditions and ensure a successful transaction. 'It was a greedy trade by people who need the money,' said one syndicate manager. The three joint lead managers, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and S. G. Warburg, said the FRNs sold quicker than the fixed-rate bonds. The perception that the FRNs were cheap caused the discounted margin on the notes to tighten to 62 1/2 basis points over Libor at one stage. However, it settled at 65 basis points in late trading. By contrast, the fixed-rate bonds went almost exclusively to UK institutions and the spread remained unchanged when they were freed to trade. 'There is not the same depth of demand for fixed-rate sterling bonds as there was three months ago,' said Salomon. However, S. G. Warburg said the statement by Lloyds that it had no further plans to raise loan capital facilitated sales. Elsewhere, Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, raised FFr1.5bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds. Joint lead manager SBC said Unilever's wide following among institutional and retail investors enabled it to achieve pricing comparable with French public sector debt. Eurofima, L'Oreal and Carrefour are also thought to be looking to raise French francs. Standard &amp; Poor's has revised its outlook on the Republic of Ireland's long-term foreign currency rating of double-A minus to positive from stable. The revision reflects the government's adherence to conservative demand management policies and structural reform. IBCA, the rating agency, has upgraded Fokus Bank of Norway to A - from BBB+, writes Karen Fossli from Oslo. The move follows a strong improvement in the bank's financial position.</p>

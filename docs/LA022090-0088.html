			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> OIL CLEANUP IS TOPIC OF SCIENTIFIC SESSION  </P> <P> Eighteen months ago when they selected Newport Beach for their conference,  three University of Massachusetts scientists had no idea how appropriate the  choice would become.  </P> <P> Today, while workers sweep spilled crude oil from Newport's beaches, the  conference will discuss the latest in oil pollution cleanup technology and  policies.  </P> <P> And the featured speaker, signed up for more than a year, will be Peter  Leathard, president of the company in charge of the cleanup in Newport and  Huntington Beach. Leathard's topic: "The Prince William Sound Oil Spill -- Are  You Prepared?"  </P> <P> Leathard's firm, Veco Inc. of Anchorage, Alaska, managed the Prince William  Sound cleanup caused by the tanker Valdez's running aground. The conference  program, printed months ago, says Leathard would discuss in detail "what would  have happened if the spill occurred offshore of Los Angeles and what could be  done to prepare for such a spill."  </P> <P> The Feb. 7 spill off Huntington Beach will make the discussion a lot less  theoretical, said Charles E. Bell, one of the conference organizers. "I don't  doubt (Leathard) will talk about this cleanup. It's a hot topic."  </P> <P> Leathard is scheduled to speak during a 7 p.m. banquet today at the Sheraton  Hotel-Newport Beach. Huntington Beach Fire Chief Raymond C. Picard is expected  to appear as well and answer questions about the local cleanup.  </P> <P> The rest of the conference, which ends Thursday, is concerned with the  technical and policy aspects of soil and ground water contamination, which  usually comes from leaking storage tanks.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations mitigate the effect of double  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxation through a reduction to a decedent's adjusted taxable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gifts. In general, the amount of the reduction is the lesser of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The amount by which the transferor's taxable gifts were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased as a result of the application of section 2701 to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial transfer, or (2) the amount by which the individual's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxable transfers were increased as a result of not applying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valuation rules of section 2701 upon the subsequent transfer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicable retained interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under certain circumstances, the proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that the transferor's spouse is treated as the transferor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for purposes of making the adjustment. However, because a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferor will often acquire (by gift, inheritance, or purchase)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an applicable retained interest initially held by an applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family member and because of the administrative complexity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inherent in allowing assignability of the adjustment between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferor and any other applicable family member, the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations do not provide for an adjustment by any individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than the transferor or the transferor's spouse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Potential for Loss of Benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commentator argued that some taxpayers will be deprived  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the benefit of the adjustment if it is not: (1) Available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lifetime transfers, and (2) freely assignable to all applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family members. In response to this comment, the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations adopt a rule generally allowing the adjustment in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computation of the transferor's gift tax if either the transferor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or an applicable family member transfers an applicable retained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest to or for the benefit of an individual other than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferor or an applicable family member.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, if the applicable retained interest has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been so transferred prior to the death of the transferor, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> executor of the transferor's estate is entitled to make the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment in computing the transferor's estate tax provided that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the executor can demonstrate the fair market value of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable retained interest as of the date of death of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, after carefully considering the merits of a freely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assignable adjustment, the IRS and the Treasury have determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that in light of the relief otherwise provided, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative complexity involved in tracking the adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would far outweigh the additional benefit that would be gained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefrom.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> ``Purge'' Method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commentator argued that double taxation is avoided only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the adjustment produces no greater tax than would be produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the initial transfer had not been made (and the value of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entity did not change prior to the transferor's death). In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> view of this commentator, section 2701 requires prepayment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer tax as the ``cost'' of a corporate or partnership freeze.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this view, the section 2701(e)(6) adjustment would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished through a mechanism whereby the transferor's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer tax base is ``purged'' of the effect of section 2701.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

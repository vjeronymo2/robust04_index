UNITA said its forces would continue to resist  attacks by the Angolan Army until a general peace accord had  been signed. UNITA made this announcement in a statement after  it claimed a major military victory over government forces in  the region of Dange-ia- Menha in Angola's northern Cuanza Norte  Province. The movement said it had inflicted heavy casualties  on a government military convoy estimated to consist of about  3,000 infantry soldiers and dozens of tanks. A number of  Zairian mercenaries fighting alongside the Angolan Army had also  been killed.</p>

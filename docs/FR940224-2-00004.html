			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The BLM and Forest Service are jointly preparing a Reasonably Foreseeable Development (RFD) scenario to predict the level and type of oil and gas activity anticipated to occur for the 10&hyph;15 year period following leasing. The RFD is based on known geologic, economic, and technical information for the local area. This RFD will be used to analyze the effects of the proposed action and alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service will continue to involve the public and inform interested and affected parties on how to participate and contribute to the final decision. Another formal opportunity for response will be provided following completion of a Draft EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Draft EIS should be available for review in the fall of 1994. The Final EIS is scheduled for completion in September 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency publishes the Notice of Availability in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Supervisor for the Lewis and Clark National Forest has been assigned the task of compiling the EIS. However, the officials responsible for making the decision resulting from the analysis are: David F. Jolly, Northern Region Regional Forester, Federal Building, 200 E. Broadway, P.O Box 7669, Missoula, MT 59807; and State Director, USDI-Bureau of Land Management, Montana State Office, 222 North 32nd Street, P.O. Box 36800, Billings, MT 59107&hyph;6800. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They will decide on an alternative to be implemented after considering comments and responses, environmental consequences discussed in the Final EIS, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies. The decision and reasons for the decision will be documented in a Record of Decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement will have 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency publishes the Notice of Availability in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage but are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the courts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Angoon <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hodel <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 803 F. 2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cr. 1986) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so substantive comments and objections can be made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider and respond to them in the Final Environmental Impact Statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments during the scoping period should be as specific as possible. Initial comments concerning the scope of the analysis should be mailed to John D. Gorman, Forest Supervisor by March 31, 1994. When the Draft EIS is released, it is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters in the draft document. Comments may also address the adequacy of the Draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: February 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John D.

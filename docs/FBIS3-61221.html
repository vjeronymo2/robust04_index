			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Lithuania should officially ask for membership in  NATO without any delay, said opposition MP Gediminas Vagnorius  at a press conference on December 1.    According to Mr. Vagnorius, the leader of the Conservative  Party, refusals to make an official request for Lithuania's  membership in NATO and attempts to negotiate with Russia over  military transit are the most scandalous facts in Lithuanian  foreign policy this year.    He also sharply criticized Chairman of the Parliament,  Ceslovas Jursenas, who said that NATO membership would limit  Lithuania's sovereignty and who indicated the need to hold a  referendum on the issue.</p>

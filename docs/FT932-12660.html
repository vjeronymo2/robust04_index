			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Toshiba sells audio unit stake TOSHIBA, the Japanese electronics manufacturer, has sold its 69 per cent stake in Onkyo, a specialised audio manufacturer, the company said. The decision to sell the stake in Onkyo highlights the restructuring that is in progress among Japanese corporations and the pressure that the domestic slowdown is putting on traditional equity relationships in Japan. Toshiba sold its holding in Onkyo to the president of a medium-sized manufacturer of auto parts who expressed interest in buying the stake through an M&amp;A firm affiliated with Nomura Securities. Onkyo is an established audio manufacturer which has suffered from the downturn in the consumer electronics market both in Japan and in other industrialised economies. Toshiba had been attempting to restructure the business. Last year, it made a net loss of Y320m (Dollars 2.89m) and a programme to cut costs by reducing its workforce, moving out of unprofitable businesses and increasing orders from Toshiba was outlined last July. However, Onkyo is expected to report a 12 per cent drop in sales to Y45bn in the year ended 993 and a loss for the period. Toshiba will continue to support Onkyo by marketing the audio-makers' products through its own retail store network. Financial assistance and a loan made to Onkyo will also be continued, Toshiba said. The move by Toshiba reflects a changing attitude among Japanese corporations on equity relationships as the economic slowdown puts increasing pressure on them to offload unprofitable businesses. It points to the likelihood of an accompanying increase in possibilities for mergers and acquisitions opening up in Japan.</p>

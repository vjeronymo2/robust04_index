			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: US retail groups report sales increases MANY of the largest US retail groups reported fairly strong sales increases in April, adding weight to suggestions that the economy is slowing pulling out of recession. Kmart posted a 5.5 per cent improvement in same-store sales, with its general merchandise outlets registering a 4.9 per cent gain, and the specialty chains returning a 7.3 per cent advance. The one large retailer to show falling sales last month was Sears, Roebuck. The Chicago-based company said total sales from its domestic stores were 3.9 per cent lower, with same-store sales down by 2.1 per cent. Sears is showing a modest 2.8 per cent increase in same-store sales for the first 13 weeks of its financial year. Other mainstream department store groups all posted increases last month. Dayton Hudson saw same-store sales rise by 3 per cent, while May Department Stores managed a 5.9 per cent rise. JC Penney, boosted by strong clothing sales, saw a 14.5 per cent rise, while Woolworth reported a 14.8 per cent increase from comparable domestic stores. The Gap, the specialty clothing chain which seemed to stumble slightly in March, also posted a double-digit sales increase  - up 30 per cent overall and 13 per cent on a same-store basis. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart, the aggressive discount chain which is now the nation's largest retailer in sales terms, reported a 13 per cent advance in same-store sales.</p>

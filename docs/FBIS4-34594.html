			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 18 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Mexican Federal  Electoral Institute (IFE) General Council announced today that  it will monitor the media to see if reports on the presidential  candidates' campaigns are fair and objective. During a regular  session this Saturday, IFE members unanimously agreed to order  the institution's Radio Broadcasts Commission to file a report  on their findings by the end of the month at the latest.    The Commission is to report to the Council every 15 days  until the political campaigns conclude on the handling of  information reported by the media.    Over 40 million Mexicans will go to the polls during 21  August's federal elections to choose a president, 500 deputies,  128 senators, and 66 Assembly members. The IFE General Council  plan includes a recommendation to the media, mainly radio and  television stations, to balance information on the political  campaigns of the various parties. It also asks the electronic  media to respect, in their radio and television newscasts, the  right of Mexicans to be informed about the campaign activities  of the nine presidential candidates.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Ministers fail to speed up the superhighway: Little is changed by the government's latest statement Even seasoned observers of the fast-changing telecommunications scene took time to absorb the implications of the government's latest statement on the development of the 'information superhighway', published earlier this week. In 35 pages it reinforces the government's commitment to the multimedia revolution but does little to alter the commercial playing field. The statement is in part a formal response to the views of the parliamentary committee on optical fibre networks which were published earlier this year. The MPs argued that British Telecommunications should be free to offer broadcast entertainment across its existing network - a conclusion which BT wholeheartedly supports. This week's government paper, Creating the Superhighways of the Future, rejects that idea, but seems to offer BT and public telecommunications operators the opportunity to test their broadcasting ambitions on a small scale. But very little has changed. BT wants to offer the broadest range of services across its network. The government, anxious to stimulate competition in telecommunications and to encourage investment by cable television companies, has denied it permission to broadcast entertainment. It is not, however, prevented from offering 'on-demand' services such as movies, home shopping or home banking. An ambitious series of trials in the south-east of England will test its ability to deliver these services. Under the terms of the government's last telecommunications review in 1991, there will be no revision of the ban on broadcast entertainment before 2001. This week's paper underlined that commitment. Cable companies, however, were empowered to offer telephone services as well as entertainment over their networks under the terms of the 1991 review. This assurance of phone revenues was critical in persuading cable companies to make the heavy investments needed - a total of about Pounds 10bn by 2000  -to construct an adequate cable infrastructure. By the end of next year about 6.5m homes will be connected to cable and more are being connected at a rate of between 1m and 2m a year. The 1990 Broadcasting Act rewrote the licence for cable television operators. The newly named Local Delivery Operators can deliver entertainment using radio technology as well as cable to clearly defined franchise areas such as a city or local authority area. There are 127 existing franchises; a further nine have been advertised which will be let under the new terms. A further 30 or so have yet to be defined geographically. When that has been done, about 95 per cent of the country will be covered. This week's paper argues that BT and other telecommunications operators have been able, since April, to apply for any advertised franchise. If they were successful, the government would be prepared to grant a licence to supply entertainment within the area of the franchise. They would be able to use either their existing technology - in BT's case, the conventional telephone lines into the home - or another, such as cable or radio. In fact, this freedom has always been available to BT although it has rarely sought to advertise the fact. Mr Richard Woollam, director of the Cable Communications Association, the cable trade body, said yesterday: 'All the government is saying to BT is 'Come and join the cable party'.' BT has no intention of contributing to a piecemeal approach to the recabling of Britain. It owned a number of cable franchises at one stage but sold them. It has not overinvested in Westminster Cable, one franchise it retained. It wants to spend Pounds 15bn to create its own network in competition with the cable operators. Nothing in the government's latest paper alters this stalemate.</p>

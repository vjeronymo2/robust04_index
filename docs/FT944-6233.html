			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Comment): Enjoying the fruits of recovery - Leading Article 1994 will go down as a glorious year for the British economy. It will not go down as the year of an equally brilliant Budget. But the combination of unexpectedly high growth with unexpectedly low inflation has given the chancellor of the exchequer a wonderful story to tell. It has also allowed him to relax public spending this year without being too obvious about it. Otherwise, the budget is noteworthy for a number of politically astute gestures, particularly on employment and social security, a concern with business, especially small business, an absence of overarching ideas for fiscal reform, and determination to control the running costs of the public sector. What has been left until later is the tax cuts that the prospects for public finance appear to permit and politics will surely demand. It is, of course, absurd to raise taxes by close to Pounds 7bn in a few months only to lower them a year or two later. But politics is another matter. Inevitably, Mr Clarke chose to keep the bigger presents locked in his treasure chest until later. Instead, he offered a number of relatively modest fiscal changes - many of them desirable. But he has also tolerated a substantial real increase in public spending this financial year, by comparison with what had been expected, so taking advantage of the lower than expected inflation. The plan had been for a real reduction in general government spending of 0.1 per cent in 1994-95. The reality is now expected to be an increase of 2.3 per cent. Similarly, for the 'control total' (which excludes cyclical public spending), the plan had been for a real reduction of 1.3 per cent, while the reality is to be an increase of 1.4 per cent. How plausible then is the stringency planned for 1995-96 to 1997-98, when there is expected to be virtually no increase in the real control total and the real level of general government spending is forecast to rise by 2 per cent? Meanwhile, as a percentage of GDP, the public sector borrowing requirement is forecast to fall from 5 per cent this year to 3 per cent in 1995-96 (down from the 4 1/4 per cent forecast last year), 1 3/4 per cent in 1996-97 (one percentage point less than forecast last year) and balance by 1998-99. Gross general government debt is also forecast to peak at 49 1/4 per cent of GDP in 1995-96. Thus, on both the fiscal deficit and government debt, the UK is forecast to be within the Maastricht treaty criteria very soon. With retail price inflation (less mortgage interest) also forecast at 2 1/2 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of 1995 and the same or less thereafter, that stout Europhile Mr Clarke has done what he can to position the UK for the third stage of any move to economic and monetary union, should his party be in office and permit it. The forecast of implausibly slow growth of public spending in real terms, although helpful, is not central to this prospect. What matters most is continued good economic performance. The chancellor is right to claim this year's combination - forecast economic growth at 4 per cent (3 1/2 per cent for non-North Sea GDP), a current account deficit of only  1/2 per cent of GDP, exports of goods and services up 8 1/4 per cent (with imports rising only 4 3/4 per cent) and inflation at 2 per cent - as the best for a generation. But one swallow does not make a summer and one annus mirabilis does not make a miracle. After all, as Mr Clarke pointed out, the UK has seen growth disappear into excessive inflation three times in the last two decades. The experienced observer will wonder how things will be messed up this time. The forecast is that growth will fall smoothly to 3 1/4 per cent next year. Notwithstanding the tax increases in the pipeline, it may take substantial interest rate increases to bring this about. It would also be wise to avoid those widely expected future tax cuts altogether and allow net exports and investment to drive the economy forward. If the overall fiscal and economic picture is what stands out in this Budget, there is still much detail to be assessed. If inflation is kept as low as forecast, the proposed freeze on the running costs of the public sector is at least defensible. Less attractive is the chancellor's addiction to fiscal tinkering. The new venture capital trust scheme, for example, which will provide income tax relief at 20 per cent, looks like another tax loophole. Such fiscal concessions are the wrong way to promote economically efficient small business. Equally, the chancellor missed an opportunity to improve taxation of savings by combining the Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts (Tessas), the first of which mature this year, with personal equity plans (PEPs). Instead, he has allowed the latter to include corporate bonds and preference shares and proceeds of Tessas to be deposited in new accounts. Some-thing far bolder would also have been better. Downright peculiar is the proposal to spend as much as Pounds 605m on transitional relief for businesses facing higher rates bills following revaluation of properties. That such large amounts of relief are required so long after uniform business rates were introduced is difficult to understand. In addition, while it is good to see the main personal allowances raised in line with prices, the decision to widen the 20p tax band by Pounds 200 reminds one how unfortunate this notion was. Not only did it complicate the tax system, but it also prevents the more sensible change of raising tax thresholds. Intellectually, however, the centrepiece of the Budget must be the measures on social security and employment. While modest, they are welcome. The reform of housing benefit, for example, while bound to be unpopular, was right. There does need to be a limit to this benefit. More popular will be proposals to increase family credit for those in full-time jobs, accelerate payment of benefits to people taking jobs, introduce a pilot study on family credit for those without children, reduce lower rate national insurance contributions and introduce a rebate of the national insurance contributions for the long-term unemployed (even though the latter are defined as those unemployed more than two years). Future fiscal room for manoeuvre should be used to develop such schemes rather than cut the basic rate of income tax, as Tory backbenchers will demand. Mr Clarke stands revealed as a sensible chap, full of good intentions, but with limited reforming ambitions. This is not a Budget with big ideas, but one with a few tolerably good little ones. Everything hinges, however, on the chancellor's ability to execute his one really big idea: sustaining a non-inflationary expansion. This is the point in the cycle when that begins to be both intellectually difficult and politically unpopular. Mr Clarke did show courage in raising taxes last year. But he - and the governor of the Bank of England - will have to show at least equal courage, if the pace of this recovery is to be kept a sustainable one.</p>

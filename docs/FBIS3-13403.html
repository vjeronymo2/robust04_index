			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Bishqar in Beirut] </F>   [Text] Palestinian mujahidin launched a major attack on a  Zionist settlement in northern occupied Palestine today.  Subsequent extensive clashes between the mujahidin and the  Zionist forces left a large number of the latter dead or wounded.    The Nayif Hawatimah-led Democratic Front for the Liberation  of Palestine [DFLP] issued three successive statements in Beirut  this afternoon, claiming responsibility for the attack. It  reported that one of its groups infiltrated occupied Palestinian  territory via south Lebanon and attacked a Zionist settlement.  Several hours of fierce fighting with the Zionist occupation  forces followed, during which the DFLP fighters killed or  injured a large number of enemy troops.    The DFLP statements asserted that one of its fighters, who  was in charge of maintaining communications from south Lebanon  with the other group members, was arrested by the UN Interim  Force in Lebanon [UNIFIL]. The DFLP demanded his immediate  release.    According to earlier reports from south Lebanon, two  Palestinian martyrs fell during fighting with the occupation  forces today and a third was captured by the enemy. A fourth  was arrested by UNIFIL's Norwegian contingent.    This afternoon the Zionist occupation forces bombarded and  raked with heavy machine-gun fire liberated villages in the  eastern sector of the southern border belt, including Dallafah,  Qilya, Zummarayya, and Jabal al-Dahr.    Meanwhile, the Islamic Resistance addressed a new warning  this afternoon to the agents serving in Antoine Lahd's militia  [South Lebanese Army, SLA] that it will punish all of them  sooner or later.    The warning added that the enemy Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin's visit to south Lebanon to reassure the agents and all  the financial and military assistance given to them will not  save them from the mujahidin.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 2 HELD WITHOUT BAIL IN SLAYING CASE  </P> <P> Two men accused in the execution-style slaying of an 82-year-old Vista man  whose body was found on Camp Pendleton were ordered held without bail Tuesday  by U. S. Magistrate Irma Gonzalez.  </P> <P> Larry Wayne LaFleur, 22, and Nick Michael Holm, 20, were arrested last week by  FBI agents on suspicion of murdering Otto Bloomquist, who was last seen alive  by his wife at Plaza Camino Real shopping center in Carlsbad.  </P> <P> "When you look at the nature of the crime . . . I agree with the government  there can be no more heinous crime," Gonzalez said.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutor Larry Burns said the slaying was predatory.  </P> <P> "The affidavit indicates that both set out to accost an elderly person," he  said.  </P> <P> "This was execution," Burns said. "It chills the sensibilities to think about  killing someone in this manner." Bloomquist was shot five times, according to  Burns.  </P> <P> The body of Bloomquist was discovered Jan. 15 in a remote area of Camp  Pendleton, northwest of Fallbrook, five days after he disappeared. Because the  body was discovered on federal property, the FBI is handling the investigation.  </P></p>

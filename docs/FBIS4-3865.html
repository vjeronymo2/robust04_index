			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President  Jiang Zemin, in a meeting with visiting Canadian  Governor-General Ramon John Hnatyshyn here today, expressed hope  that China and Canada would strengthen friendly exchanges and  cooperation.    He added that, in the fundamental interest of the two  countries and the two peoples, bilateral relations should be  raised to a new stage of overall cooperation, on the basis of  seeking common ground while reserving differences, mutual  respect, equality and mutual benefit.    Extending his warm welcome to Hnatyshyn, Jiang said that in  the 20 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries,  bilateral relations have witnessed fruitful development in all  fields.    "We are pleased to see that during the past few years, China  and Canada have overcome the temporary difficulties in bilateral  relations under joint efforts and restored the vigorous  development of such relations," the Chinese president said.    Jiang said that he had very good talks with Canadian Prime  Minister Jean Chretien when they met in Seattle in November last  year, noting that Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua is in Canada  on a visit now.    He pointed out that "to enhance exchanges between leaders of  the two countries is of great significance."    It is learned that this is the first visit to China by a  Canadian governor-general since 1987, and a senior Chinese  diplomat here pointed out that Hnatyshyn's visit marks the  resumption of political contacts between leaders of the two  countries and the overall normalization of Sino-Canadian  relations.    On bilateral economic and trade relations, Jiang said that  the two economies are highly complementary, and Canada has  become one of China's major trade partners in the world.    He continued that bilateral trade volume has grown by a  large  margin and that two-way investment and economic and  technological cooperation have been continuously broadened.    Jiang noted that Canada has valuable expertise in  communications, telecommunications and hydropower, which are  being emphasized in China's development for the next few years.    He said that China's economy is in rapid and sustained  growth, the market is expanding and the investment environment  is becoming better, which provides good opportunities for the  expansion of Sino-Canadian mutually beneficial cooperation.    He asked his guest to urge the Canadian Government to seize  the opportunities so as to further bilateral economic and trade  cooperation.    Hnatyshyn expressed his pleasure at visiting China, adding  that bilateral relations date back to a long time ago and his  current visit marks the further development of such relations.    He said that "we admire China's achievement in its economic  reform and believe that the Chinese people will have a better  future."    He noted that China is more and more important in the world,  and Canada is ready to strengthen cooperation bilaterally,  multi-laterally and in international affairs, so as to  continuously promote relations between the two countries.    On the human rights issue, Hnatyshyn expressed his  understanding of China's domestic conditions, stressing that the  human rights issue should not be linked to trade.    He pointed out that Canada is willing to carry out  discussions and cooperation with China on this issue.

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Thailand (10): Making a meal of quotas - An aspect of Thai politics Dr Narongchai Akrasanee is one of Thailand's more well-known economists-cum-businessmen. Educated in Australia and the US, he was the youngest dean of the economics faculty of Thammasat University in Bangkok. He made his name as a specialist in industry and trade. Dr Narongchai is now head of a finance and securities company called GF. Last year, he was the special envoy of the then-prime minister, Mr Anand Panyarachun, negotiating regional free trade among the six members of the Association of South East Asian Nations. In September, Dr Narongchai was almost appointed a minister in the new government. 'Almost' because at the last minute he fell foul of something he, as a free trader, has spent much of his working life arguing against: quotas. Foreigners frequently complain that Thai politics is impossible to understand. Unpronounceable Thai names do not help matters and it does not help that so many of the 'anti-military' political leaders have military rank. But often it is the behaviour of politicians that is difficult to understand, as if some code has to be cracked. One set of codes deals with quotas, around which Thai politics sometimes appears to revolve. Dr Narongchai was to have been appointed to the Cabinet by Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, leader of the New Aspiration Party, the second-largest in the coalition. Thai coalition cabinets are formed by quota and under the present constitution, governments are allowed a maximum of 44 ministerial positions. These are shared out in proportion to the size of the coalition parties. After the election in September, the New Aspiration Party was given 11 cabinet seats. When word leaked out that Dr Narongchai was among the non-elected appointees that Gen Chavalit was proposing to nominate, the party's MPs threatened a rebellion. One more cabinet seat given to an appointee, no matter how able, would mean one less for an MP. Gen Chavalit had to yield; an elected MP was picked instead. The quota system does not allow much flexibility. The selection of MPs to fill those portfolios is often based on arithmetic. MPs of the Democrat Party, the largest in the present coalition, say they are virtually guaranteed a cabinet post if they can head a team of candidates that has made a clean sweep of all the seats available in a province or in a multi-seat constituency. The previous elected government came to power in March. No sooner had the cabinet posts been announced than Mr Banharn Silpa-archa, secretary-general of the Chart Thai Party - at that time ranked second in the coalition - told reporters that his party would periodically reshuffle its ministers so that all senior members could have a turn in the Cabinet. It did not, apparently, occur to Mr Banharn that the prime minister, Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, might want to be consulted. Not even a prime minister who was in power as a result of leading a coup. Reshuffling the Cabinet within the Chart Thai Party quota was an internal affair of the Chart Thai Party. This adherence to quotas and 'fair shares' is supposed to mean objective selections that avoid favouritism. Of course it does nothing of the kind, and it contrasts starkly with the way most Thais conduct their private lives. No group of friends or associates would dream of having a meal and dividing the bill into 'fair shares'. Emphasis on generosity dictates either that the most senior or most wealthy pays the bill or members of the group informally take turns to pay. Quotas continue to play a role once ministers have been appointed. A commerce minister is in charge of allocating export quotas for tapioca and garments. An agriculture minister's responsibilities could include fertiliser procurement and sales quotas. A finance minister can decide which foreign banks will be in the next batch allowed to open Thai branches. These quotas keep many - but not all - ministers busy. There is nothing they enjoy better than deciding that conditions have changed and therefore the method of allocating quotas has to be changed as well. Naturally, every time the method is changed there are winners and losers. The stakes can be very big. Quotas mean money: 'quota-rent' according to the jargon. Ministers who control quotas can become indispensable financiers of their parties. One interesting case of quota-rent in Thailand involved taxi licensing. For such a prosperous city, Bangkok had, and still has, some of the most decrepit cabs in the world. But because the numbers were restricted and owning one was still profitable, licence plates were bought and sold for as much as Bt600,000 each; the plates cost more than the taxis themselves. Earlier this year, the Anand Panyarachun government, an enemy of quotas, liberalised taxis. Only certain minimum requirements have to be met and commuters can now ride in brand new, comfortable taxis with proper meters, often paying cheaper fares than in the old quota-bound wrecks. Tapioca is another example. The main allocation method for tapioca export quotas, a highly lucrative business because of the quirks of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy, is based on the amount of tapioca an exporter has stocked up. This is supposed to encourage exporters to buy more tapioca and raise farm-gate prices. It has also led to a great deal of cheating. One inspection a few years ago was supposed to have measured eight million tonnes of tapioca in exporters' warehouses: rather a lot of school puddings. Officials were transferred, questions were asked in parliament, and former ministers are still fighting an official committee's ruling that they were 'unusually rich', a ruling that led to the seizure of their assets. Unwittingly therefore, French farmers who insist that the EC limit tapioca imports have played their part in Thai political power struggles. Some ministries control more quotas than others and the politicians struggle to gain those with most quotas. But once they have acquired cabinet quotas, the ministers tend not to interfere with their colleagues' activities. The government of Gen Chatichai Choonhavan, who was overthrown in last year's coup, was dubbed 'the buffet cabinet', a suitably modern expression in a country where the word for 'eat' is slang for being on the take. In the age of double-digit growth, there was plenty for everyone. In political terms, quotas actually meant a kind of free trade, a free-for-all. The present Cabinet has its share of rent-seekers but the experience of the past two years and the frugal appetite of Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister, could curtail the buffet.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- Thousands of Berliners have  been demonstrating since this morning at the memorial of the  socialist leaders Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht in  Friedrichsfelde. The cofounders of the German Communist Party  (KPD) were killed by volunteer corps officers in Berlin on 15  January 1919.    The demonstrators are marching presently in close rows past  the stone monument, inscribed with the words "The dead remind  us," and past the graves and placing flowers there. One of the  first demonstrators, despite receiving a murder threat at the  beginning of the week, was Gregor Gysi, head of the Party of  Democratic Socialism's [PDS] Bundestag group. He is accompanied  by the PDS Chairman Lothar Bisky and the party's honorary  chairman, Hans Modrow.    The demonstration was called by Berlin Peace Coordination, a  loose association of leftwing parties and organizations as well  as environmental and peace groups. Last year around 40,000  people took part in the event. [passage omitted]</p>

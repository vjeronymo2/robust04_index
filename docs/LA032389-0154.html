			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELOCATION FEE EXTENDED TO ILLEGAL RENTAL UNITS;  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL APPROVES ORDINANCE TO REQUIRE LANDLORDS TO PAY UP TO $5,000  </P> <P> Property owners who illegally convert garages or other structures into rental  units must pay up to $5,000 to tenants who are forced out because of  substandard conditions under an ordinance approved Wednesday by the Los Angeles  City Council.  </P> <P> Tenants' rights attorneys praised the law because it will offer for the first  time relocation assistance to renters of illegal, substandard dwellings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Source of Protection  </P> <P> "This is literally going to help thousands of poor people who before today did  not have any protection from evictions," said Mary Lou Villar, an attorney with  the East Los Angeles Legal Aid Foundation. "Up until now if you were kicked out  of a garage, you were out on the street."  </P> <P> City law already requires landlords of legal dwellings to pay for tenant  relocation when renters are evicted for necessary improvements or when the unit  is declared unsafe by city inspectors from the Building and Safety Department.  But a loophole in the law did not require property owners of illegally  converted units to do the same.  </P> <P> "The law has to apply equally to every landlord, whether it's an illegal unit  or not," said Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who introduced the measure.  </P> <P> The council passed the ordinance 12-0 and sent it to Mayor Tom Bradley for  approval. Bradley has not yet studied the ordinance or taken a position on it,  a spokesman said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focus on Illegal Units  </P> <P> It will largely affect homeowners who turn garages into apartments or build  illegal rental units onto their homes, said Barbara Zeidman, director of the  city's rent stabilization unit.  </P> <P> These units sometimes come to the attention of city officials after neighbors  report substandard conditions, such as poor plumbing, exposed wiring and  makeshift gas lines.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, renters who are disabled, 62 or older or have children  will receive $5,000. Single adults will receive $2,000.  </P> <P> A Times investigation in May, 1987, revealed that roughly 42,000 illegal garage  dwellings shelter about 200,000 people throughout Los Angles County. The garage  homes, a disturbing outgrowth of the region's affordable housing crisis, lie in  a swath of mostly low-income Latino neighborhoods from Sylmar through East Los  Angeles into Long Beach, the Times study showed.  </P> <P> The number of illegal dwellings in Los Angeles is not known. But the city's  Building and Safety Department receives about 500 complaints a month, many of  which concern garage and other illegal dwellings, said Mel Bliss, chief of the  Bureau of Community Safety.  </P></p>

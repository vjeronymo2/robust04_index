			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 14 Jan -- "The chairman of the State Duma  absorbs the opinions of all the deputies and no proposal made by  a deputy should be left unnoticed," Ivan Rybkin, the chairman of  the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly, stated today at a  news conference. "The speaker should rise above his party  allegiance, otherwise he is simply not ready to occupy this  post," he added.    In Rybkin's opinion, the chairman of the Duma should  organize  the work of the lower chamber in such a way as ensure that the  most topical problems receive sufficient legislative support.  He believes that our legislation does not keep pace with life.    The speaker of the Duma said that putting our economic  legislation in line with realities of life should become its  priority task. He also stressed that it is necessary to study  proposals prepared by the Commission for Legislative Proposals  attached to the Russian President. "It made many valuable  proposals," believes Ivan Rybkin. Apart from that, the chairman  of the Duma sees its task in solving the question of the state  financing of the parties via their factions in the lower chamber  of the Federal Assembly, as well as maintaining interaction with  those parties whose representatives were not elected to the  parliament.    "The main committees of the Duma should be formed in  proportion to factions' numbers," believes Rybkin. At the same  time, he noted that "leaders of the deputies' associations today  are unlikely to agree to act as heads of the committees because  they already have enough organizational work to do in the  factions and deputies' associations."    Speaking about the economic reform in the country, Ivan  Rybkin stressed that they need some corrections. "We should be  searching for more intelligent solutions that suit the Russian  realities," he believes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Sami Qammuh has said that during  his meeting with His Majesty King Husayn, U.S. President Bill  Clinton promised to study Jordan's request to reduce its debt to  the United States. Speaking to the Jordanian News Agency, he  added that creditor states were contacted in order to enable  Jordan to restructure and reduce its debts.    Qammuh said he held talks with officials at the U.S.  Treasury  and State Departments on the economic and financial situation in  the Kingdom, particularly the subject of debt and the need to  address it and find the right solution to reduce it. He added  that the issue of rescheduling debt at the Paris Club was  discussed. Jordan asked that the debt due to be paid over the  next three years be rescheduled. He said the Jordanian side  received promises from the U.S. Administration to support  Jordan's request to obtain the best possible terms through the  Paris Club. We, he said, hope all our requests will be met.    The finance minister added that the U.S. side praised the  serious Jordanian measures to rectify the economy and to  modernize financial and economic regulations and laws so the  Kingdom will be able to attract investment and encourage and  increase national exports.    Qammuh left Washington for Paris last night to attend the  Paris Club meetings on Jordanian debt.</p>

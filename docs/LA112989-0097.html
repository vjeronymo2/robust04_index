			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING AHEAD: WHEN IT COMES TO PLANNING, DISAGREEMENT IS CRUCIAL  </P> <P> Businesses interested in achieving accurate forecasts should make sure that  their planning committees agree to disagree. Futurists have found that  disagreement among committee members forces the group to look at more  alternatives. Examinations of group behavior have concluded that judgments made  by groups are more accurate than those by individuals precisely because of this  tendency to disagree.  </P> <P> "With more disagreement, people are forced to look at a wider range of  possibilities," says psychologist Rebecca A. Henry, co-author of a recent study  of group behavior. "It makes them think of things they hadn't thought of  before."  </P> <P> The study found that the greater the disagreement at the beginning of a group  discussion, the more accurate the final judgment.  </P> <P> Forecasts of sales and other financial data made by groups are generally more  accurate than the forecasts of individuals. The use of committees for  forecasting can lead to a significant increase not only in the accuracy of the  forecast but also in a company's confidence in it.  </P> <P> Businesses should be wary of committees that strive for an easy consensus.  Henry suggests that individuals should be encouraged to make judgments before a  meeting, which will almost guarantee disagreements.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trend Toward Bald Women  </P> <P> Balding men may have company in the future: Hair loss by working women seems to  be on the rise. In Japan, a growing number of women have the same types of  baldness as men -- thin hair at the crown or receding hairlines. According to  the Nippon Hair Specialists Assn., the number of women seeking treatment for  balding has more than doubled in the past few years.  </P> <P> Some experts attribute this increase to a growing number of women in the work  force. Working women are increasingly facing employment stresses traditionally  felt by men. Along with an increase in the number of women experiencing  stress-related illnesses such as heart attacks, hair loss aggravated by stress  may, for some women, be a result of the hectic pace of the modern workplace.  </P> <P> Look for more women wearing hairpieces too. In recent years, three of every 10  customers buying hairpieces in Japan were women. According to one hairpiece  manufacturer, at least 5 million women in Japan are worried about thinning  hair.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Changes in an Aging World  </P> <P> Offices and stores are in for a major redesign. The graying of America -- a  steady rise in the number of elderly as the baby boom generation ages -- means  that the structures where people work and shop will need to be redesigned to  accommodate an aging society.  </P> <P> Ken Dychtwald, president of Age Wave Inc., which advises businesses and  government on the implications of an aging America, says the growing number of  elderly will necessitate changes in physical design and environment as  businesses and stores seek to attract older Americans as both workers and  customers. Stores and offices with fewer and less steeply pitched stairs,  physical spaces rearranged to provide better access for people whose  flexibility is limited, transportation devices such as motorized walkways to  increase mobility and even furniture that responds to verbal commands will  allow the elderly to work and shop more easily.  </P> <P> Futurists suggest that during the 1990s workers over 50 will find a growing  demand for their stability, expertise and experience. At the same time,  Americans over 50 will also account for more than three-fourths of the nation's  wealth and half of its discretionary spending, which will make stores even more  eager to accommodate them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Snubbing a Shorter Week  </P> <P> For years, we've been hearing about how we will all work fewer hours in the  future. But those predicting the shorter work week may be in for a surprise: A  recent survey said most workers don't want it.  </P> <P> The survey, conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that about  two-thirds of all workers, if given a choice, would not want to change their  work week. Of those who would change the number of hours they worked if given a  choice, most said they would opt to work more hours -- and earn more money.  Only 6% of the men and 9% of the women expressed a preference for a shorter  work week accompanied by a wage cut.  </P> <P> In reality, the 40-hour work week may already be a myth. Another recent study  found that the average work week is now about 49 hours. Among business men and  women, more than 85% work more than 45 hours each week.  </P></p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Property: Rise in sales lifts hopes of recovery - State of the market SLOW RECOVERY continues in the housing market. The Corporate Estate Agents' Property Index, collecting data from 4,300 offices, reports that while August saw the expected holiday downturn, completed sales were 47.5 per cent above those of August 1992. Admittedly, that was an unusually inactive month, as former chancellor Norman Lamont's holiday from stamp duty had just ended. But it is still a large increase and suggests that confidence is returning steadily. House prices, whether measured by Nationwide or Halifax at the lower end of the market or Savills at the top end, are still below levels of a year ago despite small increases in recent months. For Nationwide, the average house cost in September of Pounds 53,149 was 2.5 per cent down on September 1992 and 2.5 per cent up on January 1993. These sums show how modest the improvement is. The Savills' figures, computed up to June, average Pounds 321,606 for a house in the country (down 2.9 per cent on 1992) and Pounds 516,510 for a town property (down 2.3 per cent). Large price increases in London tend to be the exception, says Paul Raymond of Chestertons Residential; he notes that prime properties in Kensington have risen as much as 10 per cent since the year's beginning. Sales to foreigners are largely responsible. For the British, lower mortgage rates and higher disposable incomes for most people in work have made houses at their most affordable in 20 years, according to Savills, while Nationwide estimates the house price to earnings ratio at 2.95 and Halifax at 3.4. Any further cut in interest rates would make houses more affordable still, probably without causing major price increases. But, having been burnt in the aftermath of the 1980s' boom, buyers are wary of over-borrowing again.</p>

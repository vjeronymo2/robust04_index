			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (8): Currency in search of a role  -Why the yen has yet to displace the dollar THE steady fall of the yen over the last three years seems to have come to an end, but in spite of generally favourable market conditions, there does not seem to be much hope for a rapid turnaround in the near future. One of the biggest negative factors affecting the yen rate over recent years has been the outflow of Japanese capital, requiring Japanese investors to sell yen in order to obtain dollars and other currencies to make foreign investments. But the situation changed in 1990 as total Japanese indirect, or securities, investment abroad plunged to Dollars 39.45bn, down from Dollars 113.67bn in 1989. More significantly, Japanese investors were huge net sellers of US securities - to the tune of more than Dollars 16bn in 1990 - and more modest net sellers in west Germany and Australia. The only country where Japan made substantial net purchases was Luxembourg, and these were thought to be mostly Euro-yen paper. Excluding the Luxembourg investments, Japanese foreign securities investment only totalled about Dollars 7bn in 1990 - little more than one-tenth of the 1989 figure. This was offset by a slight increase in Japanese direct foreign investment to about Dollars 48bn in 1990, up from Dollars 44 bn in 1989, but quarterly statistics show a steady decline throughout last year. This change in the amount and nature of Japanese investment has led Nomura Research Institute economist Mr Richard Koo to say 'the worst reason for yen weakness is gone'. Given the absence of heavy yen-selling pressure and the continued growth of the Japanese economy, 'the biggest mystery is why the yen is still weak', Mr Koo says. With most Japanese foreign securities investment made in yen and a substantial portion of the funds in other currencies raised outside Japan, it is surprising that the yen has not benefitted in foreign exchange markets, he says. At a current rate of Y135 to the dollar, the yen is in the middle of its three-year range. According to the Bank of Tokyo, the yen-dollar average was Y128.13 in 1988, Y127.98 in 1989 and Y144.81 in 1990. The yen was fairly stable for most of 1990 until Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, when surprisingly, it strengthened against the dollar. Since the end of hostilities, the dollar has risen, which market players attribute to the quick and decisive conclusion to the US-led war. The power shown by the US and the perceived indecisiveness of Japan and Germany, which have the two most significant currencies after the dollar, highlighted prospects for economic recovery in the US and increased confidence in the dollar. However, some economists say US recovery is by no means certain and the Japanese economy generally looks much healthier. Further signs of a US recession and steady Japanese growth could lift the yen somewhat, but few look for a big move. The yen's range of Y135 to Y140 in recent weeks represents an equilibrium level, many say. While a combination of factors may have benefitted the Japanese authorities' interests in halting the slide in the yen, Tokyo's desires to increase its currency's international role have not made much progress. Although the ministry of finance and Bank of Japan continue to liberalise financial markets and the dollar's international role remains on the decline, there has been little interest around the world in picking the yen as a replacement. Japan's yen-dominated exports rose in 1990, but coming after a decline in 1989, the trend has been mixed. Bank of Tokyo director Mr Keikichi Honda says the minimal international interest in the yen stems from the lack of a visible, consistent policy by the Japanese government to promote the yen. Yen holdings are not attractive to international investors and official authorities because of the lack of a liquid short-term money market in Japan, he says. 'The absence of a yen TB (treasury bill) market is a real impediment', Mr Honda says. 'TBs are like air and water; without a base, arbitrage transactions are not as liquid as desired.' While the US Treasury has a deliberate policy of fostering liquidity in its debt markets, Japan's authorities are hesitant to issue government securities without a specific funding need. The finance ministry finally relented last year and issued treasury bills for liquidity purposes, but Mr Honda says conflicts of interest throughout the bureaucracy prohibits an overall consensus on the importance of promoting a short-term yen money market. While the US Treasury has weekly bill auctions, Japan's finance ministry still prefers to issue what it calls financing bills only when the need arises. A committee of government and private-sector experts attached to the official Economic Planning Agency has been studying liberalisation and internationalisation of finance, but the EPA is thought to lack the influence needed to settle disputes between the Bank of Japan and the finance ministry. Conflicts of interest among various finance ministry bureaux, such as international finance budget, finance and tax, have also made it more difficult to develop a larger money market in Japan. The unattractiveness of the yen as an instrument of international trade is shown by the almost negligible amount of yen-dominated trade by third parties. The yen's share of world trade inched up to 4.3 per cent in 1989, from 4.2 per cent in 1988, according to the Bank of Tokyo. Over the next few months, the yen may be buffeted by domestic developments in Japan. Prime minister Mr Toshiki Kaifu's term as president of ruling Liberal Democratic party ends in October, and the expected political manoeuvring could create uncertainty, although analysts see the impact of this as being short-lived.</p>

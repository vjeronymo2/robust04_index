			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Blockade by Greece puts EU on spot Greece's blockade against Macedonia could cause a serious diplomatic split within the European Union and further complicate European policy towards Bosnia, Brussels officials warned yesterday. With Greece giving little warning of its intentions to its European partners, Commission officials yesterday indicated that they had been both surprised and angered by Greece's action, not least because it currently holds the EU presidency. 'It is bad enough for a member state to act like this, but it is even worse when they are heading the union,' commented one senior Commission official, who feared the action could inflame Balkan tensions. Mr Hans Van Den Broek, commissioner for external affairs, yesterday flew to Athens, where he was due to meet Greek officials. His visit forms part of a regular meeting between Russia, and foreign ministers from the three members of the EU troika: Germany, Greece and Belgium. However, EU officials yesterday indicated that Mr Van Den Broek was likely to seek to use the meeting to pressure Greece over the issue. Mr Nicolaas Wegter, Commission spokesman, said yesterday: 'We are concerned about the situation and therefore are asking for clarification (from the Greeks).' France, Germany and Belgium yesterday all expressed their concern over Greece's refusal to let Macedonia use the port of Thessaloniki, Macedonia's main outlet to the sea. Meanwhile, Denmark yesterday asked for the European foreign ministers to discuss the issue when they meet in Brussels on Monday. With some officials now suggesting that Greece's action may contravene EU regulations governing trade and foreign relations, the Commission's legal services have been asked to consider the legality of Greece's action. However, diplomats yesterday indicated that Greece's move, which comes after a month in which it has sought to distance itself from Nato's threat of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, has left many diplomats uncertain about what action can be used against Greece. In spite of the deep irritation felt by some Commission officials, fears about creating a deep rift in the Union has left many unwilling to demand any co-ordinated European action against Greece yet, not least because it is still too early to be sure what the blockade of the port will precisely entail. 'If it's a matter of oil, that is serious and that will be a big problem. But reports suggest that it might be less than that,' commented one diplomat.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AZUSA COUNCIL CALLS FOR END TO RECALL BID  </P> <P> The City Council has passed a resolution urging that a recall effort against  Councilmen Harry L. Stemrich and Tony D. Naranjo be stopped. The resolution was  approved on a 4-0 vote, with Mayor Eugene F. Moses abstaining.  </P> <P> The resolution, approved last week, has no direct effect on the recall drive.  Recall proponents have until April 4 to gather the 2,806 signatures needed to  force a recall election.  </P> <P> Councilman Bruce Latta, who proposed the resolution, said the council needed to  make a statement that recall elections are divisive and destroy the image of  the city. Latta added that the $30,000 that would be spent on the election  could be put to better use. Latta and Moses were targeted in a vitriolic recall  in 1983, in which they retained their seats and two council members they  opposed were ousted.  </P> <P> "(Recall elections) distract the City Hall staff. . . . It causes a lot of  dissension in the community because a recall is a negative campaign," Latta  said.  </P> <P> Stemrich and Naranjo, who were elected as Moses allies last year, have accused  the mayor of inciting and backing the recall, a charge Moses has denied. In  explaining his abstention, Moses said the recall was initiated by voters, and  they should have the final say.  </P> <P> "It was the people's choice," Moses said. "They started it. I didn't want to  irritate anybody by me taking a position."  </P></p>

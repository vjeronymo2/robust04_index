			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Giant CIS aluminium smelter closes TAJIKISTAN'S giant Regar aluminium smelter has shut down because of a lack of raw materials, according to industry officials. Last year the smelter produced about 370,000 tonnes of aluminium and exported virtually all of it to the west. In the first half of 1992 it produced about 184,000 tonnes. Yesterday's news will be welcomed by the western industry which blames a sudden surge in exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States - to more than 1m tonnes last year - for driving down aluminium prices to their lowest-ever level in real terms. Officials said only the plant manager, Mr Muxaur Sinani, and three other Russians remained at the Regar plant. About half the workforce were Russians or Germans - all key technical people - but they had been driven away by the ethnic disputes which threaten to engulf Tajikistan. The final blow to the smelter's output was when rail links with Russia were cut, halting the flow of alumina (aluminium oxide), the officials said. Azerbaijan, previously the smelter's main alumina supplier, stopped shipments some time ago because it was claimed no aluminium was being shipped back in payment. Observers suggested that the smelter, which uses out-of-date 'pre-bake' technology, would have to be converted before it could be brought back into operation. This would take two years but work was unlikely to start before political stability returned to the central Asian state. Hundreds have been killed and thousands made homeless by ethnic conflicts. A month ago output at the smelter, about 100 km (60 miles) west of Dushanbe, the capital, was cut to an annual rate of 200,000 tonnes compared with its nominal capacity of 520,000 tonnes, because of a dispute about the ownership, which dried up money for spare parts and shut down two of the three anode lines. Both the Tajik government and Consortium Aluminiy, the new organisation that includes most of the former Soviet Union's aluminium operations, claim ownership of the smelter, said to provide most of Tajikistan's income.</p>

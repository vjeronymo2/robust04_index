			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / People: Shopping around Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the cash and carry operator which is planning to open one of the UK's first US-style warehouse clubs, has announced that David Rowley, deputy chairman, will retire next March. Rowley has been with the company for 24 years, and became managing director in 1987. He had been deputy chairman since 1991, overseeing property development, legal matters and welfare. N&amp;P says it will not nominate another deputy chairman; it is happy with the remaining structure of chairman, Richard Fulford, and group managing director, David Poole. It is, however, adding another executive director. Alex Rentoul (right), 41, currently running Sandler Rentoul Associates, joins the board from October, with responsibility for corporate development, strategic planning and new business development. Rentoul qualified as an accountant and has worked previously in strategic planning and corporate development roles with Imperial Group and Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton. He knows N&amp;P well; with Sandler Rentoul he carried out strategic consultancy for N&amp;P, including advising on its warehouse club plans. N&amp;P is also appointing Roger Strachan, 62, former finance director of Nestle UK, as a non-executive director.</p>

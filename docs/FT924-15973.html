			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Arts: Who Shall I Be Tomorrow? - Theatre Plays about suicide, like suicide attempts, rarely convince. The quiet get on with it, the noisy are already in therapy. Bernard Kops' latest play, Who Shall I Be Tomorrow? at the Greenwich Theatre tells the story of a faded actress who tries to take her own life. It makes confusing, inconsistent theatre. The evening's strength is the lustrous Joanna Lumley, who takes the lead in this two-hander with Harry Landis; the acting is a delight; the evening's weakness is the plot, a pattern of inanity occasionally crossed by moments of insight. A play which welcomes you with the unshaven singing of Tom Waits and a programme filled with cuts from Sylvia Plath and Stevie Smith promises no laughs; but depression is not taken seriously enough. Kops wrote better on similar themes in his Playing Sinatra (1991), also about domestic claustrophobia and depression. Lumley plays Rosalind, a once famous and now out of work actress on telephone vigil in a London bedsit. Her chaotic world is penetrated by neighbourhood noise, from Deep Purple's 'Smoke on the Water' to Bach's double violin. The other character, a gay jazz pianist called Gerald (Harry Landis), visits from upstairs: 'So why are you depressed?' The action takes time to form itself into anything dramatic. Lumley is always winning and diverting, sashaying around in pyjamas throwing out lines of Macbeth or The Dybbuk. She moves effortlessly through extremes: monstrous conceit to pathetic uncertainty, and with the clipped attention-span of the profoundly depressed. But Kops' writing shapes her character too obviously. So, predictably, she falls in love with her therapist and fantasises an affair; her childhood was not a forgotten boredom but a horror of parental cruelty. And she is agoraphobic. Opposite Rosalind, Gerald hums Weill and croons Hollander. He has problems in the shape of Desmond, an unconvincing lover from the north. But he helps Rosalind, injects her with confidence, and unwittingly prevents her suicide at the end by announcing his own pain when Desmond leaves. Finally, she fixes an identity of sorts in playing many parts ('I'm not a seagull, I'm an actress'), but this looks contingent and unconvincing. However, this final scene works best, because it shows rather than tells; Matthew Francis' direction brings the characters alive here. They are really, as Fats Waller nearly said, two needy people too much in love with themselves to say goodnight. Greenwich Theatre, 081-858-7755 / 853-3800.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Cambodians marked the 10th anniversary of the end of brutal Khmer Rouge rule,  and the head of the Vietnamese-supported government in Phnom Penh said there  will be no going back. The Cambodian revolution "is absolutely irreversible,"  President Heng Samrin said in a speech. More than a million Cambodians died  during the 1975-78 Khmer Rouge rule that ended with a Vietnamese invasion in  late 1978 and installation of a new regime in Cambodia on Jan. 7, 1979. Vietnam  has promised to withdraw its troops by 1990, and Cambodian officials announced  last week that the troops would leave by next September if a political  settlement is reached.  </P></p>

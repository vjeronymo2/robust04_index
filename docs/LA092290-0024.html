			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAIRPLEX PARK;  </P> <P> PEDROZA HAS 'LASS LAUGH IN FEATURE  </P> <P> Jockey Martin Pedroza ruined Laffit Pincay's 1990 Fairplex Park debut Friday,  charging from behind on Shinko's Lass to a 2 3/4-length victory in the $53,900  CTBA Marian Stakes at 1 1/6 miles.  </P> <P> Circling three wide around the far turn, Pedroza guided Shinko's Lass past  Something Comfy, the troubled favorite with Pincay aboard. Intercivet was  another five lengths behind in third in the field of 10 three-year-old fillies.  </P> <P> Shinko's Lass covered the distance in 1:43 2/5 and paid $17.40.  </P> <P> The victory was the second in a row for Shinko's Lass, who won $31,400.  </P> <P> "This is the most important win for this filly to date," said trainer Mike  Mitchell of the Desert Wine filly who had previously won two of 13 starts.  "With so much black type in her breeding, we needed to make her a stakes  winner."  </P> <P> Dropping well off Timely Walk's fast early fractions, Shinko's Lass appeared a  certain winner when Pedroza swung her outside down the backstretch. Something  Comfy, the 9-5 choice, never had clear sailing until the final quarter-mile.  </P> <P> Corey Black was excused from all mounts Friday and will ride only once more at  Fairplex Park this year, in the $100,000-added Las Madrinas Handicap next  Friday, according to steward Thomas Ward.  </P> <P> "Corey felt he needed to take some time off," said Ward of the leading jockey  at Fairplex Park the last four years.  </P> <P> "Corey called me Friday morning and said he just isn't mentally ready to ride  here. He'll be riding out of town the next three days."  </P> <P> Through Thursday, Black had won with three of 45 mounts.  </P> <P> Fairplex Notes  </P> <P> David Flores rode three winners Friday, increasing his lead in the rider  standings to 15-12 over runner-up Julio Garcia. . . . Four patrons tabbed six  winners for a $12,694 payoff in the Pick Six. . . . Undefeated Stan's Lad is  the favorite to win today's Derby Trial Stakes.  </P> <P> The $1-million Super Derby from Louisiana Downs will be televised here Sunday  between the fifth and sixth races. Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled and  Preakness victor Summer Squall head the attractive lineup that also includes  local stars Stalwart Charger and Cee's Tizzy.  </P> <P> Friday's track attendance of 9,500 represented a 500 increase over 1989. Total  mutuel handle of $3,045,627 compares to $2,952,117 bet last year.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Antonio Martino, Forza Italia economist, by </F> Giovanni Negri; place and date not given: "Italy's Role as  Cinderella of Europe Must End" -- first three paragraphs are  L'INDIPENDENTE introduction]    [Text] Rome -- Italy is looking to the West, and Antonio  Martino's version of its foreign policy is taking shape.    As the most likely candidate for foreign minister, he set  out  for L'INDIPENDENTE the broad outlines of Italy's future foreign  policy, Second Republic style.    Silvio Berlusconi has made up his mind: If the National  Alliance also is present in the country's government, it must be  clearly understood that Italy's image abroad will be sharply  defined: His choice of Martino is intended to show that the  "Italian revolution" must not be misunderstood.    It is liberal, democratic, and western. This implies an open  alliance with the United States, friendship with Israel, Italy's  release from its role as "the Cinderella of Europe,"  antiprotectionism in economics, and human rights in philosophy.  Here is Martino's thinking, as he prepares to leave for the  United States, on the very eve of Clinton's visit (June) and the  G-7 summit in Naples (July) and as battles rage in Rome for the  Interior and other ministries.    [Negri] One-third Beirut, one-third Finland, and one-third  Vatican: Is half a century of foreign policy as defined by  Andreotti finished?    [Martino] Yes, times have changed. Both since when my father  laid the first foundations of the European Union and since the  fall of the Berlin Wall.    [Negri] But you are an economist. Why the Foreign Ministry?    [Martino] I could say that it is a very important economic  ministry, that at the international level economics is of  supreme importance. But I want to be clearer than that. There  is some truth in the words "new international order" -- woe  betide us if we permit an explosion of protectionism and  national egoism. Economic war between great giants such as  NAFTA, the European Union, and the Far East would be fatal. We  are independent, the challenges are posed at the global level,  and regression and isolation must be strongly discouraged.    [Negri] Leaving philosophy aside, what will you tell  Clinton?    [Martino] I know the United States well. It will be a good  relationship, irrespective of what color the administration is.  Also the time is past when visits were mere photo opportunities,  emblematic of a foreign policy which had sunk into decline.    [Negri] You are stubbornly nonconfessional. What is the  future of Italian-Vatican relations?    [Martino] Precisely because I am nonconfessional, I do not  have to prove myself. We will have even better, and clearer,  relations with the Vatican.    [Negri] Is it true that you are pro-Israeli?    [Martino] The utmost encouragement must be given to the  peace  process in the Middle East. This is why friendship with all the  sides involved is necessary.    [Negri] I understand diplomatic language, but Andreotti was  pro-Arab.    [Martino] The problem is how to gain peace through  negotiation. With this objective, we will never adopt a  preconceived alignment with either side.    [Negri] At the Foreign Ministry you will inherit the image  of  an Italy relegated to the second league, at least in Europe.    [Martino] More important than image is identity -- that is,  conduct consistent with our Europeanist conviction and with the  pledges demanded. We say that we must set our own house in  order. There must be an end to slovenliness and the failure to  honor deadlines. Then we will enjoy greater credibility in what  we have to say.    [Negri] Let us move onto the current situation. The main  priority is the former Yugoslavia.    [Martino] We will be in the forefront of defending human  rights. But it is irresponsible to set the cart before the  horse: I will simply say that this is the first point on which  I am concentrating.    [Negri] Elections are taking place in South Africa.    [Martino] Let us hope that the elections take place  peacefully. But we must be aware that in that kind of situation  there are often internal conflicts, such as the present ones  between the ANC and Buthelezi's Inkatha movement, which are even  fiercer than the conflict between blacks and whites.    [Negri] What about China, of which Andreotti and De Michelis  were so fond?    [Martino] There is a gigantic experiment in the  liberalization of the economy, for the present without a  transition to democracy. But can economic development spread  while leaving a centralized government unchanged?    [Negri] There has been corruption within the context of  international cooperation. Will there be changes in the Foreign  Ministry?    [Martino] If cooperation is what it has been hitherto, that  is, transfers between governments, then I am against that. You  cannot benefit a country by sending money to authoritarian,  corrupt, and dictatorial bureaucracies. The direct transfer of  aid and know-how to the people and involvement by private  concerns are another matter.    [Negri] But without development in the Third and Fourth  Worlds, there will be a growth in the already enormous  emigration toward the wealthy countries.    [Martino] We must not make mistaken assumptions. We are well  aware of what prevents development (protectionism, restrictions,  and inefficient public action), but we know much less about what  makes it possible from area to area. There are no magic wands  that can be waved. As for emigration, ours are a people who  have exported workers to the four corners of the world; in fact  in South America there is virtually another Italy to be kept in  mind. So we must be more open with those who come here to work,  and stricter with those who mistakenly believe they can find an  illusory El Dorado here.    [Negri] In conclusion, why did Berlusconi choose you for the  Foreign Ministry?    [Martino] Without embarrassment, I believe that he respects  me and realizes how necessary it is to strengthen our foreign  policy.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: NEVER MIND  </P> <P> Wait a minute. Did Marlon Brando tell the Toronto Globe and Mail the other day  that his just-completed film "The Freshman" was a stinker and because of it, he  was retiring? What he meant was it has a "screamingly funny" script, featuring  "wonderfully comedic portrayals," "imaginative" costuming, "perfect sets" and  the best crew he had ever had the pleasure of working with.  </P> <P> Retirement? Au contraire. Brando says that if he's offered a role in a sequel,  he'll be happy to accept. At least, that's how the 65-year-old star feels in a  lengthy apology released through his publicist. Brando, blaming his dyspeptic  comments to the Toronto paper on "trying times of a personal nature," had  praise for director Andy Bergman and discounted his hasty put-down of "The  Freshman."  </P> <P> "Clearly, I was wrong about the quality of the picture," Brando said of "The  Freshman." "It is clear to me that the movie contains moments of high comedy  that will be remembered for decades." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

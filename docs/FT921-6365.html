			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (23): It's cheap but is it a bargain? - Value investing THE CENTRAL principle of value investing is almost exactly 400 years old. The secret of getting rich, wrote Thomas Lodge in 1595, is 'Buy cheape, sell deare'. Value investing is the systematisation of that motto. It is a disciplined, methodical approach to assessing when any particular share is cheap and when it is expensive, rather than trying to judge whether the stock market as a whole is over- or under-valued. The phrase 'value investing' is an American one, and so is the best-known treatise on the subject, Benjamin Graham and David Dodd's book Security Analysis, published in 1934. The authors set out a detailed set of rules for assessing stocks against their intrinsic value. This was based on weighing up a company's assets, calculating its future earning power, and deriving a price to which the market was likely to gravitate over time, based on an appropriate price/earnings ratio. In Graham and Dodd's slightly ponderous prose: 'It is our thesis that the stocks of companies with disappointing earnings usually sell lower than they should, for the same basic reason that stocks as a whole sell too low during periods of depression. The significance of the unfavourable conditions is exaggerated.' Since then, the basic techniques of value investing have not changed: find cheap stocks and hold them - perhaps for a long time - until their intrinsic value is recognised by the market. Since the 1930s, however, it has become much harder to find shares that are grossly undervalued. And since then, professional value investors have acquired computers, allowing them to search rapidly through huge databases of corporate financial data. For the private investor, similar effects can be achieved, more laboriously but much more cheaply, by poring over the FT's share price listings. If in late January you had asked the FT Analysis computer database for all big UK companies selling at a discount to net asset value which also had a modest price/earnings ratio and a healthy dividend yield, you would have come up with a handful of answers. These include Asda, the stores group, trading at a p/e ratio of 8 and a yield of 8 per cent; British Aerospace (p/e of 3, yield of 12 per cent); British Steel (no earnings, but a historic yield of 15 per cent); and Trafalgar House, (p/e of 10, yield of 19 per cent), the shipping and construction group. All of these have fallen out of favour with the stock market, often because of problems suffered by the industries in which they do the bulk of their business. Only more detailed analysis would suggest if all these companies deserve their current cheapness. How do you tell when a share is offering true value? The latest annual report will give you useful information: the strength of the company's balance sheet, the businesses from which it derives the bulk of its profits, and its long-term record of growth in earnings and dividends. The detailed FT-Actuaries All-Share indices, published in the FT every day, will give you a sense of the typical p/e ratio for companies in that sector (in the case of Asda, for example, food chains were selling at a 15 p/e ratio). A word of warning: the reason why stocks are on high yields and low p/e ratios is that the market perceives them to be risky. These perceptions could be right. As a result, most value investors buy a spread of stocks, hoping that the recovery of some will outweigh the losses on a few. Private investors should beware of putting too much of their portfolio in one or two risky stocks. Just how risky apparently 'cheap' stocks can be is shown by three other companies that were also thrown up by that database search: Polly Peck, Maxwell Communication Corporation, and British and Commonwealth. All three are currently in administration, with little prospect of a return for shareholders. Yet by the crude yardstick used for the database search, they looked cheap. Moral: cheapness is not the same as good value. There is one other trap. When the market is selling at historically high price/earnings multiples - as Wall Street has been doing recently  - there is a risk of picking up stocks which are relatively cheap but absolutely dear. Graham and Dodd put it neatly: 'Beware of 'bargains' when most stocks seem very high', they wrote - and it's as true now as it was in 1934.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Oliynik report: "Such A Long Return"] </F>   [Excerpts] As has already been reported, an official  ceremony to hand over two Soviet POW's -- the Russians Aleksey  Olenin and Yuriy Stepanov -- to the Russian side was held at  Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's residence 16 May. On  22 May KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent was among those who met  their countrymen at Sheremetyevo-2 International Airport off the  flight from Islamabad. Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, Pakistani  ambassador to Russia, was among the welcoming party. [passage  omitted]    All the parents of men captured in the Afghan War have been  waiting for just such a moment. Unfortunately, there is still  no accurate information on how many of our POW's are held in  war-torn Afghanistan. Although the total number of MIA's,  according to Russian Federation Defense Ministry figures, is  290. It is known from various sources that only 60 or 70 of  them are alive.    "The complex work to find Soviet POW's is being held up for  a  whole host of reasons," I was told by Russian delegation member  Leonid Biryukov, the man from the CIS Heads of Government  Council Committee for Internationalist Servicemen Affairs who is  responsible for the search for MIA's. "First and foremost,  because a fierce internecine power struggle is under way in  Afghanistan. President Rabbani now has no time for our  prisoners, although he has stated that he will do everything in  his power to free them."    In conversation with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent,  Tatyana  Samolis, press secretary to the director of the Foreign  Intelligence Service, stressed that the search for former Soviet  soldiers is one of the areas for cooperation between Russian  intelligence and similar departments in other states --  primarily those which can have a real influence on solving this  problem. She noted that the release of Olenin and Stepanov was  possible thanks to the close collaboration between two special  services -- the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service and the  Pakistani Defense Ministry's Inter Services Intelligence.</p>

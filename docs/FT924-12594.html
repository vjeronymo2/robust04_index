			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Minister urges EC to liberalise telecoms MR EDWARD LEIGH, trade and industry minister, yesterday called for the liberalisation of the European telecommunications market on the UK model. Mr Leigh told the European Cable 92 conference in London that the future lay in changing the regulatory regime which had grown up over the past 100 years. New technology allowed market entrants to flourish. 'However efficient and well regulated a monopoly may be, it will be subject to pressures, either within the organisation, or from government which will pull in a different direction from the priorities it should be serving - the customers' priorities,' Mr Leigh said. He added that when the UK started liberalisation in 1981 there were warnings about the impact of the universal service being threatened by competition which would concentrate on the most lucrative areas of the market. This had not happened. According to a recent study, Mr Leigh said, the telecommunications market in the EC could quadruple in size between 1990 and 2010 to some Pounds 270bn. But this would only happen 'if the Community market was subject to orderly liberalisation and cost-effective flexible tariffs'. He said UK operators with experience of liberalisation were among the most enthusiastic advocates of competition in Europe.</p>

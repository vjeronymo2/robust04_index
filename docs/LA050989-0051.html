			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS HOLD ONE-INNING LUMBER PARTY;  </P> <P> HITTERS WAKE UP FOR 9-2 VICTORY OVER TIGERS  </P> <P> The supposedly potent Angel offense has been dormant for much of the season.  But Monday night, the hitters began to stir.  </P> <P> Scoring nine runs in the fourth inning, the Angels buried the nearly comatose  Detroit Tigers, 9-2, before 12,795 die-hard fans at Tiger Stadium and gained  their 10th victory in 11 games.  </P> <P> The question now is whether the Angel hitters can completely shake their slump.  </P> <P> "All we're hoping for is our offense to become as productive as we think it can  be," Manager Doug Rader said. "So far, it hasn't been, but if it even  approaches our expectations, we'll be fine."  </P> <P> Thanks to outstanding pitching, the Angels have excelled. Just ask Chuck  Finley, who had his second complete game of the season, improved his record to  4-2 and lowered his earned-run average to 2.60. The Angels' league-leading team  ERA is 2.65.  </P> <P> "We just keep rolling it over and over," Finley said of the Angel starters.  "Everyone wants to have a better outing then the last guy. Nobody wants to take  the rap as the weak link.  </P> <P> "This spring, everybody talked about how we'd produce (offensively) and all the  pitchers had to do is keep us close. It hasn't been that way so far, but we've  got people who can put the numbers up. I still wouldn't want to pitch against  our lineup."  </P> <P> Tiger starter Doyle Alexander, who was 11-5 against the Angels before Monday  night, never seemed to mind that much. But this Angel team has been finding a  way to win for the last month.  </P> <P> Designated hitter Brian Downing, one of the few consistencies in the  on-again-mostly-off-again offense, is a veteran of 16 major league seasons.  He's acutely aware that the time will arrive this year when the hitters will  have to carry the load if the Angels are to continue winning.  </P> <P> "We've been getting the pitching and just enough hitting," said Downing, whose  bases-loaded triple Monday was a crowning blow in the fourth. "Realistically,  we can't expect this kind of pitching for 162 games, but if you can get  consistent starters every day, it's so uplifting.  </P> <P> "We're riding the wave, but there will tough times when we will have to pick  (the pitchers) up."  </P> <P> Finley certainly got a lift in the fourth inning when the Angels scored nine  runs without the benefit of a home run. Downing and Wally Joyner belted  back-to-back 425-foot triples that would have been homers in most parks,  however.  </P> <P> Joyner led off the inning with a double to left-center. One out later, Devon  White and Chili Davis hit singles, Lance Parrish walked and the Angels had a  1-0 lead and the bases loaded.  </P> <P> Dante Bichette then hit a bouncer down the third-base line and third baseman Al  Pedrique made a nice back-hand stab of the ball, but his throw to the plate hit  White in the foot and both White and Davis scored. Jack Howell was walked  intentionally to load the bases again and then Alexander (3-3) walked Dick  Schofield -- after getting ahead in the count, 0-and-2 -- and the Angels gained  a 4-0 lead.  </P> <P> Downing gave the Angels a big lead with a triple that one-hopped off the 440  sign in dead center. Ramon Pena replaced Alexander. But Joyner, who is hitting  only .224 despite having a hit in eight of his last 11 games, made the most of  his second at-bat in the inning. He hit a shot almost identical to Downing's.  Johnny Ray hit a single to center to score Joyner and the Angels had their  biggest inning since they scored nine in the second against the Yankees on Aug.  27, 1988.  </P> <P> It was a big night for Joyner, not only because he was two for four with a  walk, a line-out to right and a 410-foot fly out to center, but because he  finally felt like a contributor to the Angels' streak.  </P> <P> "I did pretty good tonight," Joyner said. "The frustrating part has been to go  out and not think you're helping the club. I mean I enjoy winning, but it's  just a matter of not feeling like you've helped in the wins."  </P> <P> Joyner said he has stopped trying to pull every pitch, an early-season phase he  goes through every year.  </P> <P> "All my career, when Wally Joyner was hitting good, I was hitting the ball over  the shortstop's head and going to left," Joyner said. "I finally feel like I  have an idea at the plate again. Of course the key is to see what happens  tomorrow."  </P> <P> That's pretty much the tact Rader is taking, not wanting to label a one-inning  outburst as the end of his club's offensive woes.  </P> <P> "Anything you say after a game like this sounds greedy," he said, "but I'd like  to see us have this kind of run-scoring capacity in more than one inning. We  need to keep the pressure on.  </P> <P> "We're not there yet, but hopefully, we'll be there on a more consistent  basis."  </P> <P> Joyner says he's not superstitious, but he does plan to "retrace his steps" of  Monday.  </P> <P> "It's no big deal, but I will be getting up at exactly 12:13," he said.  </P> <P> And it still remains to be seen whether this is some grand awakening or if the  Angel offense will hit the snooze alarm.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Manager Doug Rader decided to maintain his normal pitching rotation rather than  skip fifth-starter Jim Abbott's next outing, which means the Angel starters  will be working on six days' rest rather than the normal four. Abbott will  start Friday night against the Yankees at Anaheim Stadium. "With the innings  the starters have pitched and as far into the games as they've gone, a little  extra rest shouldn't hurt anyone," Rader said. Take away each starters'  shortest outing and all five have lasted six innings or more in every other  start. . . . Injury Updates: Second baseman Johnny Ray said Monday his sore  left wrist was "the same." And center fielder Devon White said his sore throat  was "about the same, day-by-day." . . . Claudell Washington, whose daughter is  in the hospital after injuring her neck in a household accident, has not  rejoined the team. Club officials said he would return as soon as his daughter  is released from the hospital.  </P> <P> If things weren't going badly enough for the Tigers, who have the worst winning  percentage in baseball, they got worse Monday night. Center fielder Ken  Williams bruised his ribs on the first play of the game when he slammed into  the fence to make a running catch of a drive off the bat of Brian Downing and  had to leave the game. Then in the fifth inning, first baseman Torey Lovullo  crashed into the railing near first base while chasing a pop foul. Lovullo  bruised both knees and had to be helped from the field. Both are on a  day-to-day basis.  </P></p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Observer: Flight of fancy Prudential has long been running commercials on how Britain's wives long to be free - and it is easy now to see why. An NOP survey released by the Pru yesterday revealed that only 53 per cent of British women would stay with their husbands if they had the choice of a Continental man instead. They viewed Italian men as the hottest prospects - 11 per cent of the women would prefer one. The French came second with 6 per cent, while Greeks, Spaniards and Dutchmen tied at two points lower. Danes, whether or not boosted by their macho treatment of Maastricht, were preferred by 3 per cent. Europe's least desirable men in the she-Brits' eyes were Germans, Luxembourgeois and Portuguese. But as they tied at 1 per cent apiece, they have the consolation of knowing that someone, at least, loves them.</p>

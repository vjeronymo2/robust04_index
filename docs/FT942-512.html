			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / US consumer confidence at 4-year peak A rebound in consumer confidence this month and a rise in sales of new homes in May were seen yesterday as confirming the underlying strength of the US economic recovery. On Wall Street, the unexpected buoyancy of the indicators prompted falls in bond prices in early trading - on the grounds that signs of economic strength would increase the chance of an early increase in short-term interest rates. The Conference Board said its closely followed index of consumer confidence rose to 92 this month from a revised 88.9 last month. The level of confidence in the second quarter was the highest for four years. Mr Fabian Linden, for the board, said confidence was at a level that historically 'has been associated with a reassuringly lively economy'. Consumers, however, were still concerned about the availability of jobs. Confidence, however, varies significantly by region. It is buoyant in central, southern and mountain states but still quite subdued on the east and west coasts. Sales of new single-family homes rose 4 per cent from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 738,000, 16 per cent above the level in the same month last year. The figures follow recent reports - on retail sales and industrial production - that appeared to signal a deceleration in the underlying pace of economic growth from an unsustainable annual rate of about 5 per cent in the second half of last year. If growth does slow to an annual rate of 3 per cent or less in the second half, the domestic pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates will be reduced. Fed governors and regional presidents meet in Washington on July 5 and 6 to set monetary policy. Some analysts expect the Fed to signal another increase in short-term rates to support the weak dollar. Others believe the Fed will continue to focus on the domestic outlook for inflation and growth and wait until employment figures for June are released on July 8 before making a decision on rates.</p>

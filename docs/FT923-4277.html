			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / People: Pinches on phone to DTI Mike Pinches, managing director of Orbitel, the mobile communications manufacturer owned by the Vodafone group and Sweden's Ericsson, is being seconded to the Department of Trade and Industry at the beginning of next month. He will act as an industrial adviser to the division of the department which deals with posts and telecommunications, and will initially produce a report on the international competitiveness of the UK mobile communications manufacturing industry. The secondment is seen as an instance of the closer co-operation between government and industry being instituted by Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade. Pinches has been at Orbitel for five and a half years and is being replaced as managing director by David Sims, currently managing director of Meggitt Electronic Components, a subsidiary of Meggitt, the engineering group.</p>

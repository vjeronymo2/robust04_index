			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: United Uniform ahead at Pounds 3.4m In spite of tough trading in its fourth quarter, United Uniform Services, the manufacturer and distributor of uniforms throughout the US, increased pre-tax profits for 1991 by 28 per cent. The advance from Pounds 2.66m to Pounds 3.4m was achieved from sales 80 per cent higher at Pounds 53.7m. The comparable figures included only a seven months contribution from Horace Small, one of the largest manufacturers of tailored uniforms in the US. Following the acquisition in October of Loev Brothers, a supplier of uniforms in eastern Philadelphia, profits are expected to benefit as Horace Small increases its share of supplies to Loev from 10 per cent to 35 per cent. The total dividend is doubled to 3p via a final of 2p.</p>

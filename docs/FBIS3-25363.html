The attack, which was  unclaimed, caused no casualties. The explosive was placed in an  uninhabited area of the house which also houses the offices of  the national education service. A second bomb, which was  planted under a broken-down car parked a few meters away from  the house, did not explode.    This attack comes a day after the discovery in Lome of the  bodies of a deputy and two members of the Action Committee for  Renewal who were assassinated after they were abducted on 13  February by men in military uniform. The killing of these three  people a week before the holding of the second round of  legislative elections, has been condemned by the entire Togolese  political class opposed to President Eyadema.</p>

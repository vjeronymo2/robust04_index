			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K. Deniz Ogut] </F>   [Excerpts] Azerbaijan's postponement of the "Turkic  Republics" summit, which was due to have been held in Baku,  shocked Ankara. [passage omitted]    The summit was postponed in line with a request from Russia,  which is following a "backyard" policy on Central Asia and the  Caucasus. This process, which started with the dispatch of  Russian troops to Tajikistan, continued with the solution of the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict on a Russian initiative and Moscow's  intervention in the continuing Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.  Realizing they can achieve lasting peace only by siding with  Russia, Georgia and Azerbaijan joined the CIS. From then on,  Russia has said: "If unity is needed, we already have the CIS;  we do not want a summit of the Turkic republics."  <H5>  A Dream Collapsed Within Four Days </H5>   Recent military victories by the Azerbaijanis against the  Armenians are due to Moscow helping Baku, which is acting in  tandem with the Russians. In return, Baku postponed the "Turkic  summit." [passage omitted]    Turkey's broken dream is not the only result of the  postponement of the Baku summit. What really faded was the  illusion of a share in the Caucasian and Central Asian cake by  acting as a front for the West. Trying to establish ties with  the former Soviet republics, Turkey acted as the representative  of the IMF, World Bank, similar other imperialist institutions,  and NATO. In line with these institutions' desires, Turkey  advised them to follow an unbridled privatization program. This  was Turkey's thinking to create "a Turkic world extending from  the Adriatic to the Wall of China." It did not happen.  <H5>  Shaman Dance by Turkes, Demirel, and Inonu </H5>   In agreement with the United States, Yeltsin has now  declared  the region part of his responsibility. Turkey, which failed to  develop its own independent ties with these republics, has  remained helpless in the face of this new development.    Privately, the Russians are saying: "We had relations with  these republics for many years and will continue to have  relations. Why did Turkey start to utter the slogan `From the  Adriatic to the Wall of China?' This frightened us." The  Russians tease: "Now, Turkish officials are reacting to  Zhirinovskiy's statements. Well, weren't we supposed to be  concerned when Turkes, Demirel, and Inonu were organizing Turkic  world meetings in Antalya and, like Shamans in our Siberia,  dancing around fire and hammering the iron on the anvil?"</p>

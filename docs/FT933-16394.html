			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Now it's son of Taurus THE STOCK exchange's decision to abandon its overly ambitious Taurus project for paper-less share trading and speedy settlement created a vacuum. Earlier this week, though, a task force led by the Bank of England suggested a way of achieving many of Taurus's objectives, albeit at a lower cost and amid significantly less wrangling among interested parties. The project is to be known as CREST, because, in the words of the task force chairman, 'it seems to be an encouraging, up-beat name with no down-side.' Private investors should be encouraged by the task force's suggestion that the Treasury's intention to eliminate stamp duty on transactions, which was to have occurred with the introduction of Taurus, should coincide instead with the advent of the new project. For the private investor, there are several key differences between the new proposal and Taurus, the most significant of which is that paper-less share dealing and speedy settlement will be at the option of the client. Thus, clients who take comfort from physical possession of share certificates can continue to hold them and can count on receiving new paper when additional shares are bought. The problem, according to the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers (APCIMS), is that they are likely to have to pay more to execute trades. But because CREST is not expected to be working before 1996, it will be some time before investors need to make a decision on whether having share certificates is, in fact, essential. Those shareholders who want to earn the benefits of the lower-cost, paper-less trading system may select a broker who is a member of CREST. But the shares will have to be held in the 'nominee' name of the broker for transactions to take place. ProShare, the organisation set up to promote wider individual share ownership, says it is unhappy with moves to encourage the transfer to nominee names because it inserts a layer of bureaucracy between the company and its owner, the shareholders. But Michael Baker, chief executive of APCIMS, says there is nothing wrong with moving to nominee names. 'The Securities and Investments Board has laid down criteria for private client stockbrokers,' he said. 'As long as the stockbroker meets those requirements and is a member of SIB's investor compensation scheme, clients should have little reason for concern. 'Private client stockbrokers have reported to us that a significant number of clients have already switched to nominee names in advance of Taurus.' Investors may check if their broker is covered by contacting SIB. What may be significant for the estimated 500,000 British private investors who trade their shares actively is the axeing, no later than next July, of the two-week account settlement period. By early 1995, the settlement period - the time between the date a bargain is struck and the date the payment and ownership change hands - will narrow to only five days. But Baker said: 'Many of our members regret the decision.' It means that investors will have to stump up cash for purchases much more quickly. Also, those who buy shares, and then raise the cash for them by selling others - say, a week later - will find that financing technique closed to them. Baker said it was estimated that around 10 percent of all transactions on the exchange were 'netted' deals that occurred in the middle of the account settlement period. So, a portion of private client business was likely to disappear.</p>

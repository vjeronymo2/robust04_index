			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Markets: . . . but IT savings schemes fall - At a Glance Contributions to investment trust savings schemes fell by 24 per cent between the second and third quarters of 1992. This was largely due to a drop in lump sum investment, although there was a small fall in the amount invested on a regular basis. However, the number of regular savings accounts increased from 57,280 to 66,475. Nearly Pounds 400m has been invested in IT savings schemes since they began in 1984.</p>

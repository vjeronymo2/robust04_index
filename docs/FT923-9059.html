			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: First dividend in eight years at Ampolex AMPOLEX, the Australian petroleum group, has declared its first dividend for eight years and plans to spend ADollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.03bn) on expansion over the next half-decade, despite a subdued earnings performance in the latest year to June. The company yesterday announced a 23 per cent fall in net earnings to ADollars 37.2m for the 12 months from ADollars 48.1m a year earlier. This reflected falling world oil prices which cut about USDollars 4 a barrel from receipts. Net profits werehelped by substantially lower tax of ADollars 8m against ADollars 51.3m. Revenue fell by 19 per cent to ADollars 176.4m from ADollars 217.5m, despite steady crude oil sales at 6.2m barrels a day. The directors declared a final dividend of 2.5 cents a share. Exploration spending took ADollars 64m, with a further ADollars 186m spent on development. Mr Peter Power, chief executive, said yesterday he was expecting improved earnings for the current year following the start of oil production from the company's Kutubu project in Papua New Guinea.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (24): Key facts for visitors CURRENCY: The French franc is still pegged to the Deutsche Mark, but has floated against most of the other European Community currencies, notably the pound and the lire, since the autumn currency crisis. Almost all large Paris banks, such as Credit Lyonnais or Credit Agricole, have bureaux de change although you should shop around for the most competitive rates. The small bureau de change on rue Saint-Honore at the back of Le Louvre des Antiquaires (by Palais-Royal metro station) usually offers good rates. Leading credit cards - American Express, Visa and Access/Mastercard - are accepted by most hotels, shops and restaurants. Telephones: The international dialling code for Paris itself is 331. Dial 19 followed by the country code and number to make an international call from Paris. To make a call from Paris to anywhere else in France dial 16 plus the number. Some payphones are still coin-operated but most only accept telecartes, phone cards, which are worth up to 18 minutes of telephone time and can be bought from any cafe-tabac. Minitel: Although Minitel is probably best known, inside and outside France, for its Rose sexlines, it is actually one of the world's most advanced interactive information networks. You can change your flight reservation, book an opera ticket, check a phone number or read the International Herald Tribune on Minitel. Most hotels are equipped with them at reception. There are also coin-operated Minitels available to the public at the Bibliotheque Public Information at Centre Georges Pompidou. Time: French time is one hour ahead of Britain (Greenwich Mean Time) and six hours ahead of New York. The only exception is in the four weeks in early autumn from late September, when the French clocks go back an hour at the end of summertime to the same time as Britain (and only five hours ahead of New York) until the British and American clocks go back in late October. Hotels: Paris is fairly busy throughout the year, but the hotels are filled to the brim in May, June, September and October when the city is crammed with tourists. March is busy too because of the pret-a-porter fashion shows as is June during the biennial Air Show. Book early for these periods. Details of the main Parisian hotels are available in the hotels section of this guide, or in standard tourist guides such as the Michelin. Restaurants: The grand Parisian restaurants, those with two or three stars or a really stunning location like the Jules Verne on the Eiffel Tower, are almost always booked up four to six weeks in advance, particularly for dinner. You should also book a few days to a week in advance for anywhere else which is particularly attractive, or fashionable. Addresses and telephone numbers for restaurants are published in the Michelin and Gault Millau guides. Clubs: Business life in Paris is notoriously nepotistic and the city has a labyrinthine network of private clubs and dining circles. The plush private clubs, such as the Club des Inter-Allies on rue Faubourg Saint-Honore or the Saint-Cloud country club, are ideal for discreet business entertaining. These clubs are ferme to the public, or members only, although they do have reciprocity arrangements with private clubs in other cities such as London and New York. The Inter-Allies has the added attraction of pretty gardens and a large 1970s James Bond-style swimming pool. Tipping: A service charge of 15 per cent is automatically added to all restaurant bills, or cafe bills if you sit down to eat. The bill usually indicates this with service compris, service included. But you should always leave a tip if you stand at the bar. Strictly speaking you need not tip taxi-drivers. Most people do, however, unless the journey was particularly dreadful. The same principle applies to hotels. The staff at the very swanky Plaza-Athenee are told to stand at the room doors for 30 seconds, no more, in case the guest decides to give them a tip. Airports: Paris has two main airports. Charles de Gaulle, 23km north-east of the centre, for international flights (tel:4862 2280 for flight information) and Orly, 12km to the south (tel: 4975 1515) for domestic routes. Almost all the major - and minor - international airlines fly to and from Charles de Gaulle. Air France, the French international carrier, also has an extensive international network of routes. Air France passengers should go to Terminal 2 at Charles de Gaulle and passengers with most other carriers to Terminal 1. Air Inter is the main domestic airline operating from Orly. Getting to and from the airports: It takes anything from 40 to 90 minutes - costing FFr150 to FFr250 - to get from central Paris to Charles de Gaulle depending on the traffic. Try to avoid travelling there by taxi during rush hours particularly on Friday evenings when people are leaving Paris for their weekends in the country. The easiest alternative is the RER train service from Chatelet, which costs around FFr30 and takes about 30 minutes. The RER stops at Roissy station where a courtesy bus ferries passengers to the airport terminals. But the RER network is not safe at night, particularly for women travelling alone. Alternatively Air France buses leave for Charles de Gaulle from L'Etoile and Porte Maillot every 20 minutes. Allow at least an hour for the journey, which costs roughly FFr40. The taxi journey to central Paris from Orly is cheaper and quicker, at FFr120 to FFr150 lasting about 40 minutes, depending on the traffic. Buses leave for Orly from Les Invalides and Montparnasse every 15 minutes with tickets costing about FFr35. Public Transport: The famous Parisian Metro underground railway network is not only cheap, but efficient. Maps are available from every station and are included in all tourist guides. You identify which line you want from the direction, the end station on the route. The metro operates on one ticket per journey, however long. One ticket costs FFr6, or you can buy a carnet of 10 tickets for FFr36.50. A weekly pass costs FFr57 and a monthly pass FFr201. The only hitch is crime. Pickpocketing is commonplace, so keep a tight grip on your bags. You can use your metro tickets on the Parisian bus network, although this tends to be a less efficient way of travelling around the city because of traffic jams. Paris is also the hub of an international rail network, thanks to France's futuristic - and very comfortable - Trains a Grande Vitesse (TGVs), which often make it easier to travel to cities such as Brussels by rail rather than air. Call 4565 6060 for train information and 4582 5050 for reservations. Taxis: One of the indirect effects of the efficient metro network is that taxis tend to be comparatively cheap in Paris. There are taxi ranks in most parts of the city centre. You can also hail cabs on the street whenever their roof lights are on. Most restaurants will call for them for you at the end of the evening. There are also a number of reliable telephone taxi services so you can order your own cab from Taxi Bleu, Tel: 4936 1010, or Taxi Etoile, Tel: 4270 4141. The Aerotaxi service, Tel: 4731 3030, specialises in airport journeys, which is useful during peak periods when the peripherique and motorways may be congested. Boats: Travelling by boat is one of the loveliest ways of seeing the city. The bateaux mouches look - and are - terribly touristy, with their incandescent lights and booming loudspeakers. But they do provide one of the most efficient, and picturesque, routes through the city. A bateau mouche journey at night is quite captivating because of the effect of the lights on the stonework of the riverside buildings and the Seine bridges. Vedettes de Pont Neuf, Tel: 4633 9838, leave from the Pont Neuf itself. Bateaux Mouches, Tel: 4225 9610, from Pont de l'Alma and the Bateaux Parisiens, Tel: 4705 5000, set sail from nearby Pont d'Iena.

The inner city parks, the Jardin des Plantes and Jardin du Luxembourg, were designed to be ambled, rather than run, around. Parisian joggers tend to settle for running on the roads or around the islands - Ile de la Cite and Ile Saint-Louis - as a compromise. Gyms and keep-fit centres: Some of the grander hotels, such as the Ritz, or plusher private clubs, notably the Inter-Allies, do have their own multi-gyms and swimming pools.

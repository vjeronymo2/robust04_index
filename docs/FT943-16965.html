			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / OECD calls for firm action against inflation The turbulence on the world's financial markets could be eased if monetary authorities in the industrialised world took more action to underline their commitment to low inflation, the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development said yesterday. The call came as the OECD unveiled its latest half-yearly outlook, which revised its forecasts of growth upwards for the first time since 1991, with industrialised economies expected to expand by 2.5 per cent this year and nearly 3 per cent in 1995. With the recovery now well entrenched in the US and UK, growth in continental Europe will be boosted by rising exports, said the Paris-based OECD, which represents 25 of the world's industrialised nations. Meanwhile, Japan's economy will begin to grow by the second half of this year, boosted by rising domestic demand. But the recent bout of market instability and the rise in long-term interest rate expectations could undermine those projections, Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the OECD's chief economist, warned yesterday. If the yen strengthens significantly - as it has done in recent days - this is likely to slow the pace of the Japanese recovery by reducing Japan's exports, Mr Shigehara said. And though the dollar's slide against the yen has not yet been repeated against other currencies, a weaker dollar would fuel US inflation. Meanwhile, the recent rise in long-term interest rates, and the broader market turbulence, suggests that governments should make more effort to emphasise their commitment to low inflation, without overreacting to every market movement, Mr Shigehara said. 'More effective articulation of clear commitments to sound public finances and price stability, and, where necessary, decisive corrective actions . . . would contribute importantly to the stabilisation of market expectations.' Although Mr Shigehara declined to point the finger at any particular government, the OECD's outlook suggests that the US may be one country where such clearer commitments would be particularly welcome. Nevertheless, Mr Shigehara warned against 'overreacting' to erratic market swings and stressed that the recent rise in interest rate expectations could not be solely attributed to inflationary pressures but also reflected traders' rising bond yield expectations and growing aversion to risk.

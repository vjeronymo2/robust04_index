			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Argentina denies debt cut in trouble ARGENTINE government officials yesterday denied that the country's foreign debt reduction package was in danger. This follows an overwhelming preference by creditor banks for swapping Dollars 23bn worth of debt for par bonds, rather than accepting discount bonds that reduce debt principal by 35 per cent, reports John Barham in Buenos Aires. About 80 per cent of banks have now applied for par bonds because these, as well as preserving the full value of the debt principal, also pay higher interest than discount bonds. In previous debt reduction schemes for other Latin American countries, par bonds offered lower, fixed interest rates while discount bonds yielded higher, floating interest rates. Concern has been growing all week that a low degree of preference for discount bonds would threaten the reduction package. Argentina is now asking banks to take more discount bonds. However, Mr Horacio Liendo, who negotiated the agreement for Argentina, said, yesterday: 'In no way does this affect Argentina's Brady plan.' Mr William Rhodes, Citicorp's veteran debt negotiator, said that he expected a signature ceremony to be held in Buenos Aires on September 9. Mr Liendo said that unusally low international interest rates have cut the attraction of discount bonds to the point where, at current rates, Argentina would pay Dollars 920m in annual interest if all banks took par bonds and Dollars 720m a year if they only took discount bonds. Argentina is now paying Dollars 810m a year in interest. The par bonds are also more costly for Argentina to back with collateral, in the form of US Treasury zero-coupon bonds. Discount bonds would require 35 per cent less collateral. Officials reckon that the par bonds would cost Argentina Dollars 300m more to back with collateral. Argentina has already won commitments from multilateral lending agencies for long-term loans totaling Dollars 2.4bn that would be used to buy collateral.</p>

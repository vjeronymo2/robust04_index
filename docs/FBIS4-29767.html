			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] Hans Blix, director general of the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], has expressed the hope that former  U.S. President Carter's visit to the North will serve as a  turning point and a climate will be fostered in which North  Korea will completely return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty and comply with the nuclear accord.    Director General Hans Blix said this in an exclusive  interview with the KBS network on 17 June.    He said he welcomed the promise North Korea has made to  former President Carter that it will allow the inspectors who  are now in Yongbyon to approach nuclear facilities without  restricting their activities.    Director General Hans Blix said, in particular, with regard  to North Korea's replacement of nuclear fuel rods: At present,  the five-megawatt atomic reactor is empty because its fuel rods  have been removed. It seems that new fuel rods will be  installed soon.    He said: The inspectors in Yongbyon have been conducting  various kinds of inspection activities, including installing  monitoring equipment at the storage site of spent fuel rods and  at reprocessing facilities without any restrictions. The  inspectors work at any time and take turns working.    Asked if he would be willing to have dialogue with North  Korea, Director General Hans Blix emphasized that his duty is to  inspect if activities comply with the nuclear accord, adding  that the United States will discuss issues, including the  normalization of relations, with North Korea through political  dialogue.</p>

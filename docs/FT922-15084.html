			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Clash of the sound-bite slickers: The 'huckster' factor in New York's Democratic party primary IT WAS billed in advance as the great, much-needed policy debate on the crisis facing urban America. And there could be no more fitting location for it than New York, a city whose social fabric is being rent by 'crack', violent crime and Aids, and where teenagers have taken to shooting each other in the school room. But so far the crucial Democratic primary race in New York has had difficulty rising above the relentlessly personal or trivial. This both confirms the city's reputation as a political circus and spells an uphill battle for Mr Bill Clinton, the governor of the southern state of Arkansas and front-runner for the presidential nomination. Winning in New York next Tuesday is vital for Mr Clinton, yet his campaign here has got off to a rocky start, dogged by two big problems. First, there remain persistent doubts among voters about his character, fanned by microscopic attention to his past from local television and a hostile tabloid press. New Yorkers, for all their supposed cosmopolitanism, tend crudely to divide their southern countrymen into two categories: hicks and hucksters. And Mr Clinton, with his bouffant hairstyle and mouth seemingly stuck in a smirk, looks to many like a representative of the latter category, or a dubious Southern tele-evansensible, detailed policy documents he may brandish before the voters. The governor has not helped by his confession in the middle of the campaign that he smoked marijuana in Britain more than 20 years ago. This was in itself trivial, but it made his previous pat answer to drug questions - that he had never broken US laws - seem evasive and equivocal. He is, in short, having a hard time difficulty shaking off his tabloid image as a sly, slippery 'Slick Willie'. His second problem is that Mr Jerry Brown, the former governor of California and Mr Clinton's sole remaining official adversary, has fought a skilful campaign. His populist rhetoric, ruthless tarring of Mr Clinton, and command of the 10-second sound bite have turned him from a mildly dotty fringe candidate into a serious challenger. Victory in New York is important in part because the state has the second-largest count of delegates (after California) at the Democratic National Convention, which will choose the party's presidential candidate. And New York City, with its extraordinarily diverse ethnic mix, is often seen as an acid test of a candidate's national stature. Not for nothing did Mr Clinton deliver a major foreign policy speech in Manhattan this week. New Yorkers, proud of the city's reputation for political toughness, would like to think that no candidate can fail here and go on to win the nomination, but that is typical New York hype. After all, Mr Jimmy Carter (another Southerner) came a dismal third here in 1976. And Mr Clinton has come to New York with almost half the delegates needed to sew up the nomination. Just a few weeks ago Mr Clinton seemed all but assured of victory in New York after strong wins in the key Midwest states of Illinois and Michigan, and the withdrawal from the campaign of New England's Mr Paul Tsongas. But then Mr Brown won a surprise victory in the small north-eastern state of Connecticut, amid polls showing that almost 50 per cent of local Democrats questioned whether Mr Clinton had the honesty to be an effective president. With the media continuing to question Mr Clinton's marital fidelity, Vietnam draft status and ethical record, New York suddenly became a key test of the governor's character. Mr Brown has ruthlessly capitalised on this, accusing Mr Clinton of delivering a 'big lie a day', and branding him as the friend of Wall Street and the slick, unacceptable face of politics-as-usual. 'I am running,' he says, 'against a candidate who is the very symbol and personification of a system and politics that doesn't work.' This is extremely galling for Mr Clinton, whose preferred image is of a new-age Democrat operating outside the traditional party hierarchy. But Mr Brown's tactics have been effective, allowing him to capitalise on a groundswell of bitter cynicism among ordinary US voters towards conventional politics. New York's bewildering ethnic mix means that any politician campaigning here faces an extremely delicate balancing act. So far both candidates have avoided any serious gaffes, but Mr Clinton appears to be well ahead in winning the backing of Jews, who account for about 30 per cent of the primary vote, thanks partly to his attacks on President Bush's tough new policy towards Israel. The important black, Hispanic and labour constituencies look more divided. Mr Brown has appeared on the same platform several times with Mr Jesse Jackson, the black former presidential candidate, and has invited him to be his running mate. The latest opinion poll suggests that Mr Clinton is ahead, but a large number of voters appear undecided and there remains a significant wild card in the form of Mr Tsongas, whose name remains on the New York ballot. As a favourite son of the north east, he could yet attract a significant Anyone-But-Clinton vote and wreak considerable damage on the Southerner.</p>

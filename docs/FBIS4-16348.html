			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Will 10 April Deepen the Zbruch River?"] </F>   [Text] So far, the elections to the new Supreme Council of  Ukraine have gone through three stages: a first round on 27  March, a second ound of voting in a portion of electoral  districts on 3 April, and a second round of voting in the  majority of electoral districts on 9-10 April.    The first round did not produce a large number of new  parliamentarians (only 49), and it would have been risky to  predict the composition of the new Supreme Council on the basis  of these results. However, it is worthwhile to recall who the  first winners were.    Two well-known democrats were elected in Kiev in the first  round --Volodymyr Lanovyy and Serhiy Holovatyy. To everyone's  surprise, the only outright winner in Crimea, Valentyn Horbatov,  the chairman of an agrofirm (i.e., collective farm), was  appointed the presidential representative to the restive  peninsula, provoking a stormy reaction from the Republican  Movement of Crimea [RDK]. The winners in the first round in  Luhansk Oblast were six Communists and one private businessman,  and in Donetsk Oblast, five Socialists/Communists (including  Petro Symonenko, first secretary of the Central Committee of the  CPU), a representative of the Liberal Party [LPU], and the  well-known independent incumbent deputy to the Supreme Council  of Ukraine, Oleksandr Shekhovtsov. The Communists won one seat  each in Odessa and Zaporizhzhya oblasts, and Volodymyr  Marchenko, a leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine [SPU], won  a seat in Sumy Oblast. A candidate from yet another "leftist"  party, the so-called Peasants' Party of Ukraine [SelPU], won a  seat in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. In Chernihiv Oblast, the first  round brought victories to the well-known Leonid Kuchma and Ivan  Plyushch, in Zhytomyr Oblast, to Health Minister Yuriy  Spizhenko, and in Zakarpattya Oblast, to Transport Minister  Orest Klimpush. In Kiev Oblast, fate smiled on two collective  farm chairmen.    Voters in the western part of the country painted an  entirely  different picture. In Lviv Oblast, seats were won in the first  round by four representatives of the New Wave alliance  (including Ihor Yukhnovskyy and Viktor Pynzenyk), two Rukh  members (one of them, Les Tanyuk), one representative of the  Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN], one independent  candidate, and Stepan Khmara, the leader of the Ukrainian  Conservative Republican Party [UKRP]. In Ternopil Oblast, seats  were won by Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil and by one  representative each from the Ukrainian Republican Party [URP],  KUN, and the Ukrainian National Assembly [UNA] (a few days  before the election in Ternopil Oblast, a candidate who was a  sympathizer of the Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian  National Self-Defense Force [UNA-UNSO] was seriously injured by  a shot to the head). The winners in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast  included the leader of the local KUN, as well as a whole group  of prominent political figures, headed by People's Deputy of  Ukraine Stepan Volkovetskyy, the chairman of the oblast council  (it was he who invited Volodymyr Pylypchuk, the distinguished  economist, Pavlo Movchan, chairman of the All-Ukrainian Prosvita  [Enlightenment] Society, Volodymyr Mulyava, hetman of the  Ukrainian Cossacks, and Yevhen Pronyuk, chairman of the Union of  Former Victims of Repression in kraine, to run for office in  this oblast to spite Vyacheslav Chornovil). These newly elected  people's deputies were supported by the Ukraine Bloc, headed by  Levko Lukyanenko. In Bukovyna [i.e. Chernivtsi Oblast], Heorhiy  Filipchuk, a democrat who heads the oblast administration of  education, won a seat in the first round, while Oleksandr  Skipalsky, chief of the Main Directorate of Military  Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense, who had the support of  KUN and URP, won in Volyn Oblast.    The clearly defined division between west and east was  disturbed by another democrat -- Hryhoriy Omelchenko, the chief  of the Ukrainian Security Service's Directorate for Combatting  Corruption and Organized Crime, who was elected in industrial  Kremenchuk (Poltava Oblast).    Nor was there a shortage of distinguished losers in the  first  round. Those who will not sit in the new parliament include the  well-known Socialists/Communists Oleksandr Kotsyuba (defeated in  Vinnytsya) and Serhiy Dorohuntsov (defeated in Kiev), as well as  the equally well-known Ukrainophobe, Oleksandr Charodyeyev  (Donetsk). Another Ukrainophobe, Valeriy Meshcheryakov, the  leader of the chauvinistic Civic Congress of Ukraine (GKU) (he  conducted his campaign in Kharkiv under the slogan: "Valera  [Valeriy] -- yes! Bandera -- no!), advanced to the second round  together with Volodymyr Hrynyov, the well-known cochairman of  the Interregional Reform Bloc [MBR], but then took fright and  quit the race.    Also among the losers in Kharkiv were the once popular  Henrikh Altunyan and Andriy Sukhorukov, as well as Yuriy  Haysynskyy, the former deputy procurator general, notorious for  his shady deals.    Valeriy Ivasyuk, the well-known Rukh activist, was defeated  in Poltava Oblast, and Dmytro Pavlychko was eliminated in  Cherkasy Oblast (incidentally, he was but one of eight chairmen  of the old Supreme Council's standing commissions who failed to  advance past the first round of voting).    In Zakarpattya, both the leader of the post-Communists,  Mykhaylo Voloshchuk (former first secretary of the oblast  committee of the CPU and former chairman of the oblast council),  and the leader of the democrats, Viktor Bed, were defeated. In  Lviv, Mykhaylo Horyn, the leader of the URP, lost to Stepan  Khmara. Other deputies to the old Supreme Council who failed to  advance past the first round of voting in Lviv Oblast were Ihor  Derkach, Ihor Hryniv, Ivan Makar, Mykhaylo Shvayka, Lyubomyra  Boychyshyn, the wife of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn and the hope of  Rukh, Yuriy Shukhevych, the leader of the UNA, Academician  Volodymyr Chernyak, the well-known Rukh economist, and the  equally well-known former political prisoner and champion of the  rights of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Ivan Hel.    Four deputies to the old parliament were defeated in  Ternopil  Oblast, and the same number lost in Ivano-Frankivsk. Five former  deputies lost their seats in Volyn Oblast, where the leaders of  the local Rukh and URP battled each other furiously in one  district and were both defeated (the seat was won by Deputy  Prime Minister Mykola Zhulynskyy). Among those failing to  advance to the second round in Western Ukraine were the minister  of forestry, the deputy minister of energy, the former deputy  minister of finance, and the distinguished economist, Mykola  Syvulskyy. In Rivne, the much anticipated victory did not  materialize for Valeriy Korotkov, the very rich but not very  well-disposed to Ukraine Russian businessman with a criminal  past (as was later revealed, the money that he spent so lavishly  on his campaign came from the $300,000 that he had  misappropriated from funds received for a different purpose from  the American company, Communications and Computer Services of  Nevada).    With respect to the contingent that advanced to the second  round, both P. Symonenko, the leader of the CPU, and V.  Chornovil, leader of Rukh, could be happy about the results. Of  the more than 200 candidates that the Central Leaderhip of Rukh  supported, 91 made it through the first round (this number does  not include the democratic candidates that were not on this  list). The picture in Kiev was particularly heartening (despite  the overall apathy of the capital's electorate). Here, the  candidates from the list described above advanced past the first  obstacle in 20 of 23 districts. Four candidates from the URP and  the Congress of National Democratic Forces [KNDS] also advanced  to the second round in the capital, and the same number from the  UNA. The Communists stood a chance to win in only four districts.    In Donetsk Oblast, however, there were only four electoral  districts in which candidates from the openly "leftist" parties  (CPU, SPU, SelPU) failed to advance to the second round. In four  districts, both the candidates who advanced to the second round  were "leftists." In the rest of the districts, they were opposed  either by candidates from the "Party of Power," or the "Red"  directors' Party of Labor, or the Movement for the Restoration  of the USSR, and only here and there, by individual businessmen.  In Luhansk Oblast, true "Reds" failed to advance in only one  district. In four districts, both candidates were "Reds," and in  the rest, their opponents were for the most part people from the  "Party of Power," the chauvinistic GKU, or the Russian "Don  Cossacks." The Communists advanced to the second round in 13 of  Crimea's 23 districts (in two districts, their victory s  guaranteed), and candidates from Meshkov's Republican Movement  of Crimea advanced in three other districts. There were, to be  sure, also three candidates from Ukrainian organizations and two  from the Crimean-Tatar Mejiles.    Competing in the second round of voting in Kharkiv's 14  electoral district, were 12 candidates from Hrynyov-Kuchma's MBR  and their allies, nine Socialists/Communists, two chauvinists  from the GKU, and two national-democrats (interestingly, on 27  March, immediately following the election, Kharkiv's "Reds" held  a press conference, at which they promised that as soon as they  came to power they would "put up against the wall [i.e.,  execute] first Khmara and Chornovil, followed by Kravchuk and  Plyushch and all speculators, businessmen, and journalists"). In  Odessa, in addition to three Communists, one member of the GKU,  and numerous "independents," the candidates included Viktor  Shyshkin, the former procurator general, Valentyn Symonenko,  counsellor to the president (leader of one of the local clans),  Pavlo Kudyukin, the notorious president of the Blasko Shipping  Company (which swallowed up the Black Sea Shipping Company), two  local political and commercial authorities who are fierce rivals  -- Eduard Hurvits, a Jew, and Oleksiy Kostusyev, a Russian --  and Anatoliy Vasserman, an aggressive supporter of an  independent "Novorosiya."    The picture in the west was quite different. The first round  of voting in Galicia showed clearly that the Communists had  lost. Although their andidate received 20 percent of the vote in  one electoral district of Ivano-Frankivsk, and another in Lviv  got close to 15 percent, they were opposed by such "big guns" as  V. Pylypchuk and V. Pynzenyk, who deprived them of any chance of  victory. The candidates of the newly created party of  Social-Nationalists also lost in all 21 districts of Lviv  Oblast. Clad in their black shirts bearing an emblem resembling  a swastika, they also failed to win the voters' confidence.    In Lviv Oblast, six candidates from Rukh, six from KUN, four  from URP, two from UNA, one New Wave candidate, and several  representatives of smaller parties advanced to the second round.  The situation in Ternopil Oblast was as follows: Rukh -- four  candidates, URP -- four, UKRP -- one, and three "independents."  In Forecarpathia [i.e., Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast], where parties  do not wield much influence for some reason, there were seven  "independent" candidates, one from KUN, two supported by Rukh,  one member of the Democratic Party of Ukraine [DemPU], and one  from the so-called Nationalistic Rukh.    In Zakarpattya Oblast, not a single openly "Red" candidate  made it through the first round, and only three democrats  advanced to the second round. Instead, there were five  representatives of the "Party of Power," five businessmen, and  three representatives of the Hungarian community. In Bukovyna  [i.e. Chernivtsi Oblast], one Communist was offset by five  national-democrats, six members of the "Party of Power," one  member of New Ukraine, and one representative of the Rumanians.  In Volyn and Rivne oblasts, of the candidates who advanced to  the second round, nine were from leftist parties (or supported  by them), 11 were representatives of the "Party of Power," six  were Rukh members, five were Republicans, and one was a member  of KUN.    In the rest of of Ukraine, the picture (not counting  individual businessmen and the "independent" candidates of small  liberal and left-centrist parties) that emerged was: for one  representative of the MBR, there were approximately eight  national-democrats, 10 "Reds," and 15 candidates from the "Party  of Power" (the latter included Deputy Chairman of the Supreme  Council Vasyl Durdynets, Deputy Prime Minister Vasyl Yevtukhov,  Industry Minister Oleksandr Holubchenko, Labor Minister Mykhaylo  Kaskevych, the former and current ministers of agriculture,  Oleksandr Tkachenko and Yuriy Karasyk, Deputy Agriculture  Minister Mykhaylo Parasunko, Mykola Kovalko, chairman of the  State Oil and Gas Committee, Oleksandr Stoyan, leader of the  state trade unions, and former prime ministers, Vitold Fokin and  Vitaliy Masol). A unique situation emerged in Kirovohrad Oblast,  where 14 Communists, six democrats (including Volodymyr  Yavorivskyy), and only two unaffiliated representatives of  governing structures advanced to the second round.    And so, the second round of voting would decide everything.  Even Vyacheslav Chornovil waited for the results of this round  to make his decision regarding whether to aim for the presidency  or for the parliamentary speaker's job.    The voting that was held in some districts on 3 April  produced alarming results for the democrats. Although two more  of their candidates won in two districts in Galicia (who else  could have won?), in Kiev Oblast, Oles Shevchenko, a leading  member of the URP, was defeated by Oleksandr Moroz, the leader  of the SPU. In Cherkasy Oblast, a Communist and a minister  defeated two Rukh members, and in Khmelnytskyy Oblast, the head  of Ukrahrotekhservis [Ukrainian State Concern for Providing  Material and Technical Supplies and Services to the  Agroindustrial Complex] routed yet another URP member. The seats  in the rural districts of Kharkiv Oblast were won by six "Reds,"  seven people from the "Party of Power," and one independent  lawyer. The national-democrats had to be satisfied with the  victory of three collective farm chairmen whom they had  supported (lacking any other choice) against openly Communist  candidates. In Zhytomyr Oblast, all the national-democratic  candidates lost (including Vitaliy Zhuravskyy, the leader of the  Christian-Democrats), while the winners were two Communists, an  independent businessman, a deputy minister, a general, a  director of a production association, and two members of the  "Party of Power."    In Bershad (Vinnytsya Oblast) both candidates lost (a Rukh  member and Anatoliy Matviyenko, the chairman of the Workers'  Congress who had formerly headed the Ukrainian Komsomol) --  neither obtaining the qualifying 50 percent of the vote. The  same happened in four other districts in the voting held on 3  April.    The days between 3 and 9 April passed in fierce battles. The  State Television Company and the yellow rag Kiyevskiye  vedomosti launched a campaign against Kostyantyn Morozov  (who ran in Kiev) --there were many who wanted to eliminate a  powerful rival from the upcoming presidential election. In  Kharkiv, MBR members claimed that the Communists had used up  their reserves of votes and would not win any more seats. In  Odessa, two journalists from opposing camps were beaten up at  the same time. In Cherkasy, the Socialist/Communists stuffed  mail boxes with proclamations urging voters in the  Prydniprovskyy electoral district to vote against both  candidates, because, allegedly, one was a "democrat-Rukh member"  and the other, a "liberal-nationalist." In neighboring Shpola,  Chornovil himself campaigned on behalf of Yuriy Boyko, a priest  of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church.    In Lviv Oblast, Mykola Horyn, the chairman of the oblast  council, with the help of people's deputies M. Kosiv and Ya.  Kendzyor, launched a campaign to discredit his rivals from the  UNA-UNSO (this was the first time they were openly called  "fascists") and their patron Stepan Khmara. Meanwhile, inspired  by its victory on 27 March, the New Wave announced its intention  to transform itself from a preelection alliance into a public  organization and to create a powerful centrist bloc with Rukh,  the Ukrainian Republican Party, and possibly the Congress of  Ukrainian Nationalists as a counterbalance to the  ultra-rightists.    Finally, the decisive weekend of 9-10 April arrived. Voting  was held on Saturday in Kharkiv and in two electoral districts  in Luhansk. In Luhansk Oblast, a Communist defeated a Socialist,  and the pro-Communist chief of the local Security Service of  Ukraine defeated a Communist.    In Kharkiv, seats were won by two Communists (one defeated  Volodymyr Filenko, the leader of the Party of Democratic Rebirth  of Ukraine [PDVU], who finally got his deserts after switching  back and forth between the "nationalists" and the  "Hrynyovites"), I. Mukhin, the leader of the local SPU, V.  Aleksyeyev, member of the chauvinistic GKU, as well as Volodymyr  Hrynyov and five of his supporters. The elections in three  districts were invalid because voter turnout was lower than  required by law, and in one district, no candidate received the  qualifying percentage of votes.    Results from Sunday's vote began coming in on the morning of  11 April. Kiev presented the saddest picture -- it was  officially announced that elections in 13 of the city's 21  electoral districts (including the district in which K. Morozov  had run) were invalid owing to voter turnout that fell below the  legally required percentage. And in those districts, in which  the election was valid, preliminary results showed that deputies  had been elected in only three districts. In view of the high  voter turnout throughout most of Ukraine and the government's  great unwillingness to see Kiev's democrats in parliament, the  results in Kiev appear quite suspicious.    In Donetsk, seats were won on 10 April by Acting Prime  Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn  Landyk, Derzhvuhleprom [State Coal Industry Committee] Chairman  Mykola Surhay and two other representatives of the "Party of  Power," 22 Socialists/Communists, two members of the directors'  Party of Labor, Yuriy Boldyrev, a vehement supporter of the GKU,  and five independent candidates (unfortunately, Petro  Tsekhmister, the director of the first private mine in the  Donbas and a sincere Ukrainian patriot, was defeated). Thirteen  deputies were not elected in Crimea because they failed to  receive the qualifying number of votes, and of the ten who were  elected, half were Communists.    The preliminary results of the election on 10 April on the  territories of some oblasts in Central and Southern Ukraine  (Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk,  Zaporizhzhya, Mykolayiv, and Khmelnytskyy) present the following  picture: seats were won by 37 "Reds," two members of the Party  of Labor, six members of the MBR, three dozen representatives of  the "Party of Power," four members of the URP, three Rukh  members, four PDVU members, one member of DemPU (Volodymyr  Yavorivskyy), two members of the Union of Officers of Ukraine,  and 12 "independents" (who might also turn out to be  Communists). Poltava Oblast proved to be the most  "anti-Communist" --not a single true "Red" won here.    In each of these oblasts, there were two or three districts  in which the elections were invalid because of insufficient  voter turnout or no deputy was elected owing to a failure of  both candidates in a district to receive the qualifying number  of votes. The exception was Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, where a total  of ten districts suffered from "abstinence." Vitold Fokin and  Deputy Prime Minister Vasyl Yevtukhov failed to win  parliamentary seats in these districts. However, the winners  included Valeriy Babych, the president of the powerful Ukrainian  Financial Group Joint-Stock Company, Industry Minister Oleksandr  Holubchenko, the Communist poet Borys Oliynyk (who was  reelected), and democrats Viktor Nosov and Yuriy Sobolyev.    In Western Ukraine (except for Zakarpattya Oblast), not a  single Communist won a parliamentary seat on 10 April. In  contrast, another 11 people on the Rukh list were elected here  (including Borys Kozhyn and Vasyl Chervoniy). Seats were also  won by five URP members, four KUN members, two UNA members (in  Lviv Oblast), and one candidate each from the DemPU and New  Ukraine. Taras Stetskiv, a member of the New Wave, defeated  Iryna Kalynets, who ran from KUN (both had been deputies to the  old Supreme Council). Five members of the "Party of Power" were  elected (including Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Zhulynskyy,  Economy Minister Roman Shpek, and Anton Buteyko, head of the  president's foreign affairs service). Mykola Horyn, chairman of  the Lviv Oblast Council, was defeated, however.    No deputies were elected in 14 districts of Western Ukraine  due to the failure of either candidate in the district to obtain  the qualifying number of votes (the only exception was  Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast).    Zakarpattya stands somewhat apart. Here seats were won by  two  representatives of the local "Party of Power," one  Christian-Democrat, and one independent democrat -- docent of  Uzhhorod University and father of the well-known popular singer,  Anzhelika Korshynska.    Will the prevalence of "leftists" in the east and the  complete rejection of them in the west split Ukraine along the  Zbruch River? Only time will tell...</p>

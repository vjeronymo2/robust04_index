			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SOCCER MATCH MOVED TO HONDURAS  </P> <P> The U.S. Soccer Federation learned Tuesday that the national team will play its  World Cup qualifying match against El Salvador on Sept. 17 at Tegucigalpa,  Honduras.  </P> <P> FIFA, the international soccer federation, made the decision when the five  teams in the region encompassing North and Central America and the Caribbean  could not agree on a location for the game.  </P> <P> It originally had been scheduled for San Salvador on July 9, but FIFA  indefinitely suspended games in El Salvador because of a fan disturbance there  on June 25.  </P> <P> Trailing 4-2 with eight minutes left in a game against Costa Rica, El Salvador  was forced to forfeit when the referee determined that it would be dangerous to  continue because of the unruly crowd.  </P> <P> El Salvador requested that the game against the United States be moved to Los  Angeles, where there is a large Salvadoran population. But two other teams in  the region, Costa Rica and Guatemala, objected to giving the U.S. an extra home  game in the eight-game, round-robin tournament.  </P> <P> Keith Walker, USSF secretary, said the new date is the one recommended by U.S.  Coach Bob Gansler. The United States will have a month to recuperate from two  tournaments in early August, including the Marlboro Cup at the Coliseum Aug. 10  and 13.  </P> <P> With a 2-1-1 record, the United States is second in the qualifying tournament.  Costa Rica completed play with a 5-2-1 record and is virtually assured of a  berth in the 1990 World Cup tournament in Italy. The two teams with the best  records at the end of the year advance. El Salvador is 0-2.  </P></p>

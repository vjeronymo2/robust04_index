			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GOLF COURSE FAVORED OVER WILDLIFE PRESERVE  </P> <P> This letter is in response to the dedication of an urban wildlife preserve in  the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area. It would be interesting to know just how our  city politicians decided to use taxpayers' money on this project when there are  many other more useful activities for this precious land.  </P> <P> It had long been rumored that a much-needed golf course was destined for this  location. Los Angeles has a paltry seven 18-hole courses, which are usually  poorly maintained. The courses are the city's only moneymaking activities.  People spend hours each Monday and Tuesday morning trying to get starting times  and pay their green fees. The point is: Golf courses are in short supply and in  huge demand, and their revenue helps offset overhead expenses of the city. That  is indeed unique and desirable for all taxpayers.  </P> <P> How many people will visit a wildlife preserve that uses 60 acres of land and  costs plenty to maintain without a nickel of revenue? I hope someone with a  sense of economic savvy will keep count, and maybe in a short while this  wildlife folly will be converted to a profitable golf course.  </P> <P> And to all the environmentalists who will be aroused by this view, please  remember that the natural terrain and the lakes and river bottom already in the  area and outside the preserve attracted migrating birds and wildlife for years  before some narrow-minded politicos decided to build this preserve.  </P> <P> A.

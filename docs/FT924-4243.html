			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Letter: A good read at breakfast Sir, In his Business Book review, 'The high priest of Moggonomics', Barry Riley stated that students nowadays neither have breakfast, nor do they read the Financial Times. Neither statement holds true for myself. Every morning, I take explicit pleasure in walking down three floors to the mail-box to pick up your excellent product. Returning to my continental breakfast, containing whole-wheat bread, eggs, muesli, milk, orange juice and cappuccino, I enjoy a lengthy 40-minute breakfast before setting out for the day. It is my belief that the quality of your life reflects on the quality of your work. Together with a healthy breakfast to satisfy my physical needs your newspaper provides me with the perfect start for a 16-hour working day. Ulrich Selzer, student, breakfaster and FT-reader, Adam-Karrillon-Strasse 56, 6500 Mainz, Germany</p>

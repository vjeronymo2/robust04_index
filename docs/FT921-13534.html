			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / PM avoids Brooke departure: Major says Northern Ireland secretary 'has more work to do yet' but may have weakened the government's hand in dealings with Northern Ireland - when he refused to accept an offer to quit by Mr Peter Brooke. The Northern Ireland secretary had been criticised for singing on an Irish television chat show on Friday only hours after an IRA bomb killed seven civilians in Tyrone. The prime minister, speaking on a visit to Northern Ireland, expressed full confidence in Mr Brooke. But the incident appeared last night to have undermined efforts to start political talks on the future of the province. Amid bizarre scenes at Westminster, Mr Brooke won warm and almost unqualified support from Labour and Tory backbenchers for his honourable stance, but he is believed at Westminster to be unlikely to survive in his present post beyond the general election. He created confusion with his resignation offer, which he made public at the end of a Commons statement on the latest IRA bombing. Not until some hours later did Downing Street announce that it had been rejected. Mr Major described Mr Brooke as a 'very good friend of peace in Northern Ireland. . . He has more work to do yet.' Mr Major visited one of the workers injured in the blast during a Belfast tour and promised that the killers would be 'hunted, hunted, and hunted for the rest of their days'. Last night he and Mr Brooke spent two hours in talks with Unionist MPs on security in the province and agreed to consider some proposals, believed to include a citizens' militia and the cordoning of Catholic areas. Heading the Unionist delegation was the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party - the most prominent among those who called for Mr Brooke's resignation for appearing on the Late Late Show in Dublin. Mr Paisley did not rule out meeting Mr Brooke again, but said Unionists would 'consider very carefully' whether to take part in further 'talks about talks' on the future of the province. Mr Paisley said confidence in Mr Brooke had been 'irretrievably damaged', adding that the minister had, in effect, 'danced on the graves' of the IRA's victims. Among others, Mr Brooke is likely to have lost considerable respect for appearing to cower to DUP demands by offering his resignation. During the Irish television show, Mr Brooke expressed outrage at the attack and sympathy for the victims' families. He declined a request to sing 'Danny Boy', but bowed to the insistence of Mr Gay Byrne, the show's host, and sang 'Oh My Darling Clementine'. Northern Ireland Office officials had argued that to change his programme on Friday would have been to allow the IRA to set the agenda. In the Commons, Mr Brooke apologised for his 'error', which he insisted was 'innocent in intent'. As he spoke, Tory MPs shouted 'no, no, no'. Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, praised Mr Brooke's 'characteristically honest and courageous statement'. Mr Brooke offered his resignation during Mr Major's trip to Belfast but urged the prime minister not to upset his itinerary to make a decision. Downing Street stressed that Mr Brooke had acted 'entirely honourably' and said the people of Northern Ireland would respect his stand, recognising 'the depth of his contrition'. In Dublin, Mr Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister, backed Mr Brooke and looked forward to seeing him 'very shortly'. An Anglo-Irish conference meeting is expected next week. RTE, the Irish state television station, made a public apology to Mr Brooke. It said that: 'RTE would very much regret if the (interview) should damage in any way Mr Brooke's work or cause his resignation . . . it was an error to have invited Mr Brooke to sing and any offence which may have been caused is very much regretted'.

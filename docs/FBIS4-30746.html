			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F> Horn by unidentified BILD reporter; place and date not given:  "Germany Will Be My First Trip"]    [Text] [BILD] Will the Communists return to power now?    [Horn] No. A return to communism in Hungary is out of the  question. The wheel of history cannot be reversed. Despite the  great election victory, we in the Socialist Party want to rule  in a coalition.    [BILD] Are you going to stop the privatization?    [Horn] No, the privatization will be continued, but under  parliamentary control. We do not want to deprive anyone of his  legal property.    [BILD] What effects will the Socialists' election victory  have on German-Hungarian relations?    [Horn] Hungarian-German cooperation has great importance in  the development of our economy. We need the Germans to expand  our economy and become full members of the European Union as  quickly as possible. Therefore my first foreign trip will be to  Germany.</p>

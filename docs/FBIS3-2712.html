Preparations have started, according to Vice-President of  the  CAS Psychology Institute Zhang Kan today.    He said that the new project will help psychologists from  the  two countries to carry out psychology research from different  cultural contexts, and study psychological problems of common  interest.    The official said that 14 cooperation projects have been  listed, and others are being negotiated.    With China's reform and opening up, Chinese psychologists  have done a lot to promote cooperation with their American  counterparts.    In 1993, the CAS Psychology Institute sent 15 scientists  abroad for international cooperation and received 21 prominent  overseas colleagues.    Chinese Mainland psychologists visited Taiwan in September  last year for the first time since 1949.    The Department of Psychology of the University of Michigan  is  one of the largest in the U.S.</p>

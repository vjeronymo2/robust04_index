			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] In an inflexible attitude and rejecting talks to  study their demands which have been proposed by the government,  a small group of former Government Ministry soldiers have  carried out coercive pressure at the UN headquarters. The  government has decided to discontinue discussing their demands  until they stop the pressure. The government will enforce the  state of law and guarantee the country's institutionalization.    The Government Ministry was scheduled to meet with this  group, and Minister Alfredo Mendieta, who has been sick for the  past three days, authorized a ministry delegation, including  deputy ministers, to meet with the group. At first, however, the  protesters stubbornly refused to hold the meeting, demanding  Minister Mendieta attend the meeting.    This same group has occupied the Managua Cathedral twice  before. They also tried to ruin the awards ceremony when  Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani visited our country  recently.    The government delegation talked to representatives of the  Nicaraguan Human Rights Center to persuade it to convince the  protesters to change their minds regarding their demands that  the minister be present at the meeting. The protesters agreed  but, at the same time, a small group of protesters began  exerting pressure at the UN headquarters. The government  decided not to continue talking to them until they stop exerting  pressure at the UN headquarters. The Government Ministry  reiterates its willingness to advance the state of law and  guarantee the democratic development of the country's  institutionalization.    [Panama City ACAN in Spanish at 0029 GMT on 10 Mar 94 cites  Managua radio stations as reporting that "at least 50 former  Sandinist soldiers occupied today, Wednesday, the building where  the UN headquarters is located in Nicaragua to pressure Violeta  Chamorro's government to compensate them for retiring to  civilian life." ACAN adds that according to media sources, the  former soldiers "are holding Francesco Vincenti, UN  representative in Nicaragua, at the UN installation," and they  want him to mediate to get the Nicaraguan Government to accept  their demands. The report adds: "A riot police contingent has  cordoned off the UN building, located near Plaza Espana, in the  southwestern part of Managua."]</p>

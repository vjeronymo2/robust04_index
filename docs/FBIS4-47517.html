These shortcomings of solar power plants may be  eliminated by creating combined solar-powered and fuel-fired  plants such as those that have been operating since 1985 in the  United States. The possibility and feasibility of siting a  megawatt-class combined solar-powered and fuel-fired plant in  Ukraine for the purpose of stable commercial production of  electric power was analyzed. The following seven strategic  aspects of siting such a plant in Ukraine were considered:  finding a priority technological combination of one  thermodynamic cycle (conversion of heat into electricity) with  an existing power system (conversion of solar radiation into  heat); determining the ``niche'' of use of the electric power  produced at a combined solar-powered and fuel-fired plant;  determining the ecological impact of such a plant; using the  earth's surface; identifying tap and fresh water sources to be  used for cooling; identifying a source of fuel (i.e., natural  gas); and giving consideration to the implications of the  shortage of electric power in the southern part of Ukraine. The  analysis indicated that a megawatt-class combined solar-powered  and fuel-fired plant in Ukraine could reduce the amount of  fossil fuel required to produce electric power in Ukraine if it  were sited so as to make use of the actinometric characteristics  (``solar potential'') of the semiarid southern rayons of the  Odessa, Nikolayev, and Kherson oblasts and western and eastern  regions of the Crimea and if the plant were designed to include  parabolic concentrators with hollow heat receivers in its  ``solar'' part and gas-steam turbine units with steam injection  into the combustion chambers in its ``thermal'' part.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alexandra Schwartzbrod and Michel de Grandi: </F> "Arms: French Industrialists Lose Ground in Taiwan"]    [Text] After selling frigates and armed Mirage 2000-5  planes to Taiwan, French arms manufacturers have been losing  ground with the Taipei Government for several months. Last  January, they had to suffer France's diplomatic about-face,  pledging to stop selling arms to Taiwan in order to normalize  its relations with Beijing. At the same time a political and  legal scandal -- which is beginning to spread -- broke out on  the island against a background of arms purchases in which the  French were involved.    The highly official LES ECHOS DE LA REPUBLIQUE DE CHINE is  opening its columns to this mysterious case. It all started  last December with the murder of Captain Yin Chin-feng, involved  in the purchase of arms abroad for the Taiwan Government. The  Taiwanese publication, which on this occasion mentioned "a case  of bribes and secret military sales," has no hesitation in  naming a French enterprise: "The main suspect is a man called  Wang Chuan-Pu who was acting as local agent for several foreign  firms including the Thomson company."    Questioned on this subject, Alain Gomez' group said it was  "not involved in this case in any way." Although the Taiwanese  publication stalled by stressing that "Wang was not Thomson's  legal representative, but a mere intermediary and nothing so far  suggests that the French company was involved in Captain Yin's  death," it is not impossible that this case, stirred up by  internal score-settling between the Taiwanese Government and the  opposition might have helped to curb Thomson's chances of arming  the frigates sold as empty hulls in 1991. All the experts agree  that the position of French industrialists in Taiwan has been  considerably weakened.  <H5>  Some Means of Pressure </H5>   Aside from the simple news item, it is more generally the  issue of Franco-Taiwanese relations which is now in question.  The publication of the article in LES ECHOS DE LA REPUBLIQUE DE  CHINE, intended for a French readership, came just a few days  after Edouard Balladur's visit to the PRC. However, although  the Taipei Government reacted with moderation to the snub of the  Franco-Chinese joint communique of 12 January, it was  nonetheless angered by its content. And the public discussion  of this case is now probably a means of reminding the French  Government of its existence and showing it that it has some  means of pressure. "Captain Yin was murdered after threatening  to reveal the misappropriation of funds he had discovered in the  awarding of arms contracts," the Taiwanese publication explained.    Strangely enough, this case is being publicly discussed at a  time when the U.S. Congress is authorizing Bill Clinton to  increase arms sales to Taiwan. The blow seems particularly  harsh for French arms manufacturers because the latter,  encouraged by the Defense Ministry which is still in favor of  selling "defensive" weapons, still hope to sell Taiwan some of  the equipment for the frigates, armored vehicles and air defense  missiles.</p>

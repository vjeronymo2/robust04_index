			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / NatWest had doubts on shares: Bank asked Kevin Maxwell for pledges NATIONAL Westminster Bank accepted shares offered to it by Mr Kevin Maxwell even though it had doubts about whether they were properly his to give, it emerged yesterday. Maxwell pensioners, whose shares and funds were looted by Robert Maxwell, will be concerned that the UK bank did not act on these doubts by refusing the shares. The shares in question are a Pounds 20m holding in Teva, an Israeli pharmaceutical company. The Maxwell pension funds claim the shares belong to them. NatWest received the shares as security for a Dollars 27.3m loan that it made to Robert Maxwell Group, a Maxwell private company, two days after Robert Maxwell's death. The bank noticed that the name of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the trustee for the pension funds, was on the document transferring ownership of the shares. So it pointed out to Mr Kevin Maxwell that BIM appeared to be the owner of the shares. Mr Maxwell insisted that BIM was holding the shares in trust for RMG. Nonetheless, NatWest appears not to have been satisfied by his explanation. Because of its uncertainty about the ownership of the Teva shares, NatWest insisted that both BIM and RMG should produce mortgage documents pledging the shares to NatWest. Mr Kevin Maxwell signed both for BIM and for RMG. Both documents also contain the signature of one other director of BIM and RMG respectively. NatWest has said that it took the mortgage of the shares in 'good faith'. It has pointed out that the shares are now being claimed both by the administrator of RMG and by the pension funds. It has therefore applied to the High Court to give directions as to the ownership of the Teva shares. NatWest said that if the court ruled that the shares were pension fund assets - and were not properly at the disposal of RMG - it would return the shares to the pension funds. The pension funds claim that Pounds 217m of their resources are held by banks which lent money to the Maxwell private companies.</p>

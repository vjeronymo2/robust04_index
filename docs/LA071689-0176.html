			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLEAN AIR DELAY LINKED TO BUSINESS LOBBYING;  </P> <P> 'GREAT MISTRUST' BETWEEN COMPANIES, AQMD CITED IN STATE'S SLOWDOWN OF SOUTHLAND  PLAN  </P> <P> Regional air quality officials were stunned when the state Air Resources Board  recently postponed a crucial vote on a far-reaching blueprint for clean air in  the Los Angeles Basin.  </P> <P> After five years of preparation and controversy, the South Coast Air Quality  Management District governing board in March attracted worldwide interest when  it approved the plan, an ambitious proposal that placed tough new air pollution  controls on everything from cars to patio barbecues.  </P> <P> Thinking that they had overcome determined opposition from major business  interests, AQMD officials believed there was no stopping their effort to rid  the four-county basin of smog within 20 years. AQMD officials thought the ARB's  ratification vote was all but assured.  </P> <P> Instead, the state board three weeks ago rejected its own staff's  recommendation and delayed the vote 60 days. ARB chairwoman Jananne Sharpless  urged the delay, explaining that the long-term success of the clean-air plan  had been jeopardized by "great mistrust" between the AQMD and business  interests.  </P> <P> What Sharpless did not mention publicly was that Gov. George Deukmejian, who  appoints the ARB board, was also "very concerned" about the air quality plan's  impact on the economy and had discussed those concerns with her only days  before she called for a postponement.  </P> <P> In the weeks before the vote was delayed, the governor and members of his  cabinet had been heavily lobbied by business interests, including the Los  Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce and the California Manufacturers Assn., which  had long warned that the plan would be a blow to Southern California's economy  and could cost thousands of workers their jobs.  </P> <P> But the lobbying did not begin or end with the governor. Indeed, business  interests worked for months in Sacramento to win concessions in the air quality  plan that they said they were unable to obtain from the AQMD.  </P> <P> * During their annual trek to Sacramento last month before the ARB vote,  members of the chamber had a "substantial" conversation with the governor about  the plan, chamber President Ray Remy said in an interview. Remy also  acknowledged that he raised the issue when he joined Deukmejian in Mexico City  in February to open a new state trade office.  </P> <P> * Officials of the Western States Petroleum Assn., which represents oil  refineries that would be subject to additional air pollution controls, held a  series of private meetings in Sacramento with John Geoghegan, secretary of the  state Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, who is also a member of the  governor's cabinet. Their objections were later raised at cabinet meetings.  </P> <P> * The California Manufacturers Assn. persuaded Sen. Ralph Dills (D-Gardena) to  introduce a bill that critics said would have delayed the plan's adoption. The  measure was introduced just one week before the AQMD was scheduled to approve  the plan in March. Later, after the AQMD approved the plan, the bill was  amended to make it take effect immediately instead of in January, in order to  force the state Air Resources Board this year to take additional time to gather  information if necessary before approving the plan.  </P> <P> * The CMA also tried to have legislation introduced that would have required  the Legislature to approve any increases in the AQMD budget beyond an  established ceiling.  </P> <P> * Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich prevailed on state Sen. William  Leonard (R-Big Bear) to carry a bill that would have subjected all or parts of  the plan to repeal or revision by initiative or a referendum vote.  </P> <P> * Antonovich also encouraged a conservative public policy research group known  as the Claremont Institute to undertake a critical analysis of the air quality  plan. Although the findings were disputed by the AQMD, Antonovich used them to  privately lobby some ARB members two days before their decision to postpone the  vote. The institute is not affiliated with the Claremont colleges.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Seed Money' Used  </P> <P> The Claremont Institute study was funded in part with $40,000 in "seed money"  from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Commission, which was created  by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. The nonprofit organization is  funded in part by county taxpayers and by 100 corporations. EDC president  Reginald Bottger said Antonovich suggested the commission contact the Claremont  Institute.  </P> <P> * Business lobbyists prompted state Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) -- whose  efforts in 1987 gave the AQMD significant new powers -- to call for Senate  oversight hearings this fall on the district's activities.  </P> <P> Presley also introduced legislation requiring the district to publish each  year's new preliminary budget in advance of public hearings and preventing the  district from increasing the final budget more than 10% over preliminary  estimates.  </P> <P> All of the maneuvering demonstrated that business executives remain unconvinced  they can work with the AQMD. They sought help in Sacramento because they said  they could not get a fair hearing in El Monte -- a point the AQMD sharply  disputes.  </P> <P> While business interests say they support the need for a clean-air plan in  principle, they want assurances that the economic costs of proposed rules are  considered by AQMD along with the potential benefits. The district has  estimated the plan will cost $2.79 billion a year for the first five years but  industry estimates are four times higher.  </P> <P> The air quality management plan, which calls for the adoption of more than 120  separate air pollution controls between now and the year 2007, is divided into  three tiers. The first tier includes new controls that would be imposed during  the next five years. These controls are based on available technology. The  second and third phases become progressively more futuristic and rely on  technology that is either just around the corner -- including methanol-powered  cars -- or rely on unforeseen technological breakthroughs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Effect on Transportation  </P> <P> By the end of 1998, for example, the plan calls for 40% of all cars and pickup  trucks, 70% of all commercial freight trucks and every bus to run on  alternative cleaner-burning fuels. There would be stepped-up ride-sharing, and  homes would have to be built closer to employment centers, theoretically to  reduce commuting.  </P> <P> Eventually, manufacturers of consumer products from barbecue lighter fluid to  underarm deodorants would be asked to reformulate their products so they  produce fewer smog-producing emissions. Tougher restrictions on emissions from  major pollution sources such as power plants and oil refineries also are  envisioned.  </P> <P> All of this has raised questions about the costs of dramatically reducing air  pollution in the nation's smoggiest air basin where ozone levels are  occasionally three times higher than federal standards allow.  </P> <P> But despite protests from industry, AQMD Executive Officer James M. Lents  insists costs have been taken into account.  </P> <P> "Every major rule we've done has literally taken one to three years to develop.  The biggest part of this debate in all of them is what is the cost and what is  the air pollution result," he said. "To me the issue is (business doesn't) like  the decisions. They want the district to make a different decision -- which is  don't control them as much."  </P> <P> Contributing to the mistrust have been verbal exchanges between district  officials and business representatives. Lents, for example, has likened  business interests to "tempters" who deal in "misinformation" and called  environmentalists the "conscience" of the district.  </P> <P> "The district should be doing a better job building stronger ties and  relationships with the business community and local government, and I don't  think they've been particularly successful," chamber President Remy said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gains Have Been Small  </P> <P> Despite their efforts, the gains made by lobbyists for business and local  government this year have been slight. Business lobbyists have fallen short of  their overall goal -- to have major new restraints placed on the district's  activities.  </P> <P> Although Deukmejian forwarded the business community's concerns about the  plan's cost to Sharpless, she said he did not suggest that the vote be delayed.  That, she said, was her idea. She did so, she explained, to provide time to  answer two specific questions.  </P> <P> The ARB ordered the AQMD to return in August with a detailed accounting of how  it would take economic costs into account in adopting new air pollution  controls. The AQMD also must explain how cities and counties could be counted  on to cooperate.  </P> <P> AQMD officials and environmental groups remain confident that the ARB will  approve the plan in August without weakening it. Even industry representatives  concede its approval is likely.  </P> <P> The Dills bill, which would have required the AQMD to prove that its air  quality plan was enforceable before getting ARB approval, was introduced too  late to have any impact this year. Leonard was unable to introduce the  legislation sought by Antonovich to subject the air quality plan to initiatives  or referendums because he missed the deadline for proposing legislation.  </P> <P> However, the Presley bill that would require the district to observe the same  public notice requirements on its budget as other governmental agencies  continues to move forward in the Senate. That bill would also allow the  district to impose a $3 surcharge on motor vehicle registration fees to help  fund the district's air pollution programs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Good Politics'  </P> <P> Clean air remains an attractive issue to most Sacramento lawmakers. As EPA  Administrator William K. Reilly said recently, "Clean air is good politics."  </P> <P> "The consensus for clean air has been holding. I don't think there's any breach  in the wall," said John White, who lobbies for both the Sierra Club and the  AQMD.  </P> <P> Last year, the Legislature enacted a California Clean Air Act that goes far  beyond its federal counterpart and beyond President Bush's proposals for  strengthening the federal law. Moreover, the state Air Resources Board, which  is appointed by the governor, recently adopted the most stringent tailpipe  standards in the nation.  </P> <P> "Lawmakers are repeatedly asking how a bill would affect our air quality plan.  They say they're not going to sit here and start to peel off authority to  prevent the AQMD from doing that," observed Gene Fisher, an AQMD lobbyist.  </P> <P> That clean air is "good politics" has not been lost on the business lobby.  </P> <P> "Certainly, right now a lot of people are concerned about cleaning up the air  -- and we're among those," said Robert Getts of the petroleum association.  </P> <P> "It makes our task much more difficult, certainly. We say you have to balance  the health benefits and clean up benefits along with economic and socioeconomic  costs you incur. It makes it a little more difficult to make some of those  socioeconomic cases in the environment we have."  </P></p>

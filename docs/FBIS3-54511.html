			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The national conference of consensus  concludes this evening at the Palais des Nations after two days  of proceedings. The final session is under way. More details  from our correspondents at the Palais des Nations:    [Correspondent] Dear listeners everywhere, God's peace and  mercy be upon you. As you heard, we are now following the final  session of the national conference of consensus. The main event  of this session is the report being presented by the rapporteur  of the committee in charge of drafting the platform of national  dialogue. One of the most important points of this report thus  far is that the committee has reached a number of decisions.  First of all, with regard to the article pertaining to the  appointment of the presidential body [Article Six], the  committee kept the version of the original text which stipulates  that it is the Higher Security Council which appoints the head  of the presidential body. The latter can appoint one or two  deputies. The two deputies will assist the head of state in the  tasks which he entrusts them with. So as I have said, the head  of state will be appointed by the Higher Security Council.    As regards Article 27 pertaining to the Transitional  National  Assembly [al-majlis al-watani al-intiqali], the committee in  charge of drafting the platform proposes to increase the number  of seats from 180 to 200. These seats will be divided according  to the following percentages: 15 percent of the seats will be  reserved for representatives of state bodies, and the remaining  75 percent will be equally divided among the political parties,  associations, economic organizations, and other organizations.    The installation of the Transitional National Assembly will  take place three months after the latter has been formed. It  has also been decided to abolish the board of censorship since  nothing justifies its existence, the document says.    Another article in the document stipulates that the head of  state can rule by decrees in the period between his appointment  and the appointment of the transitional national assembly. In  other words, the period between the two appointments has not  been fixed.    The political resolution says that actions and measures have  to be taken in order of priority with a view to ending the  political crisis. This resolution adds that the end of the  political crisis will inevitably have to go through the  electoral process, but there are other actions which must be  undertaken and other conditions which must be met in the  economic, social, and security fields. The resolution further  says that the constitution remains in all circumstances the  legal framework of the transitional period. But, the resolution  adds, the constitution cannot be implemented in full since, for  example, it will be impossible to hold elections soon. However,  emphasis was put on the need to return to the electoral process  as soon as possible and also on the need to amend some laws  during the transitional period, such as the electoral code, the  law on political parties, and the information code. This point  was in fact included in the original text of the draft platform.    [Announcer] Rachid Benhmimid, we give you back the line to  follow the rest of the statement read out by the rapporteur of  the committee in charge of drafting the document and also the  proposals made by the committee to the national conference which  is meeting at this very moment. These proposals will be put to  the vote very shortly.</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP DEFENDS AD CRITICIZING FEINSTEIN RECORD  </P> <P> Democratic gubernatorial candidate John K. Van de Kamp Friday defended a new TV  commercial that he is running, saying that its criticism of Dianne Feinstein  was designed to present parts of her record as San Francisco mayor that she had  left out of her own commercial last month.  </P> <P> But rather than defend all six charges in his ad, Van de Kamp chose to focus on  one: the projection by Feinstein's successor, Mayor Art Agnos, that the city  would have a $180-million budget deficit for fiscal 1988-89. Agnos blames the  projected deficit on her spending policies in the mid-1980s.  </P> <P> Feinstein, who left office in January, 1988, blames the projected deficit on  factors beyond her control, including the settlement of expensive lawsuits  against the city.  </P> <P> To which Van de Kamp said Friday in Santa Monica: "Clearly, one of the two  Democratic candidates for governor is either wrong or simply being untruthful."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp then issued a challenge to Feinstein to clear up the questions of  responsibility for the budget deficit matter.  </P> <P> "I'll put up one-half of the money it would require to have any of the Big 8  accounting firms resolve the issue . . . Dianne Feinstein can put up the other  half."  </P> <P> Feinstein adviser William Carrick responded: "This is basically a hotdog  maneuver designed to pump up John Van de Kamp's failing campaign, and we're not  playing that game. Standard and Poor's of New York gave the city an AA rating  in August, 1988, months after Dianne left office, and said the following: 'The  AA rating also reflects management's willingness to adhere to sound fiscal  policies.' "  </P> <P> Although Van de Kamp said last fall that "people are tired of negative  campaigns, tired of negative candidates," his new ad criticizing Feinstein's  record is definitely in the negative category.  </P> <P> But a Times analysis of the six specific charges in the ad found that Van de  Kamp had taken some liberties with Feinstein's nine-year record as mayor,  blaming her for some problems left by the late Mayor George Moscone, problems  she moved to solve in her tenure.  </P></p>

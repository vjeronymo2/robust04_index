			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Economic Viewpoint: How to cope with the slowdown Some recessions are said to be 'home-made'. But if there is one sure feature of the recent faltering in the British recovery, it is that it has been made abroad. The key factors are the continued decline in the European economies, which constitute Britain's principal export markets, and the slow and hesitant nature of any recovery that may be taking place elsewhere in the world. No clever manipulation of domestic budgetary or monetary policy will allow Britain to contract out of events in Europe or the wider world, whatever the Euro-sceptics may wish. Meanwhile a simple programme* for European revival has been presented by none other than the international financier, George Soros. His success in speculating against sterling in the face of a wide-open opportunity should not elevate him to the status of prophet; nor should it cause his policy proposals to be sniffily brushed aside. They deserve a hearing on their merits. His first suggestion is that the French authorities should take advantage of the disappearance of the narrow ERM band to reduce short-term interest rates now by about 3 percentage points. This should preferably be done in conjunction with other members of the ERM and with a negotiated extension to two years of the French debt to the Bundesbank, arising out of this summer's support operations. A reduction in French interest rates has been proposed frequently enough. But a newer element is provided by the second Soros suggestion that the resulting appreciation of the D-Mark, and the consequent weakening of the German economy, would hasten the reduction in German interest rates. The net result would be a European recovery, in which Germany would eventually join, and in the end a pattern of exchange rates not far different from that prevailing this summer before the collapse of the narrow ERM band. It is however the financier's third proposal that differentiates his package from the common run. This is that after about two years some countries would be able to move to a common currency directly, without reinstituting the narrow bands. Thus the present vicious circle of European disintegration could be turned round into a virtuous one. What is not generally known is that the early stages, at least, of something close to the Soros package very nearly got under way earlier this year. For at the meetings of the EC Committee of Central Bank Governors, called to consider the 'fault lines' in the ERM after Britain's departure, the Bundesbank proposed a temporary widening of the ERM margins. Because the proposals were given the thumbs down by partner countries, Bundesbank representatives never got as far as proposing a specific range. But what they had in mind was something like a 6 to 10 per cent margin on either side of the central parity. This would have been enough to give France and other countries much more room for manoeuvre on interest rates, without destroying the medium-term credibility of the ERM. It was because of the rejection of this proposal that the EC Central Bankers' Committee, in common with the Monetary Committee, issued a thin report, suggesting no more than minimum changes in the ERM and implying that everything would have been all right if the UK had joined at an appropriate exchange rate and kept to the rules of the game. German representatives had another go during the fateful weekend meeting of July 31 and August 1, called in response to the tidal wave of speculation that had hit the French franc. As is known, they proposed a temporary floating of the D-Mark, while allowing the rest of the ERM to continue. The Netherlands announced that it would stay with the D-Mark and Belgium threatened to do the same after objecting to the German proposal. What is not so well known is that almost every other ERM member, including countries such as Denmark and Ireland, threatened to stick with the D-Mark. In that case the French franc would have been left to depreciate alone, precisely the result that the French prime minister, Edouard Balladur, was determined to avoid because of his no-devaluation pledge. A TAX SUGGESTION Meanwhile the British chancellor has to consider what to do in the face of a large budget deficit, which he cannot rely on righting itself, and in the face of a fragile UK recovery. The first consideration points to financial tightening and the second to loosening, or at least doing nothing. Two remarkably similar attempts have been made to square this circle, one by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in its Green Budget prepared in collaboration with Goldman Sachs. The other has been made by the Panel of Independent Forecasters established by the Treasury. In the recent past, fiscal policy has been less potent than expected and monetary policy more potent. But that does not justify writing off fiscal policy altogether. The Green Budget authors do not support hysterical talk about an immediate fiscal crisis. Nor, to be more practical, does the 1 1/2 percentage point reduction in gilt-edged yields so far this year suggest such a crisis. Nevertheless if the debt ratio is to stabilise at just over 50 per cent of GNP, which it is likely to reach by the late 1990s, then the Green Budget estimates that the PSBR will have to come down from its present 8 per cent of GNP to around 2 1/2 per cent. (This assumes that inflation is also 2 1/2 per cent.) A similar target estimate is reached if the object is to stabilise the net assets of the public sector. The Green Budget authors suggest that a cumulative tax-increasing package of Pounds 6bn should be phased in over the period up to 1996-97, but that only, say, Pounds 1bn of tax increases should be announced for next year. They also recommend that there should be even more interest rate cuts if fiscal tightening restrains the economy. Several reservations must be registered. First, interest rates cannot be determined irrespective of what is happening in other countries. The British have already had the one-off depreciation recommended for France by Soros. Second, Norman Lamont already used to the maximum the Augustinian strategy of 'fiscal virtue but not yet', to the tune of Pounds 10bn per annum of tax increases in the pipeline for the next two years. Further doses would deepen consumer pessimism. Third, the authors try too hard to be shadow political strategists for the Tories (irrespective of their personal political views). Hence their reluctance to leave tax decisions for later Budgets nearer an election. Their main job should, however, be to lay out appropriate economic policies before going on to discuss how politics may distort policies. Fourth, the authors too quickly dismiss the question of spending reforms. Here again the authors try too hard to be politically realistic. But even if worthwhile reforms cannot take effect in this parliament, early legislation would cast a shadow beforehand. In fact, a modest amendment to the Green Budget proposals would transform them into common sense. The Green Budget argues for phasing out mortgage interest relief and restricting the value of the main personal allowance to the 20 per cent income tax starting rate. Such changes have the advantage of not increasing the most conspicuous marginal tax rates and - unlike VAT widening - of not having a knock-on effect on the RPI. If these changes are desirable for their own sake, why not announce a definite timetable for them? But instead of presenting them as net tax increases, the chancellor should leave open - and not just in the small print - the possibility of offsetting tax reductions if the economic situation either permits or demands such cuts. Of course, UK mainstream economists turn pale at the mention of tax cuts, even as part of a neutral package. Another flavour should be given to the debate. * Prospect for European Disintegration.

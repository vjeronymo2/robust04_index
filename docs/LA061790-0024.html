			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETS: COLLECTORS CASH IN ON OLD FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS  </P> <P> Back in 1947, George Steffes paid $100 for 100 shares of Tucker Corp. common  stock. The check barely cleared the bank before Tucker, an upstart auto company  with uniquely designed cars, went broke. The 100 shares were worthless.  </P> <P> But now -- 43 years later -- Steffes could get his money back. Thanks to a  popular movie about Tucker, as well as a growing interest in historically  significant financial documents, the Tucker stock certificate that has been  sitting in Steffes' drawer would fetch about $100 at auction.  </P> <P> "Collectors are getting more interested in these kinds of collectibles. They  find them colorful and interesting," says Diana Herzog, president of R. M.  Smythe &amp; Co., which is holding its annual auction of financial documents  this weekend in Memphis. "The hobby is still within the range of people who no  longer want to spend a lot of money for paintings, prints or coins."  </P> <P> When the auction is over, Herzog expects about 500 lots of financial documents  to have been sold -- for a total of about $1 million. That auction's average of  $2,000 per lot isn't going to make Sotheby's quiver. But experts say prices  have been rising steadily the past 10 years.  </P> <P> In fact, financial-document hobbyists are delighting over reports that American  corporations may do away with paper stock and bond certificates in favor of  computer entries. They believe that the change could make their collections  skyrocket in price.  </P> <P> Even if financial documents don't become as prized as a Mickey Mantle rookie  baseball card, collectors say they get pleasure just owning -- for so small a  price -- a piece of history.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't advise anybody to go into this with the idea of making money. It's  for your fun, for your pleasure. If the thing goes up in value -- hooray," says  Sanford Hock, a stockbroker with Paine Webber &amp; Co. in Beverly Hills. He  has more than 250 historical financial documents.  </P> <P> Among his holdings are a large number of Confederate bonds; a lottery ticket  signed by George Washington that he estimates is worth about $5,000; a stock  certificate for Charles Chaplin Productions, signed by Charlie, with an  estimated value of $4,500, and a receipt for work on a church bell signed by  Paul Revere. Hock says he paid $6,500 for the Revere piece last year.  </P> <P> The most valuable financial document so far is a stock receipt for the East  India Company dated 1657. Because it is believed to be the oldest piece of  stock paper in private hands, it sold in 1989 at auction for $42,500.  </P> <P> As in any other hobby, most of the people who dabble in these collectibles know  what to look for. Many are employed in the financial industry.  </P> <P> The experts say amateurs should be alert for three types of documents.  </P> <P> First are those bearing important signatures. Many famous industrialists signed  early stock certificates for their companies.  </P> <P> Haley Garrison of Williamsburg, Va., an expert on antique stocks and bonds,  said the most prized signatures are those of John Jacob Astor and his son  William, J. P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, Thomas Edison, Andrew Carnegie,  Stephen Girard, Marshall Field, Henry Ford, Jay Gould, Meyer Guggenheim, Andrew  Mellon, Henry Wells and William Fargo.  </P> <P> The second thing to look for are financial papers of historical significance  and, third, papers of exceptional beauty.  </P> <P> Stocks and bonds aren't valuable just because they are old. A 500-ruble Russian  bond issued by the czarist government in 1912 was recently found in Los  Angeles. But it has no value to collectors because, in the waning days of that  regime, such bonds were as common as ditch water.  </P> <P> Most people who find themselves holding financial collectibles are no more  collectors than kids who bought baseball cards in the 1950s were investors.  What makes financial collectibles exciting is that it is still possible to  stumble onto valuable finds in a way that is no longer likely with paintings,  coins or even baseball cards.  </P> <P> "A guy came to me recently with a bond of the Erie Railroad Co.," says  Garrison. It turned out to be a rough draft signed by financier Jay Gould.  </P> <P> Garrison says it is probably worth between $10,000 and $15,000 -- with 60% of  the value attributable to its historical significance and 40% to Gould's  signature.  </P> <P> "Valuable stock and bond certificates are very frequently found by individuals  in the papers or belongings of relatives," notes Scott Winslow, a dealer in  Nashua, N.H. He says an 80-year-old woman recently found a pile of stock  certificates for mining companies that dated to the turn of the century. "The  companies all went bust, and (the stocks and bonds) had no negotiable value,"  he says.  </P> <P> "But today they have collectible value because of the quality of the graphics.  They had vignettes of mining scenes," says Winslow. He estimates that each  certificate is worth about $150.  </P> <P> "This is a fairly common occurence," Winslow adds.  </P> <P> Even more common, however, is an old stock certificate that isn't pretty,  wasn't signed by someone famous, doesn't have its history rooted in some  important event and isn't worth a nickel.  </P> <P> Novices should also remember that cashing in big on an old stock they might  unearth isn't easy. Getting a fix on the true price of an old stock is  difficult. One expert estimates that the Tucker certificate is worth $15 and  another $250.  </P> <P> Also, finding a buyer may be difficult, since there may be as few as 20,000  collectors right now. "We're a relatively new hobby," says Garrison, who is  helping organize the biggest auction ever for financial documents. It is to be  held in Dusseldorf, West Germany, in September.  </P> <P> Why Dusseldorf? "Because Europeans are avid collectors of American financial  history," says Garrison.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Federal Spenders Don't Have Corner on Deficits  </P> <P> State and local governments are learning from the federal government how to  spend more than they make.  </P> <P> According to the U.S. Commerce Department, state and local governments had a  record $45.7 billion deficit in the fourth quarter of 1989. That combined  deficit was the worst one ever recorded. The deficit dropped to $44.6 billion  in the first quarter of 1990 -- the last period for which there are figures.  </P> <P> "The numbers we have at the moment indicate that the deficit has gotten  considerably worse," says a Commerce Department source. "This has been going on  for a few years."  </P> <P> State and local governments started running deficits in the fourth quarter of  1986 after more than three years of surpluses.  </P> <P> There have been deficits in the recent past, according to Commerce Department  stats -- specifically from 1970 to 1972; from late 1973 to 1976 and briefly in  1980 and 1982. But the magnitude of the current aggregate deficit among the  states and locals dwarfs any from the past.  </P> <P> In July, the department will put out deficit statistics for the first quarter  of 1990. It will also revise and update its statistics from the past three  years.  </P> <P> Most of the problem is occuring in the Northeast, but Louisiana and West  Virginia are perennially in bad shape and parts of Florida and California are  also piling up debt, the department said.  </P> <P> The bottom line is that local and state governments -- like their federal  counterpart -- will soon have to come up with ways of either generating more  revenue, or they'll have to cut spending dramatically.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Johnson's Departure Leaves Void at the Fed  </P> <P> Manuel Johnson's decision to leave the vice chairmanship of the Federal Reserve  Board to become a professor could have some serious effects on the Fed.  </P> <P> On the plus side, Johnson's move could give chairman Alan Greenspan an even  stronger voice in policy decisions. On the negative side, Johnson's departure  will leave the Fed without a well-versed liaison with foreign central banks.  </P> <P> "Foreign central bankers are all sorry to see him go," says one source with  strong contacts in those circles. "With his departure, the international side  of the Fed needs some strengthening," says this source. The Fed and foreign  central banks, of course, have been coordinating monetary policy.  </P> <P> The International Assn. of Financial Planning in Atlanta says Americans who  responded to a recent survey believe that the 1990s will be a decade of  decreasing economic opportunities. The most pessimistic respondents, the survey  found, were those 35- to 44-year-olds who see their retirement plans hurt by  the need to put their children through college and care for aging parents. The  survey found that 61% of those answering were less inclined to take financial  risks now and 62% are more inclined to save money over the next 10 years . . .  </P> <P> Mara Balsbaugh, entertainment analyst at Smith Barney &amp; Co., recently told  clients that a 3-for-1 stock split is a "strong possibility" for Time Warner  Inc. in the near to intermediate term. She also expects Time Warner to announce  some "fairly significant restructuring moves . . . involving asset and/or  equity stake sales, potentially eliminating billions of dollars in debt." . . .  </P> <P> In a recent conference call with Prudential-Bache analysts, Sharon Vuinovich,  McDonald's Corp.'s head of financial communications and investor relations,  indicated that the burger company was disappointed with its second quarter.  "We're all looking for a pickup. Our comparisons in the second quarter will be  the easiest comparisons that we'll have all year. But, at the same time, I have  to tell you that we aren't seeing any substantial pickup in business right now  . . . So I guess we'll just have to see," said Vuinovich in the Pru-Bache  transcript of the call. . .  </P> <P> DR DAVID TILLINGHAST / for The Times  </P></p>

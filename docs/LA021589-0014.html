			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAYLE ON SOVIETS  </P> <P> No one can accuse NBC of lacking a delicious sense of irony. During a recent  "Today Show," one of that network's newscasters, in a story on Vice President  Quayle's visit to Central America, described the war in El Salvador as (I  paraphrase) "a war which still continues despite more than $3 billion in  military aid from the U.S."  </P> <P> I was disappointed that the next story wasn't about "a fire which still  continues to rage despite thousands of gallons of gasoline from firefighters."  </P> <P> MONTE MONTGOMERY  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

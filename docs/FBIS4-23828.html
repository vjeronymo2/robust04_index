			<p>BFN     [Text] The Zimbabwean Government has granted large  allowances and salary increases of between 10 to 23 percent to  members of Zimbabwe's civil service and Armed Forces. Reports  said the salary increases would cost Zimbabwean taxpayers about  217 million U.S. dollars. Low paid workers were given salary  increments of 23 percent to match Zimbabwe's annual inflation  rate and others were given between 10 to 23 percent. In  addition, all government employees were given transport and  housing allowances. A government spokesman said those working  in government had been most affected by the high cost of living  because their salaries and conditions of service had not matched  inflation. The report said in comparison salary increases for  private sector workers had been on average around 15 percent.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Ill-prepared Dow slumps on PPI data Wall Street US stocks stumbled yesterday as news of a sharp increase in producer prices rattled the bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 33.65 lower at 3,874.81, after recovering somewhat from its worst level of the session. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 4.96 at 468.18, reflecting the broad base of the sell-off. Declining issues outnumbered advances on the Big Board, 1,652 to 570. Volume was moderate, with 293m shares traded by the close. The American SE composite fared a little better, dipping 0.97 to 454.5. The Nasdaq composite shed 4.96 to 763.76 as a two-day rally by technology stocks sputtered out. In spite of indications to the contrary, the market was ill prepared for the bad news on inflation delivered by the Labor Department. Stocks across the board went into a tail-spin as trading opened, with investors jolted by the announcement of a 0.6 per cent increase in the August producer price index. A 0.5 per cent gain had been forecast. Before the session began, the strong reading set off alarm in the bond market, where a wave of selling pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury to over 7.70 per cent, its highest level since mid-July. After sliding more than 40 points in the first hour, the Dow industrials were able to stabilise and retrace some lost ground. A second downturn came during the afternoon, but the blue chip battled back again. Still, as the session closed, 23 out of the index's 30 components were showing losses, three were unchanged and a six held slender gains. Rate-sensitive stocks were among the hardest hit, as some investors feared higher inflation would bring forward the Federal Reserve's next tightening of monetary policy. In banking, Bankers Trust dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 70, JP Morgan retreated Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 63 1/2 and Wells Fargo shed Dollars 2 to Dollars 154 5/8 . Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street securities house, lost Dollars 2 to Dollars 65 7/8 . In retailing, JP Penney slumped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 7/8 and Gap Stores retreated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 36 3/4 . An 8 per cent decline in USAir's share valuation was unrelated to the day's economic developments. The issue was marked down Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 6 1/8 after one of the carrier's domestic flights crashed near Pittsburgh, killing 132 passengers and crew members. Canada Toronto stocks plunged to close sharply lower as US inflation data rocked North American financial markets. The TSE-300 index fell 25.24 at 4,329.14 in volume of 66.57m shares valued at CDollars 715.9m. Advancing stocks led declines 344 to 411 with 305 issues unchanged. All of Toronto's 14 sub-sectors fell, except for precious metals which bucked the TSE trend on an improving gold price. December gold on COMEX closed USDollars 1.20 higher at USDollars 395.80 per ounce in heavy volume. Brazil Sao Paulo rallied for the third session in a row to close up 1.5 per cent in heavy trade boosted by renewed confidence in Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso's presidential candidacy. The Bovespa index ended up 790 at 53,511 points. Stocks rose 11.4 per cent over the last three days, shrugging off a 10.5 per cent plunge on Monday sparked by the resignation of Mr Rubens Ricupero, the former economy minister. Turnover was RDollars 362.4m (Dollars 419m). Telebras TEL. SA preferred closed up 0.4 per cent at 51.70 reais.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Burton revives retail worries The patchy and volatile nature of the recovery in consumer spending was highlighted yesterday by disappointing sales figures from fashion group Burton and a lacklustre statement from clothing and food retailer Marks and Spencer. The statements contrasted sharply with Wednesday's news from fashion retailer Next that sales in the half-year to January 31 were expected to be 18 per cent up, and yesterday's announcement from MFI, the furniture group, that sales since Boxing Day were up 14 per cent. MFI also unveiled a near-doubling of pro-forma interim profits to Pounds 24.5m. The figures sent analysts scurrying to rewrite their full-year profits forecasts, with Burton downgraded from about Pounds 60m to between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m, and MFI lifted from about Pounds 60m to about Pounds 70m. M&amp;S was unchanged at Pounds 860m-Pounds 880m. Sir John Hoskyns, Burton's chairman, told the company's annual meeting that sales for the first 21 weeks of the financial year, to January 22, were no better than last year. Sales were 5 per cent up at Debenhams, but down 5 per cent in the multiple chains - which include names such as Top Shop, Dorothy Perkins and Principles - reflecting tough competition and increased promotional activity in clothing. Sir John said the multiples were responding to strategic changes, 'but change of this kind, which was urgently necessary, is also painful'. Lower mark-ups to make prices more competitive, plus markdowns to clear stock, resulted in a reduction in Burton's gross margin of 1.5 percentage points, although costs in the period had been reduced by 2 per cent. M&amp;S said that after a disappointing November, sales had recovered to the extent that the six weeks to January 1 had met expectations. But it operated at full price throughout Christmas, and the margin loss in the post-Christmas sale, in money terms, was the same as last year. With increased sales, that suggests the overall gross margin for the period will be higher. Yesterday's figures added to the mixed picture of Christmas and new year trading, with disappointing results from Dixons and Kingfisher, solid performances from the likes of M&amp;S, Sears, Boots and WH Smith, and sharper improvements from Signet, Laura Ashley, Storehouse, and Next. 'The upturn in spending is far from smooth,' said Mr Tim Kirkwood, analyst at Panmure Gordon. He said the vast difference in profit expectations between 'recovery' stocks such as Next and Burton reflected not just internal factors, but the weakness of the consumer recovery. If recovery was stronger, he suggested, most retailers would be seeing the benefits. Lex, Page 18; MFI rise Page 20</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Arts: Theatres in old London IN 1600, theatre takings were put in piggy banks, until someone had time to break the pottery moneyboxes and count the cash. The play cost a penny for the groundlings in the yard, and seats in the galleries were two pence. Broken piggy banks from the 1988-89 dig in the Rose Theatre in Southwark are an evocative part of a newly opened permanent display of Tudor and Stuart theatres in the Museum of London. The Rose, over the road from the FT's building, was at the heart of theatreland in the days of Marlowe and Shakespeare. Across Park Street was the Globe. Nearby were the Swan and the Hope, and the Bear Garden for bear baiting. London's first theatre was The Theatre, built by James Burbage in 1576 in Shoreditch, beyond the rule of the City fathers. Similarly, Philip Henslowe put the Rose in Southwark in 1587. In 1599 Burbage demolished The Theatre and came south to build the Globe and start a lively rivalry. The Globe/Shakespeare players in Hamlet parody the Rose/Marlowe style of acting. Centrepiece of the new display is a metre-high model of the Rose incorporating the results of the dig, which confirm details Henslowe recorded in his diaries. The model includes the refreshment parlour that Henslowe's partner, the grocer John Cholmley, ran beside the Rose. A sword hilt and scabbard from the dig are rusty relics of many a swordplay. But missing from the display are the hazelnuts, which were those days' chocolates and popcorn. Both Rose and Globe digs produced masses of them. At the Globe, the Museum of London has finished supplementary bore hole digs beneath the cellars of Anchor Terrace, paid for by the site's owner, Hanson, finding more of the theatre's perimeter. Now Hanson and the Museum are preparing a proposal for the future of the site. What a chance for the new French-style National Heritage Secretary to promote a French-style solution, a total excavation of the Globe - even if it means removing the lower floors of Anchor Terrace - to learn how Shakespeare was played in the theatre he wrote for. Bore holes are not enough.</p>

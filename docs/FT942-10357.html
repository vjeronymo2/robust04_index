			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Legal liaison plea at Iraq arms probe Sensitive prosecutions brought by Customs and Excise would be improved if the attorney-general had greater involvement in such cases, the chairman of Customs told the Scott inquiry into the export of arms equipment to Iraq yesterday. Mrs Valerie Strachan, while not calling for changes to the independent constitutional position occupied by Customs, said that there would be benefits in more regular meetings between its lawyers and the attorney over such prosecutions. Improved contact would bring Customs into line with the director of public prosecutions and the Serious Fraud Office, whose lawyers regularly meet the attorney-general as a matter of course. It would lessen the chances of Customs getting 'out of line' with the prosecution policies of the director of public prosecutions and the Serious Fraud Office, and help the attorney-general carry out his role as overall supervisor of Customs as well as answer questions about its operations, she said. She added: 'I would see positive advantages from a number of points of view of the relationship being a bit closer, better articulated and with a more regular channel of communication.'

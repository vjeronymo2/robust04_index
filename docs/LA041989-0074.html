			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The leader of Czechoslovakia's Communist Party said there will be no  rehabilitation of Alexander Dubcek, who led the 1968 "Prague Spring"  liberalization campaign that was crushed by Soviet tanks. "We don't intend any  political rehabilitation or return of Alexander Dubcek to political activity,"  Czechoslovak leader Milos Jakes told reporters in Moscow after meeting with  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The return of Dubcek might be  misunderstood and could "lead to instability," he said. The Czech Communist  Party lags behind Hungary and Poland in adopting reforms modeled on Gorbachev's  restructuring campaign, but Jakes said it is changing at its own pace.  </P></p>

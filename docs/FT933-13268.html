			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Forte seeks buyer for Harvester chain FORTE, the hotels group, confirmed yesterday that it had begun to seek buyers for its Harvester restaurant chain. If no suitable buyer is found by the autumn, the group might either extend the brand, currently based predominantly in the south-east of England, throughout the UK or put the business into a joint venture. Forte is believed to be looking for a price in excess of the Pounds 120m mentioned in some reports. It is also thought to be interested in selling its stake in the UK Kentucky Fried Chicken business. This is run in a joint venture with Pepsico, which is seen as the most likely buyer of the Forte stake.</p>

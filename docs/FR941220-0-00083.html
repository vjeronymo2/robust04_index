			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Concerning user fees, the Department has taken no action in the Final Rule. Concerning the ``single occupation'' LCA filing requirement, the Department has carefully considered the comments and its own program experience and has concluded that_without any significant additional burden for employers_the proposed provision, combined with other clarifications in this Final Rule, such as changing the LCA validity period (item 1.d below) and LCA filing dates (item 4.d below), will promote the Department's desired result: a truer indication of valid job openings. Therefore, the proposal is adopted as it appeared in the NPRM. However, concerning the ``single region'' LCA filing requirement, the Department has concluded, based on program experience and the comments on the NPRM, that it is possible to achieve the Department's goals (under statutory obligations) without modifying the Interim Final Rule's provisions permitting the employer to file the LCA with the ETA regional office having jurisdiction over the initial place of employment if the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant is to be employed sequentially in various places in more than one ETA regional jurisdiction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Notification <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (See &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .734(a)(2).)&blank;Section 212(n)(1)(C) of the INA requires that an employer seeking to hire an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant shall notify, at the time of filing the application, the bargaining representative of its employees of the filing of the labor condition application or, if there is no bargaining representative, post notice of filing in conspicuous locations at the place of employment. 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(1)(C). The interim final regulations at &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .730(h)(1) implement this statutory requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the course of investigations under this program, the Wage and Hour Division has found that some employers have made false statements regarding wages and worksite locations and have failed to fulfill the obligations attested on the applications (for example, by not paying the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants the rate specified). As a means of curbing such abuses, the Department proposed that employers also be required to provide to each H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant a copy of the labor condition application, no later than the date the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant reports to the place of employment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the 29 commenters on this issue, 26 supported the proposal. Several suggestions as to the appropriate timing of the notice to the H&hyph;1B workers were made by commenters: the employer should be allowed 10 days to meet this requirement; the employer could fulfill the requirement by providing the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant a copy of the certified LCA; the employer should comply with this requirement at the time the visa petition is filed, before the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant reports for work; and the employer should have the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant sign the notification. One commenter opposing the proposal said that the notice should be provided only if the nonimmigrant requests it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful consideration of the comments and the Department's program experience, the Department is promulgating this proposal as it appeared in the NPRM, in order to better assure the protections intended by Congress and to better safeguard workers (both foreign and domestic) against abuses by employers. The Department is of the view that notification at the time the H&hyph;1B worker begins work and receives other employment related documents, such as tax withholding and I&hyph;9 information, is the most appropriate time to provide the copy of the LCA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A further clarification of the regulation, based on program experience, is being made in recognition of abuses and to better assure the protections of workers which Congress intended the notice requirement to achieve. The Department has become aware that some employers which place H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants at new worksites within areas covered by existing LCA's have failed to fulfill their LCA obligations, but, because no notices were posted at the new worksites, the adversely affected workers were not informed of the LCA standards or of their own rights to examine certain documents and to file complaints. The Department recognizes that it could take the position that an employer may employ H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants only at worksites where notice had been given, and therefore could require an employer to take two steps before placing H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants at a new worksite within the same area of intended employment: post a notice  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  file a new LCA. However, such a dual requirement appears to the Department to be burdensome. The protections intended by Congress can be afforded by having a notice posted by the employer at each new worksite within the same area of intended employment at the time the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants are sent there to work, without the employer being required to file new LCA's. The Final Rule, therefore, imposes a less burdensome but equally worker-protective standard, by providing that the employer shall provide such worksite notices on the first day of work by an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant at that worksite which will remain posted for at least ten days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A clarification of the regulation, based upon program experience, is also being made in recognition of potential abuses with regard to the timing of an employer's provision of notice of filing an LCA. The Department has become aware of confusion and potential adverse effects in situations in which employers provide the required notice of filing the application to the bargaining representative, or to its employees by posting at the place of employment, considerably in advance of the date the application is filed ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> six months prior to filing). In order to alleviate confusion and to better assure the achievement of Congressional intent that U.S. workers who will be working side-by-side with H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants be notified of the employer's intent and their ability to file complaints if they believe violations have occurred, the Final Regulation requires that notice, provided by the employer under the fourth labor condition statement, must be provided on or within 30 days prior to the date the labor condition application is filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c.

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Body Shop dispute in Singapore BODY SHOP International, the retail group which operates largely through franchisees, has become embroiled in a dispute with the head franchisee of its Singapore operation, where the group has 11 of its near 1,000 shops. It has been in Singapore for 10 years. Ms Anne Downer, the head franchisee in Singapore, has issued a writ against Body Shop in London claiming damages after Body Shop instituted proceedings in Singapore. Body Shop claims Ms Downer's right to operate the Body Shop business in Singapore, and in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan, has been terminated. Body Shop said yesterday that it disputed all of Ms Downer's claims. One analyst said that Singapore was insignificant in group terms. The dispute echoes an episode concluded in July last year when Body Shop won back control of six of its UK shops operated by Ms Pauline Rawle, a franchisee. In its international operations, Body Shop has in recent years been pursuing a policy of moving to have each country's franchise operated locally rather than grouping countries together.</p>

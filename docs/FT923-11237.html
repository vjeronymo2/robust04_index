			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / How To Spend It: The complete work of Shaker The Shaker shop has produced an enchanting little book illustrating the full range of Shaker furniture. Half catalogue, half Shaker manual, the booklet is illustrated in the simple naif style of Henry Lapp, an Amish craftsman, and captures the simple lines and pleasing proportions of the pieces, from four-poster beds and wardrobes to hanging shelves and lengths of pegrail. The booklet is beautifully produced and the text perfectly illuminates the connection between the austere beauty of the furniture and the community from which it came. Pounds 3 from Shaker, 25 Harcourt Street, London W1H 1DT.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondents Ana Patricia Candiani and </F> Rosi Ahuaxi Vazquez for the "ACIR Radio News" newscast]    [Excerpts] Today the country focuses its attention on  Chiapas State, where Dr. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon paid a  surprise visit. He met in San Cristobal de las Casas with  Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation  in Chiapas State, as well as with mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz.  [passage omitted]    In a surprise and brief visit, the agenda of which was a  secret right up until the last minute, Ernesto Zedillo visited  Chiapas, in the first stages of his political campaign, a  campaign begun by Luis Donaldo Colosio. He arrived at 1000 in  San Cristobal de las Casas, where he was interviewed by local  radio station XEWM Radio 640. There he reiterated his statement  made in Tuxtla Gutierrez as he deplaned: Peace, harmony, and  unity are essential to reaching agreements that fully satisfy  those with fair demands. Ernesto Zedillo was clear when he was  asked whether he would be willing to talk to the EZLN. He  replied: The federal government is responsible first; only if  the government asks me would I participate in that dialogue.    [Begin Zedillo recording] The negotiations are without a  doubt the government's responsibility, specifically through the  president's peace commissioner. I have said that I am willing  to talk in good faith with any Mexican citizen. If at any time  the peace commissioner, the government, considers it important  that I attest or guarantee that I will honor the government's  commitments when I take office, I will do so with pleasure. [end  recording]    Ernesto Zedillo admitted that the country's future is at  risk  and that our future will depend on what we do today. Poverty,  dropouts, and exclusions should anger us and serve as incentive  to decisively fight these issues.    After Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon's interview with this  local radio station, he met privately with Bishop Samuel Ruiz of  San Cristobal de las Casas. This private conversation lasted  about 40 minutes. He spoke about this conversation at a news  conference in the main park.    [Begin Zedillo recording] It was a conversation where I  basically reiterated to him what I already said publicly this  morning on the radio regarding my wish that permanent peace and  reconciliation be achieved soon here in Chiapas. [end recording]    Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon walked through the main park  in  San Cristobal de las Casas, where people declared their demands  for peace because they have lived through war.    Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon also answered some reporters'  questions. One question was on whether a campaign against  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari exists. He simply replied  the president deserves esteem, respect, and consideration.  Regarding economic pressures, he said that conditions look  promising. Luis Donaldo Colosio's death led to a climate of  uncertainty, but as the days pass we will regain confidence.    Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon arrived in San Cristobal de  las  Casas with a reinforced personal escort. At the end of his  interview in the main park in San Cristobal de las Casas, he  returned to Tuxtla Gutierrez, where he will board a private  flight to Mexico City.</p>

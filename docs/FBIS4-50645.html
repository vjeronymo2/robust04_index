			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 20 (AFP)--Britain and China failed  yet again Friday to agree on the financing of Hong Kong's  mammoth new airport, although both sides claimed they were  making some headway.    "The fact is, there are still questions in the Chinese  minds," the chief British negotiator, Hugh Davies, told  reporters after the first meeting of the Joint Liaison Group  airport committee in nine months.    "We're disappointed. We would like to have seen more  progress," he said. "But on the whole, we found the atmosphere  positive, and I think we're on the right track."    His Chinese counterpart, Guo Fengmin, was somewhat more  upbeat, saying the two sides had made "positive progress" and  even found common ground on some issues, which he did specify.    "But we still have work to do," Guo said, indicating a  decision is not yet in sight on how to pay for the 20.3 billion  U.S. dollar Chek Lap Kok airport and related public works.    The new airport, off the outlying island of Lantao, is due  to  replace congested inner-city Kai Tak airport in 1997, when Hong  Kong reverts to China, and is one of the biggest public works  projects in the world today.    But although site preparation work is well under way,  Britain  and China have long been at loggerheads over the amount of debt  that should be raised to pay for the vast undertaking.    The issue has also been overshadowed by China's shrill  attacks on Governor Chris Patten's attempts to extend democracy  in Hong Kong, although Beijing has suggested in recent weeks  that it might separate the two issues.    Davies said Britain's fourth and latest financing proposal  --  which calls for 60 billion Hong Kong dollars (7.76 billion U.S.)  to be injected as equity from Hong Kong's bulging reserves --  was still very much alive.    "There are still various quesions within the overall  financing package that need to be resolved," he said, adding  that agreement could happen "rapidly" if the Chinese side  accepted Britain's terms.    More talks are to be held at the expert level, but no date  was set for another meeting of the airport committee, Davies  said.    He also said the airport issue was unlikely to come up at  the  next full meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, the  diplomatic body charged with hammering out the technical details  of Hong Kong's change of sovereignty.</p>

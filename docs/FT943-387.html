			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Weinberg to head 'vulture' fund - New York Life and St James's Place Capital create Pounds 100m venture Sir Mark Weinberg, one of the leading figures in the UK life industry, is to chair a new company with Pounds 100m capital to acquire life companies, close them to new business and manage their existing funds. The company is to be a joint venture with New York Life Worldwide, a subsidiary of the fourth largest life insurance company in the United States. It owns Windsor Life, which is already in this area of business in a smaller way, having acquired six life companies in the past ten years. When the plan was originally announced in November it was intended to link up with a bank or building society as a way into 'bancassurance' - the selling of financial products to bank or society customers through branch networks. This is now to be pursued separately. The main shareholders in the new company are St James's Place Capital, the investment company run by Sir Mark and Lord Rothschild, and New York Life, which is to transfer the closed fund business of Windsor Life. Each will have a 30 per cent stake, while Scottish Amicable will subscribe Pounds 10m, with other institutions expected to contribute the remaining Pounds 30m. Mr John Wybrew, the chairman of Windsor Life will be chief executive of the new company. He expected the first acquisition within the next six months or so. He thought small and medium-sized mutually-owned insurers would be most vulnerable, since they would suffer from their lack of access to capital. The position of UK subsidiaries of foreign companies which have failed to achieve critical mass was also highlighted. The plan is a version of what is known in the life insurance sector as 'vulture life' because it depends on picking up life companies which cannot survive on their own, and living off the business they have already acquired. Combining the investments managed by separate companies should bring cost savings. Rising costs of meeting regulatory standards in selling financial products against a background of intensifying competition have led many life insurers to believe that the number of life companies open to new business will sharply fall over the next few years. Earlier this week, an analysis by Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the actuaries, suggested that within a decade 40 per cent of life insurers would be struggling to remain open.</p>

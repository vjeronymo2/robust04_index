			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: State Street gains Australian branch licence State Street Bank and Trust Company, the US custodian bank, has been granted a branch banking licence in Australia. State Street, the largest custody services provider in Australia, is the third overseas bank to be granted a branch banking licence under the government's new foreign bank policy, and the first US bank. The government announced a liberalisation of foreign bank entry in 1992, in an effort to promote competition in the sector. Yesterday, Mr George Gear, the government's assistant treasurer, said the authorisation would allow State Street to provide cash management and foreign exchange services to custody clients in the Asia-Pacific regions and to expand the trade finance activities offered to small and medium-sized businesses. But its operations will be limited to wholesale banking. There has been growing demand for custody services - which include the safe-keeping and administration of share and bond portfolios for institutional clients - because of the strong growth in Australia's fund management industry.</p>

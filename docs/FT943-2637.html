			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / How To Spend It: Forever in fashion - Styles change but fiances still give diamonds It is nice to know that the ancient rite of the engagement ring, that abiding token that He gives to Her when his intentions are honourable, is still going strong. According to de Beers 96 per cent of brides receive an engagement ring of some sort. (What, I wonder, happens to the other 4 per cent and are their marriages any the worse for all that?) Of that 96 per cent, de Beers reports that more than three quarters include a diamond. Of course the matter of getting engaged these days is not approached with the same solemnity as it was in times gone by. EF Cushing summed up the prevailing attitudes of the day in an essay he wrote in 1926 on Culture and Good Manners in the US. 'An engagement ring is a matter for serious thought on the part of the young man. The best that his pocket can afford is what he desires and a ring that will please his fiancee's taste is even more important. Either by asking her directly or from someone who knows her preferences he finds out her desire and tries in every way to fulfil it. The solitaire diamond as large and perfect as he could afford has for many years been the standard engagement ring.' The days when Richard Burton gave Elizabeth Taylor the 33 carat emerald-cut Krupp diamond ('I've never been so left-handed in my life,' declared la Taylor) seem to belong to a vanished world but nevertheless those who can afford it still seem to like their diamonds large. Claudia Schiffer, one of the jet-set breed of so-called super models is sporting a flawless five carat brilliant-cut diamond designed by Bulgari bought for her by her fiance, magician David Copperfield. When David Bowie married Iman he gave her a wonderful canary yellow emerald-cut diamond with two white triangular diamonds either side. Cindy Crawford has a diamond-set gold band from Richard Gere. Among the bright young things, the fad ring is Cartier's Ellipse - a thick yellow 18 carat gold band, it costs Pounds 995 when set with semi-precious stones and Pounds 21,200 when set with a 1.5 carat solitaire diamond. When the engagement follows its proscribed course and ends at the altar, then a plain thick yellow wedding ring can be added to make a matching pair. On average, British men are really rather mean. The average price paid is about Pounds 350. De Beers suggests that a young man these days ought to think in terms of spending about a month's salary (in Japan the average is about three months salary and in America two months) - after all think what a girl spends on a wedding dress which she wears merely for half a day whereas the ring is meant to last forever. A collection of 60 diamond rings by some of Britain's best designers, ranging in price from Pounds 835 to Pounds 5,000 is on display at Jess James, 3 Newburgh Street, London W1. The really tricky thing is what do you do when love turns sour. For those who mind about correct behaviour the rule is: if He breaks it off, She gets to keep it. If She breaks it off, then strictly speaking she should return it. But you could, I suppose, always follow the advice of the inimitable Zsa Zsa Gabor. When asked by a friend whose engagement had been broken off if she should return the ring, she replied 'by all means give back the ring - just make sure you keep the diamond'. Diamond Engagement Ring Collection is on at Jess James until September 22. It moves to Hamilton &amp; Inches in Edinburgh from September 23 to October 3 then to Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Chester, Bedford, Aberdeen, Lichfield, Blackpool, Bath and back to London</p>

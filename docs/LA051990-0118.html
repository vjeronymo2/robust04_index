			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> SPACE AVAILABLE IN OLD COURT BUILDING  </P> <P> With construction of a new Courthouse under way, the Municipal Court building  on Cochran Street in Simi Valley will soon be available for other uses.  </P> <P> The city is accepting proposals from government and nonprofit groups until June  15 for alternate uses of about half of the 8,000-square-foot building.  </P> <P> The new Courthouse should be completed in November, and space in the Cochran  Street building will be available after that, said Bob Heitzman, the city's  deputy city manager.  </P> <P> The Simi Valley Police Department, located next door to the Courthouse, plans  to use about half the building for office space. The move will "allow us to  expand our Police Department a little bit," Heitzman said.  </P> <P> The areas still available for use include the courtroom and other office space.  </P> <P> Although no proposals have been submitted yet, Heitzman said, several agencies  have shown an interest in the space.  </P> <P> The county's Historical Society and Mental Health Department and the Red Cross  are among those interested in acquiring the office space. Heitzman said a  performing arts facility has also been proposed.  </P> <P> Although the county is not requiring that groups pay rent for the facility,  Heitzman said, the amount of rent a group offers to pay will be one of the  city's considerations in choosing who will occupy the space.

A premium of 0.2 per cent is to be added to the credit rates when fixing at bid. Interest rates may not be fixed for more than 120 days. SDR-based rates of interest are the same for all currencies but must be used only for the OECD-defined poor countries. The SDR-based rate was most recently changed on July 15 to 6.85 per cent. It will again be subject to change on January 15 1994.</p>

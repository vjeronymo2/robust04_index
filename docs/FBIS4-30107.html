			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, a great heyday has unfolded in our country,  unprecedented in the 5,000-year long history.    Our fatherland has turned into a socialist power with  invincible national strength because the revolutionary party has  been strengthened and developed, and world-class changes have  been achieved in all sectors--political, economic, cultural, and  military--under the party's leadership.    In June 1964, our people came to usher in the new era of  this  proud history because they were blessed again with having  another leader [suryong] by upholding the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il at the head of the party and the revolution.    Under the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader, the  party's leadership role has been extraordinarily consolidated,  and the party work has been carried out in close tandem with the  economic work over the past 30 years. As a result, in  accordance with pushing for the economic construction and  national defense building, we have seen the successful  accomplishments of the Seven-Year Plan, which had been carried  out until 1970; of the Six-Year Plan from 1971 to 1976; of the  Second Seven-Year Plan from 1978 to 1984; and of the Third  Seven-Year Plan from 1987 to 1993.    The implementation of the four grand long-range plans has  unfolded the heyday of our era which is shining with the  esteemed name of Comrade Kim Chong-il, and has displayed to the  whole world the formidable might and invincibility of the  socialist fatherland in which the leader [suryong], the party,  and the masses are marching forward in singlehearted unity.    Our self-supporting national economy has endlessly been  strengthened and developed on the basis of its own firm  foundation. The industrial production had increased by more than  one and a half times in each period of the plan.    The industrial production increased by 3.3 times during the  Seven-Year Plan period; by 2.2 times during the Six-Year Plan  period as of the end of August 1975 when we achieved the goal  ahead of schedule by one year and four months; by 2.2 times  during the Second Seven-Year Plan period; and by 1.5 times  during the Third Seven-Year Plan period.    These great achievements, which have been made for the past  30 years, are precious fruitions of the leadership of the  revolution and construction by the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il--a great politician, a genius of creation and  construction, and an ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant  commander--who has with far-sighted clear-mindedness,  outstanding revolutionary sweep, matchless mettle, and  extraordinary determination. Herein lie the immortal  achievements of the outstanding leader [yongdoja] who has added  bright luster to Korea in the whole world.    The 30 year-long period until today since the dear comrade  leader began leading the party work has been one in which the  most glorious and brilliant era has unfolded in the annals of  the Korean revolution, and one of great creations and changes in  which Korea unprecedentedly shines in the whole world throughout  the 5,000-year old history of our nation.    Our people will brilliantly accomplish the revolutionary  cause of chuche along the single road to loyalty forever by  cherishing deep in their hearts the greatest national dignity  and pride of having established a socialist power in which they  neither fear nor envy anything in the world, while upholding the  great leader [widaehan yongdoja] at the head of the party and  the revolution and following his seasoned leadership.</p>

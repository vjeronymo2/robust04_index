			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wheat futures up after US report Wheat prices rallied yesterday at the Chicago Board of Trade as traders responded to US government forecasts of smaller world wheat production and improved near-term export prospects for US wheat. Wheat futures for December delivery were up 4 1/2 cents a bushel in midday trading. In its monthly crop report, the US Department of Agriculture reduced its world wheat output estimate to 541.95m tonnes, from an earlier forecast of 546.1m. The agency also trimmed its estimate of US wheat production, largely on deteriorating prospects for the US spring wheat crop. The USDA cut its spring wheat production estimate to 564m bushels, from last month's forecast of 605m. US Durum wheat production will jump to 98m bushels, up nearly 40 per cent from last year, reducing the need for imports and taking the pressure off a trade dispute between the US and Canada. Traders said US wheat export prospects were also improving, with Pakistan and Egypt making purchase inquiries for wheat this week. As expected, the USDA forecast bin-busting harvests for US maize and soyabeans, in a remarkable recovery from last year's disastrous crops. Given favourable weather conditions US farmers should harvest a near-record 9.2bn bushels of maize this fall, and a record 2.3bn bushels of soyabeans, the government said. The estimates, the first of the season for the USDA, fell near traders' expectations. The agency also boosted its export and feed use figures for soyabeans, causing futures prices to move higher.</p>

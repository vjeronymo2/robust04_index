			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: BellSouth buys 22.5% of cable television operator BELLSOUTH, one of the US regional telephone companies, yesterday secured a foothold in the cable television business by agreeing a Dollars 250m deal that will give it a 22.5 per cent stake in Prime Management, Texas-based operator of the Prime Cable service. The deal echoes yesterday's much bigger merger between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc by allowing BellSouth to expand beyond its telephone and wireless communication operations into cable services and interactive entertainment. BellSouth, based in Atlanta, Georgia, has 19m telephone subscribers across nine south-eastern states of the US, while Prime's cable systems serve more than 500,000 customers in US markets including Houston, Chicago and Las Vegas. In exchange for its stake in Prime, BellSouth will lend the company Dollars 250m, which Prime will put towards a Dollars 450m recapitalisation of Community Cable Television, a Las Vegas-based cable operator in which Prime has a stake. Community Cable, with more than 203,000 cable connections, owns Hospitality Network, which provides interactive television services in 70,000 hotel rooms nationwide. BellSouth's financial backing should enable Prime to accelerate the growth of its cable services, while BellSouth will gain from the opportunities to feed its telephone services through Prime's cable networks in new geographical markets. Mr William Reddersen, BellSouth's recently-appointed senior vice-president in charge of broadband strategies, said: 'This is another significant step in preparing BellSouth to capitalise on the emerging opportunities in interactive television, consumer entertainment and the convergence of the communications and cable industries.' The deal is not expected to affect BellSouth's reported interest in joining QVC Network in its bid for Paramount Communications. However, it was unclear yesterday whether there would still be a role for BellSouth following Bell Atlantic's involvement in the bid through its takeover of Tele-Communications Inc, a QVC ally.</p>

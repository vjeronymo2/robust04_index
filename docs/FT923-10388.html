			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Fears of intervention remain THE DOLLAR recovered ground against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday as fears of central bank intervention continued to keep the US currency off its lows, writes James Blitz. On a quiet day of trading, with almost no corporate activity, the dollar rose a pfennig from its previous close to DM1.4840. Fears that the Federal Reserve might intervene in the market to keep the dollar from falling below DM1.45 continued to push the dollar higher. The currency was also boosted by rallies in the US bond and equity markets. Rumours about US and German policy towards the dollar continued to affect the market. A suggestion circulated during the afternoon that Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, was planning a statement that Germany did not want to see the dollar lower. Although the statement never materialised, it did help the dollar break resistance at DM1.4750. In New York the US unit eased back from the London close to end at DM1.4815. The dollar's rise against European currencies meant that the yen had a better day's trading against the D-Mark. The Japanese currency had fallen back in recent days, following the Bank of Japan's decision to cut its discount rate by  1/2 percentage point. Dealers also said the market is starting to turn its attention to the possibility of BoJ intervention directly in D-Mark/yen trading, which could limit D-Mark strength in coming days. The yen closed at Y86.22 against the D-Mark, up from a previous Y86.53. Against the dollar, the yen was softer at Y128.00 compared with Y127.50 previously, but in New York firmed to Y127.81. Sterling finished slightly firmer against the D-Mark at DM2.8450, after a previous close of DM2.8430. However, the pound's divergence from the strongest currency in the EMS grid, the Portuguese escudo, led to suggestions that the Bank of Portugal had intervened in the market, buying sterling, to keep the two currencies within their permitted divergence of 6.18 percentage points. That intervention could not be confirmed yesterday. But one head of foreign exchange at an investment bank said the UK authorities could become concerned by the widening differential between the pound and the Spanish peseta. Yesterday the differential was at 5.93 percentage points. The Italian lira rallied against the D-Mark yesterday morning after the Italian parliament approved by an ample majority the government's measures to cut the budget deficit. The resignation of the foreign trade minister 28 days into the Italian government's life had a negative effect on the currency in the afternoon, but the lira closed at L755.4 to the D-Mark, up from L756.2.</p>

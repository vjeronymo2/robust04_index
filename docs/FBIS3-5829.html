Its current down-slide is mainly due to a temporary  adjustment process. Many partners have been forced to sell  their right to [word indistinct]. This is due to measures  instituted by Bank Negara, the Central Bank, to curb speculative  inflow of funds.    Most foreign currency payers had been buying huge amounts of  Malaysian currency given its high interest rate and because they  wanted to gain by investing from the booming stock exchange.  The solid fundamentals and confidence in the Malaysian economy  had never been stronger. It is therefore not surprising that  the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange performed extremely well. It  recorded a volume of 107.8 billion shares in volume valued at  387.3 billion ringgit in 1993. This was unprecedented and  surpassed even the total volume and value of shares traded over  the past 20 years.    What happened was that funds flood in significantly, putting  extreme pressure on the liquidity in the banking system and  pressure on interest rate. Therefore, the Central Bank had to  intervene to bring about stability in the financial system. Of  course, mopping up the excess liquidity in the bank system was a  costly affair for Bank Negara. However, had it not been done  the price of inaction would have been even more damaging. It  would have resulted in runaway inflation. Therefore, Bank  Negara's recent spate of measures are to ensure that funds only  flow in for genuine investment purposes. The move is also vital  in ensuring the country's economic growth and stability.    These measures are long-term and should not be construed as  moves to further regulate the economy. But at the same time, it  does not go against the principles of liberalization, which  Malaysia opposes. But being a small economy, there has to be  certain amount of protection of the local currency. It cannot  be left entirely to global market forces. This is because there  are companies large enough which can struggle against the  ringgit and in the process disrupt the steady growth of the  economy. After all, it is the rule of the Central Bank to  maintain price stability by keeping a check on inflation.    Economic growth is meaningless if accompanied by too high an  inflational rate. Therefore, Bank Negara should be lauded for  its cautious policy [word indistinct]. The result can be seen  the government being able to record an overall balanced budget  in 1993 [as heard]. The Central Bank has always proved a guiding  hand in moving the economy towards a more sustainable growth  fund. It is in this light that foreign institutions should see  the role of Bank Negara and the measures it is taking. After  all both Malaysians and non-Malaysians alike stand to gain from  the continuous prosperity of the country. Its future depends on  the ability to strike a fine balance between growth and  stability. And Bank Negara has done a fine job in achieving  both.</p>

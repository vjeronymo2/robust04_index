			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Technology center -- A Tuesday story incorrectly reported that the San Diego  city Planning Department recommended against a 56.4-acre research campus on  Torrey Pines Mesa. The department recommended approving the La Jolla Pines  Technology Centre -- despite findings that it would add to traffic congestion,  air pollution and the fouling of water in Los Penasquitos Lagoon -- because the  project would promote job opportunities and encourage the development of  facilities for research in the life sciences.  </P></p>

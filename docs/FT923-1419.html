			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Ford's short-time working extended FORD, Britain's leading vehicle manufacturer, is to extend short-time working at its three British assembly plants at least until the end of next month in response to disappointing sales in the UK and weakening demand from export markets. It has also reduced output at its assembly plants at Saarlouis and Cologne in Germany as well as its Spanish plant at Valencia, while extending short-time working at its Belgian plant at Genk. The company has already warned that it sees no sign of improvement in UK new car demand and 'no indication of any real recovery before mid 1993.' It has also lowered sales forecasts for several other markets including Italy, Spain and France. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, yesterday welcomed the cut in UK interest rates as 'a prudent first step'. The reduction should 'help to stabilise consumer confidence after the turbulence of last week', he said. Further cuts would be welcome if they could be achieved 'without triggering too rapid a fall in sterling'. Ford's assembly plants at Dagenham, Essex, and Halewood, Merseyside, together with its Southampton van plant, have been on short-time working for much of the time since the summer shutdown. The plants will in effect move to three-day weeks next month. Ford of Britain said yesterday that about 10,000 workers in the UK would be affected by the cuts next month which would reduce production by about 12,000 vehicles. For four weeks from the end of this month, Ford will work a four-day week at its Halewood plant, which produces the Escort-Orion range, by eliminating the single Friday shift. There will be no output in the final week of October. At the Dagenham plant, which produces the Fiesta and which has been exporting more than half of its output, the plant will be on a three-day week for five weeks from next Monday. In the UK, Rover has also introduced a four-day week on its Rover 200/400 assembly line at its plant in Longbridge, Birmingham, until the week beginning October 26, cutting production by 7,000 cars. Mini and Metro lines are on a three-day week until November, cutting output by 4,000 cars.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Guarded optimism at Yorklyde Yorklyde, the Huddersfield-based woollen and worsted cloth manufacturer, reported profits of Pounds 1.52m pre-tax for the 12 months to January 31. The outcome - down from Pounds 1.82m last time - came on turnover ahead 14 per cent to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 9.92m). Mr Charles Brook, chairman, said the 'satisfactory' result reflected a period of severe recession. There was guarded optimism of an upturn in trading conditions, although this was likely to be gradual, he said. Earnings per share dipped from 25.2p to 21.2p. The final dividend is held at 5.7p for a maintained total of 9.7p.</p>

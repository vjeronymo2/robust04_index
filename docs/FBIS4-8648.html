			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Robert Krasowski: "A Vetoing Lech Walesa?"] </F>   [Text] Recently, President Lech Walesa has been using his  veto power more and more frequently. We asked some politicians  to assess the way he has been availing himself of this right.  According to Jan Maria Rokita, it is a "veto by surprise,"  while Tomasz Nalecz describes Walesa's vetoes as "provocative  and exacerbating," and Ludwik Dorn uses the term "destructive."    The preannounced veto by the president regarding the  electoral law to gmina [small administrative units] councils,  would already be the 11th veto in Lech Walesa's term of office.  The greatest emotions were stirred by two vetoes of an  electoral law in 1991 (both of which were overruled), a veto  regarding the law on radio and television in 1991 (not  overruled), and one regarding a law on retirement pensions for  uniformed officials in 1993 (not overruled).    In recent weeks, the president has definitely reminded us of  his veto prerogative more often. He vetoed a neo-popiwek  [wage-controlling] statute by making the claim that it tries to  interfere with the level of earnings in private companies, and  that the statute violates the law by granting the government a  parliamentary privilege to set taxes. For a long time, the  president also suggested the possibility of not signing the  Budget Law because of its failure to implement the breakthrough  announced by the now governing coalition during the elections.  But once he finally approved of the budget, the very same day  he announced he will veto an electoral law for self-governmental  elections.    Many politicians of the governing coalition sharply  criticized the moves by the president, saying that Walesa was  driven by a hostility toward the coalition and his goal was to  achieve political destabilization. But the governing coalition  failed to gather the necessary two-thirds majority required to  overrule the veto on neo-popiwek. Many papers in turn published  articles in which efforts were made to establish whether the  president is violating the legal order by his measures.    According to Lech Falandysz -- deputy chief of the  President's Office and the Belvedere's main legal expert -- the  president is simply using his powers, while not violating the  law at the same time.    "Some politicians should first read the Small Constitution  and only then start making judgments on the president's  measures" -- Falandysz says. "Besides, the president will not  allow anybody to tell him how to use his powers."    In the view of Falandysz, to meet the demand that the  president make his reservations known before a law is adopted by  the Sejm and, in this way, try to influence the legislative  process in parliament, would mean an elimination of veto power  altogether.    "The president would have to fight for his ideas on laws in  parliamentary commissions and he would also be accused of  interfering with parliament proceedings" -- Falandysz states.  <H5>  It Would Be Unacceptable in the United States </H5>   Center Accord Deputy Chairman Ludwik Dorn: Aside  from Russia, the only president with veto power is the U.S.  President. If he has any reservations regarding a bill, he does  not wait until it is passed by Congress. Representatives of the  presidential administration simply suggest their protests --  without using the media as a go-between -- and then they examine  the configuration of forces in Congress.    Only after it turns out that the congressional majority does  not want a compromise, the president makes a public statement  that in case the bill is passed, he will use his veto power.  But even in such cases, there is usually a meeting between the  president and congressional leaders, and the dispute most often  ends in a compromise. But if a veto is indeed used, then the  whole thing is of dramatic dimensions.    What is important in that practice, is the complete  accountability of both sides, the awareness of what it is that  the other side wants, and also the fact that neither side is  eager to put the opponent against the wall. Simply put, nobody  regards the dispute as a zero-sum game. What happened with the  Budget Law in Poland would be unthinkable in the United States.    In Walesa's case, I do not recall any occasion in the past  where he would make an advanced warning that he may veto a law.  He applies his veto power in a destructive manner.    After all, the truth is that Walesa is not making use of his  prerogatives, the men and the resources at his disposal, to  influence the contents of laws. So it is very clear that he  does not care about specific issues but only about strengthening  his own position.  <H5>  Presidential `No' is Just Like the President Himself </H5>   Jan Maria Rokita, deputy chairman of the Democratic  Union Parliamentary Club: Situations arising in the United  States show that over there, a "veto by surprise" -- which  President Lech Walesa often applies -- is an unknown phenomenon.    But Walesa has some arguments in his favor. First of all, in  Poland there is no formula for the president's participation in  parliament's legislative proceedings during which he could  submit remarks on draft laws being prepared. The Belvedere's  representatives take part in the commissions' proceedings only  when presidential initiatives are debated.    Second, it also happens that the legislative process itself  is conducted "by surprise." Some laws are adopted all of a  sudden and at an insane speed. The reforms of the state are  going on and the legal system is undergoing constant changes, as  well. But what speaks against Walesa, is the evaluation of the  totality of the style in which he executes his office. It is  clear to any observer of the political scene, that Walesa likes  to play the card of uncertainty in his position -- hence the  proverbial "I am in favor and even against." I am convinced  that even if the president could actually participate in  legislative proceedings, he would definitely not use his right,  anyway. Simply put, the current situation is much more  comfortable to him. The president likes to catch people by  surprise and attack unexpectedly.    Besides, presidential vetoes are becoming an instrument of  Walesa's political confrontation with the Democratic Left  Alliance, and recently also with the Polish Peasant Party. If  Walesa had decided to veto the Budget Law, then one would have  been able to accuse him of initiating brawls. But since he did  not veto it after all, a question mark remains in that respect.  So I would not make an accusation like that. It is probably  true anyway, but it would be hard to find facts to support it.  That is because when vetoing the neo-popiwek law and the new  local electoral law, Walesa had genuine social support. In the  case of neo-popiwek, he was supported by the opposition, and in  the case of the electoral law -- by self-government groups.  <H5>  The Vetoes Are Provocative, Exacerbating </H5>   Tomasz Nalecz, press spokesman of the Union of Labor's  Deputies Club: I am very critical of the way Lech Walesa  has been using his presidential veto. I think that when using  certain instruments, one should observe rules effective for the  entire machinery. Otherwise, you break the machinery.    According to the Small Constitution, the day-to-day ruling  of  the country is in the hands of the government, with the  parliament adopting laws, and the president serving as an  umpire. This means that the president is supposed to get  involved at a point when the machinery malfunctions. Under this  concept, a presidential veto should happen once in a blue moon.  But what Lech Walesa is doing, is turning the right of veto  into an instrument of day-to-day governing of the country. The  way he applies the right to veto leads to political cacophony.  It amounts to playing two melodies at the same time.    As is well known, being a Sejm deputy for the Union of  Labor,  I am not an enthusiast of the current coalition. But one cannot  paralyze the functioning of the chief institutions of state  power. But Walesa gets an itch every time he comes across an  important law -- this applies not only to those laws which are  supposed to determine something decades into the future, but  also to those which pertain to quite immediate issues.    That is why one can regard the presidential vetoes as  provocative and exacerbating. President Walesa has made a  decision to play his political game. That conflicts with my  concept of the Presidency.    This reminds me of a story: An elderly fellow is carrying a  big sack and every once in a while he stops and stirs around in  the sack with a stick. When asked what he is doing, he responds  that he is carrying a sack full of rats and he stirs in the sack  so the rats won't bite him on the back. "Then they bite one  another" -- explains the man.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / US trade deficit up in October The US trade deficit rose to Dollars 10.1bn (Pounds 6.5bn) in October, from a revised Dollars 9.4bn in September, roughly in line with market projections. The deficit for the first 10 months rose to Dollars 90.5bn, a 42 per cent increase from the equivalent period last year. The increase last month reflected a 0.8 per cent increase in imports and an erratic 0.6 per cent decline in exports, caused partly by a decline in exports of civilian aircraft. A deficit of Dollars 15bn on trade in goods was partially offset by a Dollars 4.9bn surplus on trade in services. There are signs, however, that the deficit is beginning to level off as economic growth accelerates in Europe and Japan, boosting demand for US exports. Averaged over three-month periods, the deficit has been stable at Dollars 9.5bn-Dollars 10bn since June. Many economists expect the deficit to contract next year, given the weakness of the dollar and the likelihood of slower US growth. The geographical distribution of the deficit remains a source of tension in Washington. Last month, the merchandise deficit with Japan rose to Dollars 6.7bn from Dollars 5.4bn. The overall merchandise deficit with Pacific Rim countries rose to Dollars 12.6bn, against Dollars 10.9bn.</p>

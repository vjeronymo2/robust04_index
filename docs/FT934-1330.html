			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Jaguar boosts output by 43% Jaguar has increased output by 43 per cent this year to about 29,500 cars from last year's 20,593. The 1992 figure was the lowest for 11 years. Following the cut of about 45 per cent in its UK workforce in 1991 and last year the fortunes of Jaguar, a subsidiary of Ford of the US, have improved markedly. Its UK workforce has been virtually unchanged at about 6,450. In contrast to much of the European car industry it has avoided short-time working this year and since August it has had significant overtime at its Coventry plants. Its worldwide retail sales have risen by about 24 per cent this year to between 27,500 and 28,000 from 22,475 last year, largely due to a rising US demand. Jaguar more than doubled its sales in the US in November to 1,356 from 616 in the same month a year ago, with about 70 per cent of its US business now based on leasing. The US is Jaguar's single most important market worldwide and its sales there increased 49 per cent in the first 11 months of the year to 11,358. The luxury carmaker has been in loss for five years in succession from 1989 to 1993, but the losses have been reduced significantly in recent months. Its operating losses in the first nine months of the year fell to Dollars 226m (Pounds 151.6m) from Dollars 300m in the same period a year earlier. Losses in the third quarter were reduced to Dollars 108m from Dollars 135m, but the third-quarter loss this year included a one-off charge of Dollars 65m for the closure of Venture Pressings, its joint venture with GKN. Jaguar is being increasingly integrated into Ford's European operations and next year production of the stamped body panels for Jaguar cars will be transferred from Venture Pressings to the Ford plant at Halewood, Merseyside, which has spare capacity.</p>

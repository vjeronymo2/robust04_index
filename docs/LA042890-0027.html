This day was to remind all of us that we  must do something to save our planet from destruction, perhaps by recycling  cans, plastics, glass.  </P> <P> In general, do not pollute.  </P> <P> On Tuesday morning I went out to get my paper and to my surprise found The  Times wrapped in a large plastic bag.  </P> <P> How can we save our world when large corporations, such as The Times, keep  right on polluting? How many thousands of these bags will be found in landfills  waiting hundreds of years to decompose?  </P> <P> DONNA PRIETTO  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

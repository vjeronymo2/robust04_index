			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Registration does not give architects a monopoly Sir, I nearly always enjoy Colin Amery's perceptive thoughts on architecture, which makes the polemicism of his article against the statutory registration of architects all the more puzzling ('Say yes to freedom', September 27) . The issue of statutory registration is simple. For more than 60 years it has offered the protection to the client and to the public that, when they commission an 'architect', they engage a man or woman trained and qualified to practise. If registration ends, anyone from anywhere within the European Community - plumber, plasterer, jobbing gardener or mini-cab driver - will be free to use the title. In whose interest is that? The profession is not a closed shop. Anyone can design a building, provided they do not call themselves an architect. It follows that there is no unfair monopoly. It is nonsense for Amery to say that the profession is being offered 'freedom'. No chains are being removed which currently constrain the architect from serving his clients. I agree with Colin Amery about the need for the highest possible architectural and environmental standards and that it is inevitable that some architects will fall short. But this is nothing whatever to do with statutory registration. I agree that the RIBA can do more to raise the quality of the profession. But the 'freedom' that Colin Amery offers, yet does not define, is irrelevant to such a role. The winning schemes of the prestigious Financial Times Architecture At Work award that Colin Amery organises suggest to me that he supports the wide range of today's architecture. But I wish he would redirect his attack on to the government and other commissioning agencies that have become so obsessed with the least cost without a thought for quality.

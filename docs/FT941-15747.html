			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Volatile trading hits Bromsgrove Interim profits at Bromsgrove Industries sagged as its operating divisions contended with volatile trading and continuing pressure on margins. The Birmingham-based specialist engineer announced pre-tax profits for the half year to September 30 of Pounds 3.14m (Pounds 4m); turnover expanded to Pounds 57.5m (Pounds 53.7m). Acquisitions contributed Pounds 3.67m to turnover and Pounds 672,000 to the pre-tax line. If non-recurring costs, amounting to Pounds 1.1m against Pounds 400,000 last time, are stripped out the disparity is less marked. Profits would have been Pounds 4.2m against Pounds 4.4m. At the trading level, the aerospace and medical and industrial divisions performed strongly while automotive and plastics were steady, but the marine and offshore and environmental divisions faced reduced demand. Overall operating margins fell from 10.3 per cent to 9.5 per cent. Gearing since the end of the first half has fallen from 69.8 per cent to 57 per cent and can be expected to fall further as Bromsgrove sells companies it now sees as peripheral to a plan for greater concentration of its interests. The group is seeking to create larger profit centres from a series of small but specialist engineering companies. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.65p, payable from fully diluted earnings of 3.18p (4.07p) per share.</p>

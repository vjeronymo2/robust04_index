			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Seaperfect to float with likely Pounds 50m value A company which claims to be one of the world's largest controlled producers of shellfish is hoping to come to the market later this year with an estimated value of about Pounds 50m. Seaperfect plans to raise approximately Pounds 20m through an institutional placing to fund the expansion of its scallop and clam farming activities. In May, the company raised Pounds 3m through a private placing with UK institutions. The company's product has attracted some well-known faces to the board. Mr Andre Bernard, former co-chairman of Eurotunnel, will become a non-executive director next month, and Sir David Orr, ex-chairman of Unilever and Inchcape, is non-executive chairman. Seaperfect was founded in 1988 by American-born Mr William Lord-Butcher, who made his fortune in the 1980s with the sale of his direct mail marketing business to a New York investment group. He said shellfish were the perfect follow-on to computers. 'We were looking for a species that was ready to be industrialised.' The company farms scallops and clams in the warm water regions of South Carolina, Florida and Chile, which Mr Lord-Butcher argues is an advantage when competing against the Japanese. On average, Seaperfect's Chilean-raised scallops take 15 to 17 months to mature, against three to seven years in Japan. The scallops and clams are mostly for export to Europe. Most of the shellfish eaten in Europe is wild produce caught by local fishermen trawling the sea or estuaries. However, Mr Lord-Butcher argues that health and safety concerns mean that commercial farming - where the environment is tested on a regular basis and harvesting and processing is strictly controlled - will become increasingly important. Seaperfect sells its scallops and clams to the catering and retail industry, before harvesting them from the field. They are bred in protected hatcheries and the larvae nursed until old and big enough to be put out to sea. Last year Seaperfect sold 15,000 scallops, or some 203 tonnes, by far its largest business. Mr Lord-Butcher is confident the group can more than double sales with the funds from a flotation.</p>

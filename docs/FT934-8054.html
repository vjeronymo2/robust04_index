			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Sedgwick up to Pounds 63.6m - Strong dollar brings substantial benefits SEDGWICK GROUP, the insurance broker, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 63.6m for the first nine months of 1993, compared with Pounds 55.8m for the same period of 1992. Earnings per share for the period were 8.5p, compared with a restated 7.8p. Brokerage and fee income and expenses both increased by 4 per cent, reflecting an improved underlying trend for the third quarter. Profits also benefited substantially from the strength of the dollar compared to 1992. Mr Sax Riley, chief executive, pointed to a positive performance in the US where brokerage and fee income rose by 5 per cent 'in spite of difficult market conditions'. On the other hand, conditions in the London market 'remain difficult, shortage of capacity being the main feature,' added Mr Riley. Brokerage and fee income rose to Pounds 551.2m (Pounds 465.3m). A fall in investment income to Pounds 33.2m (Pounds 37.8m) was partially offset by a reduction in interest payable to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 11.5m). Expenses rose to Pounds 509.7m (Pounds 435.7m). Operating profit increased to Pounds 74.7m (Pounds 67.4m). Share of associates' losses increased to Pounds 800,000 (Pounds 700,000). Insurance underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 200,000, compared with profits of Pounds 600,000.</p>

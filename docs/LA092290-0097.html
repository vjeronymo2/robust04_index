			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REGENTS MOVE AHEAD ON WEAPONS LAB CONTRACTS  </P> <P> The UC Board of Regents voted 13 to 3 Friday to begin negotiations for renewing  federal contracts to run two nuclear weapons laboratories. The university  system's relationship with the Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos national  laboratories has sparked strong opposition among faculty, students and peace  activists.  </P> <P> The no votes were cast by Regent Yori Wada, alumni representative Martha  Newkirk and student representative Jenny Doh. Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, an ex  officio regent, spoke against the laboratory contracts but left before the  vote, which was held at UCLA. Regent Yvonne Brathwaite Burke abstained.  </P> <P> Friday's action allows university officials to begin talks with the U.S.  Department of Energy on the renewal of the five-year contracts, which are set  to expire in 1992. Also involved is the Lawrence Berkeley facility on the UC  Berkeley campus, which performs federal research but no classified work.  </P></p>

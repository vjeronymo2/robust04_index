			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Credit losses up at Swedish co-op bank FORENINGSBANKEN, the Swedish co-operative bank, saw its operating loss rise to SKr1.35bn (Dollars 175m) last year from SKr907m, as credit losses rose to SKr3.50bn from SKr2.79bn. The bank said it would need to strengthen its capital base in the autumn through a new share issue, after its capital adequacy ratio fell to 8.1 per cent at the year-end. The government has announced the bank is entitled to state support through guarantees. Bad debts accounted for 3.8 per cent of total lending in 1992 and mainly related to real estate and small and medium-sized companies. Problem credits amounted to SKr8.9bn at the year-end. The bank said it expected to remain in the red this year, warning 'there is a substantial risk that loan losses will remain high'.</p>

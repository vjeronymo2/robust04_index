			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: SOUTH GATE;  </P> <P> EX-MANAGER TO GET $63,500 SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> The South Gate City Council has decided to pay $63,500 to former Administrator  Bruce Spragg, who was fired last month.  </P> <P> "In order to avoid any possibility (of a lawsuit), we negotiated," Mayor Robert  A. Philipp said after the council approved the severance settlement last  Friday.  </P> <P> The council also rescinded its Aug. 20 firing of Spragg, who then submitted his  resignation.  </P> <P> Spragg, 57, had been the city administrator for more than eight years at an  annual salary of $87,000 when he announced on Aug. 13 that he planned to retire  in March. The council then asked Spragg to resign by Aug. 17. He refused and  the council fired him.  </P> <P> William D. Cornett Jr., a former South Gate city administrator, has been called  out of retirement to head the city staff until a new administrator is named.  The search for a new administrator could take up to four months, Philipp said.  </P></p>

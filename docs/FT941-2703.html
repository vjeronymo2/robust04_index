			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Ron and Ollie's big falling-out: Jurek Martin tells how two American heroes found feet of clay Once they were inseparable, two conservatives locked together in a common cause. The young man would walk through walls and around the law for his boss, who returned the compliment by describing his acolyte as 'a hero.' This relationship is now in tatters. Inserting himself with vigour into the Virginia contest for a US senate seat, the most widely watched political race of the year, former President Ronald Reagan has rounded on former Lt-Col Oliver North and, in effect, called him a liar. Mr Reagan's intervention came as a letter solicited by an old friend, former Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, and was promptly released by the campaign of Mr North's rival for the Republican nomination, Mr James Miller, budget director in the Reagan White House. 'I do have to admit,' Mr Reagan wrote, 'that I am getting pretty steamed about statements coming from Oliver North. I never instructed him or anyone in my administration to mislead Congress on Iran-Contra matters or anything else. And I certainly didn't know anything about the Iran-Contra diversion  . and the private meetings he said he'd had with me just didn't happen.' Mr North, whose own conspiracies, freelance or not, consumed the US in Mr Reagan's second term, immediately saw another conspiracy. Citing threats to his life by Abu Nidal, the terrorist, as evidence of his loyalty, Mr North's faxed reply said the former president had been 'seriously and intentionally misinformed' about his service on the national security council, and meetings of the two did take place. Mr North's candidacy in Virginia is ferociously controversial and has been stoutly opposed by Senator John Warner, a Republican not up for re-election this year. If Mr North beats Mr Miller, as he has been favoured to do, he will face Senator Chuck Robb, the incumbent Democrat. Mr Robb is no stranger to recent controversy. He is a former Marine whose wife is the daughter of the late President Lyndon Johnson. The senator recently admitted, in a pastoral constituency letter, to conduct unbecoming in a married man, namely extra-marital affairs. Mr North, a self-appointed symbol of rectitude, loved this confession. His fondness for Mr Reagan's intervention is much less apparent.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Gold price rally runs out of steam THE GOLD market's cautious recovery following its sudden plunge a fortnight ago ran out of steam this week. Buyers were keen on Monday, as dollar weakness made the yellow metal relatively cheap in terms of other currencies, and the price climbed Dollars 4.75 to Dollars 342.20 a troy ounce, although gains were limited by reports of producer selling. At that point traders were suggesting that a rise to Dollars 342.80 an ounce might trigger short-covering by the US investment funds whose sell-off had been largely responsible for the preceding fall. But the thesis was never tested. In spite of the dollar's continuing slide gold met strong upside resistance on Tuesday amid concern about Australian selling encouraged by the fact that the Australian dollar was even weaker than the US currency. The gold price slid to Dollars 338.20 an ounce before fresh support emerged on Thursday, in spite of a upturn in the fortunes of the dollar. The support was underpinned by buying in strong currency areas, notably Germany, where it was estimated that demand for gold was running at about four times the 1991 level. By last night's close the price had recovered to Dollars 340 an ounce, up Dollars 2.55 on the week. The silver market, which got off fairly lightly when gold plummeted two week's ago, continued to lose ground this week, the cash price touching an 18-month low of 364.75 cents an ounce on Wednesday. Traders said silvers' apparent independence of the gold price trend underlined its new status as an industrial, rather than a precious, metal and attributed its fall to gloomy economic conditions. Cash silver closed at 371.5 cents an ounce, down 4.5 cents on the week. At the London Metal Exchange activity tended to be discouraged by the volatility of the foreign exchange markets. 'Investors won't commit themselves while there is the danger a sudden currency move will wipe out a profit or trigger a stop-loss order within seconds,' explained one trader. The biggest move was in the copper market, where the cash price fell Pounds 61.50 on the week to Pounds 1,257 a tonne as holders liquidated long positions. But the fall was heavily influenced by the dollar factor, which accounted for about Pounds 22 of the price movement. Another firm LME market was zinc. A threatened strike at Peru's Centromin metals group and a world stocks reduction in July, reported by the European Zinc Institute, encouraged the rise, which left the cash position Dollars 51 up on the week at Dollars 1,415 a tonne. But the main factor was developing fourth quarter supply tightness, which was reflected in a further widening in the cash premium over three months metal from Dollars 29.25 to Dollars 38.50 a tonne. A similar situation developing in the lead market resulted this week in a sharp narrowing in the cash discount against metals for delivery three months delivery. With the cash price rising Pounds 17.50 to Pounds 337.50 a tonne - in spite of the downward pressure of sterling's rise against the dollar - and the three months position falling slightly the cash discount shrank from Pounds 20.25 to Pounds 4 a tonne. Cocoa prices continued on their downward path as the only bullish factor in a heavily oversupplied market - dry weather in west African growing areas - was weakened by reports of thunder storms in the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer. The December position at the London Futures and Options Exchange ended at Pounds 628 a tonne, down Pounds 13 on the week. In contrast, coffee futures made modest extensions to last week's gains, with the November position closing yesterday at Dollars 760 a tonne, up Dollars 8 on the week. Dealers could offer no clear reason for the coffee market's recent steadiness beyond the fact that modest purchases by manufacturers had been roughly balancing light producer selling. Potential sellers may have been discouraged by the prospect, however faint, of real progress being made on a new International Coffee Agreement with price-stabilisation clauses at the International Coffee Organisation meeting beginning in London on September 21. Brazil, Colombia and Coast Rica presented a united front after three days of preparatory talks in Bogota this week. They insisted that 'decisive progress' must be made at the September meeting and deplored the fact that producers were so far not showing willingness to share responsibility for ensuring that coffee import controls would be observed.  ---------------------------------------          LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS        (As at Thursday's close)  --------------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium  +12,100 to 1,350,600 Copper      +5,575 to   268,550 Lead        +1,500 to   154,825 Nickel        +342 to    43,302 Zinc        +1,550 to   349,225 Tin           +110 to    14,695  ---------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Chinese Economic News" column: "Six Guidelines </F> for the Flotation of Mainland Firms in Hong Kong"]    [Text] Ma Shuping, deputy director of the Accountant  Office of the Finance Ministry, has stressed the following six  principles on the question of the flotation of mainland firms in  Hong Kong: 1) The enterprise must implement China's accounting  system. It is international practice to follow the accounting  standards of the enterprise's home country.    2) When an enterprise is listed on the Hong Kong market, it  should prepare balance sheets in light of international or Hong  Kong accounting standards. Although the "experimental system"  and the accounting operation and statistical systems have  approached Hong Kong's accounting standards, there are still  differences between mainland statistics and Hong Kong's  prevailing practices. To help Hong Kong investors understand  and analyze the financial status of the listed companies, the  financial reports presented by the company to the shareholders  should follow China's accounting standards and regulations as  well as international and Hong Kong accounting standards.    3) When the shareholding company is set up, the listed  enterprise should implement the "experimental system." The  provisions governing shareholding companies should be followed  for endorsing the establishment of a company, namely, "a company  is established and becomes a corporation after it registers with  the industrial and commercial administrative management  authorities."    4) The implementation of the "experimental system" will not  be retroactive. To provide a comparable financial report, the  auditing report submitted by the registered accountant should  readjust the balance sheet of the previous years and reckon the  achievements of the previous three years in light of constant  prices. This does not affect the actual situation of a certain  accounting system already practiced in an enterprise.    5) The time and method for evaluating transfer accounts.  According to provisions, when an enterprise is transformed into  a shareholding company, its assets must be evaluated, and the  face value of the original enterprise must be readjusted in  light of the values defined in the evaluation. There are two  points which should be clarified: First, when the accounts  should be transferred. The accounts can be evaluated and  transferred only after the enterprise has been transformed to a  shareholding company. Second, how the accounts should be  transferred. The floating capital, long-term investment, and  invisible assets should be transferred in light of the value and  face value defined in the evaluation. The original value and  accumulated depreciation of the fixed assets should be  reevaluated. The net value of the fixed assets should be  calculated by deducting the estimated depreciation from the  reevaluated original value.    6) Public welfare funds should be placed under the  shareholders' control. In accordance with the law and  administrative rules, a shareholding company should draw a  certain proportion of public welfare funds from its after-tax  profits. Public welfare funds should be under the shareholders'  control. The fixed assets purchased by an enterprise with  public welfare funds are considered part of the enterprise's  assets. Any gains or losses which result from the disposal of  these assets should be regarded as income or expenses from  enterprise operations and should be included in the enterprise's  total profits or losses.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Unease surfaces over fairness of local tax - Council finance MR John Major insisted yesterday in the face of some Tory expressions of unease, that the government's plans for a council tax would be fair and that more than 70 per cent of people would gain from the change. Labour MPs cheered as Mr Peter Fry, Tory MP for Wellingborough, warned that there would have to be an investigation into the disadvantage suffered by his local authority if he were to advise his constituents that the tax was fair. Wellingborough had been penalised for trading profitably and passing the profits on to chargepayers, he said in the Commons, and even the cheapest house there would pay more than the dearest house in Westminster. There would also be a transitional protection scheme and rebates for people on low incomes. The plans came under a further Tory attack, when Miss Beryl Goldsmith, secretary to Mr Norman Tebbit, condemned them as 'grossly inequitable.' Miss Goldsmith, in a letter to the London Evening Standard, made it clear that her letter had nothing to do with Mr Tebbit. Her complaint, raised with Mr Major by a Labour MP, was that even after the discount for someone living alone, her one-living-room flat in the Barbican would attract a higher bill than that for Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, and his family, in Westminster. Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, and Mr Heseltine both emphasised that the surest way to reduce local tax bills was to vote Tory. Speaking in Bristol, Mr Patten said that residents there faced 'double jeopardy' from coming under a Labour-controlled city and county. A Labour government committed to scrapping the government's powers to cap council spending would mean 'triple jeopardy,' he said. Labour, meanwhile, renewed a broad attack on the Tories' approach to local government, saying that the choice in the May elections was between 'quality and cuts' in services such as transport and education. While maintaining the attack on the council tax, Mr John Cunningham, the party's campaign co-ordinator, refused to commit the party to repealing council tax legislation if it were passed before the election, saying he thought the timetable unlikely to be achieved. As for charges of high-spending, Labour pledged that its Quality Commission would mean efficient delivery of local services, and challenged the government to say why people should not be able to vote for a higher level of service. Government spending on advertising has increased as the local elections have approached, as it did before the 1987 local elections, according to a study commissioned by BBC Radio. Out of an advertising spend of Pounds 34m in the first three months of the year, nearly half was spent in March.</p>

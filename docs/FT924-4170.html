			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina threatens Falklands' fish earnings THE FALKLAND islands is facing a heavy financial loss as Taiwanese and Korean fishing companies prepare to follow Japanese companies' defection to Argentine fishing grounds. The Argentine government recently decided to abandon its requirement that foreign fishing vessels register in an Argentine port and fly the national flag, while also cutting the price of licences issued to Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese and Spanish companies to fish for Illex squid in Argentine waters. The moves threaten to precipitate what Penguin News, the islands' newspaper, has described as the worst crisis to face the British crown colony since Argentina invaded it in 1982. A large proportion of the Far Eastern companies that were offered licences by the Falklands government three weeks ago have elected not to take up their allocations, opting instead for the cheaper Argentine licences, which are unrestricted in terms of control and last two to three years. Three of Japan's largest fishing companies, KSJ, OSA and CTC, were originally offered 70 licences by the Falklands government. They have indicated that they will take up just 12: resulting in a revenue loss of many millions of pounds to the Falklands. Taiwanese and Korean companies are set to follow the Japanese and indications now are that the Falklands will suffer a revenue loss of about Pounds 16m a year, although pessmistic estimates put the figure much higher. Revenue from the sale of licences last year amounted to more than Pounds 30m, which comprised 64 per cent of the islands' annual revenue. The islands' government also fears damage to stocks. It is understood that the Argentines believe squid live only one year and that what is not caught is lost. An official in Port Stanley said this showed they did not understand basic squid biology. 'What is not fished is not lost,' he said. 'It survives to breed and produce next year's crop.'</p>

Russian Arms Trade Centralized"]    [Text] The existence of a number of foreign economic  structures involved in the sale of Russian arms has caused a  fragmentation of Russia's efforts on the world arms market, has  undermined the exporters' authority among the customers, and has  somewhat disorganized government policy. This prompted last  November the creation of a single government structure to export  arms, ammunition, military equipment, and components -- the  "Rosvooruzheniye" state company. Presently the company is  staging its presentation to mark the start of its international  operations.    "The USSR and, later, Russia did not sell arms -- they only  supplied them to allies within the framework of the former  political course," Lieutenant General Viktor Samoylov, general  director of the "Rosvooruzheniye" state company, said at a press  conference yesterday. He also stressed that the company  entrusted to him "is not afraid of accusations of being a  monopoly," because in the past two years attempts by a multitude  of sellers to trade in arms have failed. Only a single state  company, such as "Rosvooruzheniye," will be able to do so  successfully.    The "Rosvooruzheniye" state arms and military hardware  export  and import company was set up 25 November of last year in  accordance with the Russian president's edict No. 507 on the  basis of the "Oboroneksport" foreign trade association, the  "Spetsvneshtekhnika" foreign trade company, and the Main  Administration for Cooperation, to act as their successor.  Under presidential edicts, Viktor Samoylov was appointed the  company's director, and Air Force Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov  was named the president's representative on its board.    "Rosvooruzheniye's" entirely new objective is to invest  private and government money into Russian military-industrial  enterprises to create under contract weapons models that are  most sought after on the world market. All Russia's largest  defense enterprises will continue to be involved in foreign  economic activity, but they will act under contract with the  company. Arms will be delivered to foreign buyers out of the  excess reserves of military hardware stored at  military-industrial enterprises; revenues from the sales will  not be transferred to the budget as was the case formerly, but  will be received by the producer (with a deduction of 3-5  percent commission fees to be kept by "Rosvooruzheniye"), who  will pay taxes to the state. It is well known that formerly the  state allocated arms sales revenues between enterprises at its  discretion.    At the initial stage of "Rosvooruzheniye's" activity, its  deals will be licensed by the Foreign Economic Relations  Ministry; later the company itself will be authorized to do so.  At present a special government decree and a new draft law on  military-technical cooperation are being drawn up to set forth a  new procedure for military exports. Tomorrow KOMMERSANT-DAILY  will report the company's activity in greater detail.   <H5>    Who's who in "Rosvooruzheniye" </H5>   General director -- Lieutenant General Viktor Samoylov  (formerly Vladimir Shumeyko's military adviser)    First deputies:    Colonel Valeriy Tretyak (former consultant of the  secretariat  of the Russian Federation Interdepartmental Commission on  Cooperation with Foreign Countries);    Captain 1st Rank Sergey Oslikovskiy (former first deputy  chief of the "Oboroneksport" foreign trade association.

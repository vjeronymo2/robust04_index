			<p>BFN     [Text] The 11 volunteers of Premiere Urgence are still  being held by Serb soldiers several days after their arrest.  Soldiers claim that they found ammunitions in the  organization's trucks. Thierry Mauricet, the president of the  organization, is worried; he questioned Edouard Balladur when he  met him at the Humagora international meeting of those  participing in humanitarian actions, which is currently taking  place at the Palais des Congres in Paris. Listen to this  dialogue between the two men recorded by Pascal Misrai:    [Begin recording] [Mauricet] [words indistinct] Premiere  Urgence. I am in charge of the issue, and I know that France is  exerting pressure to obtain their release, but has not been  successful yet.    [Balladur] Yes, for the time being. We have received  assurances that their lives are not threatened, but we cannot be  satisfied with this. France is the most active country in  Yugoslavia, and I believe we cannot ask less than respect for  those ensuring humanitarian aid. This is the minimum we are  demanding.    [Mauricet] The current hardening of Serb behavior, the  latest  detentions of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] blue helmets are  worrying me. What do you intend to do? Is it possible to stop  the escalation?    [Balladur] We hope so, in any case we are attempting to stop  it by trying to obtain coherent international action by all  large countries. I thank you for what you are doing. Believe  me, no one is forgetting the fate of your 11 friends. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM-TASS correspondent Lidiya Peresypkina] </F>   [Text] Minsk 7 April, TASS -- A ceremony of handing over  the equipment of the American moth balled military hospital  worth over 8 million U.S. dollars to Belarus was held at the 9th  Clinical Hospital in Minsk on Thursday.    The Belarusian public learned about this valuable present  from the U.S. Government to the republic which had badly  suffered from the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power  station, during U.S. President Bill Clinton's recent visit to  Minsk. The President's wife, Hillary Clinton, visited then the  4th Children's Clinical Hospital in the Belarussian capital, met  with medical workers and organizers of public health and  familiarized herself with the needs of Belarussian medical  institutions. That is why the equipment packed in 130  containers, 20 tons each, includes unique surgical furniture and  roentgen apparatuses, refrigerators and microscopes, and special  beds for patients. Apart from the 9th clinic, this equipment  will be received by the 4th Children's Clinic, well known to the  U.S. side, the Research Institute of Radiation Medicine and the  Minsk first-aid hospital.    The U.S. Government has been rendering humanitarian aid to  Belarus on a regular basis lately which is estimated at over 100  million U.S. dollars.    Still, the handing over of this considerable humanitarian  cargo is a very important fact for many reasons. First, medical  workers of the Republic received valuable and unique equipment  which this country cannot afford to buy. Second, the process of  the delivery of this humanitarian cargo became a bridge of  friendship between the two armies as from both sides the cargo  was dispatched and received by people in a military uniform. In  addition, during the transportation of the cargo help was  rendered by marines from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and  North Ireland.    Some 30 young U.S. servicemen headed by Major-General of the  Medical Service Michael Scotty, arrived in Belarus and now  together with their Belarusian colleagues are not only receiving  the cargo but also training Belarusian medical workers to handle  the equipment unfamiliar to them.    During the ceremony of presenting the humanitarian aid  General Michael Scotty noted that for the first time during his  30 years of service he was handing over the Army property not  for military but for peaceful purposes.</p>

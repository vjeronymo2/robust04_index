			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Mehmet Ali Birand: "Two Important Steps for </F> Customs Union"]    [Excerpts] The question of a customs union between the  European Union [EU] and Turkey is very important. However, in  view of the persisting economic instability in Turkey, the  people tend to believe "it is not the right time to consider a  customs union." Nevertheless, those who are well aware of the  matter believe that Turkey stands to significantly gain from  that process.    If we wish to improve our economy in the long run, then a  customs union is the most reliable system we should adopt....    Ankara will host an important visitor tomorrow. He is former  Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broeck, who is now  responsible for the EU Foreign Relations Committee. He will  hold talks with officials to establish the political  inclinations in Ankara. Prime Minister Tansu Ciller seems to  maintain her decisive approach on the matter. Meanwhile,  significant progress has been made in the talks between the two  sides in Brussels. The EU-Turkey Council will meet in October  and the process of achieving a customs union will begin at the  end of 1994.    Whether it likes it or not, Turkey is moving toward  establishing a customs union with the EU. Of course, neither  side can force the other to agree to that process. In other  words, Turkey may decide to abandon it at the last moment.  However, as things stand at the present time, Turkey can decide  to abandon that process only if the EU adopts a completely  unacceptable approach.    The two sides are involved in bargaining talks and mutual  maneuvering at the present time. [passage omitted]  <H5>  We Must Achieve What We Want on Two Basic Issues </H5>   Turkey is concerned with two basic issues:    1. To redeem its loss.    Turkey will incur a loss from its customs taxes and revenues  from the Communal Housing Fund when a customs union is realized.  An optimistic estimate is that Turkey stands to lose $2  billion. However, the Ministry of Finance has disclosed that  Turkey's loss will total $6 billion. It must have probably  added the flies to its calculations. The officials in Brussels  will be appalled if that figure is mentioned to them. We should  abandon our old habits and draw up a convincing report based on  basic information. The EU is already aware of what Turkey  stands to lose. Furthermore, it is ready to help Turkey redeem  its loss. So, let us not exaggerate the matter. What is left  to consider is Greece's obstruction. Obviously, the Turkish  officials should move to visit the EU capitals to discuss the  two matters. That is unavoidable.    2. Question of Limitations.    Turkey will apply the customs union system with certain  limitations on imported commodities to protect various sectors  in the country. For example, the automotive industry sector  will comply with the customs union on a reduced scale for a  certain period. Naturally, the representatives of almost all  the establishments in the private sector have rushed to Ankara  to appeal to be included on the list of the establishments that  will be exempt from the customs union to a certain degree.  However, a point that should be considered is as follows: The  EU officials are gladly expecting Turkey to submit its list on  the commodities on which it wishes to impose limitations. That  is because they have their own list. Obviously, they will  extend their list as much as we extend ours. Turkey's textile  industry is an important item on their list. So they are looking  for an opportunity to place a reservation on our textile  industry to prevent it from taking over the EU markets. The  warning the EU officials have made is as follows: "Do not bring  up the question of limitations right at the beginning of the  talks. Discuss the matter at the end of the negotiations."    Unfortunately, no one seems to heed that and similar  warnings  in Ankara. Apparently we will make a serious mistake if we move  to raise the question of limitations at the beginning of the  talks.    Naturally, the agreement to be reached on a customs union  will have to be approved by the EU capitals. Regardless of how  the matter is considered, the EU capitals will decide on the  matter. We shall suffer an unnecessary loss if we fail to adopt  a sensitive approach and if we do not do what has to be done  until the last moment. (That is what we usually do.)    Let us not repeat our old mistakes, at least, let us not do  so on this matter.</p>

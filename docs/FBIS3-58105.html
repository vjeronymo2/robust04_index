In this way, the trade unions yesterday suffered  their second political defeat -- the first was in the Economic  and Social Council -- in their battle to prevent the Workers'  Statute from being amended.    Labor Minister Jose Antonio Grinan stated after the debate  that the trade unions are entitled to call a general strike and  are free to make decisions independently on their own  responsibility. "However, it must not be forgotten that over 90  percent of the deputies representing the people's sovereignty  have voted in favor of it, and this means that the vast majority  of the population, whom they lawfully represent, are in favor."    The decree law on urgent measures concerning the labor  market, introducing the new apprenticeship, practical training,  and part-time contracts and legalizing nonprofitmaking  employment agencies, was approved by 317 votes out of the 341  cast, with 22 against and two abstentions. At the same time,  all the deputies voted for the decree law to be handled as an  ordinary law, with the aim of its joining the two bills amending  substantial parts of the Workers' Statute which will be approved  by the cabinet today.    This reform will be debated as a whole at the plenary  session  which will be held 20 January. This means that the debate will  be held seven days before the general strike. [passage omitted]</p>

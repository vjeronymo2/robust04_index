			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / US Budget: Spending on land cut - Environment ENVIRONMENTALISTS who hoped President Bill Clinton would keep his pledge to buy more land for the nation's parks will be disappointed by the budget, writes Lisa Bransten in Washington. Spending on land acquisition will fall to Dollars 77.6m (Pounds 51.3m) from the Dollars 117.9m allocated in 1993. Overall, however, the Interior Department budget increases by more than Dollars 500m to Dollars 9.5bn. Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary, said his department opted to maintain and improve existing national parks rather than acquire new land. He hopes to continue increasing land held by national parks through land swaps with other Interior Department bureaux. The department aims to press ahead with plans to raise fees for grazing livestock and mining hard rock minerals on federal land, although Mr Clinton bowed to congressional pressure and took them out of the budget itself. Mr Babbitt said he had the administrative authority to increase grazing fees and planned to press Congress to increase mining fees by at least 8 per cent.</p>

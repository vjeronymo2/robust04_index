			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Automated claims data base. The automated claims data base will be used for all claims opened in fiscal year 1988 or later, and earlier year claims if they involve expenditures of funds in fiscal year 1988 or later, as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Tort and Special Claims Management data base (all offices); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Personnel Claims Management data base (all offices except COE claims offices). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Affirmative Claims Management data base (all offices except COE claims offices). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Investigative files. A claims office will maintain separate investigative files on potentially compensable events (PCE) for every incident which it (or a unit claims officer) has investigated, or has received a copy of a report of incident or report of investigation from a unit claims officer or any other source. Similar files will be maintained for incidents investigated by a claims office or other Army official that might give rise to an affirmative claim in favor of the Army. The investigative file will be merged into a claims file when a claim is filed or asserted. Investigative files not otherwise merged into a claims file will be retained until transferred to another Army claims office or until the time for filing a claim has expired. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.233  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Arrangement of claims files. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Instructions on the arrangement of claims files are found in &sect;536.196 and in DA Pam 27&hyph;162. Every file for a claim against the United States must ultimately contain the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) For files processed under the automated claims data management system, a printout (i.e., ``paper screen'') of the automated data pertaining to that claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If the claim has been paid in whole or in part, a copy of the settlement agreement, if any, and the certified copy of the paid voucher (comeback copy from the finance and disbursing office). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The action or recommendation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The claim (initial and any amendment). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The report of claims officer, with exhibits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.234  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Disposition of claims files. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Commander, USARCS, is the proper authority for post settlement review of claims against the United States. Claims having the following file numbers under AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2 will be forwarded to USARCS (subject to the provisions of b and c below) for disposition under the regulation: 27&hyph;20a, 27&hyph;20g, 27&hyph;20h, 27&hyph;20i, 27&hyph;20j, or 27&hyph;20q. Claims having other 27&hyph;20 file numbers will be disposed locally according to the instructions in AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Files of completed tort claims will not be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS prior to the expiration of any appeal period or the 6-month period for filing suit, as applicable. The file of a tort claim in which an award that is final is not accepted by the claimant, within a reasonable time, will also be forwarded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) For personnel claims involving recovery action, claims files will be assembled and processed for local recovery action or forwarded for centralized recovery action in accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 3, &sect;&sect;536.195 and 536.196. After completion of final recovery action by field claims offices or command claims services such files will be forwarded to USARCS for retirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Files will be administratively closed as abandoned or withdrawn and forwarded to the Commander, USARCS, as provided herein. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Personnel claims. Claims under subpart K will be administratively closed as abandoned in the following situations: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The claimant affirmatively withdraws or abandons the claim prior to adjudication. Such files will contain evidence of the claimant's intention to do so, such as a letter from the claimant or a memorandum of a telephone conversation with the claimant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The claimant cannot be located to be paid or, if the claim is not fully substantiated, to have his or her intentions with regard to the claim ascertained (but, see paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) For other reasons, final action on the claim cannot be taken. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) When a claimant has neither affirmatively abandoned nor fully substantiated a claim cognizable under subpart K, he or she should be directed by certified mail to provide the required substantiation within a specified period, usually 30 days. If correspondence is returned as undeliverable, and the claimant is an active duty service member, a current military address can usually be obtained from the Commander, U.S. Army Enlisted Records and Evaluation Center, Army Worldwide Locator Service, ATTN: PCRE&hyph;RF, Fort Benjamin Harrison, IN 46249&hyph;5301. If the claimant fails to respond, to the extent that the claim is substantiated and meritorious it should be paid; otherwise, it should be disapproved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Tort claims. Each file will contain evidence of claimant's intention to withdraw or abandon the claim, such as a letter or a memorandum for record of a telephone conversation with claimant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Before apparently abandoned claims are forwarded to USARCS, a certified letter should be sent to the claimant requesting, his/her intentions within a specified period, usually 30 days. If no reply is received within a reasonable time, usually 30 days, the files may be closed and forwarded to USARCS, except as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Tort claims under subparts D, E and F. Additionally, a paragraph of the letter should state that failure to respond will result in the presumption that the claim is abandoned. Further, it should be stated that if the claimant is dissatisfied with the action taken, the claimant may file suit in an appropriate United States District Court no later than six months from the date of mailing of the letter, or the claimant's remedy will be forever barred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) In tort claims under subpart C, the last paragraph should advise the claimant that failure to respond will result in the presumption that the claim is abandoned, and that if the claimant is dissatisfied with the action taken, the claimant has a right to appeal the action for a review and final decision. Further, it should be stated that the claimant only has 60 days to submit such an appeal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Only after each of the above actions has been completed, may a tort claim be considered to be abandoned, and be forwarded to USARCS for retirement. If correspondence to a claimant is returned as undelivered, and the claimant is an active duty service member, a current military address can usually be obtained from the Commander, U.S. Army Enlisted Records and Evaluation Center, Army Worldwide Locator Service, ATTN: PCRE&hyph;RF, Fort Benjamin Harrison, IN 46249&hyph;5301. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.235  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Retrieval of claims files. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Field claims offices will occasionally have need of a file that has been sent to USARCS for centralized recovery or retirement (for example, action on a ``late'' reconsideration request). When requesting the return of a file from USARCS (either in writing or telephonically), the requesting office must provide_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The claim number. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The claimant's name. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The date the file was forwarded to USARCS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The name of the TGBL carrier (if the claim was a household goods or holdbaggage shipment claim). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Whether the file was forwarded for retirement or centralized recovery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The reason the file is being requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If USARCS has already acted on a request for reconsideration on a personnel claim, the file will not be returned to a field office for action on a second request for reconsideration. In such cases, the request will be sent to USARCS for action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.236  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Certified and registered mail. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Correspondence to claimants and/or their attorneys denying or making final offers in tort claims under subparts C, D, E, F, G, H, and L or the transmittal of an abandonment notice will be accomplished by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. The return receipt (green card), upon its return to the claims office, will be retained as a part of the claims file as proof of receipt by the claimant or other addressee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.237  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Maintenance of claims files. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The contents of each claim file for claims against the United States will be placed in a standard 91/4 inch by 113/4 inch manila folder. The name of the claimant, exactly as entered into the automated claims management data base, will be placed on the top-left portion of the file folder. The complete nine-digit computer-generated claim number displayed in the automated database will be placed on the extreme top right-hand side of the folder. The fiscal year, office code, and claim sequence number will be separated by a dash mark (example, ``88&hyph;011&hyph;0079''). Both name and claim file number entries on the manila file folder will be printed legibly in blue-black ink. The claim file should be stapled together before inserting in the file folder; however, the file need only be placed in the folder without stapling to the file folder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Investigative files will also be maintained in manila folders. The date of the incident and general descriptive data (for example, ``1 Jul 86/auto accident (1st and Elm, Smallville)'' or ``24 Sep 86/heart operation (Jones, John M.)'') will be placed on top-left portion of the file folder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2 requires labeling of file folders and containers with specific information. In complying therewith, the following guidance is provided: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

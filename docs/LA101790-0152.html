			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOUSE, SENATE REACH COMPROMISE ON DEFENSE BUDGET  </P> <P> In a major breakthrough on the defense budget, the House and the Senate agreed  today on a compromise plan that would build no more B-2 bombers this year while  slashing nearly $2 billion from President Bush's request for the Strategic  Defense Initiative.  </P> <P> The $289-billion military budget blueprint for the fiscal year that began Oct.  1 came after nearly three weeks of bargaining and provided $18 billion less  than Bush had sought in January.  </P> <P> Among the key provisions are the wholesale cut in "Star Wars"; a worldwide  troop cut of 100,000, including 50,000 in Europe, and a significant reduction  in Bush's proposal for land-based nuclear missiles.  </P> <P> The legislation also includes $403 million in research and procurement money  for the V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney  has tried repeatedly to cancel.  </P> <P> Negotiators agreed to spend $2.9 billion on SDI, midway between the Senate's  figure of $3.7 billion and the House's $2.3 billion. The compromise bill also  calls for sharply scaling back the limitations the Senate had sought to impose  on the way the Pentagon can spend money on various aspects of SDI.  </P> <P> The compromise reached on the B-2 Stealth bomber allows production of the  aircraft to proceed but is silent on future procurement.  </P> <P> "It's good news, bad news," said Rep. Ike Skelton (D-Mo.), a member of the  House Armed Services Committee and a B-2 proponent.  </P> <P> The House earlier adopted a defense bill that stopped production of the  radar-evading aircraft at the 15 planes now under construction.  </P> <P> The Senate, in its legislation, approved the Administration's request for $5.1  billion this fiscal year to buy two planes, for a total of 17, plus spare parts  in the next fiscal year.  </P> <P> The compromise calls for $4.1 billion for the Stealth program, including $1.8  billion for research and development on the aircraft and $2.3 billion for  procurement.  </P> <P> In July, Air Force Secretary Donald B. Rice told the House Armed Services  Committee that the service needs $1.4 billion to acquire two B-2s on schedule.  Rice said that without the money, acquisition of the two bombers would have to  be delayed until 1997.  </P> <P> Both the House and Senate must approve the package before it reaches the  President.  </P></p>

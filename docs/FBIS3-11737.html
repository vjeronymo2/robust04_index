The Senate agreed to modify Article 41 of the Constitution  to  promote greater independence of electoral bodies and to broaden  citizen participation in the electoral process with an eye on  federal elections scheduled for next August. The decision closed  three days of special sessions called by the Permanent  Commission, which is operating during the congressional recess  between late December and 15 April, to examine and, as the case  may be, approve electoral reforms.    On 23 March the Chamber of Deputies approved a bill to amend  the electoral law that calls for a new structure for the  electoral bodies and establishes new electoral crimes and  stronger punishments for such crimes.    The amendments will go into effect after their publication  in  DIARIO OFICIAL and will be applied during the 21 August  elections in which about 42 million Mexicans will elect a  president and federal legislators.</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLOVENIA REPUBLIC VOTES TO SECEDE FROM YUGOSLAVIA  </P> <P> Slovenians voted overwhelmingly Sunday for their republic to secede from  Yugoslavia. In Serbia, the renamed Communists appeared headed for defeat in  runoff elections, the opposition said.  </P> <P> According to unofficial results of Slovenia's plebiscite, 88% of the electorate  voted for secession, 4% voted against and the remainder of the ballots were  invalid.  </P> <P> Thousands danced and cheered in the streets of the Slovenian capital of  Ljubljana.  </P> <P> "Within the next six months, Slovenia will decide whether to stay in Yugoslavia  or become an independent country," Slovenian President Milan Kucan said.  </P> <P> Center-right parties in Croatia and Slovenia ousted Communists in spring  elections. Both republics have threatened to secede if Yugoslavia does not  transform itself into a loose confederation of semi-independent states.  </P> <P> The largest republic, Serbia, advocates a strong federal government. The  opposition celebrated what it said were victories in Serbia's largest cities,  including Belgrade, in runoff voting for the 250-seat legislature.  </P> <P> In the first round, Serbia's Socialists -- formerly the Communists -- scored a  resounding victory by winning 87 seats. Ethnic Hungarian and Muslim groups won  nine constituencies. The three major opposition parties got none.  </P> <P> On Sunday, many opposition candidates were reportedly in the lead for the  remaining 154 seats.  </P></p>

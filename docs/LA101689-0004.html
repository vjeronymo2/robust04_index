			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUNNY NEWS  </P> <P> Those who denounce reporting of "negative" news and opinion by the nation's  media should take note of the highly enlightening article by Vitaly Korotich,  editor of the Soviet magazine Ogonyok (Op-Ed Page, Sept. 28).  </P> <P> Korotich writes: "There were times when the bosses loved us (the media)! This  love reached its peak 10 to 15 years ago, when the press was swimming in a  torrent of sunny news."  </P> <P> From this I deduce that when the press begins printing only positive news and  favorable opinion, we would be on the road to totalitarianism.  </P> <P> FLOYD A.

He spoke after today's meeting between members of the  committee, those of the Defense and Security Committee, member  of the U.S. Government and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine  Albright, and head of the U.S. Armed Forces John Shalikashvili.    Partnership for Peace is an answer to the Central European  states' demands for NATO membership, Payne said, adding, "this  is the first time people have given serious consideration to the  issue and come up with a certain approach to it." We have  succeeded in breaking through a barrier, he said, quoting  Shalikashvili's remark that three months ago something like that  would have been impossible. The project has been conceived so  that each state could set its own pace of integration into  security structures, Payne said.    The project includes the evaluation of individual countries'  political conditions, namely progress on respect for democratic  political system and frontiers, civil and human rights, budget  transparency and civilian control of the military, Defense and  Security Committee Chairman Vladimir Suman said.    It will also include concrete aspect of military  cooperation,  such as army maneuvers and the sending of Czech representatives  to NATO's political and military organs, Suman added.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Korean banks impose curbs on Hyundai THREE BANKS yesterday announced credit controls on the Hyundai conglomerate for funnelling what they called illegal loans to its founder, presidential candidate Chung Ju-yung, AP reports from Seoul. Hyundai's main lenders imposed the restrictions on 13 Hyundai subsidiaries because of their failure to call in loans provided to Chung and his family. The banks said the loans were illegal because they were not for business purposes. Among the 13 subsidiaries are the group's flagship, Hyundai Motor, along with Hyundai Heavy Industries and Hyundai Engineering and Construction. Korea Exchange Bank, the main creditor of the three, said that the subsidiaries defied the banks' order to call in Dollars 23.5m (Pounds 13m) in loans to Chung and his family by the end of last month. It said they would be denied the same amount in new loans or the renewal of old loans. Bank approval for investments in new projects or real estate purchases would also be suspended. Yesterday's development was the latest move in a battle between the government and Hyundai, whose founder heads the country's second largest opposition party. Following the 76-year-old billionaire's entry into politics early this year, the government began a series of tax probes and credit controls against Hyundai, saying that Hyundai funds were flowing to Chung's party for political purposes. Last week, a Hyundai executive was prosecuted and Chung was warned by the government in a case of alleged illegal stock trading. Chung's son and two advisers were arrested in April on charges of evading taxes. The government has contended that Chung and his family misused bank loans and traded stocks illegally to funnel funds into his party. Chung, however, claims he has severed ties with Hyundai and all his political funds come from his personal assets, estimated at more than Dollars 3bn. Last month, Chung was nominated as his party's candidate for presidential elections at the end of this year.</p>

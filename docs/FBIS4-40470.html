			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valentina Nikiforova and Pavel Filippov: "In </F> Circumvention of the Constitution. The Presidential Edict Is  More Ado About Crime"]    [Excerpts] On 14 June President Boris Yeltsin signed an  edict "On Urgent Measures to Protect the Population Against  Gangsterism and Other Manifestations of Organized Crime." It  talks in particular about enacting a system of urgent measures  to combat it. Primarily total -- including criminal prosecution  -- investigation not only of suspects but also their relatives,  friends, and other individuals and corporate entities. [passage  omitted]    Here is how the edict was assessed by Duma Security  Committee  Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin:    "The first impression: The mere fact of signing such an  edict is a gross violation of the Constitution, a departure from  criminal law procedures and substantive criminal law norms, and  a violation of human rights and freedoms. The president has  once again shown that he has not observed and is not going to  observe the Constitution -- even the one that he drafted and  spent enormous efforts to have approved.    "Second: Under normal conditions this regime cannot function  or stand up to crime. In the end, nothing prevented the  president from inviting the Duma to draft and approve a law to  fight crime. And the situation would have changed drastically.  In that event this struggle would be based on a clear-cut legal  foundation. But no matter what may be said in presidential and  government structures, there have been no results. And the  edict is just a warning to criminals: Be more careful."</p>

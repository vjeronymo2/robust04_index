			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: British Gas may lose triple-A rating in Moody's review BRITISH GAS, one of the most active UK issuers in the eurobond market, could be set to lose its cherished triple-A credit rating following a decision by Moody's Investors Service to put it under review for possible downgrade. The decision leaves BT and Marks and Spencer as the only UK companies with unquestioned triple-A ratings from both agencies, along with Anglo-Dutch groups Royal Dutch/Shell and Unilever. The review, which affects some Pounds 3.6bn of long-term debt, reflects pressure put on British Gas by Ofgas, the UK gas industry regulator. This has raised the prospect of greater competition in the UK's industrial and commercial markets, and put pressure on the company's prices in the domestic gas market, Moody's said. Also, the rating agency said it would 'review British Gas' investment plans in exploration and production and international operations, to assess the investment requirement, and any potential shift in the balance of group earnings and consequent volatility.' British Gas's triple-A rating from rival rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's remains unquestioned. According to S&amp;P, companies with triple-A ratings pay around a fifth of a percentage point less when raising money in the Euromarkets than the next best credits.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLD STUNS SOUTH; SNOWSTORM ON PATH TO NOVA SCOTIA  </P> <P> A cold wave that stunned the Deep South broke low temperature records all  across Florida on Saturday, and an elderly woman froze to death in an unheated  home in the northern part of the Sunshine State.  </P> <P> Farther north, a powerful storm that dumped as much as two feet of snow on the  middle Atlantic states on Friday buffeted the New England coast with winds up  to 52 m.p.h. and snow while moving away toward Nova Scotia.  </P> <P> The arctic air that poured into Florida sent the mercury plunging from the  Panhandle all the way to Key West, the southernmost point on the continental  United States.  </P> <P> Florida's rich citrus growing region reported minor crop damage after the  second night of record cold.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cold Expected to Ease  </P> <P> But the cold snap was expected to ease slightly, and the trend was to warmer  temperatures by tonight, National Weather Service forecaster Fred Gonzalez  said.  </P> <P> Florida's lowest temperature overnight was a record 18 degrees in the northern  part of the state at Tallahassee, the capital.  </P> <P> Other records for the day in the state were 28 at Apalachicola, 29 at Daytona  Beach, 35 at Ft. Lauderdale, 35 at Ft. Myers, 36 at Hollywood, 24 at  Jacksonville, 51 at Key West, 37 at Miami, 39 at Miami Beach, 30 at Orlando, 27  at Pensacola, 31 at Tampa and 35 at West Palm Beach. In neighboring Alabama,  Mobile tied its record of 27 and Montgomery tied its record of 22.  </P> <P> Just outside Florida's capital, in Miccosukee, police said a 65-year-old woman  froze to death in her unheated home. She was discovered unconscious by a  neighbor and paramedics could not revive her.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Rare Occurrence'  </P> <P> "This is an extremely rare occurrence in Leon County," sheriff's spokesman Dick  Simpson said. The death prompted deputies to visit other unheated homes to  check on residents, he said.  </P> <P> In other cities around Florida, shelters filled up with homeless people who  usually sleep on the streets in more hospitable weather.  </P> <P> But while Florida shivered, Dodge City, Kan., posted a record high Saturday of  80 degrees.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service said snow was falling along the northern New  England coast as the two-day wintry blast moved toward Nova Scotia. Strong  winds buffeted the shoreline with gusts of 52 m.p.h., pounding Chatham, Mass.,  the weather service said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Snow Blankets Boston  </P> <P> As much as 12 inches of snow fell over Cape Cod, and areas south of Boston  reported accumulations from five to eight inches. Three to six inches of snow  were reported across southeast New Hampshire.  </P> <P> An afternoon winter storm warning was in effect for the southeast coast of  Maine, where four to eight inches of snow had fallen.  </P></p>

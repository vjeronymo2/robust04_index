			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report from </F> Chelyabinsk-70 by Sergey Sergeyev, identified by caption]    [Text] [Sergeyev over video of optical fiber production  facilities] Using standard copper wire, it is possible to  transmit a few dozen telephone calls. But this is optical  fiber. It is only 125 microns thick. Yet it is possible to  transmit up to 15,000 calls along this very thin fiber. The  technology and equipment for the production of optical fiber was  developed in the southern Urals, at the Federal Nuclear Center  in the closed city of Chelyabinsk-70.    Several years ago, the Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic  Power and Industry approved the state conversion program  "Russia's Fiber-Optic Communication Systems." The main part of  the job fell to the Urals nuclear scientists, who have acquitted  themselves brilliantly. They proposed that, unlike foreign  firms using natural quartz which is very expensive and in short  supply, we should use artificial quartz, which is purer and as a  result makes it possible to increase the throughput of  information and enhance reliability.    Yet listening to Anatoliy Barulin, general designer of our  system for the production of optic fiber, you cannot but be  amazed. Why is a Swedish fiber-optics line being installed in  St. Petersburg and a Japanese one in the Far East, when our  system has a great number of advantages recognized in the West.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AFTER LULL, NEW AND COLDER SANTA ANAS COMING TO TOWN  </P> <P> The San Diego area will experience a brief lull in Santa Ana winds today, only  to have a stronger, colder set of Santa Anas arrive Sunday night and Monday  morning, according to the National Weather Service.  </P> <P> "The Santa Anas are falling apart, becoming very, very weak, and a sea breeze  is starting to come in, temporarily, through Saturday," forecaster Wilbur  Shigehara said.  </P> <P> "Because of the lull in the Santa Anas, humidity will be up a little, but still  low. As Sunday and Monday Santa Anas come, humidity will once again plunge."  </P> <P> The Santa Anas will be particularly chilly because of an influx of cold air  from Canada, cold enough for the Weather Service to issue a frost advisory for  Sunday night in the agricultural valleys. The cooling trend will last until  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Temperatures for the inland valleys will reach lows of 27 degrees and highs of  65 to 70 degrees Sunday.  </P> <P> Mountain areas will be cool this weekend, with highs hitting 52 to 57 degrees  Friday and lows of 23 to 33 degrees all weekend.  </P> <P> Desert regions can expect highs of 70 degrees Friday, falling a bit Saturday  and Sunday, and temperatures as low as 30 degrees at night. Winds in the desert  will reach 30 m.p.h. before the cold Santa Ana winds kick in Sunday night.  </P> <P> Beach temperatures will reach 66 over the weekend, with inland coastal regions  slightly higher.  </P> <P> High tides for the weekend will be under 7 feet, Shigehara said, but should  cause no problems.  </P> <P> "Winter is around the corner," said Shigehara. Winter officially begins at 1:22  p.m. next Thursday.  </P> <P> It may, however, arrive a bit earlier.  </P> <P> "Monday should be a harbinger of winter, with temperatures in the mid-60s along  the coast and upper 60s inland, and chilly winds," Shigehara said.  </P> <P> It appears that this winter will be nothing unusual, he added, with  temperatures and rainfall forecast to be about the same as last year.  </P></p>

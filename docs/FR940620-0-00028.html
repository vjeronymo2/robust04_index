Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), &sect;1.4, Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and &sect;103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)), on regular business days between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Regulations Branch, Office of Regulations and Rulings, U.S. Customs Service, Franklin Court, 1099 14th Street NW., suite 4000, Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a), public notice is inapplicable to this interim regulation because it is within the foreign affairs function of the United States. A failure to have this regulation in place at the earliest practicable date would provoke undesirable international consequences. In addition, because this regulation sets forth procedures which the public needs to know in order to claim the benefit of a tariff preference under the NAFTA, it is determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that notice and public procedures are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. Furthermore, for the above reasons, it is determined that good cause exists under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1) and (d)(3) for dispensing with a delayed effective date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because this document involves a foreign affairs function of the United States and implements an international agreement, it is not subject to the provisions of E.O. 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for interim regulations, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do not apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Drafting Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principal author of this document was Francis W.

An amateur chemist who had manufactured amphetamines  received  a sentence of three years and eight months. The Espoo District  Court had sentenced him in June to four years in prison.    According to the court, the chemist had made a total of just  under 2 kg of amphetamines. Over a kilogram of the drugs ended  up being sold, but the chemist did not know how to distribute  them.    The sentences of the chemist's partners in crime were also  slightly reduced. Two of the men received prison sentences of  four years and eight months and the third man got four years and  three months. The sentences meted out by the district court had  been several months longer.    During the trial the chemist claimed that he had  manufactured  the amphetamines in cooperation with the police. According to  the chemist, the police's plan was to catch the men who ran the  drug ring.    Because of his claims, the police who were examined in  connection with the chemist were suspected of being guilty. They  were suspected of incitement to commit drug crimes and of breach  of duty. After the preliminary investigation, Provincial  Prosecutor Lasse Apio decided that there was not enough proof to  bring charges against them.</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GORBACHEV ELEVATES RUSSIAN IN SURPRISE  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today named a surprise choice for the new post  of vice president -- a career Communist official who climbed through the party  apparatus to join the Politburo.  </P> <P> Gennady Yanayev, 53, an ethnic Russian who previously headed the Young  Communist League and the official trade union, was criticized by some deputies  as an old-style conservative who would slow reform.  </P> <P> But Gorbachev defended his candidate as "an active defender of and participant  in perestroika," and Yanayev said he supports Gorbachev's reforms although he  called for caution in the move toward a market economy.  </P> <P> The nomination of a Russian as vice president was a surprise partly because of  the widespread belief that Gorbachev would choose an official from one of the  other 14 republics to offset charges the central government was unsympathetic  to ethnic minorities.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said last week he was ready to nominate Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze for vice president, but Shevardnadze then resigned and  subsequently refused the post.  </P> <P> No other names were placed in nomination today. Voting was to be by secret  ballot tonight with results to be announced Thursday. More than half the voting  deputies would have to cast ballots against Yanayev to force another  nomination.  </P> <P> Several deputies objected to the fact that there were no alternative  candidates, but others said Gorbachev should have the right to choose his own  Cabinet and vice president.  </P> <P> Yanayev, a historian by profession, is a longtime Communist Party official who  earlier this year was made a full member of the party's ruling Politburo. He  was formerly head of the party's youth organization, the Komsomol, and briefly  served as head of the official trade union organization.  </P> <P> "It is a bad time for the republics," said Algimantas Chekuolis, a Lithuanian  deputy and newspaper editor who was observing but not participating in the  Congress. "We got another Gorbachev, a complete apparachik a la Gorbachev."  </P></p>

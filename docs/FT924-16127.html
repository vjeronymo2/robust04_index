			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Romanians vote in freedom but with little hope ROMANIANS have just conducted the freest elections in their country's turbulent history. But the support given to politicians linked to the recent communist past highlights one of the difficulties facing this former dictatorship in its struggle to build a solidly based democracy. The picture provided by the elections shows a deeply polarised society. Fault lines run between town and country, between young and old, and most markedly between the ethnic groups. The country's substantial Hungarian community and rapidly diminishing German population have preserved their language and customs after living for centuries alongside gypsies and the Latin Romanian majority. President Ion Iliescu, a close aide to the executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in the early 1970s, emerged as clear front-runner in Sunday's presidential vote. By far the most skilled and experienced of Romania's politicians, he won strong support in rural areas, where half the population still lives, and in the heavy industrial areas where a 50 per cent collapse in production from overmanned and obsolescent state companies has increased unemployment and insecurity. Sociologists and Mr Iliescu's many political opponents believe his most tenacious supporters are among the former communist nomenklatura: the bureaucrats, managers and secret police who were the backbone of the Ceausescu regime. It is the tenacity of the nomenklatura's hold on the levers of power and patronage which has most dismayed the young, the budding private entrepreneurs, and the liberal intelligentsia of Bucharest and other cities who backed Mr Emil Constantinescu, presidential candidate of the 18-party Democratic Convention, a loose coalition of opposition parties. But many younger Romanians have already voted with their feet. Up to 1m people, including many of the most skilled and educated, are believed to have left the country since the fall of the dictatorship. Many more, their hopes of a decisive break with the old regime in tatters, will now try to follow. A senior official in the privatisation agency, himself about to abandon the public service, explained. 'This was essentially a negative election. Few voted enthusiastically for any of the candidates, most voted simply against the others.' Mr Iliescu, who gained around 48 per cent of the vote in the six-way first round of voting for the French-style executive presidency, is confident he will be re-elected for a four-year term in the run-off on October 11 against Mr Constantinescu, who picked up only 30 per cent. The party which supports him, the Democratic National Salvation Front, also emerged as the largest single party in the parliamentary elections, with 28 per cent of the vote, against 27 per cent for the Democratic Convention. But both the main groupings are far from a parliamentary majority, opening the way for possibly months of what the Balkans are famous for, horse-trading and intrigue. The possible permutations are infinite given the fractious nature of the Democratic Convention and the relative strength of personal ambition among all the participants compared to the weakness of party ideology or loyalty. But with a hungry winter approaching, after a summer of drought and sharply declining real incomes for most of the population, any new government which emerges will need the broadest possible political base to survive.</p>

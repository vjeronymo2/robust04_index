			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Further moves in train to oust Simpsons' board The increasingly hostile battle for control of Simpsons of Cornhill, owner of two of the City's most famous restaurants, took a new turn yesterday when dissident shareholders announced moves to oust the board. Rebel shareholders led by Mr Robert Klapp, former chairman of Select Appointments, have requisitioned an extraordinary meeting amid claims that the board has abandoned plans to develop a themed-restaurant chain along the lines of Simpsons, the 17th century chop house. The board, which refused to allow voting on a rebel resolution to elect two new directors at an EGM last month, has rejected the allegations. Mr Paul Reece, managing director of Simpsons, said resolutions seeking the removal of the board and disclosure of executive salaries would be vigorously opposed. He also dismissed claims that the rebel group had the support of 40 per cent of the shareholders. Mr Klapp, meanwhile, yesterday outlined his long-term strategy for the company which was floated last August, raising Pounds 2m for the acquisition of Simpsons and the nearby Jamaica Inn. 'We could build up a group of traditional chop houses nationally with restaurants in towns such as Bristol and Oxford,' he said. The rebels - who already have the support of Mr Alan Crompton-Batt, an existing Simpsons' director - also revealed that investors in the Far East were behind a 10 per cent stake in the company recently purchased by Mountjoy, registered in the Turk and Caicos Islands. Overseas investors are thought to be interested in opening a Simpsons-style restaurant in Hong Kong.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GOLDSMITH SAYS BAT BID DOOMED UNLESS EXTENDED  </P> <P> Sir James Goldsmith, one of the three financiers leading the hostile takeover  bid for BAT Industries PLC, said Thursday that a British regulatory panel must  extend its deadline or his takeover attempt will fail.  </P> <P> Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers requires that all conditions of a bid,  including U.S. regulatory hurdles, must be completed within 81 days of the  posting of the bidder's formal offer document.  </P> <P> "If there is no extension from the panel it's very hard to see the offer  succeeding," Goldsmith said.  </P> <P> Goldsmith's consortium, Hoylake Investments Ltd., posted its $21.4-billion  (13.4-billion-pound) bid for BAT and its U.S. subsidiaries on Aug. 8, which  leaves the group 58 days to meet U.S. regulatory requirements.  </P> <P> London-based BAT, the world's largest tobacco company, has significant  interests in financial services, paper and retailing -- including such U.S.  holdings as the Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field department stores and  Farmers Insurance Group.  </P> <P> Goldsmith on Thursday also launched an attack on regulatory commissions in  several U.S. states "for obstructing the bid."  </P></p>

The flight will mark a record-breaking mission on orbit due  to last a year and two months. Researcher Valeriy Polyakov will  spend 429 days aboard Russia's orbiting station Mir carrying out  medical experiments. The two other cosmonauts, Viktor afanasyev  and Yuriy Usachov, will replace their colleagues, Vasiliy  Tsibiliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov who will return to earth on  January 14.    During the expedition, the cosmonauts will carry out a  series  of medical and biological experiments. Special attention will  be devoted to the medical and sanitary-hygienic aspects of  super-long space flights, including the future space expeditions  to Mars, as well as to methods of offsetting the negative impact  of weightlessness on human body during long flights.    During the simultaneous work of the two crews a series of  biotechnological experiments will be conducted, so that  Tsibiliyev and Serebrov will be able to bring their results to  the earth.    Afanasyev, Usachev and Polyakov will conduct some  technological experiments in the sphere of crystallography, the  study of the impact of vacuum on various materials, and continue  astrophysical studies and the long-distance sounding of the  earth. The work on geological anomalies will be resumed. They  will also study the emergence and development of typhoons in  various parts of the world ocean. No space walkouts are planned.    The crew will receive three cargo spacecraft, one of which  will have a ballistic capsule to be returned to the earth.  Planned repair and maintenance work will be continued in order  to keep up the Mir complex in a proper condition.    The experiments will provide invaluable scientific material  for designing and building a new orbiting station, tentatively  called Alpha, which is expected to be put in orbit after 1997,  which will mark the beginning of an era of manned space  programmes in world astronautics. An agreement to build such a  station has been signed by Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice-President Al Gore.</p>

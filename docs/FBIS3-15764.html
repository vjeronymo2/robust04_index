			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Kolesnichenko] </F>   [Text] New York, 10 Mar -- "I am satisfied with my visit to  the United States. President Clinton, the leadership of the  U.S. Congress, and I came to complete mutual understanding  regarding various aspects of politics on the agenda of our  talks," Eduard Shevardnadze, head of the Georgian state, stated  on Wednesday evening. In an exclusive interview with an  ITAR-TASS correspondent he noted that, during the meetings with  the U.S. leadership, "an atmosphere of solidarity with Georgia  and support for its territorial integrity and democratic  development prevailed."    E. Shevardnadze pointed out that he had spent a few hours at  the U.S. Congress, persuading the legislators of the need to  render urgent and effective economic assistance to Georgia. "In  my opinion, during discussion of the aid package the legislators  will remember my arguments and agree that the volume of  assistance promised by the administration should be increased,"  he said. "At the present time a critical situation has taken  shape in Georgia; the country is on the brink of famine. We  need Western assistance, both financial and technical, as never  before."    As regards a settlement of the Abkhazian-Georgian conflict,  the Georgian leader noted that he had completely devoted the  last day of his visit to meetings at the United Nations. "I  submitted several variants for a peace settlement to the  Security Council," he said. "My speech was received with  understanding and approval. At the present time the detailed  drafts submitted by us for ways of achieving peace are being  examined by the UN secretary general, who should make a final  decision in the immediate future. This was a very important day  for us. Owing to the fact that numerous talks were scheduled at  the headquarters of the international community, we had to make  adjustments to the program of the visit and postpone meetings  with business circles, although they are also important for us."    The head of the Georgian state spoke out in favor of "global  de-Bosnia-ization [debosniizatsii] of all the regional conflicts  in the 20th century." He called upon the United States and  other developed states in the world to promote this process.  "In many cases not only national hatred, separatism, extremism,  but also blatant elements of fascism manifest themselves," he  pointed out. "We cannot allow the shoots of fascism to grow and  allow extremism to triumph."    Dzhaba Ioseliani, chairman of the temporary committee of  Georgia for emergency situations, reported in a conversation  with the ITAR-TASS correspondent that "the president and the  entire delegation were really satisfied with the results of the  visit to Washington, but the talks that took place at the United  Nations showed that not everyone in the international community  is on the side of Georgia." "Some people think that we are  extremists," he pointed out. "I think that the U.S.  Administration and the UN leadership will come to share the view  that there is an acute need to send peacekeeping forces to the  region. I think, however, that this contingent will be  negligible. It will probably consist of servicemen mainly from  the European countries and naturally from Russia, although the  U.S. side will try to see that the Russian `blue berets' are  involved as little as possible. The Americans themselves are  refusing to send their lads to us."    As the ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from informed  sources,  on the last day of his stay in Washington E. Shevardnadze held a  meeting with CIA Director James Woolsey, at the latter's  request, "with just a few people present." According to Petr  Chkheidze, during the talks ways were discussed of effecting  joint activity in the field of combating the illegal  transportation of narcotics to the United States. Both the  sides, he noted, had agreed on joint efforts to put an end to  this criminal activity.</p>

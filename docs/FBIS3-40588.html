These caravans  only can go up to Karachi. India is Pakistan's eternal and  ignoble enemy and it has never been lethargic or absentminded in  harming Pakistan politically, economically, or diplomatically.  Even now, it is punishing the Kashmiri Muslims only because they  aspire for Pakistan and chant slogans of Long Live Pakistan.  Given this situation, if Kazakhstan asks Pakistan for a transit  facility to India, then we can only refuse it. The foreign  minister rightly said that no such caravan can proceed to India  through Pakistan.    The foreign minister and the present government may be asked  to justify the agreement they signed with the Iranian Government  for gas supply to India with a transit facility through  Pakistan, which, according to reports received so far, was  granted without any fee. How can an enemy country, and that too  with which we do not have any transit agreement, be allowed to  have a transit facility? We should reject any proposal, even if  there is any possibility of earning some revenue by allowing the  transit facility, because it is tantamount to helping the enemy.  The nation justifiably is apprehensive and suspicious of this  agreement. The opposition is creating an impression that there  is something else [word indistinct] in the agreement. We do not  think it wise to respect the wishes of a friendly country at the  expense of our own interests. Will Iran allow Pakistan or any  other country to use Iranian territory for providing any  facility to an enemy? Why didn't the foreign minister adopt the  same stand, which he did in the case of Kazakhstan, on Iran as  well?</p>

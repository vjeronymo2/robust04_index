			<p>BFN     [Text] A recent opinion poll shows that the Palestinians of  the occupied territories have been regaining their high morale  since the fall of 1993.    The poll, conducted by the Nabulus Palestinian Studies and  Research Center on 31 May 1994, also shows that Fatah's  popularity is growing.    According to the poll results, published on 14 June 1994,  66.5 percent of the respondents are "optimistic" or "relatively  optimistic" about the future, against 21.5 percent who are  pessimistic and 12 percent who expressed no opinion.    According to an earlier poll by the same center conducted in  February 1994, the ratio of optimists was only 39 percent,  against 37 percent who were pessimistic about the future.    The new poll shows that a 57-percent majority of  Palestinians  approve of the autonomy agreement signed by Israel and the PLO  in Cairo on 4 May and that Fatah's popularity is on the rise.  Thirteen and a half percent said the agreement is "excellent,"  26 percent termed it "a good agreement," and 17.5 percent  believe it is "fair."    Forty percent criticized the agreement, with 17.5 percent  saying it is "bad" and 22.5 percent calling it "not favorable".  Three percent had no opinion.    The Fatah Movement, the main PLO faction, got the support of  44.5 percent of the respondents, who said they would back it in  elections for a representative council. This represents a 7  percent rise over its popularity according to an earlier poll in  April.    In contrast, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), the  major opponent of the peace process, has lost ground and  obtained only 12.5 percent of the votes. In the April poll it  enjoyed the support of 16 percent of the interviewees.    A 2,000-member cross section of the population of the West  Bank and the Gaza Strip took part in the poll.    At the same time, an Israeli opinion poll published on 13  June 1994 showed a contrary trend among Israelis, where popular  support for the Palestinian autonomy agreement fell from 62  percent in September 1993 to 54 percent now.    The poll, conducted by the Israeli Applied Social Research  Institute, shows that only 41 percent of Israelis favor the  geographical extension of the autonomy, in comparison to 50  percent in September, immediately after the signing of the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles.</p>

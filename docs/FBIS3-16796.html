			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yuriy Biragov, chairman of the North Ossetia Supreme  Soviet, and Georgiy Kozayev, first deputy chairman of the  republican government, have sent a telegram on behalf of the  Presidium of the North Ossetia Supreme Soviet to President Boris  Yeltsin of Russia, chairman of the Federation Council Vladimir  Shumeyko, and State Duma chairman Ivan Rybkin. The telegram  states, inter alia, that the proposal made by a number of  Russian deputies to introduce federal rule on the territory of  North Ossetia has given rise to indignation among the people of  the republic. Such proposals are regarded in North Ossetia as  an attempt by certain forces -- I quote -- to play the national  card on the Yugoslav model.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (14): Textile industry may need imports - Cotton farmers and manufacturers are anxious for a good harvest Farmers across Punjab, the heartland of the cotton industry, are anxiously scanning their crops for signs of a good harvest. They are not alone. A bumper crop would draw sighs of relief not only from the farming community but also from the textile industry, which depends on home-grown cotton. The government would be similarly relieved after seeing production of its main export earner fall from 9.1m bales to 7.9m bales last year - almost 40 per cent below the record 12.8m bales produced in 1991. The collapse - blamed on pest attacks and heavy rains - sent shock waves through the economy. For cotton prod- uction underpins a textile industry that employs 35 per cent of the total labour-force, and supplies raw materials to more than 1,000 ginning factories and hundreds of mills. Hopes of a recovery this year, however, have been dented by reports of a poor harvest in Sindh, where prolonged rainfall has ruined much of the crop. Although the southern province produces less than 20 per cent of Pakistan's total output, the Small Landholders and Farmers Association says the situation is no better in Punjab, home to the prog- ressive farmers who once boasted some of the world's highest yields. Mr Ishtiaq Jafari, chairman of the association, claims that only 5m bales will be harv- ested this year, far short of government estimates of 9.5m bales. Pests have destroyed about 30 per cent of the crop, while up to 20 per cent may have been ruined by rain, according to the association. Its gloomy forecasts are rejected by Mr VA Jafarey, adviser to the prime minister on finance, who accuses Mr Jafari of deliberately playing down the industry's prospects. 'The growers say the crop is bad just to push prices up,' he says. 'The real position is far from clear. There has been damage in Sindh, but some parts of the Punjab have harvested more than last year.' Privately, government officials and western econ- omists admit the crop will probably fall short of initial estimates, with output hovering in the region of about 8m-8.5m bales. That may be bad news for the textile industry, which together with raw cotton accounted for 68 per cent of Pakistan's total exports in 1991-92. Domestic consump- tion alone has exceeded 8.5m bales in recent years, and the country could lose Rs7bn (Dollars 228.6m) of foreign exchange earnings if there is insufficient production for overseas sales. If the crop fails to meet even domestic needs, the textile companies would be forced to import higher priced overseas cotton, increasing their costs and squeezing profit margins. The knock-on effect could be dramatic. The textile companies represent almost a third of all companies listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange, and the market invariably falls on bad news from the cotton growers. Aware of the grim prospects for Pakistan if output stagnates, the government has set up a Cotton Resource Group to investigate the fall in production and suggest remedial measures. In its first report, the group blamed the decline not only on persistent rain and viruses, but also on the decision by many farmers to abandon cotton altogether or their failure to protect crops with adequate pest- icides. A large number of farmers have switched to sugar cane in Punjab, prompting a 1.89m-hectare contraction in the area used to grow cotton. Yields per hectare, meanwhile, fell 14 per cent from 574kg to 493kg last year - almost half the 1991-92 total - following an attack of cotton-leaf virus. Some 1.88m bales were lost, worth more than Rs19bn at current market prices. A further 1.65m bales were also lost to attacks by whitefly and aphids. 'I don't think production will ever get back to 12m bales,' says one Punjabi cotton farmer, who asked not to be named. 'Too many hybrid species have been introduced. They are more susceptible to viruses, and the first crop has been horrendous.' In a bid to improve yields, the Cotton Resource Group has drawn up a list of recommendations. Imple- menting them requires significant government intervention at both federal and provincial levels, to ensure that new rules take effect and existing regulations are followed more tightly. The group, for instance, wants the government to reduce pesticide prices by abandoning the 27 per cent tax on imported products, which puts some of the best brands out of reach for small farmers. They also recommend tougher control of pesticide dealers, who have been accused of diluting products. Other demands include improved water supplies, better seed distribution, and new credit facilities for farmers. Although most of the measures have not been costed, the group said Rs55m was need just for research on combating pests and viruses. The Pakistan Central Cotton Committee has gone further and urged the government to give farmers interest-free credit facilities; incentives to combine production in co-operative farms; and crop insurance. This leaves the government with a dilemma. It has few reserves to meet all the farmers' demands, but the knock-on effects of ignoring them may be even more costly. Leaving the cotton industry to market forces could persuade more farmers to switch to other crops, and deprive the textile industry of raw materials. In turn, that could lead to widespread factory closures and higher unemployment. With the ruling Pakistan People's Party relying on rural areas of Punjab and Sindh for the bedrock of its political support, it is unlikely to abandon the industry in a hurry. Indeed, the findings of the Cotton Resource Group have already been endorsed by the National Agriculture Co-ordination Committee, which helps to formulate policy. An injection of government funds and incentives is likely to boost the industry, but it may be only a temporary diversion for a farming community moving inexorably towards a more diversified crop base.</p>

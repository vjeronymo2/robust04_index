			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS STILL FIGHTING FOR HIGHER PAY IN ANAHEIM  </P> <P> Teachers at the Anaheim Union High School District, who staged a one-day strike  last spring, began the first day of school Thursday still locked in a salary  dispute they had thought would be settled with the district during the summer.  </P> <P> "We're not pleased at all," said Norma Potter, president of the Anaheim  Secondary Teachers Assn.  </P> <P> In June, teachers ratified a two-year contract that provides for a 1% salary  increase for the school year that just ended, plus at least 3.2% for this  school year. But the contract also said higher raises could be forthcoming once  it was determined how much extra money the district received from a  $2.5-billion state budget surplus.  </P> <P> The district has since learned it will receive about $5 million more than  expected this school year. But in negotiations last week, teachers were told  that they will not receive any share of the extra revenue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Employee Benefits Cited  </P> <P> Supt. Cynthia F. Grennan said that teachers were, in effect, earning more money  because certain employee benefits, such as medical insurance, have gone up and  the district is picking up the extra costs. With that and other benefits, the  raise actually totals about 7.2% for this year, she said, a number the teachers  dispute.  </P> <P> Throughout the salary dispute, district administrators said they could not  afford a teacher pay raise because more than two years of declining enrollment  had eroded their financial base.  </P> <P> Grennan said the extra money, which amounts to about $259 more per student, is  enough to balance the district's budget -- for the first time in 10 years. But  she said nothing is left over for teacher salary increases exceeding 3.2% for  this year.  </P> <P> Potter said the new contract prohibits any job actions such as another strike.  However, she said, the association has told teachers in back-to-school  newsletters to refrain from working any unpaid overtime.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Extracurricular Duties  </P> <P> She said that would mean teachers would be urged to no longer arrive before  school or stay late to allow students to talk over problems or ask questions.  Or it could mean that teachers would no longer lead extracurricular programs  such as a foreign language club or the science club, for which they receive no  extra compensation.  </P> <P> "It might be hard on students, and teachers don't want to do that," Potter  said. "Most teachers will probably do it anyway even if we tell them not to."  </P> <P> The one-day strike, when nearly 700 of the district's 900 teachers stayed away  from the classrooms, has left bitter feelings in its wake, Potter said.  </P> <P> When she took over as president of the association this summer, Potter said she  went to the Board of Trustees to tell them that the teachers were ready to  "bury the hatchet."  </P> <P> "I told them there was a lot of fence-mending to do and hopefully we could get  off to a good start and that one way to do that was to offer a fair salary  increase," she said. "Apparently they didn't hear that."  </P></p>

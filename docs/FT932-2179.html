			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Gardening: How to curb rampant roses - Robin Lane Fox looks at how the French deal with roses when they go on the rampage and finds that it is, after all, quite a pretty sight ROSES ARE now everywhere and the great flush which we expect in late June is two or three weeks early. My indicator is the single rose Complicata, probably because I grow too much of this extremely uncomplicated plant in rough-mown grass. It was a great favourite with Arthur Hellyer, the FT gardening writer who died last year, and in average years, we expected it to peak around July 1. It is a big, easy shrub and it will even grow upwards into fruit trees, as you can now see at Mottisfont in Hampshire. This year, my index of the season is almost past its best, two weeks ahead of time. In all this earliness, the older roses are leading the way and you need to move quickly if you want to visit gardens at their best: I do, however, find that the earliest are those in direct sunlight and that the Bourbons are still later than accelerated albas, damasks and gallicas. Among festoons of flower on my favourite climbers, on Paul Lede and the flat white Sombreuil, I am relishing some contrary European wisdom. I have the old Royal Horticultural Society handbooks on roses. They were absolutely adamant, those experts of the pre- and post-war era: never allow a rose's stems to criss-cross, chafe or obscure each other. Pruning should occur in early winter or early spring, although the merits of one season over the other sustained an argument for nearly 50 years. Whenever we do it, we should, however, follow the rules: keep those roses fanned out on the wall, open out the centre to the light and cut out excessive stems from as low a point as possible. On one awful fault all of Britain's experts agreed: never clamp the stems of the rose into a bunch and never ever use staples to fix them back on to a post or support. There are old illustrations, deploring this hangman's tactic. For years, therefore, I have pricked myself in cold winters: I have cut out long canes from the ramblers and struggled to open out the centre of Mrs Herbert Stevens in late February. Then, I travelled and noticed a curious thing. In one of the world's best-kept rose gardens, they are breaking all the RHS rules and are none the worse for it. In ancient Egypt, people used to marry their sisters; in India, wives jumped on to their husband's funeral pyre. Society survived: in Bagatelle, the supreme oasis of Paris, the robust climbing roses are being stapled on to posts, chafed and treated as if they are blackberries, trying to escape. They have been treated in this way for years. In spite of the RHS rules, roses like Guinee or New Dawn have made huge trunks with old, cantankerous thorns: in June, they are covered in flowers and, if their stems offend them, the French simply cut them out. They do not bother with the Great Pruning Debate about the relative merits of November and February. They cut them after flowering; they cut them again in autumn if they look a mess; they start from the principle that the roses must look trim and neat and, except in the months when they are forming buds, they simply cut them to keep them tidy. They stand at the opposite extreme to that other heretic whose results encouraged me to disobey in the opposite direction: in Suffolk, the great rosarian, the late Humphrey Brooke, never pruned any of his roses at all unless they died. Two years ago, I first saw this Bagatelle treatment and was not sure that I believed it: in the long term, surely, research would show that the RHS was right. I have just been back to check again. Caroline Testout is bursting with flower and Alberic Barbier is almost looking tidy. Perhaps it is the French climate; perhaps it is the local genius of Bagatelle, but their roses are extremely happy, having escaped from the National Rose Society's guidelines. In this new straitjacket, three French methods impressed me: the stake, the iron cage, and the rope. Roses are clipped and crucified on each of them: nobody is to be seen knitting below these scaffolds, and yet the heads of flower roll happily by the thousand. Would it also work for Climbing Lady Hillingdon? Each method is characterised by a major breach of RHS wisdom: by British standards, the roses are seriously over-planted. The preference is for thick wooden stakes, about a 1ft wide and 6in thick, with none of the frilly ironwork of an English Sloane's metal arbour. On to the two main sides of this post, a climbing rose is planted both front and back and the two plants are then stapled on to the wood and left to 'faire le criss-cross', on the understanding that if any stems flop out of control, they will either be pruned immediately or stapled back into the main tangle. As for the criss-cross, you have never seen the equal, a sort of rosarian cat's cradle in whic everything chafes and refuses to fan out. In Britain, we limit our roses to one stake for each plant and take the greatest care to prune them in winter in case the summer daylight becomes obscured. The iron cage is an alternative with real potential. In Britain, we use iron cages around young trees to keep off deer, malevolent rabbits and other people's teenagers and dogs. In France, cages are used like tall lamp posts on to which climbing roses can be trained to a height of 10 or 12 feet. You need to drive three or four lengths of metal into the ground arranging them round a bed of a yard's diameter, cut as a circle. In the middle, over-planting prevails again because the French rule is to plant three or four climbing roses of serious vigour, defying the RHS rules of density. The roses then run up to the top of the cage and are clipped, comme vous voulez, without any nonsense about November or February. The result, this month, is a great cone of flower, like a stage designer's dream for a summer set. If you need height and emphasis in a summer garden, you should think very carefully about the scope for three or four different climbers, trained up a secure circle of metal posts. The rope trick appeals to me particularly. In Britain we do grow roses on ropes and you can see them superbly at Hyde Hall in Essex, one of the great post-war rose sanctuaries which is open to the general public. I was brought up to believe that roses on ropes were all very well for Queen Mary's rose-garden in Regents Park or the National Rose Society's display garden in Hertfordshire, but they were not a feature which civilised gardeners would want at home. Swags are over the top and recommended rope-varieties are vilely coloured. Who wants a Kordes climber with those boring glossy leaves and harsh red flowers, turning purple in hot weather on a spliced mainbrace at eye-level? The whole inclination of a rose with spirit is to grow off a rope, not on to it: do we have to wait to cut it until the Great Pruning Debate is in season and finally, we can tidy it up for the year? At Bagatelle, they are more broad-minded. Their rope-varieties include rampant white-flowered favourites like The Garland or Alberic Barbier and they are spaced two or three yards apart. These roses are amazingly rampant in Britain, but in France they merely prune them as soon as they have flowered and whenever else they need: as a result, they run like neat little Banksians along ropes of the sort of superior thickness which cordons off partygoers and keeps them out of privileged enclosures. Reared on the RHS, I would have declared it impossible: these varieties are much too rampant, whereas the right sort for ropes should be a winner of the President's Trophy with beastly modern leaves and flowers in a sharp shade of carmine. Vast possibilities now reopen. If ropes will support the prettiest old ramblers and summer pruning suits them, why not edge a long flight of steps with a hand rail of white Bobbie James, pruned in to shape? In France, Felicite and Perpetue are totally happy, being martyred and chopped in July after flowering: could we not direct them on ropes along the backs of borders or as edging to main lines of view? In the gardens of my Old Vicarage, I can now string up a Rambling Rector, an atheist's rope-trick for one of the loveliest white roses in the book. The art is not to raise the ropes too high or to connect them to anything made of dipped red cedar or treated with that awful golden tinge. Pruning can then take place in summer after flowering, not in winter when you catch a chill. As for criss-crossing, let us merely say that in France they do not seem to mind it as much as the old experts suggested. In short, the rules are relative. Did those who designed them in pre-war Britain ever cross the Channel and give French habits the benefit of the doubt? Or do the rules reflect the mentality, class and character of those who draw them up, country by country? I am now turning ropes and considering stakes as well as expensive arches, next year, I will enter the Great Pruning Debate but my contribution will be in late July, with the advice to get out promptly and prune anything in the rose bed which is not capable of a second autumn season.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Observer: Cordon vert If, as seems increasingly likely, the 'ring of steel' around the City of London is made permanent, we know who to blame - Stani Yassukovich, the former Euromarket star whose current hobby-horse is the City Research Project. Yassukovich, former chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe, was explaining how best to improve the UK sterling money markets yesterday when a hack bowled him a low ball. Why was the City's cordon still in place? Yassukovich had no hesitation in admitting that he was a permanent cordon fan. Apart from the fact that many international banking pals liked the roadblock idea, it has also done wonders to speed up his own journey to the City from his home in west London.</p>

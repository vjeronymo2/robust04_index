Plyushch  has received Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the  Argentinian Republic in Ukraine L. Baqueriza. A friendly  conversation took place. The ambassador asked about the course  of discussion by the Ukrainian parliament of the Tripartite  Agreement signed by the presidents of Ukraine, the United  States, and Russia and of the supplement on the elimination of  nuclear weapons on the territory of our state. In the  ambassador's opinion, these documents themselves and the  decisions adopted by the Ukrainian parliament are historic.  They, Baqueriza emphasized, have generated a lot of interest in  Argentina.    Plyushch pointed out that we regard the Tripartite Statement  and the supplement to it as a step of good will and as a step of  good intentions on the part of Russia and the United States with  regard to resolving this problem. All the more so since, in the  course of preparing, signing, and adopting these documents,  Ukrainian President L. Kravchuk acted decisively and correctly.    Touching upon bilateral Ukrainian-Argentinian ties, the two  parties pointed out with satisfaction that the Argentinian  president is expected to come to Ukraine on an official visit.</p>

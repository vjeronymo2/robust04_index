			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Vinayak: "Larger Role for Private Sector in </F> Mining"]    [Text] The Centre's new mineral policy envisages a larger  role for the private sector in areas hitherto reserved for the  public sector. Among the minerals dereserved are: copper,  zinc-lead ores, molybdenum, gypsum, tungsten and others, but  coal, lignite and atomic minerals are still retained in the list  for the public sector.    The new policy favours induction of foreign technology and  participation in mineral exploration and mining for high-value  and scarce minerals. Foreign equity investment in joint ventures  in mining, promoted by Indian companies, will be encouraged.  While foreign investment in equity will normally be limited to  50 per cent, this limitation will not apply to captive mines of  any mineral processing industry. Enhanced equity holding can  also be considered on a case-to-case basis, says the official  statement.    In respect of joint venture mining projects for minerals and  metals in which the country is deficient or does not have an  exportable surplus, a stipulated share of production will have  to be made available to meet the needs of the domestic market  before exports from such projects are allowed.    The country has vast mineral resources, but mining small  deposits scattered all over the country poses problems for big  public sector ventures. The private sector can tap this market  with modest investments and short lead times.    Mining, being labour-intensive, can open up job  opportunities  in backward areas. Efforts will be made to promote small scale  mining in a scientific and efficient manner while safeguarding  vital environmental and ecological imperatives, says the  official statement.    The management of mineral resources has, therefore, to be  closely integrated with the overall strategy of development; and  exploitation of minerals is to be guided by long-term national  goals and perspectives. It is against this backdrop, the  Government has felt the need to spell out the features of its  new policy, the statement said. But the delay in the amendment  of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act 1957  has created some confusion in the field.    Admittedly, the country is not endowed with rich resources  of  high grade ores in strategic areas except bauxite and iron ore.  This underlines the need for adopting scientific mining,  together with beneficiation processes for economic utilisation  of the available mineral resources. Mineral economists however  agree that progress in this direction over the the past three  decades has been rather tardy except in some sectors.  <H5>  Focus on future needs </H5>   At the same time, the Government has to keep in view the  future needs of defence and development and try to ensure  indigenous availability of basic and strategic minerals to avoid  disruption of supplies during emergency.    The national mineral policy has also focussed on aspects  like  sea-bed mining, development of proper inventory, linkage between  exploitation of minerals and development of mineral industry,  conservation of forest resources and protection of environment.    The Centre will consult the States before formulating legal  measures for the regulation of mines and the development of  mineral resources to ensure basic uniformity in mineral  administration and development of the industry in tune with the  national policy aims. The new policy aims at exploring mineral  wealth in the land and in the off-shore areas; developing  mineral resources taking into account the national and strategic  considerations and ensuring their adequate supply and best use  keeping in view the present needs and future requirements; and  promoting necessary linkages for smooth and uninterrupted  development of the mineral industry to meet domestic needs.    In the development of the mineral industry the role of the  Government, both Central and States, has been spelt out in the  1957 Act. This Act has been amended through an ordinance issued  recently to accommodate the reforms envisaged by the Centre in  this field. It is time the Government updates the national  mineral inventory before it opens up this sector to the private  sector, both domestic and foreign.    The Geological Survey of India (GSI) will be the principal  outfit for geological mapping and regional mineral resources  assessment including in its exclusive economic zone. It will  continue to be responsible to draw up action-oriented plans in  association with other agencies.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Proved and Total Reserves of Five Major Ores and Minerals(in million tonnes) |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Proved                   |Total Reserves           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bauxite                  |1,487                    |5,863                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Iron ore                 |10,384                   |21,799                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Iron ore magnesite       |4,506                    |13,732                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Manganese ore            |93                       |548                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chrome ore               |62                       |270                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Copper ore               |216                      |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Special attention will be given to the development of  strategic minerals through systematic investigation of various  potential sources of supply. Further, the focus will be on the  survey and exploration of minerals in which the country has a  poor or just adequate resource base.  <H5>  Ecological problems </H5>   Environmental problems associated with mining activity,  particularly open cast mining, land subsidence in underground  mining, deforestation and atmospheric pollution call for  appropriate strategy for mitigation of their adverse effects on  the eco-system. The new policy says that mining operations shall  not ordinarily be taken up in identified ecologically fragile  and biologically rich areas. Strip mining in forest areas should  be avoided in accordance with prescribed norms and established  forestry practices shall form an integral part of mine  development strategy.    The research and development (R&amp;D) activities will  focus on  the entire gamut of activities from geological survey,  exploration, mining, beneficiation and extraction of minerals to  development of materials. The new policy seeks to promote  development of new technologies for conversion of existing  mineral resources into viable economic resources. Appropriate  technologies shall be developed to enable indigenous industries  to utilise the available resources and as substitutes for  minerals whose reserves are poor.    The R&amp;D efforts shall be directed to find new and  alternative  uses for minerals whose traditional demand is on the wane, says  the statement. Indigenous technology has to be upgraded through  R &amp; D and adoption of technological innovations from abroad.  Research in mining methods shall also receive priority attention.    The liberalisation of imports and reduction of customs duty  on finished metals like copper, zinc and aluminium, has hit  companies like Hindustan [HCL] Copper, Hindustan Zinc [HZL] and  National Aluminium.    While the Government has dereserved 15 minerals, ilmenite,  siliminate and mica have been kept out of this list. Bauxite  also does not appear in the deleted list although India ranks  fifth among bauxite rich countries in the world.    According to Mr. I.G. Jhingran, Secretary to Union Ministry  of Mines, liberalisation of the mining policy will help  indigenous companies to foster closer ties with mineral-rich  Third World countries for joint exploration and development of  ore resources.    Hindustan Copper could explore the possibility of joining  hands with Zambia which has rich copper ore deposits for  exploration and tie up imports of the richer grade ores for  blending with its low grade material. It has acquired  considerable expertise in mining and smelting operations.  Similarly, HZL also could go global with its expertise skills to  find partners abroad to develop the mineral deposits in Third  World countries. HCL is now free to even enter the metal trade.  For expanding its Khetri copper smelter capacity from 35,000  tonnes to one lakh tonnes a year, it could source ore imports  from Zambia to make its products competitive in the market.    These public sector companies are moving from an era of  protection to a competitive market and they should tap all  avenues to make their operations economically viable. HZL is  exploring the scope for setting up a joint venture in Vietnam  for developing a gold ore deposit in collaboration with BRGM  [Geological and Mineral Research] of France.    Mr. A.C. Wadhawan, Chairman, HZL, says some Australian  companies have evinced interest in exploration activities for  base metal ores, including gold, in India. The finds in  Karnataka and other southern States are promising for further  evaluation and assessment. These projects for transition need  long gestation period.    If, meanwhile, LME zinc prices continue to drop, HZL may  find  itself in an unenviable position as the Government is unlikely  to give it any budgetary support to weather the storm. The  Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd., with special skills in  exploration activities, is facing a bleak future as it may run  out of business if foreign mining companies enter the field. It  will have to seek foreign collaboration for survival and  technology upgradation.    Its capacity utilisation has dropped in 1992-93 as the  public  sector mining companies are starved of funds. Even the GSI is  now being asked to gear up to become market-oriented and try to  earn its keep, at least partly. It now remains to be seen how  the mining reforms will help the development of this core  industry and whether it will lure foreign investment for the  industry's rapid development.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] The first deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian  Federation, who visited India as well, reported that at the  request of the Indian party the visit of the Indian Prime  Minister Naramsimha Rao earlier scheduled for June 14-15 had  been postponed for late June - early July.    Interfax interlocutor found it difficult to say what  documents would be signed during Rao's visit to Moscow. "We are  preparing both political documents and serious agreements on  bilateral cooperation. For example, we have a protocol on space  cooperation, there are interesting initiatives in the field of  military-technical cooperation which, in particular, provide for  a joint servicing of the MIG aircraft not only in India but,  possibly, in other countries as well. Now it is still now clear  what we shall manage to achieve," he noted.    Adamishin underlined that "filling up the Russian-Indian  cooperation with a real contents, which is based on pragmatism  and takes into consideration common positions of the parties  (they always dominate) and discrepancies (they also exist, say,  on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation)" is the main aim of  Rao's visit to Moscow.    In Adamishin's words, "the relations within the triangle  Pakistan-India-Russia are rather interesting." "India is our  strategic partner. This was our strategic choice during the  period of confrontation which preserves its significance in the  period of cooperation as well. Earlier we could say against  whom we are. Now we are on friendly terms. This change opens  new opportunities for the Russian-Indian cooperation," he said.    Adamishin specially stressed that "having such a reliable  partner as India in the Southern Asia and in the global scale,  Russia should not loose opportunities which improving of its  relations with Pakistan grants."    When asked about Russia's position with respect to the  dispute between India and Pakistan on Kashmir, Adamishin  answered: "We believe that India and Pakistan should solve this  problem on a bilateral basis. If they are interested in  Russia's mediation let them address us with a joint request. In  other words, we support a bilateral method to solve any problems  and do not refuse to render our assistance."    Adamishin reported that when he was in Islamabad, the  Pakistanis said that it would be easier for them to reach an  agreement with the Indians under the Russian mediation. "It's  natural that I said about this to the Indians but there was no  reaction. However, the Indians declared that they approve our  dialogue with Pakistan, at least they do not show any jealousy  with respect to it," he said.    In Adamishin's words, "under the new situation when a more  serious confrontation and such crises as, say, the Middle  Eastern one, do not block it, the Kashmir conflict acquires a  sharper coloring." "Usually somebody else wins thanks to the  protracted confrontation between two parties. It is necessary  that both Pakistan and India understand this," he underlined.</p>

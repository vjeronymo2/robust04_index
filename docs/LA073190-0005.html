			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ENCINITAS RAIDS LEAD TO DEPORTATION OF 28  </P> <P> After receiving many complaints from Encinitas residents about the presence of  transients and illegal aliens in encampments around the city, the San Diego  County Sheriff's Department and U.S. Border Patrol arrested 29 people Sunday  and deported 28 of them, officials said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies from the Encinitas station and Border Patrol agents entered  four encampments and arrested 29 people for trespassing, said Deputy Larry Van  Dusen, a Sheriff's Department spokesman.  </P> <P> Twenty-eight of those arrested were illegal aliens, said Ted Swofford, a Border  Patrol spokesman.  </P> <P> Twenty-five volunteered for immediate deportation and deportation proceedings  were started against the remaining three, who are suspected of criminal  activities, Swofford said.  </P> <P> The joint action follows complaints to the Sheriff's Department about people  living outdoors or in makeshift huts on property they don't have permission to  use, Van Dusen said.  </P> <P> Complaints have centered on unsanitary conditions at the encampments, illegal  fires, public drunkenness, littering, fighting, drug activity and verbal  harassment of children who pass near the camps.  </P> <P> Sgt. Ron Morse, of the sheriff's Encinitas station, said one or two complaints  a day are received.  </P> <P> "I get calls from grocery store managers about shoplifters, who, as soon as the  back door is open, they come in and steal things," Morse said.  </P> <P> But a community activist said the arrests might be in response to the city  repealing its ban on curbside hiring a few weeks ago, just two days before a  court hearing on a suit filed against the city over the ban.  </P> <P> "Their follow-up strategy is to do the sweeps and follow up on the complaints  of the merchants," said Roberto Martinez of the American Friends Service  Committee, a Quaker service organization. "It's in retaliation because they  lost the ban."  </P> <P> Martinez said the Sheriff's Department might have overstepped its bounds by  working with the Border Patrol.  </P> <P> Van Dusen said it was the first joint effort by sheriff's deputies and the  Border Patrol.  </P> <P> "It got to the point where the complaints were so frequent and the problem  escalating that it was time for the Sheriff's Department to take some larger  action," Van Dusen said.  </P> <P> Border Patrol officials said their agents have worked with other agencies, such  as the San Diego Police Department and the California Highway Patrol, on the  problem of illegal aliens.  </P> <P> "We do it all over," Swofford said. "We just cross paths all the time."  </P></p>

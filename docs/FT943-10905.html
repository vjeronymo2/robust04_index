			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares recover as interest rate worries recede - Market Report The return to existing interest rates in the London money market restored calm in the UK stock market yesterday, enabling the FT-SE 100 Index to recoup Friday's fall. It was a cautious session, at first, until the US dollar rallied from the initial loss which greeted news that the US had launched trade sanction proceedings against Japan. At the close, when the Dow Industrial Average was also forging higher, the FT-SE 100 Index was 14.8 up at 3,097.4. There was some underlying nervousness ahead of publication today of the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin, which is expected to provide further insight into the Bank's views on inflation prospects for the UK economy. Little heed was paid to the disclosure of a slight slowdown in domestic M0 money supply. Equities opened slowly, gathering confidence as short-dated gilts improved and sterling lost some of the gains achieved on Friday when a rise in base rates had appeared on the cards. The market turned quickly, however, when stock index futures opened higher. The upturn was confirmed when the Bank of England provided money market assistance at established rates, implying that base rates will stay at 5.25 per cent, at least for the time being. Equity strategists agree that base rates are likely to rise before the end of the year but forecasters were unsettled by the Bank's actions on Friday. After easing off the top at midsession as London waited to see how Wall Street would react to the trade sanctions move against Japan, the UK market turned higher again as the dollar rallied. The Dow Average, untroubled by a slight rise in the US Purchasing Managers Index in July, showed a gain of 10 points in UK hours. The Footsie closed within a whisker of the day's best, with 3,100 again close at hand. The focus on the blue chips and Footsie futures-listed stocks left the second liners somewhat on the sidelines. At 3,641.4, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index put on only 1.2 points. Seaq volume of 544.7m shares, against 508.7m on Friday, reflected increased turnover in the second half of the session as the market regained confidence. Business in non-Footsie stocks made up just under 60 per cent of the day's total volume. On Friday, retail, or customer, business at Pounds 1.18bn was unexciting, indicating that base rate concern did not prompt any great rush out of equities. There was support for Shell Transport and RTZ, benefiting respectively from strength in oil and metals prices. Other dollar stocks were subdued at first by uncertainty in the US currency but gained ground towards the close. Pharmaceuticals stocks, in particular, continued to find selective support from the international fund managers, and dealers said that institutional activity had reached satisfactory levels by the end of the session. Consumer stocks recovered from the shock suffered on interest rate prospects but made little progress. Interest in the media and similar service sectors was subdued. The focus remained on the speculative sector, with shares in Wm Low, the Scottish supermarket group, continuing to signal market expectations that the Tesco directors will sanction a higher bid in an attempt to drive J. Sainsbury off. The banking sector, experiencing its half-term reporting season, showed mixed movements, with Lloyds Bank still overshadowed by Friday's trading statement. Abbey National, the housing and banking group which reported yesterday, turned lower as analysts expressed some caution over the housing finance results. Across the broader range of industrial stocks, it was the capital goods and engineering sectors which performed best as the market turned its attention back towards the progress of recovery in the UK.</p>

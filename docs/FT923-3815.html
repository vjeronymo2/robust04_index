			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Letter: Hoist with 'Big Bang' petard Sir, I refer to the article 'Warburg ends trade in stocks of 362 companies' (September 5). I am sure that the irony of Lord Parkinson not being able to obtain shares in the company he has recently become a director of, namely Usborne, will not be lost on many of your readers. It was, after all, Lord Parkinson, in those days known as Cecil Parkinson, who was responsible for the legislation relating to 'Big Bang'. In some respects it would, therefore, seem entirely appropriate that he should be one of the people suffering from the shambles which has resulted from that legislation.

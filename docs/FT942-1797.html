			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kmart fails to resolve impasse on restructure The board of Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, yesterday met for the first time since shareholders threw out the company's restructuring plan. However, it took no decisions about what to do next. Earlier this month, a powerful group of institutional investors rebelled over Kmart's plan to sell minority stakes in its specialty retailing subsidiaries. They wanted the company to dispose of them completely, and concentrate on putting its poorly-performing dis-count store operations in order. Yesterday, Kmart's board met for four-and-a-half hours to discuss the next step without reaching a conclusion. Afterwards, the company said: 'The board of directors and management are reviewing the total strategy of Kmart Corp, including the core business and the status of the specialty retail businesses. As soon as decisions are made, they will be announced.' The company said that yesterday's meeting was designed to present the board of directors with a range of options, and it had gone out of its way to discourage the idea that any decisions would be taken at such an early stage. The next board meeting is scheduled to take place on July 19. Under the original plan, Kmart's management had hoped to create classes of Kmart shares tied to the performance of the four specialty retailing subsidiaries. It planned to sell between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of each block of shares to raise money for the refurbishment of the core discount stores. Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive, is believed to favour a revised version of the plan that would involve floating off the subsidiaries but retaining majority stakes in them. This plan would not require shareholder approval because it does not involve the creation of Kmart shares. However, it would still anger institutional shareholders, who want the subsidiaries sold completely.</p>

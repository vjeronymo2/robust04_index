			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Hague Sceptical About Bosnia </F> Plea"]    [Text] The Hague, 22 Feb -- The Netherlands Government has  watered down its position on measures to protect the population  in the other Bosnian "safe areas." Yesterday Foreign Minister  Kooijmans spoke of a certain form of ultimatum after the success  in Sarajevo. He was in favor of action in Mostar, a town where  the population is being hard pressed by the Croats.    This morning the Foreign Ministry spokesman said an  ultimatum  could be an instrument and the same strategy could be considered  as in Sarajevo, but added that "the momentum of this moment"  could be maintained by other measures as well, including the  request for air support if the UN troops in Bosnia were unable  to carry out their duties. This was approved by the Security  Council last summer, and the NATO fighter aircraft have  practised these duties.    At the Defense Ministry there are quite strong objections to  applying the Sarajevo model elsewhere in Bosnia. In every new  action from the air, the danger air actions pose for the ground  troops must be considered carefully, according to military  experts at the ministry. Moreover the heavy means of air  support undoubtedly would lead to an escalation in the violence,  and the UN troops on the ground would in fact have to go into  action out of self-defense.    The United Nations wants 3,000 extra UN troops in Sarajevo  to  monitor the ultimatum. British troops have had to be partially  withdrawn from Vitez for these duties. The British duties also  include protecting the Belgian-Netherlands transport battalion  and taking the lead in a possible evacuation.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Blunkett urges compulsory community service COMPULSORY community service for everyone aged under 21 is proposed by a Labour frontbencher to tackle rising crime and unemployment. The proposals from Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, would mark a significant change of policy direction for Labour towards a scheme similar to National Service without the military component. It comes as ministers and the opposition call for tougher measures to tackle juvenile crime - and for the government to take responsibility for reinforcing 'social values'. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said yesterday: 'The government has got to give a lead to society.' He told the BBC that 'a loss of a sense of purpose among our younger people' was one cause of rising crime. Mr Clarke said he is to restructure the police and prison services, give courts power to send juvenile offenders to secure homes, and increase penalties for offences committed by adults on bail. Yesterday Mr John Major, the prime minister, said in an interview with the Mail on Sunday that 'society needs to condemn a little more and understand a little less'. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman, will also call for tougher penalties for juvenile offenders when he sets out details of his party's revamped crime policies today. Yesterday he backed Mr Clarke in saying there was a need to 'condemn what is wrong' but also to recognise that the young have to be given 'some stake in society'. But Mr Blunkett's proposals, set out in a personal submission to Labour's social justice commission reviewing the party's policies, go a step further. He proposes a nine-month period of full-time community service, linked to adult education, for everyone under 21. Participants would be paid a proper wage which would not replace training or education grants. Making the scheme compulsory would prevent it being seen as only for those who failed academically, he says. Mr Blunkett adds: 'There were some very unfortunate elements of National Service - people were taught to use guns - but I think that the good parts of National Service could be brought to teach people to help each other.' Mr Blunkett also calls for an investigation into the future of mortgage interest tax relief and housing benefit and proposes the integration of the tax and benefit systems. He says: 'We must look to the future and the technology of the 21st century, rather than the constraints and outdated thinking of the decades already passed.'</p>

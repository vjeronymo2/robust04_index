			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tom Wilkie: "Nuclear Firm Chairman Attacks Delay </F> Over Waste"]    [Text] One of the leaders of Britain's nuclear industry  yesterday launched an outspoken attack on government delay and  indecision over nuclear waste disposal.    According to James Hann, chairman of Scottish Nuclear,  electricity consumers will have to pay nearly 1m pounds a week  extra because the Government has postponed a decision on his  company's scheme to store nuclear fuel at its power stations  rather than send it for reprocessing.    Mr Hann voiced the frustration of the industry when he told  a  press conference in London that "every time our industry tries  to take a step forward, it is being halted in its tracks as a  result of operating in the public sector."    He was speaking as Scottish Nuclear announced a 9 per cent  increase in net profits last year to 72m pounds from 66m pounds.  In the past, Scottish Nuclear has been diplomatic in its  dealings with government.    It has also been reluctant to embrace privatisation,  believing that issues of nuclear waste disposal and  decommissioning need to be addressed first.    But Mr Hann yesterday demanded the freedom "to do what we  were asked to do -- to run our companies in the most commercial,  and safest, ways possible. If remaining in the public sector is  going to seriously hinder our progress then partial or even full  privatisation may indeed be the best way forward."    Scottish Nuclear put forward in 1991 its idea that spent  nuclear fuel should be kept in "dry stores" next to its two  nuclear power stations in Lothian and Ayrshire, rather than  being sent to British Nuclear Fuel's Sellafield plant for  reprocessing. The company estimated this would save 45m pounds  a year. The proposal was investigated by a public inquiry 18  months ago.    Mr Hann said: "Although the reporter to the inquiry stated  our plans were sound on both engineering and safety grounds, the  Secretary of State for Scotland has decided that the Department  of the Environment's waste review should consider whether there  should be one national dry store or stores sited at each nuclear  power plant."</p>

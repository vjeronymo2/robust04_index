			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Birkby Pounds 204,000 in the black A turnround from pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.12m to profits of Pounds 204,000 was announced by Birkby for the six months to September 30. The group specialises in the provision of managed rental workspace. Mr Michael Woodhead, chairman, said the results reflected both the successes of the rationalisation programme and the short period of trading since the acquisition of the Birkby Group - formerly Finlan Group - on August 3. He said that the full effect of the acquisition, reorganisation and the capital raising would be seen in the second half. Turnover amounted to Pounds 2.19m (Pounds 5.49m). Earnings per share worked through at 4.8p (509.4p losses). Following the confirmation of the reduction in the company's share capital and share premium account on December 2, a further set of interim accounts was being prepared. Directors said they expected to declare an interim dividend of 1p.</p>

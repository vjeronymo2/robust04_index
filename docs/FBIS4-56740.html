			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa -- General Reynaldo Andino Flores,  defense and public security minister, has said the Armed Forces  are permanent despite the adoption of the voluntary draft. He  has said: "We are accustomed to obeying," and he added this  decision will have many benefits, because it conciliates the  Honduran family.    He has also said this is what the people have wanted. The  government and Congress have approved it unanimously; therefore,  the military organization expresses solidarity with this new  arrangement.    Andino has said the reduction in the number of military  personnel is the responsibility of Congress, which has the power  to do so, but he added the military institution could recommend  a specific number, "because we are supposed to know the Army's  needs."    As for the Armed Forces' future, Andino has said the future  will be brighter, because if the voluntary draft is good for  Honduras, it is also good for them.    Andino has said approval of the voluntary draft shows once  more that "political power has always been above military power."</p>

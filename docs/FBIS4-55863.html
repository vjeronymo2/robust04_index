			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The 14th session of the Chamber of Counties is  expected to resume within an hour. Josip Manolic is expected to  finally resign at this session. A new speaker and new deputy  speakers of the chamber will also be elected. This is what the  Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] deputies have been discussing  since 1000, that is 1100 [as heard], in state president and  party chairman Tudjman's residence.    Opposition leaders, too, are talking behind closed doors at  the Croatian Assembly. Both sides are outlining their strategy  for implementing an interparty agreement. The opposition must  come up with their candidates for deputy speakers in the Chamber  of Counties by 1400. As yet, no one is willing to make any  official statement. This is why we can reveal only an unofficial  and unconfirmed piece of information: the deputy speaker posts  in the Chamber of Counties should be allocated to the Croatian  Liberal Democratic Party and the Croatian Peasants' Party.

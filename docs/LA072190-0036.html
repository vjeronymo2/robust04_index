			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MINNESOTA;  </P> <P> PAPERS ABLE TO BREAK PROMISE TO SOURCES  </P> <P> A $700,000 award against two newspapers that broke a promise of confidentiality  to a political campaign worker has been overturned by the Minnesota Supreme  Court.  </P> <P> The court also held that enforcing a promise of confidentiality under a  doctrine that implies a legal contract where none exists would violate the  First Amendment rights of the Saint Paul Pioneer Press and the Star Tribune of  Minneapolis. The decision on a 4-2 vote overturned a jury verdict in favor of  Dan Cohen, who said he will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Cohen sued the  newspapers for stories in 1982 identifying him as the source of documents  showing the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor was convicted of  shoplifting 12 years earlier.  </P></p>

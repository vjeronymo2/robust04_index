			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei stocks close at high for the year ACTIVE buying by dealers and foreign investors initially supported share prices, and the index fluctuated between buying and profit-taking, finally closing at a new high for the year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average gained 23.78 to 18,788.70 after a low of 18,676.67 and a high of 18,897.61, for a week's gain of 1.35 per cent. Index-linked selling and profit-taking in the afternoon cut some of the early gains. Volume surged to 800m shares from 470m. Heavy buying by brokers on their own accounts lifted activity, advances leading declines by 765 to 294 with 79 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 14.18 to 1,428.20 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed up 3.72 at 1141.51. Dealers bought large-capital issues, while foreign investors focused on electronics and communications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange announced that foreign investors were net buyers for the third consecutive week, purchasing Y128.2bn worth of stocks. Individuals were also net buyers of Y10bn, while banks sold a net Y42.6bn, investment trusts sold a net Y62bn, and insurance companies liquidated a net Y8.8bn. The National Land Agency reported an accelerated decline in land prices last year, heightening hopes that the property market had bottomed out. The real estate sector was the day's top performer, rising 7.27 per cent, as Mitsui Fudosan gained Y70 to Y1,280 and Mitsubishi Estate put on Y52 to Y1,050. Electronics firmed on foreign buying. NEC rose Y59 to Y894 and Sony advanced Y130 to Y4,230. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y15,000 to Y843,000, leading the way for other telecom related issues. Kyowa Exeo rose Y45 to Y1,040 and Japan Radio Y110 to Y1,600. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 306.78 to 19,965.87, in volume 33.2m shares, on active buying by individuals and dealers. Roundup THE region was mixed, with most of the excitement on the upside. HONG KONG's Hang Seng index ended 94.28 higher at 6,341.25, up 4.2 per cent on the week, after a top Chinese official for Hong Kong, Lu Ping, said that he hoped that the British colony's planned new airport could be built by 1997. Turnover was HKDollars 3bn, down from HKDollars 3.7bn. Blue chips posted big gains, airport-related construction companies were also strong and Jardine Matheson, especially sensitive to political developments, jumped HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 48.75. AUSTRALIA was led higher by resource stocks as the All Ordinaries index rose 15.2 to 1,675.9, fractionally lower on the week. Options-related trade boosted turnover from ADollars 260.1m to ADollars 553.1m. Prices were also helped by the government's confirmation that company tax rates will be cut on July 1. NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index gained 15.08 to 1,575.09, 1 per cent lower on the week, with most of the day's rise attributable to Telecom, Fletcher Challenge and Lion Nathan. Telecom gained 8 cents to NZDollars 2.83 after a strong overnight showing in New York, Fletcher Challenge 6 cents to NZDollars 2.51 on strong lumber prices and Lion Nathan 4 cents to NZDollars 3.80, apparently on simple volatility. SEOUL extended its creeping correction to a third straight session, the composite stock index falling 3.67 to 659.02, still only 0.6 per cent down on the week. Brokers said that investors shrugged off the announcement of further interest rate cuts. BANGKOK fell further in afternoon trade although the SET confirmed that it would postpone implementing new, stricter margin requirements. The SET index fell 8.64 to 867.44, 4.9 per cent lower on the week. BOMBAY reopened after a two day holiday with a fall in the BSE index of 37.13 to 2,341.42, down 1.5 per cent on the week.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Management: Mixing MS with work An international campaign to counter workplace discrimination against people with multiple sclerosis has been launched. According to the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, which is spearheading the initiative with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries of Israel, misconceptions about MS often result in the 'inappropriate' management of affected employees. 'Losing a job, cutting short a career or being unable to find suitable work can add to the difficulties and uncertainties of coping with the disease,' it said yesterday at a London briefing. Known to medical science for more than 150 years, MS is one of the most common diseases of the central nervous system and afflicts around 2.5m people around the world, particularly young adults. Its cause is not yet known and its course is unpredictable and variable, but it is not fatal. The IFMSS campaign will encourage employers to look at policies and procedures and 'identify realistic goals based on the principle that people with MS are usually able to continue as contributing, productive employees often with minimal or minor accommodations'. Companies should provide information to employees and senior managers which dispels myths (for example, that MS is infectious), increases knowledge about the different ways that MS affects people, and encourages a supporting environment. 'MS is a condition that affects far more people than is generally realised,' says George Remington, senior medical adviser of Marks and Spencer and a keen supporter of the campaign. 'But it is usually very mild. Few cases are as bad as, say, the cellist Jacqueline du Pre's, which was well known and which alarmed everyone.'

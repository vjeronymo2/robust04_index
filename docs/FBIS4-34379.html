			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 15 Jun (EFE) -- Brazil has purchased 7.5  million dose of vaccines to control a meningitis outbreak in Rio  de Janeiro. This information was released today by Gustavo  Sierra, vice president of the "Carlos J. Finlay" institute,  which produces the vaccines.    Sierra said: "Everything will be better now because there is  the idea of organizing a program for fighting the outbreaks and  even for steady use of the vaccine."    He added: "This order opens a new stage in the use of Cuban  vaccines in Brazil, where they will be used for controlling a  meningitis outbreak in Rio de Janeiro."    Gustavo Sierra, who heads the National Group for Human and  Animal Vaccines, said the vaccines are sold practically all over  Latin America, where they are in various phases of use, medical  registration, or distribution.    He reported that approximately 10 million doses of vaccines  have been exported so far, adding that if the vaccines are  properly used in a program, they can not only control outbreaks  but even the disease itself in the long term.    The "Finlay" institute will advise the Brazilian state of  Rio  de Janeiro in a $325 million "technology transfer" project that  will permit local laboratories to produce the vaccine developed  by Cuban scientists for controlling meningitis.    According to sources in Rio de Janeiro's Secretariat of  Industry and Commerce, the state government is planning to  create a mixed enterprise for selling the vaccine and for  vaccinating some 5 million people under 14 before 1995.</p>

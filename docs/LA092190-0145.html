			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> BEUERLEIN NOT TOLD ABOUT STATUS  </P> <P> After being activated Monday, quarterback Steve Beuerlein hasn't been told  whether he will play in the Raiders' game against the Pittsburgh Steelers  Sunday at the Coliseum.  </P> <P> "I don't know anything," Beuerlein said Thursday.  </P> <P> "I found out about the activation through (the media). And things still haven't  changed around here. I'm working with the scout team. Until I'm told anything  else, I'm just trying to get myself better every day at practice.  </P> <P> "I haven't been told anything about the game or what the plans are. I'm just  resigned to the fact that if I go out here every day and keep confident and  positive, things are going to work out."  </P> <P> Beuerlein, who had a two-week roster exemption, said the Raiders never told him  they were activating him.  </P> <P> "My parents called me up and told me they had heard on a radio broadcast, and  then I read in the paper the next day that I had been activated. That's the way  I found out about it."  </P> <P> The Raider defense, ranked 10th in the NFL last season, is eighth this season.  </P> <P> But the Raider offense, ranked 19th last season, is 23rd this season, far  behind the No. 1 Rams.  </P> <P> Quarterback Jay Schroeder, who had a quarterback rating of 60.3 last season  after throwing eight touchdown passes and 13 interceptions, has improved to  87.1 this season, fourth-best in the AFC.  </P> <P> Injury report: Raider center Don Mosebar and nose guard Bob Golic, who have  ankle injuries, are listed as probable for Sunday's game.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh free safety Thomas Everett is questionable with a head injury;  quarterback Bubby Brister (knee injury) and guard Terry Long (hip injury) are  probable.

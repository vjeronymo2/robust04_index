			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / IMF likely to reject Kenya's plea for aid THE Kenyan government yesterday pressed the International Monetary Fund to resume aid, after effectively floating its currency, the shilling, last week, Reuter reports from Nairobi. Government officials said Mr Musalia Mudavadi, finance minister, and Mr George Saitoti, economic planning minister, discussed Kenya's faltering economic performance with a visiting IMF team, but declined to divulge any details. State radio said the government had taken 'far-reaching financial reforms' and that aid should not be withheld because it 'weakened the economy and caused misery to millions'. The IMF delegation is in Nairobi for two weeks to examine government books to see if Kenya can qualify for aid worth about Dollars 350m (Pounds 246m) a year, frozen in November 1991 to force the government into economic and political reforms. Western donors said they could not prejudge the outcome of the talks but thought it unlikely aid would be resumed soon, despite measures over the past two weeks which should impress the IMF. They said recent action to liberalise the foreign exchange market and grain trade had gone far to meet demands sought by bilateral and multilateral donors, but that the government still had a lot to do. Last Friday, on the eve of the IMF team's arrival, Mr Mudavadi announced the effective flotation of the Kenyan shilling. He said only government debt servicing and imports would use the official central bank exchange rate of around 36 shillings to the dollar, and importers could henceforth freely buy foreign exchange from commercial banks.</p>

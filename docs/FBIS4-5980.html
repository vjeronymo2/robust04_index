			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- World political and  public circles are calling for a peaceful settlement of the  nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula.    Six organizations of Mali including the Malian Committee for  Supporting the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea,  the Malian Peace Movement and the Anti-Imperialist Youth Union  of Mali called an emergency meeting on April 1 and issued a  joint statement.    The statement sharply denounced the United States for  recklessly acting against peace and security of the world by  stepping up preparations for a new war on the Korean peninsula.    Noting that the resumption of the "Team Spirit" joint  military exercises and deployment of Patriot missiles in South  Korea might carry the situation of the Korean peninsula into  extremes, it expressed indignation and apprehensions for the  grave situation created in the region owing to the unjustifiable  attitude of the United States and the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA).    The Political Bureau of the C.C. [Central Committee], the  Communist Party of India (Marxism) in a statement said the U.N.  Security Council should get itself free from the U.S. pressure  and take a fair and aboveboard position to find a negotiated  solution of the problem of nuclear inspection.    The Socialist Party of Kazakhstan in a statement April 5  said  it has in the past invariably supported the efforts of the DPRK  to solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful  way. It expressed the belief that the DPRK's efforts would  surely be successful.    The presidium of the Committee of "Peace and Today" of  Russia  in an appeal sent to the U.N. Secretary General on March 30  pointed out that the all-out campaign launched by the United  States and its followers is aimed at creating another "flash  point" on the Korean peninsula.    The appeal called upon the United Nations to exert due  efforts to solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula in a  peaceful way, not by unjust pressure and policy of strength or  "sanctions".</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: New chief at CS First Boston global bond unit CS FIRST Boston, the New York-based investment banking group, has announced changes to the management of its global bond business which include the appointment of a new head of fixed-income sales and trading. Mr Robert Diamond, formerly chairman and chief executive of CSFB's Pacific subsidiary in Tokyo, will return to New York to run the bank's entire fixed-income sales and trading operation, including its Far East business. He is replacing Mr Thomas Sexton, who has resigned from his post for 'personal reasons'. At the same time, Mr Robert Baylis, a vice-chairman of the firm, will move to Hong Kong where he will take over Mr Diamond's old position as head of the Pacific operating unit. CSFB said the moves were designed to improve the co-ordination of its global bond operations. Mr John Hennessey, the firm's chief executive, said the moves meant CSFB now 'have two of our most senior managers tying together all of our fixed income businesses on a worldwide basis.' The changes at the top of CSFB come at a difficult time for First Boston, the firm's big US subsidiary, which has been hit by some notable staff defections. Last week, for example, the head of fixed-income research left CSFB to join a fund management group, and several other executives in investment banking and capital markets also moved to other firms.</p>

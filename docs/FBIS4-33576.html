The case originated in a previous decision ordering a raid  on  and seizure of the transmitters of the General San Martin FM  radio station, which was operating illegally.    The station owner filed a petition to annul the decision  saying that the station's activity could not be classified as a  crime or even an "administrative violation," and questioning the  Federal Police's authority to seize the transmitters.    Judge Alvarez Canale said the seizure "is perfectly  admissible in our legislation and does not violate any  constitutional guarantees." The judge also said that Decree No.  332/89 authorizes not only the Federal Police but also all  security organizations, if they have a federal court order, to  close stations, lower antennas, or seize the equipment used by  clandestine stations.    The National Telecommunications Commission (CNT) with  Federal  Police support closed five clandestine FM radio stations in  Chubut, four in Trelew, and one in Madryn.    So far the Federal Committee for Broadcasting (Confer) has  closed and seized the transmitting equipment of more than 800  radio and television stations throughout the country.</p>

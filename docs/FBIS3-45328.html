			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "No Relief From Trade Imbalance"] </F>   [Text] China is unlikely to shrug off a trade deficit this  year, although the scale could be trimmed, a senior government  economist said last week.    "It will be an uphill battle for China to yield a balanced  foreign trade, unless the government hits upon extraordinary  ideas," said Wang Huaian, an economist with the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation.    China posted a trade deficit of $12.2 billion last year, the  first since 1989.    Wang said positive factors to boost the country's exports  this year will be undercut by negative ones.    Sustained economic growth, exports of more high-value-added  goods, and a uniform foreign exchange rate for renminbi yuan, as  well as the establishment of more Sino-foreign joint ventures,  all help to keep exports buoyant.    "But inflation and money shortages are still biting and  pushing up export costs," Wang pointed out.    Analysts believe an upward price spiral is possible this  year, although the government has pledged to stabilize or even  lower prices before China's Lunar New Year, which falls early  next month.    And despite the central government's imposition of a  credit-tightening policy last July, Wang said a brisk domestic  market will revive and squeeze exports.    "The convergence of renminbi foreign exchange rates is a  coin  of two sides," he said, suggesting that the move could hardly  yield a much-needed boost to exports.    "This is because most Chinese enterprises, including  foreign-funded ones, had already done the bulk of their exports  according to the swap market rate, which is close to the current  uniform one of $1 to 8.7 yuan," he explained.    Similarly, China should not be under the delusion that  higher  import costs resulting from the unification could sharply reduce  imports.    A considerable part of China's trade in hard currency had  been carried out at the swap market rate before the uniform one  took effect on January 1.    "In short, the positive effect of the single-rate system,  which formally devalues the yuan, has been watered down," Wang  said.    In the meantime, Wang expects China to maintain high growth  this year even though the government has lowered its estimate of  expansion to 8 percent to 9 percent, compared with the 13.2  percent of last year.    "It would be good enough if China caps the growth rate for  1994 under 10 percent," he said.    Even with 10 percent, China's economy will grow more rapidly  than most of other nations and regions.    Hence the sustained high demand for imports, at least for  state key projects designed to improve infrastructure.    "As a developing nation, China can hardly cut all these  imports and totally rely on its own resources," Wang said.    "China will face a tougher economic scenario if it chops  imports abruptly."    This is especially true as China moves toward rejoining the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).    "We have to open our markets wider for foreign products  after  our re-entry into Gatt, which demands free and fair trade," he  said.</p>

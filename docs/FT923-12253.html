			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Change in saving patterns expected DRAMATIC changes in the pattern of consumption and savings in economies across the world in the rest of the 1990s will be followed by a radical restructuring of financial institutions, a report published today predicts. Mr John Ginarlis of PA Consulting Group says that forms of investment based on borrowing, such as home-buying, may soon no longer be regarded as worthwhile options for investors. House-buying will return to being a consumer activity from which no long-term return is expected. Low inflation, low monetary growth and high real interest rates have turned off the supply of cheap money that enabled the housing market to expand. When consumers realise that the housing market will not reinflate, there will be a permanent change of underlying attitudes towards investment, Mr Ginarlis says. He says savings will remain a more attractive investment than property for the rest of the 1990s, and predicts that the pool of liquid savings in advanced industrial economies will grow steadily. The level of personal savings will rise, partly because of the increasing average age of the population. The process is expected to accelerate as governments introduce tax regimes that erode the concessions for borrowing, such as mortgage-interest relief in the UK, and introduce incentives for savers. Mr Ginarlis predicts that financial institutions such as banks and building societies which until now have been primarily lenders will become mainly savings-industry specialists. Investment advisory services which until now have been available only to the high net-worth individual will be developed for a broader market. Sophisticated deposit schemes that offer the customer a guaranteed rate of return using money-market techniques such as hedging will appear. Financial-services companies will have to reduce their cost bases, including their branch networks, and try instead to improve their productivity. Mr Ginarlis warns that financial-services companies that treat recent changes as merely a cyclical downturn in the market run the danger of discovering too late that a rising cost base has priced them out of existence.

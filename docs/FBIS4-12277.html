			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible security source has stated the  following: At about 2000 last night, Wednesday, 6 April 1994,  very powerful explosions were heard throughout the city of  Dhamar and its suburbs. Amid the roaring explosions, perhaps  caused by the bullets and shells fired from various light,  medium, and heavy weapons, the streets of the city and the  surrounding villages became empty of pedestrians and citizens,  who sought refuge in their homes. As a result, panic prevailed  in the region. It was later discovered that the source of the  explosions was the Ba-Suhayb camp, south of the city, and that  forces in the camp arbitrarily fired shells toward the inhabited  mountains and some government departments in Dhamar, including  the Dhamar governorship, the governorate's security department,  and other government offices. The shelling also included the  headquarters of the Central Security Forces and the Republican  Guard, whose personnel maintained complete calm and self-  restraint to avoid any escalation.    When, after more than an hour, the powerful explosions and  firing of bullets stopped, and in light of the contacts and  investigations that were held by competent authorities in the  govenorate, it was revealed that guards at the camp's gate had  been arbitrarily fired at by an unidentified speeding red sedan.  None of the guards was injured. Immediately, the camp's troops  mobilized their armored vehicles, various types of machine guns,  and a tanks battalion, which assumed an offensive posture.  Then, the region was set alight when the troops fired hundreds  of shells, as explained above.    The security source added: According to all the available  information and contacts that have been held by competent  authorities there was no acceptable justification for such an  irresponsible act by the Ba-Suhayb troops.    The source added: We warn against the gravity of that act  which aims at disturbing the national security, stability, and  social and political safety. We warn against the gravity of  committing such provocations. We demand that the joint military  committee expeditiously investigates all the circumstances of  this incident and informs the people of the entire truth. God  testifies to our true intentions.</p>

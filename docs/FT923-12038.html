			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Italy The odds seem stacked against poor old Italy. Mr Giuliano Amato, the new prime minister, talks bravely of curbing the budget deficit and privatising sclerotic state industries. The reality is that there is no political consensus behind reform. The Mafia seems to be doing its utmost to destabilise the new government and the lira is trading close to its absolute floor of L765 against the D-Mark, although the official discount rate has been raised twice in the last month. The exchange rate has come to symbolise Italy's ambition to be a part of mainstream Europe. If Mr Amato cannot hold it, the danger looms of a return to the dark days of the 1970s, characterised by impotent government, repeated devaluation, inflation, capital flight and terrorist outrage. Partly because the alternative is so grim, there is an outside chance that Mr Amato may succeed. The rise in interest rates has opened up an 8 percentage point gap between short-term rates on the lira and the D-Mark. That should be enough for the time being to make speculators think twice about driving the lira below its floor. Maybe external pressure on the currency, combined with the activities of the Mafia at home, will stiffen popular resolve to accept change. Reform was never going to be anything but messy - witness the outraged reaction to the government's wise decision last Friday to wind up Efim, the loss-making state holding company. Still, the task is a Herculean one. Each rise in interest rates pushes up the cost of servicing the government's mammoth debt. To help sell its treasury bills even at these higher rates, Mr Amato has already had to stoop to the ruse of a special tax on bank deposits. That looks like the action of a government running short of practical ideas. It hardly creates a propitious climate for launching large scale privatisation issues in the equity market. If Mr Amato succeeds in staving off the lira's day of reckoning, Italian equities will look cheap, especially after yesterday's 6 per cent fall. The odds, however, are so long and the consequences of failure so dire that international investors, who have been largely out of the market for the past year, would do best to continue watching from the sidelines.</p>

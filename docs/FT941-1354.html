			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Sun Alliance The practice of laying down reserves against future claims makes insurance companies' figures extremely difficult to judge. Releasing reserves against mortgage indemnity and subsidence claims yesterday helped Sun Alliance deliver full year results well above the stock market's expectations. That is not to belittle the underlying improvement in underwriting performance. Premium income in the UK actually fell last year as the company surrendered market share in the interest of profit. But Sun Alliance cannot watch its UK business shrink indefinitely. The company needs to show it can compete with low-cost insurers such as Direct Line, which are turning their attention to household as well as motor insurance. True, 1m policyholders buy directly from Sun Alliance, mainly through newspaper advertisements. But it is doubtful whether that business has the technology or low enough costs to compete on price with telephone-based sellers. The 700 loss-making insurance broking offices operated under the Swinton banner might help defend UK market share. But since Swinton lost around 200,000 customers last year, time is running out. Having underperformed the market by 30 per cent since last summer, though, the shares stand on a yield of 5.5 per cent and a multiple of only nine times this year's forecast earnings. On all but the most pessimistic view of the insurance cycle, Sun Alliance - in common with the rest of the sector - is starting to look cheap.</p>

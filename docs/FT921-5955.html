			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Italy curbs immigration ITALY has tightened its immigration laws, making it easier for the authorities to expel illegal immigrants. A decree approved by cabinet this week permits immediate expulsion of illegal immigrants and limits the scope of appeal for immigrants accused of committing crimes. The government has been obliged to tighten the laws, first introduced in 1990, because of the ease with which immigrants have been able to stay in Italy. It has been relatively easy for immigrants to contest and delay expulsion orders through resort to regional appeal courts. At the end of December only 4,000 of the 23,000 expulsion orders had been carried out. This process will be speeded up and resort to appeal limited. Local authorities have lacked funds to repatriate illegal immigrants or those with proper documents accused of crimes. Now, the government has agreed to increase funds for local administrations to deal with immigration problems from L30bn to L60bn (Pounds 27.7m) a year.</p>

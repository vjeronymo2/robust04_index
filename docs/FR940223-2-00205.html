In regulations implementing Title III, the Secretary has identified the institutions that meet these requirements. 34 CFR 608.2(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon the extensive congressional findings concerning HBCUs, and consistent with congressional and Executive Branch efforts to enhance and strengthen HBCUs, the Department interprets Title VI to permit these institutions to participate in student aid programs established by third parties that target financial aid to black students, if those programs are not limited to students at the HBCUs. These would include programs to which HBCUs contribute their own institutional funds if necessary for participation in the programs. Precluding HBCUs from these programs would have an unintended negative effect on their ability to recruit talented student bodies and would undermine congressional actions aimed at enhancing these institutions. HBCUs may not create their own race-targeted programs using institutional funds, nor may they accept privately donated race-targeted aid limited to students at the HBCUs, unless they satisfy the requirements of any of the other principles in this guidance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, an HBCU might award race-targeted aid to Mexican American students or to white students to promote diversity under Principle 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Transition Period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the Department anticipates that most financial aid programs that consider race or national origin in awarding assistance will be found to be consistent with one or more of the principles in this final policy guidance, there will be some programs that require adjustment to comply with Title VI. In order to permit colleges time to assess their programs and to make any necessary adjustments in an orderly manner_and to ensure that students who already have either applied for or received financial aid do not lose their student aid as a result of the issuance of this policy guidance_there will be a transition period during which the Department will work with colleges that require assistance to bring them into compliance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This transition period also applies to recipients of Federal financial assistance that are not colleges, e.g., a nonprofit organization that operates a scholarship program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department will afford colleges up to two academic years to adjust their programs for new students. However, to the extent that a college does not need the full two years to make adjustments to its financial aid programs, the Department expects that the adjustments will be made as soon as practicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No student who is currently receiving financial aid, or who has applied for aid prior to the effective date of this policy guidance, should lose aid as a result of this guidance. Thus, if a college determines that a financial aid program is not permissible under this policy guidance, the college may continue to provide assistance awarded on the basis of race or national origin to students during the entire course of their academic program at the college, even if that period extends beyond the two-year transition period, if the students had either applied for or received that assistance prior to the effective date of this policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Legal Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Education is responsible for enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , at institutions receiving Federal education funds. Section 601 of Title VI provides that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. 42 U.S.C. 2000d.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FTA is engaged in an ongoing effort to streamline and simplify the administration of its programs. To this end, the agency has expanded the authority extended to grantees to incur costs for operating assistance projects prior to grant award to cover planning and capital costs as well. In fiscal year 1994 FTA extended this authority to non-operating projects funded with current year apportioned formula funds. This automatic pre-award spending authority permitted a grantee to incur costs on an eligible transit capital or planning project without prejudice to possible future Federal participation in the cost of the project or projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Expanded Coverage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because this provision has worked so well to reduce the paperwork burden on both the grantee and FTA regional offices, effective as of October 1, 1994, the FTA is further broadening this authority. Authority to incur costs for Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula, Metropolitan Planning, Urbanized Area Formula, Elderly and Persons with Disabilities, Nonurbanized Area Formula, State Planning and Research, and Title 23 Interstate Substitute Transit projects in advance of possible future Federal participation is extended to apply to fiscal year 1995 FTA funds apportioned in this Notice for the programs listed above, as well as funds to be apportioned in fiscal years 1996 and 1997. Carryover amounts for these programs are also included in this authority. This pre-award authority is also extended to projects intended to be funded with STP or CMAQ funds transferred to FTA in fiscal years 1995 and 1996, provided that the projects are contained in an approved STIP. The flexible funds would no longer have to be transferred to FTA before the authority could be used. The two-year limit for these flexible funds corresponds to the more rigorous financial constraint contained in the metropolitan planning regulation for non-attainment and maintenance areas. The authority does not apply to New Starts or Bus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similar to FTA's Letter of No Prejudice (LONP) authority, the conditions under which this authority may be utilized are specified below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) This pre-award authority is not a legal or moral commitment that the project(s) will be approved for FTA assistance or that the FTA will obligate Federal funds. Furthermore, it is not a legal or moral commitment that all items undertaken by the applicant will be eligible for inclusion in the project(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) All FTA statutory, procedural, and contractual requirements must be met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) No action will be taken by the grantee which prejudices the legal and administrative findings which the Federal Transit Administrator must make in order to approve a project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Local funds expended by the grantee pursuant to and after the date of this authority will be eligible for credit toward local match or reimbursement if the FTA later makes a grant for the project(s) or project amendment(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The Federal amount of any future FTA assistance to the grantee for the project will be determined on the basis of the overall scope of activities and the prevailing statutory provisions with respect to the Federal-local match ratio at the time the funds are obligated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) For regular FTA formula funds to which this authority applies, the authority expires with the lapsing of fiscal year 1997 funds. For flexible funds transferred from FHWA, the authority expires with the lapsing of fiscal year 1996 funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Environmental and Other Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FTA emphasizes that all of the Federal grant requirements must be met for the project to remain eligible for Federal funding. Some of these requirements must be met before pre-award costs are incurred, notably the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Compliance with NEPA and other environmental laws or executive orders (e.g., protection of parklands, wetlands, historic properties) must be completed before state or local funds are advanced for a project expected to be subsequently funded with FTA funds. Depending on which class the project is included under in FTA's environmental regulations (23 CFR 771) the grantee may not advance the project beyond planning and preliminary engineering before FTA has approved either a categorical exclusion (refer to 23 CFR 771.117(d)), a finding of no significant impact, or a final environmental impact statement. The conformity requirements of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR 51) also must be fully met before the project may be advanced with non-Federal funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

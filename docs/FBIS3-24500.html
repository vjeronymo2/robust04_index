Yegorov; UDC 621.382] </F>   [Abstract] Several options for parallel optical linkages  between simple two-layer neural-like uniform computing  structures, based on a light modulator - photodetector couple  are examined. Two design methods of optical multilayer three-  dimensional computing devices are possible: With the first  method, the complex functional circuits, made for each layer  using the traditional silicon p-n-technology are connected to  each other by optical information channels. With the second  method, the layers are formed based on simple optical logic  circuits. The advantages and disadvantages of both methods are  discussed. Block diagrams and functional circuits of the  structures and samples of parallel computations including  simultaneous storage of the results and initial information are  provided with the text. The examples of two-layer optical  computing structures are functionally not perfect, but a  combination of such devices in multilayer computing structures  increases their functional capacity and flexibility by a several  orders of magnitude, and can be effectively employed for binary  and neural computations.

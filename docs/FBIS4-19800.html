			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patrick Jarreau on "SOFRES" poll conducted for LE </F> MONDE and RTL]    [Excerpts] One year after taking office, the Balladur  government is still judged relatively favorably by the French:  32 percent give it a higher rating that its Socialist  predecessor, which is favored by only 23 percent. However,  one-third of those questioned (and almost one-half of them if  the "no opinions" are added) cannot decide or preferred not to  speak out in favor of either government.

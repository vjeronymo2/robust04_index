			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> ZACCARO ASKS CONVICTION REVERSAL  </P> <P> Lawyers for John A. Zaccaro Jr. asked the Vermont Supreme Court today to throw  out a cocaine-peddling conviction against the son of unsuccessful 1984  Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine A. Ferraro.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys argued Zaccaro's constitutional rights were violated in 1986  when an undercover Vermont state trooper entered his Middlebury apartment and  bought $25 worth of cocaine.  </P> <P> Justices took today's oral arguments under advisement.  </P> <P> Zaccaro, 25, served 90 days under house arrest, performed 530 hours of  community service and made a $1,500 court-imposed donation to a Burlington  youth group last year after his April, 1988, conviction on a charge of selling  a quarter-gram of cocaine to the undercover officer while he was attending  Middlebury College.  </P></p>

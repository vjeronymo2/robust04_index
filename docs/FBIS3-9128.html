			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] President of the Republic of Kosova  Dr. Ibrahim Rugova held a news conference today. Ramadan  Mucolli reports from Prishtina:    [Mucolli] At the beginning of the conference, President of  the Republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova acquainted the  reporters with the Serbian police repression against the  Albanian people of Kosova. During the last week, this repression  was manifested in the form of raids, harassments, arrests,  interventions into educational institutions, etc. In this  framework, he defined as a drastic case the siege to Seraj  village in the Leposaviq commune and the raids on 22 homes in  this village. Rugova assessed that repressive measures in the  northernmost villages in Kosova are carried out with the  intention of obliging Albanians to leave their territories.    President Rugova also commented on the sending of summons  for  recruiting the Albanian youngsters to the Serbian Army and added  that we should express gratitude to those who refused to  participate in the wars waged in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia,  because in this way, they have made a contribution to stopping  the war.    Mr. Rugova also stressed that many Serbian civilians have  recently been involved in brutal interventions against the  Albanian institutions and the harassment of Albanians. Rugova  also warned these civilians, if they are from Kosova, not to  play with fire and causing greater enmity between Albanians and  Serbs.    In the course of the sequestration of the buildings of  various Albanian cultural, educational, and scientific  institutions in Kosova, President Rugova mentioned the  sequestration of the building of the High Pedagogical School of  Gjakove. As a testimony to the Serbian attempts to recolonize  Kosova, Rugova underlined the warning against starting to  construct buildings for refugees or laying aside land for  newcomers, as well as against threats of proceedings against  Albanian refugees who may return to Kosova.    President Rugova then assessed highly the rallies of  Albanians in Germany, England, and Norway as successful efforts  for the internationalization of the question of Kosova and their  political will. On this occasion, he thanked all the persons  and institutions of those countries that joined the rallies and  supported the demands of Albanians.    Mr. Rugova particularly hailed the debate on Kosova in the  Belgian Parliament, especially the statement of Foreign Minister  Willy Claes that the status of 1974 for Kosova is surpassed [as  heard].    Answering a question on the signing of the agreement between  the Muslims and Croats and an eventual similar model in the case  of the Albanians of Kosova, President Rugova stressed that I  hail the Muslim-Croat agreement and consider it to be a first  step in stopping the war in Bosnia.    Further on, he stressed that ideas for federations and  confederations have existed before in the Balkans but, as  testified in the case of former Yugoslavia, they have been  unsuccessful. We are not against integrations on the basis of  new principles, but first of all, every people should be  independent and should then decide on relations with others.    President Rugova also answered other questions by reporters.</p>

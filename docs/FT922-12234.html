			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / British companies win record 127 Queen's awards BRITISH COMPANIES have won a record 127 awards for exports in the latest Queen's awards for export and technology, which are announced today. The number of applications for export awards was the highest for 13 years, reflecting companies' determination to seek new markets while domestic demand is slow. Although Britain's biggest enterprises are heavily represented, the winners include such smaller companies as Fortnum and Mason, the luxury London retailer, which has opened outlets in Japan since it began its export department in 1981. J Barbour and Sons, best known for its outdoor clothing made of oiled cotton, now sells in 25 markets while Grants of Dalvey has moved on from bagpipe manufacturing to make sporrans and hip flasks popular in Germany, Japan and 23 other countries. The Queen's awards were introduced in 1966. They are made on the advice of the prime minister helped by a committee which comprises representatives of industry, commerce, trade unions and the government. Rolls-Royce won for its sales of aero-engines and British Steel's general steels division also won an export award. ICI won three awards, two Queen's awards for technology and one for exporting purification technology. The smallest winner is Associated Timber Services, with just nine staff. UK-based Japanese companies which won awards include Nissan Motor, the car maker, and Yamazaki Machinery, a producer of machine tools. Both export to Japan. The BBC won one of 38 technology awards for the development of the Nicam digital television system, while Portakabin was rewarded for its development of luxury portable offices. Electronics and computers dominate the technology awards list. Winners include IBM and Oxford University - their jointly developed computer programming language is used by financial services companies - and Oxford Lasers, whose copper laser is powerful enough to guide telescopes.

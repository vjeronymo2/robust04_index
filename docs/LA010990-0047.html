			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURTAX  </P> <P> As expected, The Times still exhibits the Rostenkowski/Bentsen syndrome with  its sour grapes editorial "On Surviving the Medicare Crunch" (Dec. 26).  </P> <P> The catastrophic Medicare surtax law was the first time in history that a  single segment of the population was to be required to pay a surtax for a much  larger segment who paid nothing, including 2.8 million disabled, 1.2 million  spouses of disabled and unknown quantities of AIDS patients.  </P> <P> And it was a 15% surtax! If the average taxpayer were asked to pay even a 1%  surtax for something, he would balk. It was no surprise that the grass-roots  middle-income elderly taxpayers caused a veritable firestorm of revolt,  culminating in repeal of the infamous P.L. 100-360.  </P> <P> National health care, including long-term care, is badly needed but the  financial burden must be distributed across the taxpaying public -- the same as  any tax. It should not wholly burden a small minority.  </P> <P> My only regret is that when President Bush signed the repeal law that there  were not fountain pens given to Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), Sen. Lloyd  Bentsen D-Texas), the American Assn. of Retired People and The Times!  </P> <P> HERBERT A. BELL  </P> <P> Hemet  </P></p>

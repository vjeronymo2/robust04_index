			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In relation to the issue of expanding the share of  car and mobile phones using the U.S. Motorola system in the  Japanese market, the Japan Mobile Communications Corporation  (also known as IDO), which takes charge of business operations  in the Tokyo and central Japan areas, decided on 4 March to  build an additional 159 Motorola-system ground relay stations  and accept most other Motorola demands. With this, the Ministry  of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT], Toyota Motor Corporation  -- IDO's major shareholder -- and other concerned parties have  begun discussing financial and other support measures, and there  is now a strong possibility for IDO and Motorola to reach a  final agreement early next week [week of 6 March]. As a result,  the U.S. trade representative's (USTR) announcement of a list of  Japanese products subject to trade sanctions under Provision  1377 (on telecommunications) of the U.S. Trade Act, originally  scheduled for 17 March, can probably be avoided.    Since U.S. President Bill Clinton has made the decision to  revive the Super 301 Provision (on the identification of and  sanctions against countries guilty of unfair trade practices) of  the U.S. Trade Act on 3 March, and overall U.S. criticism of the  closedness of the Japanese market is on the rise, Japan seems to  have decided to make major concessions to avoid any further  deterioration in Japan-U.S. relations.    According to an informed source, IDO and Motorola, through  their unofficial negotiations so far, have agreed that IDO would  purchase Motorola-made equipment for 159 relay stations, which  would be the basis for expanding business operations using the  Motorola system, and install them in the IDO business areas, as  Motorola demanded. They are further discussing the final details  for: 1) IDO's reallocating a portion of the frequencies it uses  to service NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation]  system car and mobile phones for the Motorola system; and 2)  IDO's purchase of around 100,000 units of Motorola car and  mobile phones.    In view of this development in IDO-Motorola negotiations,  Toyota Motor and Tokyo Electric Power Company, Inc., IDO's major  stockholders, and the MPT have entered into deliberations on the  means for financial support. Concrete measures being considered  include a debt guarantee for IDO's borrowings and offering  low-interest loans from the Japan Development Bank.    It is also reported that the USTR has likewise begun its  final assessment and examination of the IDO-Motorola agreement,  and will announce its decision on the imposition of sanctions  against Japan in a few days.    In late January, IDO proposed to build 134 additional relay  stations for the Motorola system by the end of March 1997 to  expand the Motorola-system service area to a size comparable to  that of the NTT system.    Motorola countered with a proposal for IDO to build 159  relay  stations by February 1995, increase the number of its service  frequencies, and purchase 225,000 Motorola cellular phones.    IDO started its Motorola-system services as a result of the  June 1989 Japan-U.S. telecommunications agreement. As of the  end of 1993, the NTT system accounted for about 310,000  terminals, and the Motorola system, 10,000-odd units of all IDO  subscribers. This became the basis for the USTR's 15 February  claim that "the Japanese Government has violated the 1989  Japan-U.S. agreement." The USTR then indicated that the United  States was considering a list of Japanese products to be subject  to sanctions under the U.S. Trade Act.    While the Japanese Government had refuted the charge, saying  "the 1989 agreement merely provided for the allocation of  frequencies," it has decided to compromise in the end to avoid a  deterioration of bilateral relations.</p>

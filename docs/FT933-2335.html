			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Glaxo wins lawsuit on Zantac patent GLAXO, Europe's largest drugs company, yesterday won its crucial lawsuit against Novopharm of Canada over the US patents for Zantac, the world's best-selling medicine. Zantac, an ulcer treatment, is vital to the UK group. In the last financial year it generated sales of Pounds 2.17bn, equivalent to 44 per cent of group turnover. About half Zantac's sales are in the US. The case was brought by Glaxo after Novopharm, a manufacturer of generic (unbranded) drugs, sought government permission to make generic Zantac. The Canadian group had challenged Glaxo's patents on the grounds that the version of Zantac marketed by the British company, known as Form Two and whose patents expire in 2002, was no different from another version, Form One, which has never been marketed but whose patents expire in December 1995. The victory comes as a significant relief for Glaxo. Had Novopharm won, it would have been able to market generic versions of Form Two Zantac from January 1996. Sales of drugs whose patents expired recently have halved within 12 months. Novopharm was unavailable for comment last night. Normally, such cases go to appeal. Worldwide sales of Zantac increased 11 per cent in the last financial year. Sales in the US rose 13 per cent. Dr Richard Sykes, Glaxo's chief executive, said Zantac's performance was remarkable. However, this month he warned that there remained other threats to the Zantac franchise besides the Novopharm challenge: The expiry next year of the US patents of Zantac's main competitor, SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet. Zantac will have to compete with cheap generic versions of that drug. Generic versions of Form One Zantac after its patents expire at the end of 1994. New-generation drugs, such as Astra's Losec. However, in spite of those threats, Dr Sykes insisted, Zantac's franchise had a positive future.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Canadian groups loosen family ties - Bernard Simon looks at empires parting with corporate treasures FACING each other across Phillips Square in downtown Montreal are the flagship branches of two of Canada's most venerable retailers: The Hudson's Bay Company department store and Henry Birks &amp; Sons, fine jewellers. Birks and The Bay were for many years among the country's best-known family businesses. Montreal's upper-crust Birks family had presided over the jewellery chain for 114 years. The Bay, whose roots go back to the 17th century fur trade, was 65 per cent owned by Mr Ken Thomson, son of Lord Thomson of Fleet, the publishing magnate. However, both companies have recently loosened their family ties. Last November, Mr Thomson sold more than half his Hudson's Bay shares to public investors for CDollars 545m (USDollars 410m), leaving him with only a 25 per cent stake. Birks, strapped for cash and under court protection from its creditors, was rescued earlier this year by Borgosesia, the Italian luxury goods group. The recession has been hard on families that have long dominated Canada's business landscape. One after another, they have been forced to part with some or all of their corporate treasures. Some empires have all but disappeared. A group of international banks has ousted Paul, Albert and Ralph Reichmann from the helm of Olympia &amp; York, the property developer which filed for bankruptcy protection last year. O&amp;Y is now being gradually dismembered. The empire controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family has fallen victim to the plunge in North American property values. Brothers Peter and Edward Bronfman have pruned their corporate tree in the past six months. They have sheared away about CDollars 4bn worth of assets, and stand to lose control of Trizec, North America's biggest publicly-traded property developer, under a debt-relief plan filed in early August. Edward Bronfman has substantially reduced his interest in key holding companies. The Southam family has relinquished control of Canada's biggest newspaper chain. Failure to control labour costs and weak management pushed Southam into losses of more than CDollars 400m in the past two years. The company is now controlled by Mr Conrad Black, proprietor of the UK's Telegraph group, and by Power Corporation of Montreal. The Steinberg supermarket chain, once Quebec's biggest and most innovative food retailer, has disappeared. It was weakened by slipping market share, high labour costs and dissension within the founding family after the death of patriarch Mr Sam Steinberg. Even among the surviving family businesses, some have shrunk, while others are financially weakened or riven by discord. A struggle surfaced last month between Wallace and Harrison McCain over control of McCain Foods, the international potato-chip and frozen-food group based in rural New Brunswick. The break-up of so many family empires has far-reaching implications for Canadian business. Some of the country's biggest companies now find themselves without a controlling shareholder, leaving them vulnerable to takeover. The contraction of the family fortunes is a blow to national pride. The thought of Birks Jewellers falling under the sway of an Italian company sends shivers down many a genteel Anglo-Canadian spine. 'It's sad in terms of a nation's life,' says Mr Peter Newman, who has chronicled Canada's business families in several books. 'If you were involved in the local community, you could depend on these companies because they had a feeling for the country.' The growth of the family-owned business in Canada was spurred by lax competition laws and disclosure requirements. A strong, nationwide banking system also nurtured many family empires. Not all Canada's blue-blood families have fallen on hard times. Many have managed to ride out the storms; some are even prospering. Now that the Reichmanns have lost control of their family business, the wealthiest Canadians, according to Forbes magazine, are Mr Thomson (who still controls an international publishing, travel and property empire) and the secretive Irving brothers, James, Arthur and John, whose fortune centres on oil, gas and forest products in Canada's Atlantic provinces. The Bata shoe empire remains intact, as does the food, supermarket and forestry group controlled by Mr Galen Weston and his family. Mr Conrad Black's wealth has grown appreciably since he bought control of the UK's Telegraph group in 1985. His stake in Hollinger, the company which holds his publishing interests, is currently worth about CDollars 242m. On balance however, family money carries less clout than it used to. Mr Jim Muir, director of research at Richardson Greenshields, a (family-owned) Toronto securities firm, notes that much of the power in Canadian business has shifted to professional money managers at pension funds, mutual funds and portfolio management companies. Under pressure from these institutional investors, the old practice of stuffing boards of directors with the controlling shareholder's family and friends is gradually waning. The shift of power is also evident in more subtle ways. The Globe &amp; Mail and the Financial Post have dropped their social gossip columns. Could there be a more telling sign that the influence of the monied families which used to dominate these columns, and the public's interest in them, is ebbing?</p>

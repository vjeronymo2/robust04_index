			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Alliance Resources offer for Manx ALLIANCE Resources, the US-based natural resources group suspended at 9 1/2 p since October, yesterday announced an all-share offer for Manx Petroleum, a private company 29 per cent held by the quoted company's chairman. The offer was accompanied by a placing and rights issue of Alliance shares to raise Pounds 2.8m, the appointment of two non-executive directors and the announcement of the all-share purchase of a further interest in a US property. Alliance has offered 13 of its shares for every one of Manx's, which were trading at 50p on a matched bargain basis. The offer values Manx at Pounds 1.7m. Some 10 per cent of the enlarged company will be held by Alliance chairman Mr John O'Brien, who is also Manx's managing director. Mr O'Brien said the acquisitions would 'strengthen the company's position and prospects considerably'. The funds would initially be used to develop Alliance's assets in the US. The last year has been an eventful one for the cash-strapped Alliance, which was put into receivership by Manx following an attempt by directors to sack Mr O'Brien last October. Mr O'Brien had been appointed chairman in May 1992 following an agreement with Alliance that it would eventually make an all-share bid for Manx. The agreement, which was not made public to shareholders, also set out terms for a Dollars 200,000 loan to Alliance and the payment to Manx of monthly management fees of Pounds 10,000. Manx called in administrative receiver, Mr Graham Wilson, when Alliance failed to repay the loan on demand. Mr O'Brien was subsequently reappointed chairman. Yesterday's announcement means the number of Alliance shares will jump from 18.4m to 150m. The group proposes to place 44m shares at 5p to raise some Pounds 2.2m, while a one for one rights issue will draw a further Pounds 920,000 before expenses. Alliance also announced the appointment of Mr James Prior, currently a Manx director, as non-executive chairman and Viscount Torrington, director of Flextech, as a non-executive director. The group intends to apply for a relisting of its shares in London and Toronto.</p>

(Licensee) is the holder of Texas Department of Health Radioactive Material License No. L02627. Texas is an Agreement State The license authorizes the possession and use of sealed sources of iridium&hyph;192 in industrial radiographic exposure devices at temporary job sites within the State of Texas. Pursuant to 10 CFR 150.20(a), an Agreement State licensee is granted a general license by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to possess and use these radiographic exposure devices in non-Agreement States where the NRC maintains jurisdiction. Pursuant to 150.20(b)(1), before engaging in such use, Agreement State licensees are required to notify the NRC of their intent to conduct activities in non-Agreement States under the terms of the general license granted by 10 CFR 150.20(a). They are required to file four copies of NRC Form&hyph;241 and copies of their Agreement State license with the Regional Administrator of the NRC Regional Office for the NRC Region in which the Agreement State that issued the license is located. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In January 1990 the NRC issued a Notice of Violation to the Licensee for failing to follow the requirements of 10 CFR 150.20(b). As a result of an investigation in April 1992, the NRC issued an Order Suspending General License (Effective Immediately) on May 18, 1992, for deliberate, repeat violations of the same provision. The Order suspends the Licensee's authority to conduct activities in non-Agreement States until the Order is relaxed or rescinded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a letter of December 30, 1993, the Licensee requested permission to resume activities in non-Agreement States. On February 15, 1994, a transcribed meeting with the Licensee's president and owner was conducted in NRC's Region IV offices in Arlington, Texas. In that meeting, the president and owner expressed his recognition of the importance of proper training, an emphasis on safety, and compliance with all regulatory requirements, including filing NRC Form 241 when required. In addition, the Licensee indicated his willingness to comply with additional certification and advance notice requirements that the NRC might impose as a condition for being allowed to resume NRC licensed activities in non-Agreement States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The staff believes that the Licensee has recognized the importance of compliance with regulatory requirements and if allowed to resume NRC licensed activities in non-Agreement States with additional certification and notification requirements, the Licensee will comply with all regulatory requirements, and that the May 18, 1992 Order Suspending General License (Effective Immediately) should be rescinded, subject to certain requirements. These requirements include certification as to training and knowledge of subpart B of 10 CFR part 34 of all employees engaged in radiographic operations and advance notice to the NRC of NRC licensed activities to be conducted in non-Agreement States. Implementation of these requirements would provide enhanced assurance that radiographic operations will be conducted safely and in compliance with requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I find that the Licensee's commitments as set forth above are acceptable and necessary and conclude that with these commitments the public health and safety are reasonably assured, and should be confirmed by this Order. The Licensee has agreed to the terms and issuance of this Confirmatory Order in a telephone call on May 6, 1994, between Mr. William Fisher of the NRC and Mr. Orvil Couch, president and owner, Panhandle N.D.T. &amp; Inspection, Inc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202, and 10 CFR part 150, It Is Hereby Ordered, That Panhandle N.D.T. &amp; Inspection, Inc.'s Authority To Conduct NRC-Licensed Activities In Non-Agreement States Under The General License Granted By 10 CFR 150.20(a) Is Modified As Follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> LATINO ART EXHIBITION A COLORFUL MILESTONE; ARTIST CHIDES MUSEUM  </P> <P> The Latino art exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is a landmark  event. The show, on national tour, is the largest art exhibition of U.S.  Latinos ever assembled.  </P> <P> "This exhibition did not happen by accident," said Howard Fox, the museum's  curator of contemporary art. "This exhibition is an idea whose time is here."  </P> <P> But at least one prominent artist complains that the museum's attention to  Latino art is long overdue.  </P> <P> "The museum has demonstrated a lack of genuine interest and support for the  Hispanic artistic community," said Carlos Almaraz, whose work is part of the  exhibit. He pointed out that the last major Latino art exhibition there was 15  years ago, when the museum featured "Los Four" -- local Chicano painters  Almaraz, Frank Romero, Gilbert Lujan and Roberto de la Rocha.  </P> <P> So while a large crowd toasted the exhibition on opening night, Almaraz  boycotted the gala. "Why go to the opening?" Almaraz asked. "To say what great  things it (the museum) has done for Hispanics? No!"  </P> <P> However, he commended Jane Livingston and John Beardsley, who organized the  show for Houston's Museum of Fine Arts. The two, curators of the Corcoran  Gallery of Art in Washington, were "instrumental and supportive for the  creation of this exhibition. They had the critical eyes to look at art and not  at the politics."  </P> <P> The exhibition, "Hispanic Art in the United States: Thirty Contemporary  Painters and Sculptors," continues until April 16.  </P> <P> The art in the exhibition is gripping. It is vivid. It is powerful and real.  With exuberant colors, the paintings seem to scream from the walls. The exhibit  covers the spectrum from the photorealist narrative to the abstract. Although  its roots are in the past, it is unapologetically contemporary.  </P> <P> "There is a richness in this exhibition that defies categorization. Every  artist shown here is an artist of merit. This is a robust, diverse, impassioned  exhibition," Fox said.  </P> <P> "This is an exhibition of American and Latino art in a slightly different  language," Beardsley said. "It is a language of forms and contents that  portrays the Latino experience in the United States. Its strength consists in  that it is both American and Latino art.  </P> <P> "Something in the tension between the so-called dominant culture and the other  contributes to the strength in the work," Beardsley said. "The hybridization in  the language is one of the real strengths. Tension between cultures generates  power in the artistic expression that emerges from it."  </P> <P> There is a growing consensus that art does not have to be created by "the  in-crowd" in New York City to be acceptable. Los Angeles artist Romero, whose  painting "The Closing of Whittier Boulevard" is in the exhibit, says,  "Corporate America is very insecure with images. I'm breaking into corporate  collections with narrative pieces that tell a story, which makes the art  controversial. In this way, the mainstream is coming to Hispanic art, and not  the other way around."  </P> <P> In the context of this exhibition, however, Fox said, "There is no way to  identify a mainstream within the art world, any more than it is possible to  identify a mainstream culture."  </P> <P> Gronk, a Los Angeles Chicano artist who uses only one name, said, "Chicano art  is part of the American culture, and it goes unrecognized in the United States.  I'm out to break the stereotypes of what it is that we Latinos are supposed to  be like. In its diversity, this exhibition communicates that visually.  </P> <P> "A contemporary plastic artist is a visual philosopher for our time," added the  artist, whose works are part of the exhibition. "This show is a success because  it brought this point to the attention of a lot of people in the United  States."  </P> <P> Another artist, Texas-born Carmen Lomas Garza, considers herself a curandera, a  healer. "I want to depict in a fine art form all those aspects of my culture  that are positive and important for others to see and gain an understanding of  who I am as a Chicano artist," she said.  </P> <P> Through one of her paintings, the "Curandera," she attempts to convey a special  message. "In South Texas, we'd all go to medical doctors to get prescriptions  for drugs. But we'd go to the curandera for the final cleansing. It is a  spiritual cleansing. A healing.  </P> <P> "Artistically, I have tried to heal myself and other Chicanos and Latinos from  the damage that was done to us in the form of discrimination and oppression,"  she said. "I continue the tradition of making home altars honoring the Day of  the Dead. I paint scenes depicting family customs. My art work shows the  dignity of my humanness."  </P> <P> The 145 paintings, sculptures and assemblages in the exhibition portray  survival, anxiety and hope; confusion, identity, anger and love. These are all  expressions of deep-seated feelings, convictions, struggles and emotions that  reflect Latino life in the United States.  </P> <P> Diversity is also present in the materials and techniques employed by these  artists. Among the artists, John Valadez, a Chicano muralist and a colorful  urban painter, displays "La Butterfly," a realistic reflection of Chicano  street scenes in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Patricia Gonzalez's oil paintings draw from landscape imagery of her native  Colombia. Felix Lopez and Luis Tapia, both from the Southwest, make brightly  colored religious wood carvings known traditionally as santos. Gregorio Marzan  of Puerto Rico constructs mixed-media animal figures in vivid colors.  </P> <P> Luis Jimenez of El Paso works on painted animal sculptures and human figures on  painted fiberglass. Californian Manuel Neri's sculptures involve the human  figure with rough surfaces. Robert Graham, who was born in Mexico City and is  best known for his 1984 Olympic bronze statues, stands out as the most  realistic sculptor of this group.  </P> <P> The first thing that strikes the attention of a viewer at the entrance to the  show is Lujan's elaborately decorated 1950 Chevy. Lujan two-door sedan features  a "flaming jalapeno paint job" in the front and a Chicano couple along the  side. "Our Family Car," Lujan said, is symbolic of "the social dynamics, an  entire culture built around cars."  </P> <P> Some of the artists believe that this tour will be looked upon as a turning  point of art in the United States. In the future, Gronk said, "labels, such as  Hispanic, will fall on the wayside. People will see that this is American art."  </P></p>

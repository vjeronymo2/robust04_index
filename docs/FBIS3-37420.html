			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Galkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 17 TASS -- The Russian national  economy minister plans to contain the federal budget deficit at  5-6 percent of the Gross Domestic Product in 1994 as against 11  percent in 1993, and bring down the inflation rate to 8-10  percent a month by end of year from more than 22 percent in  January, according to Deputy Minister Yakov Urinson. Urinson  said that if the plan worked, capital investments would  increase, the production slump would halt and stabilization  would begin along with the improvement of the living standards.    The ministry leaders are now "airing" their plans for 1994  in  the economic circles in a bid to drum up support for further  market reforms and a moderately tough financial and monetary  policy.    The ministry vows support to the most vulnerable groups of  the population by fixing general spending on public needs at 16  percent of the Gross Domestic Product. The exact amount will  depend on revenues. To ensure these, the ministry intends to  preserve the present taxation system, whose stability and  predictability is expected to make it easier for the  entrepreneurs to adapt, and the tax agencies to levy taxes in  full measure. Urinson said this move can hardly be popular with  most industrialists and entrepreneurs, who believe that high  taxes are pernicious to any production. The deputy minister, on  the contrary, believes that the development of production  expands the taxable base and heaps up the revenues.    Last year, 17 percent of all Russian enterprises ended the  year in the black, he said. They drained the federal budget,  inflated its deficit and "froze" restructuring. Much has to be  done to pull them out from under the budget umbrella and make  them use their production potential to meet market demand. Some  of them may end up in bankruptcy, while others, particularly  those of special economic or public importance, will have to be  helped out. This applies primarily to the most important coal  and metallurgical enterprises and fertilizer producers.    Restructuring is closely linked to the liquidation of  monopolies which are hampering the development of market  relations and deflect state resources. As an example,  considerable resources allocated to the agroindustrial sector  never reach farmers but are intercepted by processors of farm  produce, suppliers of means of production, banks and retailers,  whose monopoly positions enable them to "redistribute" resources  in their own favour.</p>

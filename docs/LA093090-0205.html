			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUSSEIN'S MESSAGE TO AMERICANS  </P> <P> In his article "Beware Timidity in the Endgame" (Commentary, Sept. 23), former  Secretary of State Henry Kissinger leads a debate on policy objectives in the  Persian Gulf which centers on events in the Vietnam War. And it is not hard to  see that he has mostly accepted the critics' view of history.  </P> <P> "For economic and political reasons, I doubt a stalemate can be sustained." The  official military policy in Vietnam became defensive in 1970, under President  Nixon. "A prolonged stalemate is likely to undermine the domestic stability of  our Arab associates." Does anybody remember Cambodia?  </P> <P> Is it realistic to assume that there is no debate on the gulf crisis because we  continue to measure our foreign policy by events which took place during the  Vietnam War? Would the U.S. be isolated in a "military crunch"? Should we place  our head into the lion's mouth again? Kissinger's most revealing statement  concerns an "imperative to create the right conditions for an equally rapid  withdrawal." And to that end I credit him with orchestrating the U.S. exodus  from Vietnam, an event that could have been bloody and torturous, particularly  in the final hours. We might not have such good grace in extricating ourselves  from the gulf.  </P> <P> Kissinger has taken a good look at recent history and Vietnam when he calls for  an outcome "more consistent with long-term stability." By this I take it that  he means a policy not formulated by the hawks who want to bomb Baghdad. Or is  it Hanoi? It's all too chillingly familiar to me, and quite probably to the  former secretary.  </P> <P> DAVID C. REUTTER  </P> <P> Vista  </P></p>

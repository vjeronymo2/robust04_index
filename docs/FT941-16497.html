			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Arts: Billy Roche's The Cavalcaders - Theatre A whisper of warning. Billy Roche's The Cavalcaders at the Royal Court may seem initially disappointing to anyone who saw the same author's Wexford trilogy at the Bush. The theatre is bigger, the play is not. It may be that the small Irish town is running out of subjects. The plays in the trilogy were set respectively in a snooker hall, a betting shop and the belfry of a parish church. Each had a background that was lively and contributed to the plot. The Bush has a large stage relative to the space for the audience. That produced an appropriate intimacy. Cavalcaders is set in a shoe-menders' shop, and a fairly dingy one at that. Whereas from the belfry, you might look out from the tower and see the whole of Wexford, here you will see at most the hairdressers' across the road and perhaps a few people walking down the street. Even to do that, you have to stand on a chair and lift the curtain. This is a self-inflicted handicap by a playwright who has made so much out of specialising in details. There is a lot of movement in a betting shop or even a pool room; the scope for action at a cobblers', where most people seem to fail to collect their shoes, is limited. Perhaps this is deliberate and Roche has become more introverted. Certainly there are fewer jokes; the piece is tinged with sadness throughout. The central character, Terry, almost never leaves his shop; his girlfriends come to him, and object when he never offers to take them out. The central prop, apart from the shelf of old shoes, is an upright piano usually covered by a canvas. It is around the piano, however, that the cobblers gather in their part-time vocation, for - when not mending shoes - the Cavalcaders are a male quartet singing sentimental, poppish songs, some of which they write themselves. They pose with great style, and it is a mark of their achievement as actors that, as a singing group, they never seem to be either wholly good or wholly bad. The in-between is captured to perfection, which may be what Wexford is all about. The structure is weaker than one expects from Roche, and even harder to follow when you read the text than when you see it on stage. Neither Terry's wife nor her lover appear and we learn almost nothing about them. Suddenly the play goes into flashbacks, which is almost always a suspect way of storytelling. Yet of the quality of the acting and the infectious nature of the Wexford language there can be no doubt. Terry, played by Tony Doyle, is the most senior of the shoe-menders. His young girl friend Nuala (Aisling O'Sullivan) has great freshness, but in the background there is his older friend Breda (Marie Mullen). The two women get on well enough together, a reminder perhaps that in Wexford nothing much changes because there is nothing much that can change. The language is soft, sometimes deliberately inarticulate, almost never without feeling. There are times when you straining not to miss a word. Billy Roche himself plays Josie, one of the Cavalcaders and cobblers. Direction is by Robin Lefevre, and if you've never been to Wexford, you might as well start from here. Royal Court Theatre.

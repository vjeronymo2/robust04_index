			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Osprey Comms Osprey Communications, the advertising and marketing services group, swung back into the black in the six months to March 31. Turnover was flat at Pounds 12.5m - although last time's total included Pounds 7m from discontinued activities - and pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 357,000 against losses of Pounds 173,000. Earnings emerged at 1.18p (losses of 1.29p), but there is again no interim dividend, reflecting 'constraints on retained reserves'.</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Anheuser-Busch takes 5% stake in Chinese brewer TSINGTAO Brewery, China's largest beer exporter, will today become the first Chinese registered company to issue shares in Hong Kong, via an offer of 'H' shares to raise HKDollars 889m (USDollars 115m). The proceeds include the HKDollars 126m purchase of a 5 per cent stake by Anheuser-Busch, the largest US brewer, which is buying 45m shares as a strategic investment to expand its presence in China. Faced with a mature market at home and a patchy diversification record, Anheuser has been emphasising plans to expand geographically. Since the start of the year, it has struck deals in Italy, Japan and Mexico - in the last case, by buying a 17.7 per cent interest in Grupo Modelo, the leading local producer. Analysts believe that Tsingtao's internationally-recognised brand name and its access to the Chinese market will ensure that the issue is massively oversubscribed. Denway Investment, the Hong Kong holding company for a Chinese car manufac-turing business, set the record for oversubscription in February, when its HKDollars 402m public offer attracted HKDollars 240bn from investors. The recent weakness of the Chinese currency has dampened demand for shares in Chinese companies but as a major exporter, Tsingtao will be comparatively unaffected. It is the first of nine state companies selected by China's Securities Committee for flotation in Hong Kong and the Chinese government will be anxious to attract a positive response for the issue. Tsingtao is offering 317.6m new shares at HKDollars 2.80 per share, representing 35 per cent of its enlarged issued share capital. A further 11 per cent of Tsingtao's shares are earmarked for Chinese investors, in the form of 'A' shares, to be traded on the Shanghai stock exchange. This was scaled down, as a result of the lacklustre performance of the Chinese stock markets, and the government's desire to see savings channelled into bonds. Tsingtao's profits are forecast to rise to Yn193m (Dollars 33m) this year from Yn44m in 1992. However, there is unlikely to be any significant further growth until 1995, when its fourth brewery will be completed. Three other state companies, Shanghai Petrochemical, Guangzhou Shipyard and Beijing Renmin Machinery, are also due to launch offers within the next month.</p>

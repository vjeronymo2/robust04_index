			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, June 6 (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres disclosed Monday [6 June] that he had pledged in a  "secret" letter to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to maintain the  status quo in Jerusalem and paved the way for him to pray in the  holy city.    Peres said he undertook to allow Palestinian institutions  which were in Jerusalem before the signing of the autonomy  agreement last September to remain.    "The letter does not given any commitment about Palestinian  institutions established in the city after the signing," Peres  told reporters.    He stressed that the new Palestinian self-rule authority  would have to set up all its bodies in the autonomous areas of  Jericho and the Gaza Strip.    The full text would be published later Monday.    "It's a letter which has been blown out of proportion," said  Peres, who has previously denied the existence of such a missive.    A senior foreign ministry official said the letter was sent  to his Norwegian counterpart Johan Jorgen Holst last October 13  and it was passed to 'Arafat.    Peres wrote that Israel would "refrain from any action which  would restrict freedom of religion or restrict access to the  holy sites," said the official who refused to be named.    "The undertaking concerns those who live in the city and  visitors of the holy sites," the official added.    The letter clearly opens the way for 'Arafat to pray at the  Dome of the Rock, which Moslems consider their third holiest  site.    Peres also underlined that Jerusalem would be one of the  subjects for negotiations when talks on a permanent settlement  for the Palestinians start after two years of autonomy.    "Israel has always understood the importance and religious  significance of Jerusalem for the monotheistic beliefs and will  continue to respect the unique value of the city for Jews,  Christians and Moslems," Peres wrote.    The official said the missive was intended to remain secret  but after 'Arafat and other Palestinians alluded to written  pledges on Jerusalem the decision was taken to release the  contents.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin last month strenuously denied  such a letter existed when 'Arafat declared he had received a  written undertaking on Jerusalem.    "There is no secret agreement. There is no document which  has not been published. Everything has been made public," Rabin  told parliament on May 12.    The right-wing opposition charged he was lying during a  bitter debate.    On May 30, Rabin appeared to climb down, telling a  parliamentary committee: "According to my information, 'Arafat  has received only a piece of a speech by Peres on the freedom of  religion and access to Moslem holy places in Jerusalem."    Amid growing controversy over Jerusalem, which both Israel  and the Palestinians claim as capital, Faysal al-Husayni, the  PLO leader on the West Bank, confirmed the existence of secret  Israeli undertakings.    Al-Husayni said: "There is a letter from Israel and the  question of Jerusalem and the PLO institutions in the city and  on other subjects. I cannot say any more."    A close aide to Peres told AFP: "He has committed two  errors.  First he denied this letter existed when it does exist and he  should have published it when it was sent.    "At that time no would have paid it any attention."    "Now it will pour oil on the flames and the right will use  the story against us."    Right-wingers are preparing a major campaign to keep 'Arafat  out of Jerusalem and intend to throw a human cordon around the  city.    The PLO leader was expected to visit the autonomous enclave  of Jericho in the middle of this month. However at the weekend  he suggested further delays unless donor countries came up with  money for autonomy.    Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordanian rule in the  1967 Middle East war and annexed it.    In 1980, Israel declared the holy city its united and  eternal  capital, but foreign countries do not recognize the annexation  and maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Wealth and power in Europe's qualified democracy THE RATIFICATION of the Maastricht treaties on European monetary and political union are only now getting under way, but already the attentions of the Commission have shifted to the next round of treaty revisions. For while tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism make Emu look an increasingly long-term goal, the attraction of the EC for potential new members is undiminished; and further political reform may be a corollary of widening the EC's membership. The British government, for one, remains sceptical about the benefits of further treaty revisions, and protective of the current rights of its national parliament. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, has already reacted negatively to the proposals of the Commission's president, Mr Jacques Delors. His plan, to be discussed by the Commission this week, would set up a supra-national executive to replace the existing Commission and the six-monthly rotating presidency. Yet the current EC treaties already cede a substantial degree of national sovereignty to the European centre. The introduction of qualified majority voting for certain decisions of the Council of Ministers effectively speeded the evolution of the community from being an agreement between autonomous member states towards a more integrated  - perhaps federal - political community. The Single European Act first introduced majority voting for most of the 300 plus directives which together make the 1992 single market programme. If the Maastricht treaties are ratified, qualified majority voting will be extended to the implementation, but not the formulation, of common EC foreign policy; while decisions on EC immigration policy will be taken by qualified majority vote after 1996. The Commission has also partly circumvented the UK's veto on social legislation by introducing its working time directive as health and safety legislation, which can be passed by a qualified majority vote. The current system of qualified majority voting, laid down in Article 148 of the revised Treaty of Rome, gives disproportionate influence to the smaller countries. The distribution of the 76 votes among 12 EC member states is shown in the lower portion of the chart. It takes 54 votes - 71 per cent of the total - to pass a resolution by a 'qualified majority'; and the four largest countries - Germany, France, Italy and the UK - possess 10 votes each. So a blocking coalition with at least 23 votes must include either two large countries plus one small country, or one large country and three smaller countries. The system does ensure that a simple majority of seven smaller countries cannot pass legislation. But the four largest countries possess only 52.8 per cent of total votes compared to 71.5 per cent of total EC population and 78.7 per cent of total EC gross domestic product. The three smallest countries in economic terms - Greece, Ireland and Luxembourg - make-up 1.8 per cent of EC GDP and 4.3 per cent of EC population but 13.1 per cent of the votes. The political power of the smaller countries is also increased by the six-monthly rotation of the EC presidency which gives them the power to set and control the community's political agenda. Half the time the presidency is held by countries which together account for less than 10 per cent of the EC's population. The UK government is currently stressing the priority of widening the EC's membership rather than strengthening the ties between existing members. But the other large countries are unlikely to agree to admit Austria, Sweden, Finland and perhaps the eastern European countries too, unless political power is redistributed and the rotating presidency is replaced. Mr Delors' plans for a stronger Commission may not be the UK's preferred solution; an inner cabinet within the Council, consisting of the large states who control the presidency, with rotating representatives from the smaller countries, would be one alternative. But the UK may have to use its forthcoming presidential term to explore alternative solutions, rather then deny there is a problem.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: NATIONAL ACCOUNTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures for GNP/GDP are in billions of European currency units (Ecu).

Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany.  GNP/GDP is broken down into private consumption expenditure, investment (the sum of gross fixed capital formation and the change in stocks), general government final consumption, and net exports (exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and services). The US includes investment by government in the government series rather than under investment. Quarterly GNP/GDP totals are annualised. The growth rates are the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The figures in the fifth column of each set of growth rates refer only to exports, rather than to net exports. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government sources.</p>

High Commissioner for Refugees  (UNHCR) to help repatriate Myanmar [Burma] refugees from  Bangladesh, Foreign Ministry officials said Friday [14 January].    The contribution is in response to a UNHCR appeal in  December  for a donation of about 34 million dollars in total for the  repatriation program, the officials said.    The fund will be used to transport some 200,000 Myanmar  refugees, provide goods for daily use and implement small-scale  projects on agriculture, health, water and sanitation in support  of resettlement of the repatriated people, they said.    Islamic residents account for about 3.8 percent of Myanmar's  population of 42 million people, according to Foreign Ministry  statistics.    Since 1991, Islamic Myanmar residents began moving to  Bangladesh citing oppression, with the number of Myanmar  refugees in Bangladesh reaching 250,000 by March 1992, they said.    But based on an agreement between foreign ministers of both  countries, the refugees began returning to Myanmar and more than  52,000 people have returned to date, they said.</p>

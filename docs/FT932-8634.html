			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Whitbread up 13% after boost from food operations WHITBREAD, the UK brewing and retailing group, managed to increase full-year pre-tax profits by 13 per cent led by a strong performance by the group's branded restaurants and pub food operations. Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 251.2m in the year to February 27 from Pounds 222.1m in the same period last year when profits were reduced by a Pounds 37m exceptional charge to cover unusually high bad debts among the group's free trade loans. Trading profits increased by 2 per cent to Pounds 232.6m on turnover which grew by 7 per cent to Pounds 2.35bn. Earnings per share increased to 39.44p from 35.78p and a final dividend of 13p, against 12.4p a year earlier, lifts the full-year payment about 5 per cent to 17.75p from (16.95p). As expected a revaluation of Whitbread's property portfolio led to a write-down of Pounds 595m or 22 per cent of book values. Despite the size of the write-down only Pounds 6m was charged to the profit and loss account. The bulk, Pounds 576.6m, is seen as temporary and has been taken from the revaluation reserve. The group's balance sheet remains strong with net borrowings of Pounds 399.5m, down from Pounds 453.3m last year, equivalent to gearing of 19.3 per cent. Mr Peter Jarvis, chief executive, said the strongest performance was in Whitbread Inns, the managed pub business, which improved sales, profits and cash flow despite the recession. 'In the second half of the year our branded restaurants and pub food operations began to show growth in covers and this continued into the new financial year,' he said Profits from the managed retail operations increased by about 13 per cent to Pounds 135.7m on turnover that increased by the same percentage to Pounds 1.56bn. Whitbread Inns, Beefeater, Pizza Hut and TGI Friday's all posted higher sales and profits. The beer division increased its market share to 13.5 per cent from 13.2 per cent despite extremely tough competition and a 2 per cent volume decline in the overall beer market. Operating profits rose 4 per cent from Pounds 67.4m to Pounds 70.4m on turnover 1 per cent ahead at Pounds 896.4m. Lex, Page 18; Details, Page 20</p>

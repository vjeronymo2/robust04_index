			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / EU in talks with Africans The first European Union ministerial meeting with the 11 member states of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) ended yesterday in Berlin with broad agreement to set up working groups to promote closer trade, political, regional and economic contacts. However, Mr Festus Mogae, SADC chairman, said it was crucial that the EU decide whether it would support South African membership of the Lome Convention, which gives the other SADC countries duty-free access to the Union. Mr Manuel Marin, the Spanish EU commissioner, said the Union wanted to conclude a co-operation agreement with South Africa, but he admitted that there were 'problems about whether South Africa would be linked to Lome'. Mr Kaire Mbuende, SADC's executive secretary, said: 'South Africa is rich . . . But South Africa is one of us. It has joined SADC on equal terms. We want South Africa to have relations with the EU. But that should not disqualify it from joining Lome or its integration into the Southern African states.'</p>

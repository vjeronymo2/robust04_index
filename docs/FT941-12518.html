			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong close as base rate optimism reappears - Market Report Good news on inflation in the US brought a dramatic turnaround in the UK securities markets yesterday, with the stock market replacing an early loss of 24 points on the FT-SE scale with a gain of similar proportions as the two week trading account closed. Government bonds gained more than half a point, the shorter dates edging higher as interest rate optimism revived. But there was little recovery for shares in Sainsbury, Britain's premium-rated food retailer, which fell by more than 10 per cent in the heaviest turnover for two years following a trading statement from the boardroom. Food retailing and manufacturing stocks were hit by Sainsbury's statement, which also deepened the market's doubts over the progress of the recovery in the UK. The Footsie dipped to the 3,403 area, but dealers were relieved to see this potentially testing level hold secure. Securities markets made little response to news of Britain's non-EU trade deficit of Pounds 675m in December. Although this was above expectations, the market remained uninterested in the trade deficit. There was no genuine rally in London until the announcement that US Gross Domestic Product had risen by an annualised 5.9 per cent in the 1993 fourth quarter, while the fixed weight price deflator had gained only 1.3 per cent  -barely half the gain feared by some analysts. Markets interpreted this as a sign that, with the US economy expanding strongly while inflation remains subdued, the Federal Reserve was now less likely to raise US interest rates. UK gilts followed sharp gains in Federal bonds, and share prices quickly turned higher as increased volume levels showed themselves on the trading screens in the City's dealing rooms. At the close, the FT-SE Index stood at 3,447.4, a net gain on the day of 20.1 points. The recovery was spurred by further buying as the stock market moved into its new trading account. Over the two week account, the Footsie has risen by around 1.4 per cent, but gains were sharply cut back this week, when the Index lost 36.8 as some gloomy reports from the retailing sector undermined the confidence shown over Christmas. Yesterday's abrupt recovery was slow to spread across the full range of the market, however. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, still plagued by fears that more expiries of individually structured options contracts are pending, closed down 10.6 at 4,065.8. Renewed optimism for an early cut in UK base rates brought strong rises in bank shares and helped some of the retail stocks which had suffered earlier in the week. Building stocks turned higher as attention focused on next week's meeting of the Bundesbank policy council. But the implications of Sainsbury's statement lay heavily across the brewery and food-related sectors, where nervousness over profit margins has been unsettling investors for some months. Trading volume increased as the market recovered, and number of shares traded through the Seaq electronic network reached 1.14bn. On Thursday, 972.5m shares traded through Seaq for a retail worth of Pounds 2bn, well above the daily average for the past year. Traders admitted that the consumer sectors were likely to remain overshadowed by this week's mixed set of trading results from leading companies but believed that confidence had improved across the wider range of the stock market.</p>

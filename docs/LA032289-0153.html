			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EX-RED WING PROBERT FACES DRUG CHARGE  </P> <P> A federal grand jury has indicted Bob Probert on a felony charge of drug  importation nearly three weeks after the former Detroit Red Wings forward  allegedly tried to smuggle cocaine through the Detroit-Windsor tunnel.  </P> <P> If convicted, Probert, a Canadian citizen living in Detroit, could be banned  from the nited States, according to Roman Rewald, a Detroit lawyer who  specializes in immigration and international law.  </P> <P> Probert, 23, also faces up to 20 years in prison and a $1-million fine, but  under federal sentencing guidelines, he would serve less than two years in  prison.  </P> <P> Customs agents said they found 14 grams of cocaine in Probert's underwear on  March 2 as he tried to enter the United States from Canada. The Red Wings  suspended Probert, but the National Hockey League expelled him two days later.  </P> <P> Ross Parker, head of the criminal division of the U.S. attorney's office, said  Tuesday he decided to charge Probert with a felony, because a "misdemeanor did  not adequately represent the nature of his conduct."  </P></p>

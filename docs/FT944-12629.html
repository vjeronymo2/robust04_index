			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Daily Mail group to bid again for Midlands titles The Daily Mail &amp; General Trust is to try to find a compromise solution to overcome the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's objections to its Pounds 92m bid for the T. Bailey Forman newspaper group. The MMC said yesterday that it was opposed to DMGT's bid for Bailey Forman, which owns the Nottingham Evening Post and is one of the UK's biggest family-owned regional newspaper groups. The commission said that the bid could act against the public interest by giving DMGT too high a concentration in the east Midlands area. It already owns the nearby Leicester Mercury and Derby Evening Telegraph daily papers through its Northcliffe Newspapers subsidiary. The Department of Trade and Industry suggested a compromise could be struck to allow DMGT to pursue the bid while allaying the MMC's concerns. It has given DMGT until December 5 to produce acceptable proposals. Mr Peter Williams, finance director of DMGT, said: 'We've spent six months working on this. It's our first significant acquisition in regional newspapers for 20 years . . . and we'll be working very hard with the DTI to find a solution.' The Bailey Forman group was put up for sale this summer in an auction organised by BZW, the merchant bank. DMGT won the auction against competition from rival publishers including Emap and Midland Independent Newspapers. The Daily Mail group was criticised in the newspaper industry for the scale of its Pounds 92m bid for Bailey Forman, which was significantly higher than trade estimates of the company's value. DMGT also plans to invest heavily in modernising the Bailey Forman titles if the bid goes through. If DMGT fails to satisfy the MMC the other auction participants - which also included Reed International and Thomson Regional Newspapers - are expected to renew their bids for Bailey Forman. Express Newspapers plans to print the Scottish Daily Express and the Scottish edition of the Daily Star in Glasgow at DC Thompson's printing plant. The two papers will then be able to increase their coverage of Scottish news and sport.</p>

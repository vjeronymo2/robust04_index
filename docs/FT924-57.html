			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Do not adjust your sets: As Britain's new television companies prepare to switch on, Raymond Snoddy assesses their potential impact The staff of Thames Television will put on their best clothes tonight to go out in style. By the time the last bong of Big Ben greets the new year, the largest ITV company will have handed over to Carlton Television and become Britain's largest independent producer. For many viewers, the opening of A Carlton New Year with Chris Tarrant, Paul McCartney and London pop maestros Squeeze, not to mention 'the crazy antics of Canadian funny man Marty Putz', will be the first outward sign of three years of turmoil and government intervention in ITV. For some, it turned out to be an opportunity, for others a nightmare. Away from the screen, not much will be different. A pre-programmed computer at the Post Office Tower will simply make the switch from one company to the other, but the moment will still mark the start of the long-awaited revolution in commercial television - Mrs Thatcher's revolution. As a result of the government's insistence on competitive tenders for ITV licences which were up for renewal in 1991, four companies lost their franchises, more money is going to the Treasury from ITV than ever before, and more than 1,000 jobs have been lost as winning companies axed costs to try to stay in profit. From tomorrow Channel 4 will also be competing rather than collaborating with ITV in advertising sales. Just after midnight Carlton will be joined by two other new kids on the ITV block - Meridian in the south and south-east of England, and Westcountry Television. At 6am, Good Morning Television will take over the breakfast franchise from TV-am. The broadcasting world is already dividing into two camps on the subject of ITV. There are those who believe that the network has been taken over by accountants and will in future be unremittingly populist and ratings-driven. On the other hand, many feel that in the face of increasing competition from satellite and cable television the move to more cost-effective television was inevitable - and anyway the changes will not be all that great. 'The continuity will be huge,' insists Peter Ibbotson, director of communications at Carlton and a former deputy managing director of BBC Television. Apart from the new year variety show the first flavour of a Carlton programme will come at 4.15pm on new year's day with Surprise Party. A celebrity will be confronted by a host of friends and colleagues who will tell stories of his or her life, favourite things and songs. The show will include secretly filmed footage. A taxi-driver who is not really a taxi-driver will try to provoke the celebrity into revealing something of themselves. The programme will undoubtedly be a surprise to the celebrity involved, but hardly to the viewer. Not only will it be presented by Michael Parkinson, one of the most familiar faces on British television, but nobody is attempting to disguise the fact that this is a reworked version of one of the oldest programmes on British television, This Is Your Life, which will still pop up on Wednesday evenings, made by Thames, the independent producer. 'It's not a rip-off. It's just another way of doing it. We have to look at potential replacements for long-running formats,' says Paul Jackson, director of programmes at Carlton. Another programme with a familiar face will be Carlton's Good Getaways, which it hopes could be a potential replacement for Wish You Were Here, the holiday programme with an average audience of 13m also made by Thames. 'Some of the good, but oldest, shows just happen to be Thames shows,' says Jackson innocently, sitting in his pink office with five television sets, four to keep an eye on what is happening on the four national channels and the other for London News Network. Not every show is based on a tried and tested formula, however. Carlton's 100 hours of new network programmes for the first 35 weeks of 1993 range from from Head Over Heels, a rock and roll drama set in the 1950s, to The Good Sex Guide. At Carlton's headquarters London's West End theatreland, the changes transforming ITV can barely be seen. Carlton's office are just - well - offices. They could just as well be occupied by an insurance company. There are no studios, and no programmes are being made. Carlton is a publisher broadcaster - essentially a commissioning house - directly employing about 300, compared with the 1,500 staff Thames had until recently for making its own programmes. It is at LNN where the new face of independent television can best be seen. Carlton and London Weekend Television have together invested Pounds 14m to create a computerised transmission and broadcasting centre. The network, run by Mr Clive Jones, a refugee from TVS, which lost its franchise to Meridian, will give Londoners an integrated seven-day television news operation on ITV for the first time. The newcomers are all increasing regional news output. Meridian is adding a third news centre in Newbury to cover the Thames Valley, and Westcountry will have no fewer than seven local news studios. The main purpose of LNN is to bring national network news standards to bear on London Tonight, a 6pm-7pm, weekday news magazine for the region. But the news complex in LWT's London headquarters will also transmit all the output of Carlton, LWT and GMTV, the first time there has been such co-operation in London between ITV companies. Such co-operation is the shape of the future in a federal ITV system, where once there were 15 sets of everything - one for each company. Some observers still think the companies which bid high to win their franchises will fail before 1993 is out as the recession continues to bite into advertising revenues. But the signs are that this will not happen unless the recession deepens: HTV believes it is out of the woods after taking Pounds 12m a year out of its costs; nearly 300 jobs have been shed following the merger between Yorkshire and Tyne Tees; GMTV has booked more than Pounds 50m in advertising before it goes on air - enough to cover its bid of Pounds 34.6m a year and the 15 per cent of its revenue it must pay to the Treasury. Carlton, which bid Pounds 43.2m, is under budget. Its cash requirement will peak at Pounds 80m in the summer of 1993 at Pounds 20m lower than expected. At ITV's central commissioning centre in London - another big innovation for the network - Andrew Quinn, chief executive of ITV, is becoming more optimistic. His big worry, that some of the high bidders would be too short of cash to sign up for their share of the Pounds 515m-a-year network budget, has not been realised. The sum is less than the Independent Television Commission, the commercial television regulator, suggested, but it is the same as last year's figure increased for inflation. Quinn believes that Pounds 515m is enough to capitalise on ITV's unique selling point: its prime-time schedule, which has been taking a 42 per cent share of viewing figures and routinely trouncing the BBC in the ratings. ITV executives admit the network is going to be more populist, more determined to produce ratings winners and more responsive in a more competitive broadcasting market to the clients who pay for it all - the advertisers. ITV has been publishing prospective ratings figures on new programmes for advertisers, and executives from the new franchise holders have been explaining their objectives to advertising agencies. So far, however, controversial programme casualties are few. The Sunday night 'God slot' - reserved for religious topics - moves out of prime time to make way for a film, while This Week, the award-winning Thames Television current affairs programme is replaced by Carlton's Storyline. In what some see as a suicidal manoeuvre, Storyline moves from 8.30pm to play against EastEnders, the BBC's most popular programme. 'It's been given a protected slot,' says Andrew Quinn. As a result, it will not be expected to deliver the 8m or so expected from Granada's World in Action. ITV is still required under its licence terms to show current affairs but pressure may increase to move them from prime time if audiences drop. Three years ago Sir George Russell, chairman of the ITC, hoped he could save 80 per cent of ITV's existing range and quality of programmes in the face of growing competition and the government's policy of competitive tenders which he did not approve of. 'I think the 80 per cent should hold,' says Sir George, though largely through an improved regional service balancing the popular programmes on offer during prime time. 'We have the job of making sure that what they offer is diverse and we will be chasing that all the time,' Sir George promises. Apart from the growth of regionalism, the ITC chairman believes 'an unusually challenging mix' is emerging, which should keep ITV strong by broadening its programme sources. As well as the two new commissioning houses, Carlton and Meridian, there are the continuing 12 ITV companies, many of whom will still make a substantial number of programmes in-house, and Thames Television, offering both old and new programmes to the network centre. For Sir George there are still two important items of unfinished business. One is the ITV appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission against the Office of Fair Trading's rejection of its central networking arrangements with independent producers. The OFT claimed that the terms under which the network buys programmes from independent producers are anti-competitive. The second item is the question of ownership of ITV companies. From January 1 1994, ITV companies can be taken over by European Community companies, yet in the UK the nine largest cannot acquire each other. Though some industry insiders believe ultimate ownership is irrelevant to carrying out regional broadcasting obligations, Sir George will be raising the issue with the government. Tonight, as A Carlton New Year opens, European broadcasters may be starting to look towards takeovers in the UK. For Nigel Walmsley, managing director of Carlton Television, it will be the culmination of more than two years' hard work. For both Carlton, and the other ITV companies, it is unlikely to be the end of change. 'Market forces, different government policies and technology will keep broadcasting in a state of semi-permanent revolution,' Mr Walmsley predicts.</p>

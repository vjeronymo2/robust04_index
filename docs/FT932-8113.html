			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Get Europe to work FOR MANY months the European Community has been paralysed by the long struggle over the Maastricht Treaty of European Union. When it ends, with ratification in the British parliament, the governments must put aside all those sterile doctrinaire arguments about the long-term destination of the Community. Their top priority is to turn their attention to a pragmatic programme of action, which will make it work more effectively now, in economic and in political terms. The most urgent need is to make the Community work in ways which seek and secure the consent of the people of Europe. The first referendum in Denmark, the debates in the French and British parliaments, the opinion polls in Germany, have all shown that there are deep popular misgivings in many European countries about the Community and its policies. These misgivings have been stirred up in part by the fact that some governments, and the Maastricht treaty itself, may have seemed to imply, incautiously and quite prematurely, that Europe was necessarily bound for a federal future. But there are two other more immediate reasons for popular disquiet which are also much more practical: on the economic front, it has not always been clear that the Community's policies were delivering the advantages claimed for them; on the political front, governments have failed to develop appropriate policies of transparency and accountability to ensure that they carry the voters and their elected representatives with them. The most immediate problem arising from the Maastricht treaty concerns the future of the programme for economic and monetary union. The experts have declared that there is nothing inherently wrong with the exchange rate mechanism, despite last autumn's upheavals in the currency markets, which forced two Community currencies out of the system. The fact remains that it is now impossible to believe that the Maastricht programme for EMU will be implemented as prescribed within the periods laid down. Moreover, it is probable that some Community currencies will stay outside a monetary union for a long time, and some may stay outside the ERM for a long time as well. It is conceivable that an inner core group of countries may move ahead by themselves towards closer monetary integration. But it cannot be a matter of indifference to France or Germany that the British pound and the Italian lira are floating independently, or that the peseta and the escudo have been devalued. The urgent practical problem for the Community as a whole is to review the monetary arrangements for Europe, so as to deal with the probability of a variable geometry monetary Europe, and not simply dismiss the outsiders as failures who should be disregarded. One of the reasons for the unpopularity of the Community is that the programme for the single European market has come to be identified with industrial restructuring and thus with unemployment, while the convergence criteria of the programme for economic and monetary union have been identified with deflation and more unemployment. These criticisms may not be fair, and they are certainly over-simplifications. The political fact is, however, that high and rising unemployment is now the biggest problem facing all European governments, and their most urgent need is growth and job creation. In the end, the only reliable basis for growth and job creation is improved economic competitiveness. It is clear that the Community will not last long if it comes to be seen as a vast machine for creating unemployment. But there is no room for reckless indulgence in measures of social protection which would jeopardise that competitiveness.</p>

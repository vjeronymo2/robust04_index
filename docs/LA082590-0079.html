			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LOPEZ CANYON LANDFILL  </P> <P> Regarding the Aug. 21 article on Lopez Canyon landfill, I have never read such  a crock. On the one hand, we have the Air Quality Management District, which is  suppose to make a decision based on health and safety factors regarding the  surrounding communities.  </P> <P> On the other hand, we have the city of Los Angeles clouding the issues and  making predictions of so-called budget cuts and the piling up of garbage if  Lopez Canyon landfill is closed.  </P> <P> I hope the AQMD will not make the wrong decision based on city pressure, but  call their bluff, so in my opinion we could all see how the Sanitation  Department and the city has been lying to us.  </P> <P> JERRY ZIMMER  </P> <P> Lake View Terrace  </P></p>

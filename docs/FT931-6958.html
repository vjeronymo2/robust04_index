			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: German builder optimistic BILFINGER + BERGER, the German construction group has promised another 'good' dividend after further increasing profits during 1992, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. The company, which increased output by 14 per cent to DM6bn (Dollars 3.72bn), thanks to strong domestic demand, gave no details of earnings. In 1991, it paid out DM10 a share after a 50 per cent rise in net profits to DM65m. However, figures released yesterday suggested that progress had slowed in the second half. Output rose 23 per cent in the first six months, with the domestic business up 39 per cent and overseas up almost 9 per cent.</p>

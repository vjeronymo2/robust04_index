			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / International Company News: Dresdner held back by east German expansion DRESDNER BANK, Germany's second largest commercial bank, reported only a modest rise in group profits for 1990 after a big rise in spending caused by its expansion in east Germany, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. Partial operating profits, which exclude trading on the bank's own account, were 4 per cent higher at DM1.95bn (Dollars 1.2bn). Mr Wolfgang Roller, chief executive, said the bank's trading on its own account amounted to about DM500m in an average year. Trading income did not reach the high level of 1989 because of the world stock market downturn, but showed a sharp rise on the foreign exchange side. Dresdner's net interest income was 12 per cent higher at DM4.7bn, with fee income up by only 1.7 per cent to DM1.8bn, reflecting the decline on securities markets. Administration costs rose 11 per cent to DM4.6bn, with much of the rise stemming from expansion in east Germany. Mr Roller said Dresdner hoped to agree planned cross-shareholdings with Banque Nationale de Paris, the French state-owned bank, now the French government had made such a step easier. Commerzbank had also said it hoped soon to announce a cross-holding with Credit Lyonnais. Dresdner wrote down its securities holdings by more than DM500m. It also increased lending risk provisions, which now cover 60 countries. About 60 per cent of its sovereign debt of DM5.5bn is now covered by such provisions, which include the Soviet Union. Dresdner's net profits were up 42 per cent to DM921m due to the incorporation of Dresdner Bank Berlin.</p>

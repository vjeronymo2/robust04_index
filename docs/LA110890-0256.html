			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SONG A 'COMING OUT': TOWNSHEND  </P> <P> Guitarist Pete Townshend of The Who says his 1980 song "Rough Boys" was a  "coming out, an acknowledgment of the fact that I'd had a gay life."  </P> <P> Townshend, who has been married to Karen Astley since 1966 and has three  children, divulged his bisexuality in the book "Rock Lives: Profiles and  Interviews."  </P> <P> "I know how it feels to be a woman because I am a woman," Townshend said in the  book, a collection of interviews by music writer and radio host Timothy White.  It was released Friday.  </P> <P> Townshend said in September, 1989, on White's radio show that "Rough Boys"  showed his aversion to the macho rock star ethos.  </P> <P> He said the song meant "I understood what gay sex was about."  </P></p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Repo is unchanged THE BUNDESBANK yesterday underlined its unchanged stance on monetary policy by announcing a fixed rate repo at 6.80 per cent for today's operations, writes James Blitz. There are still some expectations in the market that the Bundesbank could cut its discount rate from the current level of 6.75 per cent at its council meeting tomorrow. But with the repo rate unchanged, any cut up to 50 basis points would amount to little more than a technical move. The central bank is clearly keen to see some progress on consumer price inflation and the German budget deficit reduction talks before easing policy any further. Dealers in interest rate futures markets were therefore rather downbeat when betting on German rate moves. The September contract declined 2 basis points to close at 93.50. At this level it is assuming that three-month money in Germany will be at 6.50 per cent when the contract matures next week, barely changed from yesterday's three-month cash rate of 6.53 per cent. The December contract shed 3 basis points to finish at 94.10. But at this level it is somewhat more optimistic, looking for some 63 basis points off three-month money by the end of the year. French franc interest rate futures were more generally upbeat yesterday as the French currency stabilised against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges. After closing at 92.65 on Monday night, the September Pibor contract rose to a peak of 92.74 in the first hour of trading yesterday, but later fell back to close at 92.70. Dealers are clearly looking for little change in yesterday's cash rate of about 7.35 per cent before next week. The December contract was more ebullient, peaking at 94.11 yesterday, some 8 basis points above Monday's close. But it slipped back to end at 94.03. Dealers are looking for a large cut of 130 basis points in French three-month money by the year-end. Cash rates in the sterling markets were a little firmer as dealers continued to take the view that UK interest rates would not come down quickly. Three-month money was about  1/16 percentage point higher at 5 15/16 per cent. Short-dated interest rates were little affected by a shortage of Pounds 600m announced by the Bank of England.</p>

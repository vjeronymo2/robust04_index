			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading IT WAS another heavy trading session in the derivatives market yesterday. This time, however, sentiment turned sharply into reverse as sterling fell and the City of London flinched at the possibility that UK base rates might have to rise after all. Traders in stock index futures, where the premium on the December over the September contract remained at recent levels, said there was no heavy selling. 'It was more like Chinese torture,' commented one. By the close, futures traders agreed with their colleagues in the stock market that the odds were now heavily on a rise in UK interest rates. Turnover in September totalled 17,634 contracts and the price slid in tandem with the FT-SE Index itself, closing at 2,363, a discount of about seven points. September expires on Friday and dealers were again busy rolling positions over into the December quotation. In traded options, turnover remained high, at 33,293 contracts, albeit slightly under Monday's total. The FT-SE option attracted good business, recording 15,459 contracts, and the Euro-FT-SE was also active, on 1,313 lots. BTR, regarded as vulnerable to higher interest rates, topped the actives list with 3,511 contracts dealt.</p>

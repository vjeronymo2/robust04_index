			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Opening address by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi </F> at joint news conference with U.S. President Bill Clinton in  Rome on 2 Jun]    [Text] I would like to begin by thanking President Clinton  for beginning his stay in Europe--during which he will  commemorate the liberation America brought to us, the liberation  from fascism and from Nazi totalitarianism--here in Italy. We  had an interesting meeting in which I was able to explain  directly the situation in Italy: the new government and its  program, the background behind our new electoral law, as well as  Italy's willingness to continue with our international treaties  and obligations. I told President Clinton that Italy has always  sought a climate of closeness with the United States  specifically, as well as with international organizations.    Next, we discussed international political issues. We will  be honored to have President Clinton as our guest in Naples for  the G-7 summit. Economics will be the key theme at the summit;  above all the question of employment, which is difficult to link  with the issue of technological development. This question  affects every country in the West.    We then viewed the current world scene and discussed the  necessity of international organizations being able to intervene  more quickly and efficiently in the various regional crisis that  bring so much pain and suffering to the local populations. I  then expressed to President Clinton our gratitude for that which  the United States, along with its allies, accomplished 50 years  ago. These 50 years for us have meant freedom. To put it  bluntly, without that freedom which President Clinton sees here  today in Italy, there would not have been a rebuilt Italy, which  came with the sacrifice of so many young American lives. We  remember this and it is because of this sense of commemoration  and friendship that we have given this welcome here to President  Clinton and his entourage.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARD'S DREAM PUT 'MAJOR LEAGUE' UNDERDOGS ON TOP  </P> <P> "One of the biggest disappointments of my young life was when the Cleveland  Indians lost the World Series to the Giants," said screenwriter David Ward, who  was 9 and living in Cleveland when the Indians blew their last chance in 1954.  </P> <P> "It taught me that things don't always happen the way you think they should,"  he said. "It was a real crusher to me."  </P> <P> Ward, who won a screenwriting Oscar for "The Sting," has had his own  disappointments.  </P> <P> He wrote and directed "Cannery Row," starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger, and  wrote the adaptation for Robert Redford's "The Milagro Beanfield War." Neither  was a commercial or critical success.  </P> <P> His fascination for the game of baseball and his affection for the Indians  persisted, along with his desire to write and direct a movie with major stars  that would do big business at the box office.  </P> <P> Ward said he wrote "Major League" without studio backing five years ago. "I  followed (the Indians) over the years," Ward said, "hoping they would return to  glory. Thirty-four years later, they still haven't won anything. I wanted to do  a film about an underdog team and I can't think of a more underdog team than  Cleveland."  </P> <P> This time out -- with full cooperation of the Cleveland Indians franchise,  which approved the script, and former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth --  the Indians would win.  </P> <P> "This is a story of personal and team redemption," said Ward, who wanted his  contemporary comedy about something "so quintessentially American" to look and  feel like real baseball -- "The Not So Magnificent Seven." In spite of the  spate of baseball movies in release and in production and the success of "Bull  Durham," which had a similar storyline, Ward pressed for financing and a start  date.  </P> <P> "I was a little concerned about (the other baseball movies), but they're  different enough," Ward said. "I wanted to do a contemporary comedy about major  league ball. In writing the script, which is about American values, I tried to  figure out what is American. Baseball is a game we invented. We have a  proprietary interest in it. We feel like it's our game. Baseball was a part of  my social fabric. (The ball park) was a place to be with friends, to hang out."  </P> <P> Ward's love of baseball and affection for an American tale of redemption was  shared by Chris Chesser, a lifelong baseball fan and former New York-based film  distributor. Now an independent producer in Los Angeles, he shares producer  credit on "Major League" with Irby Smith.  </P> <P> Chesser grew up two blocks from the Cleveland Indians' spring training field in  Tucson, home of the Tucson Toros. Chesser, who is collaborating with Ward on  film and television projects, was equally committed to a contemporary comedy  about the underdog team he knew so well coming up a winner.  </P> <P> And Chesser thinks "Major League" has "blockbuster potential" in spring  release, in spite of the competition.  </P> <P> "This is not 'War and Peace,' " Chesser said, "it's a comedy with great  dialogue that is extremely well executed."  </P> <P> "Major League" is a surprise box-office hit for a baseball film. It has been  America's most popular movie during its two weeks in release, taking in more  than $20 million.  </P> <P> Ward said it was important to him that the audience feel a part of what is  happening on screen in "Major League."  </P> <P> "Other baseball movies used baseball in the background, or in a very  unrealistic way," he said.  </P> <P> "The plot mechanics are ridiculous. The actors couldn't play baseball. A lot of  it lacked credibility. It has to be realistic. . . . It's very important to me  to have it look and feel like real major league baseball."  </P> <P> "Miami Vice" production designer Jeffrey Howard was hired to give the picture  visual wit and sparkle. And director of photography Reynaldo Villalobos, who  shot the hits "Risky Business" and "Urban Cowboy," was signed on, partly  because of his experience as a cameraman for "ABC Wide World of Sports" in the  '70s.  </P> <P> The project was a challenge that held the promise of redemption, of a sort, for  each of "Major League's" three stars, who said the movie allowed them to play  out a childhood fantasy as well as prove something in the adult world of  moviemaking.  </P> <P> Charlie Sheen, who plays a pitcher who steals cars in the off-season, sees his  role as a larger-than-life portrait of the artist as reckless young man.  </P> <P> "I'm the most intense man on the team," Sheen said, but "Major League" is a  comedy, so "there is less pressure on me as an actor. I (got) to show up on the  set and laugh. It's different. It's light. I have done something finally that  is a correlation of my dreams and my current profession."  </P> <P> Sheen apparently had a pretty good fastball of his own when he was playing ball  at Santa Monica High School. He said he was offered a baseball scholarship to  the University of Kansas, but he was tempted away from college by a role in  "Grizzly II, The Predator" a few days after graduation.  </P> <P> "I don't regret not continuing with baseball," Sheen said, "but I'll always  wonder."  </P> <P> Knowing he still had a good fast ball -- clocked at more than 80 m.p.h. -- and  wanting to see it on film, Sheen signed up for "Major League," a film that  reunites him with his "Platoon" co-star Tom Berenger.  </P> <P> Berenger plays the team's Wise Man, an over-the-hill catcher who counsels Sheen  and pulls the team together in their last bid for glory. He trained for the  role with technical adviser Steve Yeager, the ex-Dodger catcher who retired in  1987 and now sells cars in Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> In spite of earlier injuries that made training painful, Berenger said he  proved to himself that he could stretch his hamstrings, make his knees work and  catch like a pro. With his left hip and knee broken in a car accident a few  years ago, doing physical roles is "not as easy as it used to be," Berenger  said, but Yeager wouldn't let him quit until he was done, and he wouldn't stop  until it was right.  </P> <P> Corbin Bernsen cut short a vacation in Rome with Amanda Pays and commuted  between Los Angeles and Tucson to take the role of Dorn, written as Beck, which  he felt sounded a little too much like Arnie Becker, his "L.A. Law" persona.  </P> <P> He was completing work on "Bert Rigby, You're a Fool" for director Carl Reiner,  but showed up on the Tucson playing field with his own Dodgers gear, soon  replaced with Indians gear, and a special request.  </P> <P> Although his baseball character wears an ascot and carries a briefcase, Bernsen  didn't want Beck to be confused with his work on "L.A. Law."  </P> <P> Ward agreed to change the name from Beck to Dorn, but similarities in the vain,  womanizing character remain.  </P> <P> Even so, Bernsen said he hoped "Major League" would help pull him out of the  minors.  </P> <P> "I know these are name movie actors," he said, but I hope they saw the  possibility in this movie for an ensemble film . . . I hope I'll get to the  point where it's my name that's the bankability factor."  </P> <P> He is always looking for ways to show what is behind his blue eyes and easy  charm.  </P> <P> "I like to create a character that will make you say, 'Yeah, blue eyes, nice  haircut. Nice car. What? Oh, I see. . . ."  </P> <P> With "Major League," Bernsen said, "I think people will start to see I can do  other things."  </P></p>

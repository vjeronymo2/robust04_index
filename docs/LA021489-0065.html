			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A coalition of Hispanic groups meeting in Santa Ana urged President Bush to  replace Harold Ezell, western regional commissioner of the Immigration and  Naturalization Service, and disavowed efforts by a local Hispanic group to  honor the controversial INS official. State and regional members of the League  of United Latin American Citizens, a national Hispanic rights group, announced  they would demonstrate outside a reception honoring Ezell planned in Costa Mesa  by LULAC's Bellflower chapter. Angry LULAC officials urged the group's  executive committee to expel the Bellflower chapter and its head, Jose Pacheco,  from the national organization for sponsoring the reception, claiming the  ceremony could give Bush a misleading impression that local Hispanic groups  support Ezell.  </P></p>

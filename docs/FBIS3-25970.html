The Pentagon has announced the identification of remains  belonging to a U.S. soldier previously list as missing from the  Korean war.    "This is the first such identification of remains returned  to  us by the Korean People's Army since the end of the war," said  the Pentagon spokeswoman Kathleen Delaski at a regular news  briefing.    This soldier's remains were returned with a group of 33  remains that the DPRK handed over to U.S. last November 30.    The Pentagon has tentatively identified four other sets of  remains, but those associations must be studied and affirmed by  an Army review board before they are announced as positive  identifications.    "The U.S. Government welcomes and appreciates the  cooperation  of the Korean People's Army that resulted in accounting for this  American soldier," Delaski said.    "We hope that such cooperation will lead to increased  results  in the future," the spokeswoman added.</p>

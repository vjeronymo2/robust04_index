			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Creditors continue the waiting game: How much and when they will be paid is shrouded in uncertainty 'The annual question is when and how much the creditors will be paid,' said Mr Christopher Morris, a liquidator of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, yesterday. 'The answer is still shrouded in uncertainty.' Nearly three years after BCCI was closed by regulators in July 1991, those who lost money will still need a good deal more patience before seeing much sign of redress. While some fresh information was provided yesterday by Touche Ross, BCCI's liquidator, in the annual filing with the Department of Trade and Industry, many gaps remain. While some creditors have received partial interim payments through compensation schemes, there is no sign of any quick disbursement from BCCI's diminishing assets. The liquidators have never revised their original estimate that creditors may ultimately receive 30p-40p in the pound. Mr Morris said yesterday there was 'no reason to change it'. The total value of claims against BCCI remains unclear. So far there are creditors demanding nearly Dollars 3.2bn against the English assets alone. Many may not identify themselves until the prospect of a dividend looms. Other claims may come from legal actions against the bank, including Dollars 2.2bn allegedly stolen from the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder, unless the liquidators successfully conclude an agreement with it. The final figure will also depend on how many of the separate national BCCI liquidations around the world decide to 'pool' their assets with the English liquidation. This will in turn depend on the level of any revised dividend. A number of models have been developed by the liquidators to juggle these elements. One such calculation suggests possible total claims in the range of Dollars 9bn to Dollars 9.5bn. The assets to be distributed are equally hazy - although certainly far smaller. Total estimated realisations from BCCI's stated assets in the UK, Isle of Man and Luxembourg are Dollars 1.2bn. More will come from interest, less a large proportion spent on professional fees and running costs. If other parts of BCCI - notably BCCI Overseas - join the pooling agreement, their assets will also swell the pot available for distribution by several hundred million dollars. A further Dollars 750m-Dollars 1bn may come from assets and the share in out-of-court settlements negotiated with the US authorities by BCCI and other related parties. The government of Abu Dhabi earlier this year provisionally agreed to a revised deal in which it would pay Dollars 1.8bn to creditors in exchange for a waiver of litigation against it by the liquidators. Mr Morris said yesterday that it may take another two months before the detailed legal agreement is completed. It must then be submitted to the BCCI creditors' committees for approval, and then ratified in the English, Luxembourg and Cayman Islands courts. In total, these sources might provide a total of assets available relatively soon for distribution to creditors of a maximum of something over Dollars 4bn. Any further realisations will come from litigation, which could take many years. Touche Ross has sued Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney, now part of Ernst &amp; Young, as auditors to the bank, for Dollars 11bn. It has sued the Bank of England for more than Pounds 550m. Writs have also been issued against the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, its former chief operating officer; the IML, the Luxembourg banking regulator; BCCI's directors; and the Gokal brothers, controllers of the Gulf shipping group which proved one of BCCI's largest debtors. Mr Morris said yesterday that further legal actions were also likely. All this means that on the most optimistic view creditors are unlikely to receive a dividend until well into next year. This could total 15p-20p in the pound. Further payments will be subject to considerable uncertainty and delay.</p>

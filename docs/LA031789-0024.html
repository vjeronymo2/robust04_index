			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GRADUATION MOVED FROM 7 TO 11 A.M.;  </P> <P> CSUN RELENTS; TO LET CLASS OF '89 SLEEP IN  </P> <P> For graduating seniors at Cal State Northridge, the first day of the rest of  their lives will start a little later.  </P> <P> Responding to complaints from students and parents, the university said  Thursday that it will change the start of spring graduation ceremonies May 26  from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m.  </P> <P> CSUN administrators announced the 7 a.m. start time last month, saying the  early hour would avoid high temperatures and be symbolic of a new beginning for  graduates.  </P> <P> "We had thought that the students would be excited about it," university  spokeswoman Ann Salisbury said. "That didn't happen . . . . You have to listen  to what the students want."  </P> <P> Some of the 4,650 graduating students and their parents complained to  university officials that they would have to awake before dawn to attend the  ceremony at the Hollywood Bowl.  </P> <P> Valerie Kuklensky, managing editor of the Daily Sundial, the campus newspaper,  said most letters to the editor on the subject opposed the 7 a.m. start. She  said many students charged that the early hour was an attempt to curtail  drinking and rowdiness, but Salisbury denied that was the purpose.  </P> <P> The university decided to hold the event at the Bowl because construction has  closed the grassy area in front of Oviatt Library, where graduation ceremonies  usually take place.  </P> <P> Some students also have complained about plans to limit the number of relatives  and friends that can be invited to the Bowl, which holds fewer people than the  campus graduation site. Salisbury said Thursday that most students will be  limited to four tickets each, but some may be given more if other students  order less than four.  </P> <P> The Bowl has 17,960 seats and 3,500 parking spaces.  </P> <P> Salisbury said the Bowl's design will not permit students to march on stage to  receive their diplomas, as has been done in ceremonies on campus. But  administrators hope that a way can be found for university President James W.  Cleary to individually recognize each student, she said.  </P> <P> "It was never anyone's hope that students wouldn't get this recognition," she  said.  </P></p>

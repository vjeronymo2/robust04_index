			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: "SFT Fears Hidden Environmental </F> Catastrophe"]    [Text] Norway's Pollution Authority [SFT] fears that the  tolerance threshold for environmental toxins will soon be  reached in Norway.    "We are concerned. There are enormous gaps in our knowledge  about the effects of environmental toxins. We know they are  extremely toxic even in small quantities and that they become  concentrated in the food chain and in nature because they fail  to break down," said SFT Director Harald Rensvik.    Yesterday SFT published its new comprehensive report on  environmental toxins in Norway. The previous one came out six  years ago.    The main conclusions are clear: Norwegian emissions have  been  radically reduced since 1985. In the case of many environmental  toxins, industrial spillage into the waterways has been reduced  by more than 90 percent. Nevertheless, environmental toxins  are a greater threat to nature and the health of Norwegians than  ever before. The problem is that, once emitted, pollutants  remain in nature, and with the constant influx of toxins from  abroad, environmental authorities fear that the tolerance  threshold will soon be reached. Although unable to predict what  will happen, where it will happen, or when, environmental  authorities know that serious environmental problems are  developing in the natural world around us.    We receive greater quantities of many of the most dangerous  environmental toxins from abroad than we produce ourselves. The  major portion is carried on the air and wind from power plants  and industries on the continent. Some also come on the ocean  currents.    "Approximately four tons of cadmium is dumped on the  Norwegian environment each year. Three of these come from other  countries, while our own emissions account for just one ton. The  proportions are similar for other toxins," said Rensvik.    SFT says in its report that the work of reducing Norwegian  emissions must continue. "We used the easiest and cheapest  methods. The percentage that remains must also be eliminated if  the fjords and nature areas ruined by Norwegian pollution are to  be completely restored. There is still a long way to go before  crabs can be fished out of the Frie Fjord. But it is entirely  within the realm of possibility to get there," Rensvik said.    While most Norwegian toxic waste has a concrete source that  can be identified and cleaned up, it is harder in the case of  foreign pollutants. Norwegian pollutants harm one end of a fjord  or the flora and fauna of a limited region. Pollutants from  abroad are spread over the entire country by means of rain,  wind, and ocean currents. This means that the authorities have  limited knowledge of how long it will be until nature's  tolerance threshold is reached:    "In terms of climate, the Norwegian environment is in grave  trouble. We fear that unforeseen harm can arise as a result of  constantly increasing amounts of cadmium, mercury, and other  environmental toxins that are out there," said Rensvik.    The director of SFT points out that scientists know too  little to say what will happen on the day the tolerance  threshold is exceeded. But Rensvik can mention several  possibilities: severe poisoning, species that become extinct,  species that have problems with reproduction, mutations, injury  to the nervous system. Because substances are concentrated in  the food chain, they can affect people through eating such  things as reindeer meat.    "We conclude that Norway must continue to work for further  reductions both at home and abroad. Because even though our own  emissions have been cut down, the danger to Norway's natural  resources has not been dramatically reduced," said Rensvik.    The report reveals that scientists have discovered  disturbing  amounts of the environmental toxins PCB [polychlorinated  biphenyl] and PAH [expansion unknown] in the Skagerrak trough  and the Norwegian channels, in addition to the known quantities  of imported pollutants. Recent investigations have also  evidenced high concentrations of PCB's in the fatty tissues of  polar bears and Arctic foxes on Spitzbergen. It is believed that  PCB's can lead to a reduced capacity to breed, a weakened immune  system, and behavioral disturbances--especially in sea mammals.  The toxins congregate far from the source, and the effects of  this are unclear.    The reason why advisories have been issued to those who eat  fish and shellfish caught in the fjords is because of earlier  toxin emissions from Norwegian industries. For some of these  fjords, the restrictions have been reduced. In the meantime,  they have been expanded somewhat in other areas because new and  better studies have been done.</p>

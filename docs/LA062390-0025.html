			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER'S MESSAGE FOR SHAMIR'S NEW GOVERNMENT  </P> <P> You chastise Shamir for being quoted in the press and then claiming a  misunderstanding when a furor arises (editorial, June 15). Recently, Secretary  of State James Baker testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign  Operations on a State Department report that held that the Palestine Liberation  Organization is still engaged in terrorism and supports a long-range strategy  of terrorism.  </P> <P> While Baker conceded to the report, he testified: "Generally speaking, the PLO  has complied with its December '88 commitments." Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.)  pointed to the inconsistency of Baker's remarks, stating: "I just don't think  you can ride both those horses." Baker's inconsistencies do not seem to bother  The Times. Shamir's do.  </P> <P> Israel, in its 1948 Declaration of Independence, offers its hand to all its  neighboring states in an offer of peace. In 1967, the Arab leaders adopted  their formula of no peace, no negotiations with Israel.  </P> <P> The PLO is on the United States list as a terrorist organization, Yasser Arafat  is on that list as a terrorist. Arafat is not permitted to enter the U.S. to  address the U.N. The PLO declares in its charter that the state of Israel is  illegal and that it intends to have all the land from the Jordan River to the  Mediterranean Sea for a Palestinian state.  </P> <P> Now, we have Baker's message to Israel: "When you're serious about peace, call  us." The Times seems to concur with Baker.  </P> <P> There can be only one explanation for this nonsense: Meshuga! Meshuga! Meshuga!  </P> <P> SHELDON KRONFELD  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Business school director resigns PROFESSOR Tom Cannon resigned yesterday as director of Manchester Business School, clearing the way for controversial plans by Manchester University to change the structure of management research and education in the city. The plans have already caused 14 private-sector representatives to resign from the business school's council. They demanded an inquiry by Mr John Patten, the education secretary. With Prof Cannon no longer available to lead the school's fight for greater autonomy from the university, Mr Patten is thought unlikely to intervene. Prof Cannon and the university yesterday agreed a statement to reduce the blow to the university's prestige caused by the high-level resignations - which were led by Sir Dennis Landau, chief executive of the Co-operative Wholesale Society. Prof Cannon, who had two years of his contract still to run, said a recent sabbatical had given him the chance to look into new areas of research which he would now pursue. The university appointed him to a part-time visiting chair in corporate responsibility. The university plans to federate the management education and research activities of the business school, the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist) and the university's department of accounting. They have sofar operated separately. Prof Cannon said a new ordinance brought in by the university to regularise financial accountability would alter the remit of the school's director and its council. The ordinance will in effect remove the business school's autonomy and abolish its council. The council's 14 lay members, who resigned, say the university does not understand the relationship needed between the public and private sectors in management education, which requires more autonomy from the university, not less. The university admitted in the joint statement with Prof Cannon that its relations with the business school have been difficult for many years - and well before Prof Cannon's arrival in 1989. It says they were forced into new prominence by the Education Reform Act, which required the university to define clearer lines of financial accountability. In what amounts to a public testimonial for Prof Cannon, the university says he doubled the size of the school, attracted record numbers of postgraduate students, improved the quality of its research, enhanced its academic reputation and achieved two years of record profits.</p>

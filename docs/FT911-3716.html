			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / AT&amp;T raises stakes in battle for NCR: Offer for computer maker increased to Dollars 110 per share in paper bid The hostile takeover battle for NCR took a dramatic turn this week when American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US telecommunications group, offered to increase its bid to Dollars 110-a-share. However, the new proposal also suggested replacing the cash consideration by all-paper terms. Yesterday, NCR said that it was concerned that the AT&amp;T offer might not be worth as much as Dollars 110 a share by the time the offer closed, if AT&amp;T shares fell heavily. 'That's the sticking point,' said an NCR official. NCR, the fifth-largest computer manufacturer in the US, has been in discussions all weekend with AT&amp;T officials. The NCR board has yet to make any official comment on the proposal announced late on Sunday night. If AT&amp;T is now in sight of achieving its aim of buying NCR, the only sure winners are likely to be NCR's own shareholders. The takeover battle is likely to cost AT&amp;T Dollars 1.36bn more than it bargained for; and there will be no guarantee that AT&amp;T's dreams of building a successful global information technology company - spanning computers and communications - can be realised. NCR shareholders will have seen the value of their investments increase almost two and a third times in the past four months if the latest proposal goes ahead. They owe thanks for their good fortune to the rugged determination of Mr Charles 'Chuck' Exley, NCR president, to hold out for the best possible price once it seemed clear there was no hope of resisting AT&amp;T's embrace. It was not a universally popular attitude. NCR's shareholders interested in the future of the company as a computer business applaud Mr Exley's apparent intransigence; those who are interested chiefly in realising the value of their investment as quickly as possible - Wall Street's arbitrage community  -think he has merely been dragging out the inevitable. AT&amp;T's opening bid in December last year - at Dollars 90 a share - valued NCR at Dollars 6.12bn. Although Mr Exley immediately rejected the offer - arguing there was no industrial logic in the takeover - he suggested that the companies could do business if AT&amp;T valued NCR at Dollars 8.5bn or Dollars 125 a share. From that point, resistance deteriorated into price haggling. Mr Exley reduced his demand to Dollars 110 a share while Mr Robert Allen, chairman of AT&amp;T, raised his offer first to Dollars 100 a share and then two days ago to NCR's asking price. The latest offer values the company at Dollars 7.48bn. Under AT&amp;T's new proposal, investors would get 2.943 AT&amp;T shares for every NCR share held. AT&amp;T claimed that this was the equivalent of Dollars 110 a share, based on AT&amp;T's close on Friday. To protect NCR investors against a future fall in AT&amp;T stock, the bidder said it would be willing to offer up to 3.099 shares if the price averaged less than Dollars 37.375 during a 20-day period ahead of an NCR shareholder meeting to vote on the merger. Yesterday, NCR's shares rose Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 101 7/8 - well short of the Dollars 110 figure - with AT&amp;T falling Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 36 1/8 . The new offer could break the impasse in what has been one of the most bitterly-fought takeover battles the modern computer industry has ever witnessed. If the offer is accepted, then AT&amp;T will have spent more than Dollars 12m in legal fees and NCR about Dollars 7m on its defensive strategy. From the outset, a sizeable proportion of NCR's shareholders had wanted to accept the AT&amp;T bid. AT&amp;T, however, was constrained from simply buying shares in the market by Maryland's takeover laws. NCR showed an appetite for the fight which surprised those familiar with its sleepy marketing methods. It deployed a series of 'poison pill' defences including an employee share ownership scheme, which was later declared invalid. AT&amp;T set up a proxy battle at the NCR shareholders' meeting in March and succeeded in ousting four directors, including the chairman. AT&amp;T's battle for NCR is, however, likely to prove only the beginning of a very long road for North America's largest telecommunications company. The history of mergers between large electronics groups is stained with red ink and littered with failures. Unisys, for example, the world's fifth-largest computer company forged five years ago from parts of Sperry and the Burroughs Corporation, lost Dollars 436m in 1990. It is still struggling to resolve the problem of two completely different product families. Siemens-Nixdorf, put together just over 12 months ago from the loss-making Nixdorf and the barely-profitable computer operations of Siemens, is expected to lose money this year. It is proving difficult to find common ground between the radically different cultures of the two companies. Groupe Bull, which two years ago took over the US personal computer manufacturer, Zenith, has been experiencing similar problems. This is despite Groupe Bull's declared intention to manage the company at arms length from the rest of its computer operations. Groupe Bull is being propped up with FFr4bn (Pounds 397m) of investment from its largest shareholder, the French government. Furthermore, over the past decade both AT&amp;T and International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, have made abortive efforts to invade each other's territory. AT&amp;T's basic plan is to merge its small and unsuccessful computer business into NCR, leaving the Ohio-based company essentially alone to manage the business. Superficially, it is an attractive idea. For a new computer company to stand a chance of success today it must: Have identified a market niche in which it can be a leader; Offer products based on low-cost, standard microprocessor chips; Offer 'open' systems based on standard operating software; Have firm control of 'channels' - dealers, value-added resellers and software houses who provide the conduit between the manufacturers and their customers. AT&amp;T developed, and owns copyright on, the software system, Unix, which most manufacturers now agree will become the industry standard for open systems. NCR, alone among the large computer manufacturers, has taken the plunge into designs based on low-cost microprocessors and the Unix operating system. Despite the fact that it is not among the world's top 10 computer manufacturers, NCR is a leading supplier of financial systems and dominates the market for automated teller machines - 'holes-in-the-wall'. NCR, which began as a manufacturer of cash registers in the 1800s, would give AT&amp;T's computer ambitious a powerful fillip through its distribution channels. It has already been identified by Europe's largest manufacturers as a potential route into the US market. The big question is whether it will be possible for the staff of two such different companies to work together profitably. AT&amp;T has no record of success in computers. Its computer division turns over about Dollars 1.5bn a year and loses about Dollars 200m. A merger with NCR may be its last chance. But if it fails, it will bring the computer manufacturer down with it and Chuck Exley's worst fears about a merger he never wanted will have been realised.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 6 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan arrived in  Mexico from Guatemala early Monday [6 June] morning (Taipei  time) for a private visit, according to a news release issued by  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    Lien is visiting Mexico at the invitation of his friend,  Mario Vazquez, who owns a number of news organizations and  businesses in the Central American country, the ministry said.    Vazquez, who visited Taiwan last year, is very friendly to  Taiwan and has contributed a lot to promoting substantive  relations between the Republic of China [ROC] and Mexico, the  ministry noted. Lien is the highest-ranking ROC official to  visit Mexico since the two countries severed diplomatic ties in  1971.    While there, the ministry said, Lien will meet with Mexican  business leaders on Mexico's economic situation since it joined  the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).    Lien may also exchange views with Mexican officials on  possible investment and economic cooperation projects between  the two countries and seek Mexico's support for Taiwan's bid to  join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, government  sources said.    Taiwan-Mexican trade has increased steadily since 1989 when  the semi-official China External Trade Development Council  opened a representative office in Mexico. Two-way trade totaled  about US $700 million in 1993, with Taiwan enjoying a surplus of  US $300 million.    As a NAFTA member, Mexico provides easy access for foreign  investors to the vast North American market. Many Taiwan  companies have set up production facilities in Mexican cities  bordering the United States in recent years.    The ROC opened a representative office in Mexico City on May  1 to further promote bilateral exchanges. In Taipei, Mexico has  issued multiple entry visas for Taiwan visitors since June 1991.    Lien is being accompanied by his wife and several Foreign  Ministry officials, including Vice Foreign Minister Fang  Chin-yen, on his Mexican tour.    Lien will leave Mexico Tuesday (Taipei time) for New York  for  a family reunion with his two children who are studying there.  The premier is scheduled to return to Taipei Saturday.    Lien, heading a 21-member entourage, flew to El Salvador in  late May to attend the inauguration of new Salvadoran president,  Armando Calderon Sol. He then made a four-day official visit to  Guatemala. Most members of Lien's entourage will not accompany  Lien to Mexico and the United States.    This is Lien's second overseas trip this year, following a  visit to Honduras and Belize in January.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Algeria's Central Bank announced today that Algeria  had officially contacted the Paris Club to reschedule its  estimated 26-billion dollar foreign debt.    The same source clarified that the Paris Club debt  rescheduling concerned bilateral debts which constitute 60  percent of Algeria's medium and long-term debts. The bank added  that indebtedness would decrease by 4 billion dollars during  this year and by 5 billion dollars over the period of a standby  agreement with the International Monetary Fund from April until  March 1995. (Rachid Benhelmi) reports:    [Begin (Benhelmi) recording] Algeria's Central Bank  statement  said that the Paris Club had been contacted after signing a  letter of intent with the IMF in order to reschedule Algeria's  bilateral debts which constitute about 60 percent of total  medium and long-term debts. They include loans granted and  guaranteed by governments or creditors' governmental  institutions.    According to the Bank of Algeria, negotiations will start  soon with international banks to reschedule repayment dates for  medium-term bank debts.    It is expected, according to experts, that the rescheduling  of payments for bank debts would reduce debt servicing in the  medium and long-term.    Running parallel to these negotiations, discussions with  some  multilateral institutions, particularly the World Bank, the  African Development Bank, the Arab Monetary Fund, the European  Community, and other main bodies dealing with Algeria -- like  industrialists and traders -- would take place. It is expected  that these discussions would lead to clinching additional  financial reserves to cover requirements in foreign financing.    The short-term debts which should be repaid within one year  or less would not be subject to rescheduling and their interest  would be paid on time. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): Bears in charge, as low interest rates oblige US investors to buy stocks AN ECONOMY that continues to struggle, concern about President Clinton's plans to raise taxes and uncertainty about other elements of his economic policy, mixed expectations of future corporate earnings and a temporary outbreak of inflation fever combined to keep US stock markets trapped in a relatively narrow trading range during the second quarter of 1993. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 81 points, or 2.4 per cent, to end the three months at 3,516.08. The Dow did, however, set several new record highs during the quarter, peaking at 3,554.83 on May 27. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, a broader measure of market performance, stood still between April and June, ending just 1.14 points lower at 450.53. The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks gained 2 per cent to end at 690.14. The fundamentals of the equity markets were predominantly bearish throughout the three months - economic growth continued to lag expectations, many companies issued warnings about future earnings, and stocks remained expensive, with p/e ratios at historically high levels. That prices managed to hold their ground against such an unpromising background was the result of two factors. First, interest rates stayed low throughout the period, and despite a brief scare in May when it looked as if the Federal Reserve might have to raise rates to curb what appeared to be a revival of inflation, monetary policy remained unchanged. Second, vast sums of investors money continued to pour into stocks, much of it via the booming mutual fund industry. Once again, pitifully low interest returns on short-term assets forced investors to switch their funds into equities (and bonds) in search of better yields. Although fund managers stored some of the new money as cash to hedge against a market downturn, they put the bulk of it into stocks, providing a crucial support for prices in the process. In essence, the quarter was one good month sandwiched between two bad months. In April, the markets went nowhere, and the main feature was heavy selling of consumer brand stocks such as Heinz, Kellogg and Procter &amp; Gamble, sparked by Philip Morris's surprise decision to launch a cigarette price war to revive sales of Marlboro, its ailing top brand. In May, stocks surged as inflation fears, which had been fuelled by several months of worrying high consumer and producer price rises, abated. A temporary break in the gold rally, which had also fanned the inflation fires, further buoyed sentiment, as did the passage of President Clinton's deficit-reduction package through the House of Representatives. June, however, saw the markets come back down to earth, even though the inflation numbers again proved better than anticipated. The main culprit was a string of profits warnings from big companies (including Kmart, Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing and Apple Computer), which forced investors to downgrade their expectations for second-quarter earnings. The quarter ended, however, on something of a high note, with bond yields dropping to new historic lows. Yet, the economic outlook remained gloomy, with consumer confidence and spending apparently handcuffed by fears of rising taxes and unemployment. In Canada, confidence in the burgeoning economic revival, and low interest rates, provided stocks with a considerable boost. On the corporate front, leading companies continued to restructure, while the big political news was the election by the ruling Conservative party of its first woman leader, and prime minister, Kim Campbell. During the quarter the TSE 300 Composite index jumped 370 points, or more than 10 per cent, to end at 3,966.37. In Mexico, the stock markets stuttered, with the Prices and Quotations Index losing more than 100 points, or 5.7 per cent, to end at 1,670.29. Sluggish economic growth, worries about corporate earnings and fresh fears about another delay to implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement were the main factors behind Mexico's poor performance.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Queens Moat accounts THE NEW management team at Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group which was plunged into crisis talks with its bankers in March, is close to finalising its accounts for 1992 and expects to post them to shareholders by the end of next week. The accounts will call for the annual meeting to be reconvened on November 29. The meeting has been adjourned since August awaiting the final figures. Although they are still being worked on, the accounts could show negative net assets compared with shareholders' funds of Pounds 1.3bn at the end of 1991. The group's debts exceed Pounds 1bn. The sharp reduction in asset values reflects property write-downs, described by insiders as 'horrendous', and retained losses. The fall in asset values reaffirms speculation that the figures might have been overstated in earlier balance sheets. The company's new directors have already said they are considering taking action over the accounts. As a result of the drop in asset value, the group has had to call an extraordinary meeting because net assets total less than half the paid-up share capital of Pounds 251.5m. The EGM will be held on November 22, but will be adjourned and combined with the annual meeting.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Clinton steps up pressure over Bosnia peace plan THE Bosnian Serbs are facing growing international pressure to accept the peace plan put forward by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international mediators, now that the Bosnian Moslems have signed its main and most controversial element. Yesterday US President Bill Clinton promised a concerted diplomatic effort to 'press' the Serbs to join the accord and threatened to increase sanctions if they did not. 'I think international impatience is going to grow rather rapidly with the Serbs if they are going to continue with the carnage in Bosnia,' he said yesterday after a White House meeting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr Alijah Izetbegovic, the Bosnian Moslem leader. Mr Clinton said America's allies were now more eager to enforce a ban on flights by Serbian aircraft over Bosnia and the US was ready to try to strengthen international economic sanctions. By endorsing the map of the semi-autonomous provinces into which Bosnia-Hercegovina would be divided, Mr Izetbegovic has ensured that most of the blame for the continuation of the Bosnian conflict will be put on Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. Though Moscow's envoy to the peace talks, Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian deputy foreign minister, was reported to have tried hard to persuade Mr Karadzic to change his mind, he persisted in his refusal to sign the map. Mr Karadzic is now the only Bosnian leader not to have accepted either the map or the interim arrangements to be implemented during the period between a peace settlement and the organisation of elections, though he signed the constitutional framework for the new state at the beginning of this year. The Moslems and Croats, on the other hand, have now accepted all four parts of the peace plan. The US, Britain and France have already begun discussing a new UN Security Council resolution, expected to be voted on next week, which would threaten the rump state of Yugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro - with stronger sanctions if the Bosnian Serbs remain intransigent. The international mediators and western leaders have made no secret of their belief that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia is the only political leader capable of forcing Mr Karadzic to adopt a more constructive attitude, as he did at the time of the Geneva discussions on the constitutional principles for Bosnia. The Security Council resolution is expected to include cutting Serbia's transport links, freezing financial assets and the seizure of aircraft, ships and trucks which have violated existing sanctions. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the aim of the resolution would be to oblige the Serbs to put pressure on their Bosnian Serb allies to negotiate and reach agreement on the peace plan. US officials said existing sanctions were already costing the Serbian economy dearly. However, direct military intervention in Bosnia continues to be ruled out by the major members of the Security Council. President Clinton also repeated yesterday that he planned to discuss with his allies a selective relaxation of the UN arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia to help the Bosnian Moslems, but the suggestion appears to be a non-starter.</p>

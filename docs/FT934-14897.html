			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy The latest UK price and production figures appear to illustrate the dilemma facing the chancellor. If the economy is weak, the argument goes, he cannot easily put up taxes in November. But with the underlying rate of inflation at 3.3 per cent, it also seems risky to cut interest rates. It would be acutely embarrassing if the underlying rate subsequently moved to the top of the 4 per cent target ceiling, or even above it. The government's desire to avoid this may even dampen enthusiasm for higher VAT charges, which only increase the headline rate of inflation. One reading of yesterday's data is that a budget of minimal change is becoming more likely. In the short term that might please the equity market, which, having enjoyed a sharp rebound in earnings so far this year, is starting to worry about whether the momentum can be sustained into 1994. But it would only leave the job of correcting the PSBR to later. In fact there may still be sense in a more radical shift in policy mix at the time of the budget. Manufacturing output is not weak because of poor consumer demand. Rather it is investment goods which have been hit, while weak European markets are holding back exports too. The most helpful palliative would be for lower continental interest rates. Failing that a slightly lower pound might secure some market share for British exporters. Higher tax on individuals offset by lower interest rates would assist industry while having some disinflationary benefit into the bargain.</p>

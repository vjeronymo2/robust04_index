			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1720 GMT on 28 February carries in its "Details"  program an "exclusive" 10-minute interview with Aleksey  Kazannik, former procurator general, conducted by correspondent  Nikolay Svanidze.    Asked whether he thinks that those who walked free from the  Lefortovo prison were criminals, Kazannik replies: "As a former  procurator general I cannot make any such comment. This matter  is exclusively in the jurisdiction of a court. I may have a  personal opinion about them, but if they were amnestied, they  have to be released immediately, whether I like them or not.  The law is the law."    Asked whether Yeltsin and his entourage put any pressure on  him last week, Kazannik says: "Definitely. Because Baturin's  message contained a proposal to disobey or at least to drag out  the amnesty act. Meanwhile, Boris Nikolayevich's [Yeltsin]  resolution said the following: Kazannik, Galushko, and Yerin  are to follow Baturin's instructions. This was direct pressure.  This was direct intervention into the jurisdiction of the  procurator general."    Aleksey Kazannik goes on to say that his duty, as procurator  general, was "to implement a resolution of the State Duma on a  political and economic amnesty." He says that he contacted  Yeltsin on Friday and asked him to repeal his orders, but  Yeltsin categorically refused to do so. During his conversation  with Yeltsin, he offered his resignation, but Yeltsin refused to  accept it, and demanded that Kazannik find a way out of the  situation.    Asked whether Yeltsin made it clear what sort of solution he  was seeking for that situation, Kazannik replies: "No, he did  not make it clear, but later his immediate entourage, his  advisers tried to help me find a solution. But it was an  unlawful solution. In fact, our conversation on Friday boiled  down to how to stop the State Duma resolution." He says that he  was told to ask the Duma to clarify the meaning of the word  "immediately," to explain the fact that one part of the  resolution calls for a general amnesty while another part only  mentions Article 79 of the Constitution, and to define the  difference between an amnesty and a pardon. Kazannik continues:  "Under pressure, I was forced to say that the procuracy would  indeed ask the State Duma for these clarifications, but  nevertheless, I repeatedly said that the procuracy had nothing  to do with this. The procuracy has no legislative powers. It  does not question, but strictly follows legal enactments."    Kazannik adds that some ideas put forward by Yeltsin's  advisers were simply laughable, such as the suggestion to  declare the resolution invalid because it was published in the  wrong section of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA.    Kazannik goes on to say that he is sorry if he disappointed  Yeltsin by not obeying him, but when Yeltsin had appointed him,  he accepted the post on the understanding that he would strictly  follow the laws of the country, rather than personal orders.    In conclusion, Nikolay Svanidze says that Aleksey Kazannik  is  going to give up his recently acquired official residence and  move back to his native Omsk. Meanwhile, the executive power in  Moscow seems to be in complete disarray.</p>

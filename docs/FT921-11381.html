			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Panfida goes into liquidation PANFIDA, the Australia-based group which owns the Martin chain of newsagents, yesterday went into liquidation following the collapse of a proposed Pounds 155m debt-for-equity swap. The main stumbling block to the refinancing appears to have been Panfida's determination to raise Pounds 5m through a placing as part of the debt-for-equity swap. Panfida had announced in September that it had reached agreement on the debt-for-equity proposal with three of its principal non-bank lenders, including Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International which had a 29.9 per cent stake. However, creditors were believed to be unable to agree on a Panfida placing, because its only wholly-owned subsidiary was the Martin newsagents chain. 'There was nothing else generating cash,' said one source close to the company. A liquidator is expected to be named in the next two days. The shares, which were as high as 180p in 1987, were suspended at 2 1/2 p yesterday. A spokesman for News International said the group had written off its Pounds 10m stake in Panfida two years ago. Panfida expanded rapidly in the late 1980s and owned food, property and retailing interests in the US, UK, and Australia. The pre-tax loss for the year to June 30 was Pounds 1.7m, against a loss of Pounds 9.58m the year before, although the group was forced to make a Pounds 17.7m extraordinary provision for its US and Australian assets. The board of Martin and its bankers were anxious last night to distance the group from Panfida's liquidation proceedings. The newsagent had been kept off-balance sheet and therefore had no obligations to Panfida. Mr Michael Peterson, a director of BZW, which is one of Martin's bankers, said: 'Martin is alive and well, and totally supported by its banks.' The newsagent's board said last night that the syndicate of banks which had provided its finance 'now controls and effectively owns the . . . group'. Martin debts total Pounds 100m, leaving Panfida with loans outstanding of about Pounds 55m. News International, which has some Pounds 30m outstanding to Martin, also backed the newsagent. 'We are totally happy with Martin,' the company said. The banks and News International said they would continue to provide financing for Martin, which has 760 outlets.</p>

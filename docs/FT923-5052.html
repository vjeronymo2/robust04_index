			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Pounds 4.25m grant for Welsh rail project RYAN MINING, the indep-endent coal producer, has received a Pounds 4.25m grant from the Welsh Office to help it reopen the railway line in the Vale of Neath and build a rail terminal at Cwmgwrach, West Glamorgan, David Lascelles writes. The terminal is part of a Pounds 14m project by Ryan to expand coal mining in the Neath Valley area and dispense with road-borne coal haulage. The project is expected to produce 600 jobs. Ryan Mining, which specialises in underground mining, is part of Ryan Group  -a possible purchaser of British Coal assets in the forthcoming privatisation.</p>

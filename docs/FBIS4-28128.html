			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Some bright signs are  visible in Japan's economy, although it is still generally  sluggish, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said in a monthly  report Tuesday [7 Jun].    An official at the agency said that the report put a "slight  emphasis" on the bright aspects instead of on the negative  factors.    "The main reason for this is that we've disregarded the view  that industrial production is on a downtrend," he said, noting  that the report now described industrial production as taking  one step forward and one step back.    After rising 4.6 percent in March, industrial production  posted a smaller-than-expected decline of 1.4 percent in April.  It is expected to fall the same 1.4 percent in May and to turn  positive in June by 1.3 percent.    The agency is still cautious about describing the economy as  being on its way to recovery, however.    "I would not say the economy is getting better. In order to  be able to say the economy is recovering, we need to see the  support from capital investment," he said.    The report said that the employment situation is still  harsh,  particularly in the manufacturing sector. However, it termed  the ratio of job openings to seekers as being flat, instead of  on a downward trend as in its May report.    It also said that the unemployment rate is flat, instead of  on the rise as it noted previously. The jobless rate improved  from 2.9 percent in March to 2.8 percent in April.    Consumer spending was described as showing some signs of  picking up -- the same wording as in the previous report.  Household spending fell 4.3 percent in March, the biggest  decline since February 1981, but the agency official brushed the  fall aside, saying that the figure tends to fluctuate on the  purchases of automobiles.</p>

Each of the different panels under the work group has to  present by March 31 a report on the predicted changes that may  take place in connection with the country's joining the EU, a  representative at the Foreign Ministry press office said.    The meetings are to estimate whether the predicted changes  will be in line with Estonia's current principles and directions  of development. Also to be assessed is the volume of work to be  done in preparing for the membership, its costs, and how to get  experts from different fields involved in the project.</p>

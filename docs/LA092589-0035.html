			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Haiti's military government announced that the country will hold general  elections next year, transferring power to a civilian president. It will be  Haiti's first presidential election since Jan. 18, 1988, when civilian Leslie  Manigat was elected in balloting widely regarded as rigged by the army. Manigat  was ousted in a military coup five months later. The government of Lt. Gen.  Prosper Avril said the elections will be held in two rounds -- on Oct. 17 and  Nov. 11, 1990. Avril, who took over in a coup that ousted Lt. Gen. Henri  Namphy, has said repeatedly that he is heading a transition government that  eventually will relinquish power to civilians.  </P></p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Lecturers postpone strike action Further-education college lecturers yesterday postponed plans for a strike over contracts which would increase their working hours and cut holidays. The Natfhe lecturers' union announced that it would reopen negotiations with the Colleges' Employers' Forum over the contracts, and postponed the beginning of any industrial action from February 17 to February 28. However, balloting continues and Natfhe predicted 'overwhelming support' for action.</p>

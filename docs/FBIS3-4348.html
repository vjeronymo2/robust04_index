About 50  more Hong Kong affairs advisers will be appointed in Beijing  after the Easter holiday next month, a Chinese government  official said.    Chan said the Chinese had approached him in an informal way,  indicating their intention of inviting him to join the body.  This was to avoid embarrassment had an official invitation been  turned down. Chan told the Chinese that he preferred not to  accept an offer, saying it was a personal decision. "I don't  think I need to explain why," he said. Chan left the civil  service last June after a 27-year career to become managing  director of Kowloon Motor Bus.    Yeung, who also resigned last year, gave the same reason for  not accepting Beijing's offer. "I've made it public that if I  am asked either by the Chinese government or the Hong Kong  government to give my personal views on any matters to the  extent possible, I will do so if I can without taking any  further position," Yeung said. "I don't need any title."    A locally-based Chinese official refused to confirm Chan and  Yeung's rejection but said it was a matter for individuals  whether to accept. China has invited several former civil  servants to be advisers, including Sir David Akers-Jones, the  former chief secretary, and Wong Ying-wai, the former  administrative officer.</p>

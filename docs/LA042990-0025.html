			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BUSH KEEPS JAPAN OFF 'HIT LIST';  </P> <P> TRADE: THE PRESIDENT POINTS TO RECENT AGREEMENTS BY TOKYO TO OPEN THE MARKET TO  AMERICAN PRODUCTS. INDIA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S LIST OF  THOSE WITH UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES.  </P> <P> President Bush, ignoring congressional pressure, announced Friday that he has  decided not to place Japan on a "hit list" of countries with the worst trade  barriers against U.S. products.  </P> <P> India is the only country his Administration has decided to keep on its list of  nations targeted for unfair trading practices, Bush said in a statement.  </P> <P> Bush hailed what he said was recent progress in easing U.S.-Japanese trade  frictions.  </P> <P> "Promoting a vibrant, open trading relationship with Japan remains a key trade  priority of the Administration," Bush said.  </P> <P> A recent agreement with Japan that included Japanese concessions on opening its  markets to more U.S. goods was a "promising start," he said.  </P> <P> At the same time, Bush said, he was under no illusion that the agreement alone  would "lead to an immediate improvement" in this nation's $49-billion trade  deficit with Japan.  </P> <P> But, he said, he was persuaded that Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and  other Japanese leaders "share my commitment to ensuring that trade strengthens,  rather than undermines, the friendship between our nations."  </P> <P> A year ago, the Administration named Japan, Brazil and India as the countries  with the most offensive barriers to American trade.  </P> <P> Japan and Brazil have won praise from the Administration for making significant  concessions during negotiations aimed at opening their markets to American  products.  </P> <P> But India, which was cited last year for a ban on operations of foreign private  insurance companies and for controls on foreign investment that distort trade,  has refused to make concessions.  </P> <P> U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills said that India was targeted  again because it has the most trade barriers of any non-communist country, and  negotiations over the last year had made no progress.  </P> <P> Several members of Congress had warned the Administration that it would be  making a serious mistake if it failed to target Japan once more as a way of  keeping pressure on the country to honor its market-opening commitments.  </P> <P> But Hills rejected these arguments, saying that the Administration needed  flexibility in its negotiating efforts with other countries.  </P> <P> "We believe we have made enormous progress with Japan in the last few months,"  she told reporters.  </P> <P> Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) said he was glad that  the Administration had at least issued a new Super 301 list, although he was  disappointed that Japan was not included. The 1988 trade law is known as Super  301.  </P> <P> "There has been little improvement in our trade deficit with that country, and  I am a bit of a skeptic as to whether the recent agreements will make much of a  difference," Bentsen said in a statement.  </P> <P> The 1988 trade law required the Administration to issue a target list of  countries with the most offensive trade barriers in 1989 and 1990.  </P> <P> "Let there be no mistake," Bush said. "This Administration is committed to free  and fair trade. We want open markets and fair treatment for our products,  services, investment and ideas."  </P> <P> Bush said he had also directed Hills to "give her highest priority" to seeking  a conclusion by December of international trade liberalization talks now under  way in Geneva.  </P> <P> Sources said India's refusal to seek a negotiated settlement of last year's  trade case prompted the Administration to cite India again.  </P> <P> While the designation of India was likely to meet with approval on Capitol  Hill, the refusal to cite Japan was certain to raise heavy protests.  </P> <P> Many members of Congress said that a failure to cite Japan would indicate that  the Administration is not interested in carrying out the requirements of the  toughest section of the 1988 trade law. The law provides a tight timetable for  negotiating away barriers and provides for economic sanctions if the talks  prove unsuccessful.  </P> <P> They said Super 301 was written with Japan in mind and that Japan needed to be  targeted again to ensure that it lived up to its new-found willingness to lower  trade barriers.  </P> <P> In the days before the decision was announced, Hills lavished praise on both  Japan and Brazil for their willingness to negotiate in good faith and said that  citing Japan again could provoke a backlash in Tokyo, where the Kaifu  government has been pushing to change Japan's trading practices.  </P> <P> In Japan's case, there has been a flurry of trade agreements over the last  month. Japanese negotiators agreed to open their markets for the sale of  U.S.-made satellites, supercomputers and forest products -- the three product  areas cited in last year's Super 301 case.  </P> <P> In addition, Japan and the United States earlier this month completed an  interim agreement designed to attack broad-based structural barriers that are  preventing American and other foreign companies from doing business in Japan.  </P> <P> Hills praised Brazil for undertaking a "fantastic change in policy" under newly  elected President Fernando Collor de Mellor.  </P> <P> Brazil has agreed to cut protectionist barriers and submit for international  settlement the licensing restrictions on imports cited by the United States in  last year's complaint.  </P></p>

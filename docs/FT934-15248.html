			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Tokyo talks to discuss access to insurance markets US AND Japanese negotiators gathered in Tokyo yesterday to discuss the possibility of smoothing access to each other's insurance markets. The US says business practices of Japanese companies create an obstacle to foreign insurers in the Japanese market. Japanese companies tend to deal with insurance companies in their own corporate groups, or keiretsu. This and the fact that car insurance is mainly sold through car dealers have been cited as barriers to foreign companies, which have only about 4 per cent of the Japanese market. Japan, meanwhile, has told the US its state licensing system for insurance companies made it difficult for foreign companies to enter the US market. The insurance talks come at the start of a period of intense trade talks between the two countries. They had been preceded by inconclusive talks between Mr Mike Espy, US secretary of agriculture and Mr Eijiro Hata, agriculture minister. Later this week, officials will turn their attention to Japan's pensions fund management market - another bone of contention. Japan agreed this summer to expand the scope of corporate pension funds that can be managed by foreign investment advisers as part of market opening measures agreed with the US, Canada and the EC in an effort to bring the stalled Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion. The talks this week between the US and Japan covering financial services will be followed next week by talks on trade in cars and car parts, and on government procurement of high technology equipment. In both cases, the US is likely to press Japan to further open its markets to US products.</p>

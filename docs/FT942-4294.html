Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's finance minister, is tall, lean, soft-spoken. He chooses his words carefully. Renato Ruggiero, former Italian trade minister turned senior Fiat executive, is rotund, ebullient, chatty. But they share certain features - apart from their initials.

Ricupero's grandparents were Italian immigrants from Naples, where Ruggiero was born and brought up. Perhaps between them they can stitch the job up . . .</p>

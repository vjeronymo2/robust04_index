After an exceptional charge of Pounds 131,000 relating to reorganisation costs, pre-tax profits for the 12 months to end-March were Pounds 1.06m - down from Pounds 1.5m. Turnover grew from Pounds 39.4m to Pounds 40.3m. The financing costs of the new paper machine installed last year and an increase in bad debts led to the decline. Earnings fell to 8.6p (15p) and a final dividend of 2.025p raises the total to 3p (2.9p).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yusuf Shakir: "Russian Ambassador to Cairo: We </F> Have Stopped Arms Shipments to Yemen; Our Recognition of South  Depends on Brahimi's Report"]    [Text] Cairo -- Russian Ambassador to Cairo Vladimir  Polyakov has denied that Russia has provided any military aid to  the parties to the Yemeni conflict.    He revealed that Moscow has stopped sending arms shipments  to  the two warring parties. He stressed that his country's  recognition or nonrecognition of the South Yemen state will be  determined in the light of the report UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi  is to submit to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali.    The Russian ambassador said following his meeting yesterday  with Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid that  he had informed the League that Moscow has instructed him to  coordinate positions with the Arab League vis-a-vis the Yemeni  crisis and to closely monitor what is happening in Yemen. He  pointed out that Russia supports an immediate cease-fire and the  initiation of a direct dialogue among the conflicting parties.  He added that this is in line with the Arab League's position.  He revealed that the stage ahead will witness a Russian move on  the current situation in Yemen through the results Brahimi is  going to reveal in his report on the crisis. However, he did  not specify the nature of the move.</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COPTER PLUCKS NAVY CLIMBER FROM CLIFF IN DARING RESCUE  </P> <P> A Navy commando who fell off a Mission Trails County Park cliff Monday to a  rock embankment 25 feet below was rescued by San Diego Fire Department and  Sheriff's Department crews, who scaled the cliff and maneuvered a helicopter  dangerously close to the outcropping to get to the injured climber.  </P> <P> The 25-year-old member of the Navy Sea, Air and Land tactical team, whom  authorities would not identify, suffered a concussion, broken ribs and a pelvic  injury. He was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital, where he was listed in good  condition late Monday.  </P> <P> As many as a dozen members of the Navy SEAL team were drilling and had been  free-scaling a 200-foot sheer face of the cliff, above Father Junipero Serra  Trail, without safety ropes Monday afternoon when the man lost his footing and  fell, said Rick Foehr, a supervisor with Hartson Ambulance Service in San  Diego.  </P> <P> Rescue crews climbed up steep, winding trails to reach the man, who had fallen  onto a large rock embankment jutting from the cliff, and found him conscious.  </P> <P> But the crews, fearing the steep trails, called for the Sheriff's Department  helicopter to transport him out, Foehr said.  </P> <P> Pilot Bill Hubbard maneuvered close enough to rest one skid of the helicopter  on the embankment, and rescue crews moved the man inside the copter.  </P> <P> "It went real smooth. It was real good teamwork between all the agencies  involved," Foehr said. "It looks like we definitely saved a life."  </P></p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Kmart sells Pace warehouse stores to Wal-Mart KMART, the second-biggest US retailer, is selling most of its loss-making Pace Membership Warehouse clubs to rival retailer Wal-Mart Stores. Although terms were not disclosed, Kmart said the deal would yield net proceeds of about Dollars 300m in cash, equal to Pace's net tangible book value. It said the sale price included a premium over net book value, which will be used to offset the cost of closing some Pace stores not sold to Wal-Mart. Kmart will take a pre-tax charge of about Dollars 450m against fourth-quarter earnings. Wal-Mart, which owns 326 Sam's Club warehouse stores, is buying 91 Pace outlets. Pace operates 113 stores and had contracts for another 19 which have not opened. Wall Street had expected Kmart to shed its Pace stores. Kmart shares rose Dollars  1/8 to close at Dollars 24 7/8 , while Wal-Mart finished the day up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 27. Kmart's foray into the deep discount market has been beset by problems. It first struggled with Makro, a low-cost, warehouse-style retailer operated in the US as a joint venture between a Michigan-based group and SHV Holdings of the Netherlands. The Makro outlets were merged into the Pace business after Kmart acquired Pace for Dollars 322m in 1989. The timing of Kmart's Pace acquisition was also unfortunate. Shortly after Kmart decided that clubs were more than a fad and expanded into the sector, the industry started to show its vulnerability to competition and the weak economy. Pace, which had operating losses of Dollars 63m in the first half of this year, has been criticised for operating inefficiencies. In contrast, Wal-Mart was quick to spot the potential in the sector, opening three Sam's Wholesale Clubs in 1983. By 1990, the company had more than 140 Sam's outlets. Although the rate of same-store sales growth at Sam's has declined this year, analysts have praised its sophisticated distribution system. They expect it to benefit from the Pace acquisition. The Pace deal will also strengthen Sam's position against the consolidation of Price/Costco - the second- and third-biggest warehouse club chains which agreed to merge this year. Wal-Mart said the Pace clubs would continue to operate under the Pace name until the sale was finalised. The divestiture will help Kmart focus on its core discount-store operations. In October, the company said it might sell 25 per cent stakes in its Sports Authority, Borders, OfficeMax and Builders Square specialty chains through initial public offerings. In August, Kmart confirmed it was seeking bidders for its PayLess drugstores chain. According to US press reports, Kmart has tentatively agreed to sell PayLess for Dollars 1bn to a Los Angeles-based investment firm.</p>

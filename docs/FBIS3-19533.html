			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valerie Devillechabrolle: "Nearly Half of French </F> Work Force Said To Be in Situation of `Economic and Social  Fragility'"]    [Text] Nearly half the French work force today is living  under the threat of exclusion stemming from a "process of social  disqualification." Here are some of the astonishing results,  made public on Thursday 24 February, of the investigation  conducted by the Center for the Study of Income and Costs  (CERC)[.sup]1[/]. For instance, according to the study--which  took as its starting point a 1986 INSEE [National Institute of  Statistics and Economic Studies] investigation of "disadvantaged  conditions"--some 11.7 million people, or 46.9 percent of the 25  million people in the work force between the ages of 18 and 64  are currently, to one degree or another, in a situation of  "economic and social fragility."    Nearly 7 million of them have steady jobs, but as authors of  the study point out, "they are vulnerable by reason of their  income level or their tenuous integration into society." This  marginal population, according to the researchers, is "above all  unprepared to cope with job loss." Another 5 million people are  already occupationally threatened--some finding it difficult to  break into the job market, others simply unemployed. Within the  latter category, 1.8 million people are gradually being pushed  out of the job market, while 1.3 million others--people who have  been out of work for more than 2 years--have dropped out  altogether. Within that group is a yet more disadvantaged  subset: 850,000 of the long-term unemployed are in danger of  being cut off from their last links with society. Finally,  according to authors of the report, "there are an estimated  250,000 persons classifiable as `desocialized'"--in other words,  1 percent of the work force, or 16-20 percent of those covered  by minimum wage protection.    The face of exclusion seems more heterogenous and inconstant  than ever before. People are being dragged down into poverty in  a web of circumstances which the researchers say "can push  marginalized people step by step into the sphere of occupational  inactivity and welfare." For persons coming from strata of  society untouched by poverty, i.e. people who have regular  incomes and a certain amount of social and cultural capital, the  study shows that "problems begin either with difficulties  getting or keeping a job, or with emotional and relationship  problems." Investigators noted among other things that "the more  degraded the individual's employment status, the more difficult  it is, especially for men, to form couples." Indeed, couples  with employment problems run a higher risk of ending up divorced  or separated.  <H5>  Occupationally Threatened </H5>   "The precariousness of their employment status and family  disintegration have a strong effect on income and living  conditions," the investigators say. Indeed, 40 percent of those  who have been unemployed longer than 2 years live in households  where income per person is less than F2,700 per month. "Finally,  their precarious employment status is accompanied by a  significant decline in sociability," especially among males and  persons aged 35-50. In all, "32 percent of the work force can be  considered socially vulnerable." The figure is only 25 percent  for persons with steady employment but 50 percent for those  already jobless for longer than 2 years.    In that context, it can be observed in all the principal  countries of western Europe that "the social welfare machinery,  originally designed to help people cope with persistent  problems, has proven poorly suited to arrest a gradual process  of drift toward social disqualification," the authors say, even  though some Fr180 billion is disbursed each year to 12-13  million people who otherwise would sink into poverty. For 7.5  million of them, income per household member is somewhere  between the minimum wage for a single person (Fr2,300) and the  minimum old age pension for a single person (Fr3,030). Incomes  for the other 5 million range between 1 and 1.3 times the  minimum old age pension. The future success of policies which  were implemented over time in an effort to prevent  exclusion--and which were intended, like the minimum wage, to  bridge the gap between guaranteed minimum incomes and actual  wages--threatens to become "increasingly uncertain."    Indeed, according to authors of the CERC report, everything  will hinge first of all on "the authorities' ability to  articulate a genuine job policy in concertation with business,  labor and management, and all the players involved in vocational  training and occupational insertion." Prevention of exclusion  also demands efforts to reduce academic failure, as well as  "affirmation of fundamental rights" such as access to housing,  medical care, a normal family life, and at least a minimum  amount of personal possessions.

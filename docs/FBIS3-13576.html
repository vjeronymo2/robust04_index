			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, adviser to Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat, today said that the PLO is still committed to the  Middle East peace process but wants a clause added to the Oslo  accords. The new clause would call for the creation of a  security presence [wujud amni] in the occupied territories and  for the separation of Jewish settlers and Palestinians in  sensitive areas.    Meanwhile, the PLO attributed the failure of the talks held  yesterday in Tunisia with Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator on the  peace process, to Israeli reluctance to take effective measures  in Hebron and other areas. According to the PLO, Israel only  took cosmetic measures following last month's massacre in  al-Ibrahimi Mosque.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / 'Lone' Thatcher led arms talks The final stage of a Pounds 1bn arms deal between the UK and Malaysia, alleged to have been won by Britain in return for the promise of aid, was negotiated privately by Baroness Thatcher when she was prime minister. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, and the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher excluded officials from the final meeting on the deal in Kuala Lumpur in September 1988 when a memorandum of understanding between the two countries was signed, according to a businessman closely involved in trade relations between the two countries. 'The officials were asked to leave because it was felt that they were slowing down negotiations,' the businessman said. 'It was a race against time for us (the UK).' The question of whether Lady Thatcher had a role in promising aid to Malaysia in return for the defence sales may be examined by the Commons foreign affairs committee, which is investigating why the UK promised Pounds 234m of aid for Malaysia's Pergau Dam against the advice of Sir Timothy Lankester, then permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration. Mr Peter Shore, the Labour MP who will chair the sessions examining Pergau, said it was possible the committee would want to question Lady Thatcher directly. The committee is also likely to examine allegations which appear in today's Economist magazine that the protocol on the defence package, signed in March 1988 by Lord Younger, then defence secretary, contained a clause that aid would be given equal to a percentage of the value of the defence sales. Any such clause would have breached UK government guidelines. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, disclosed last month that the protocol included a reference to 'aid in support of non-military aspects under this programme' - but he did not mention any formula determining the value of such aid. Lord Younger said last night that he did not remember the protocol containing such an explicit formula. However, in June 1988 he wrote to Malaysia saying that aid could not be linked to defence sales. The Economist says that soon after Lord Younger's letter was sent, the Foreign Office wrote to Malaysia reiterating that aid would nevertheless be provided, though no mention was made of the defence sales. The Foreign Office yesterday said that the donation of aid to Malaysia in the late 1980s was 'strictly within the law'. Lady Thatcher was unavailable for comment.</p>

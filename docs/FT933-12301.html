			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Software that shifts the furniture - Daniel Green enjoys the multimedia revolution / Computing I REBUILT my flat at the weekend. Everything from doors and walls to kitchen fittings and furniture. It took about an hour and looked very pretty. Then I walked around it, stepping easily through solid partitions like Hamlet's father at Elsinore. I moved doors and chairs willy nilly and began to dream of a career as an interior designer. But I lost patience with my creation, put up a few pictures and demolished a load-bearing beam. Then I walked through some more walls just for fun. Was I on some press junket to the West Coast to play with the latest in virtual reality gadgetry? No. I was using an architectural package called Virtus Walkthrough on an ordinary Apple Macintosh desk-top computer. Virtus Walkthrough is one of those delightful computer products anyone can use within a few minutes. It is aimed at professional architects and interior designers and is intended to give them and their clients an idea of what it would be like to live and work inside their designs. It works simply. As you prepare a two-dimensional floor plan or elevation on the left side of the screen, the computer automatically creates a three-dimensional version on the right side. In the middle of the right side is a cross. Put your cursor above the cross, click and you slide forward in the three-dimensional world. Put the cursor to the left or right of the cross and the view swivels around you. When you have finished your work you can record a whole sequence of zooms, through doors and walls, up ladders and down stairs to give a client an occupant's eye view. Virtus Walkthrough is neat, but its significance is broader. It is part of a new generation of programs that take desktop computers beyond the realms of accounts packages and spreadsheets into a world where video-game technology becomes a business tool. This new type of software has a new name: multimedia. Like much jargon, the definition of multimedia is vague. In principle it means using pictures, and maybe sound, as well as words and numbers. There are two families of multimedia program: authoring packages, in which architects, marketing executives, advertisement directors and a host of others can prepare sales presentations and brochures, edit videotape, create animations and prepare colour advertisements. reference, in which huge numbers of words, pictures and sounds are stored on a compact disc whence they can be retrieved in seconds. Examples are encyclopaedias, do-it-yourself manuals and music appreciation lessons in which you can play digitally-recorded sounds from any of hundreds of solo instruments, orchestras and pop groups while reading about them and looking at colour illustrations. At their best, multimedia programs are both powerful and a pleasure to use. The catch is you may have to change your computer to make the best use of them. The authoring packages are most comfortable in the world of Apple's Macintosh. Apple has for a decade concentrated on pictures and sound while IBM and its clones got on with number crunching. As a result, Mac owners are often deprived of the latest version of a word processor or spreadsheet for months after the PC version is launched. On the other hand, Virtus Walkthrough has been available for the Mac for three years but was launched for Windows only this spring. Mac users also get first bite at Photoshop, a powerful picture retouching package that allows you to eliminate wrinkles and whiten teeth without going near Harley Street. They are often first in line for video editors, desktop publishers and 'rendering' packages that can create pictures of photographic realism. But while Apples may have the edge for those wanting to be original, Windows PCs may give you more choice of compact disc software. The reason is simple: although you can buy both Apple and Windows computers with built-in CD players, there are many more Windows computers than Macintoshes. The cost of a CD falls quickly as production rises, so software companies have concentrated on the Windows. It is early days for both kinds of multimedia program. Only now are Macintoshes powerful enough to manipulate pictures quickly. CD computers are still unusual and less than 100 CD-based packages are on the market. But the pace is quickening. The next generation of even faster Macs is planned. Software houses are joining with book publishers to find products for CD-based computers.

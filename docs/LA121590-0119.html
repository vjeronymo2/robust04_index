			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> ADAMS, HELD TO 20 POINTS, SPARKS GRANITE HILLS PAST HER EX-TEAMMATES  </P> <P> Granite Hills' Christina Adams was held to 20 points in her first meeting  against her former Grossmont High teammates, but her 13 second-half points  rallied Granite Hills to a 55-45 victory Friday night.  </P> <P> Adams, a senior guard who had averaged 38.3 points a game and had broken the  state basketball single-season scoring record while at Grossmont, was held to  only seven points in the first half.  </P> <P> "Christina said she didn't feel pressured, but I know she felt it," Granite  Hills Coach Len Klingshirn said. "It was a big thing for her to do well against  them. There was more pressure than she let on."  </P> <P> Adams transferred to Granite Hills after Frank Foggiano was fired as coach of  the girls' and boys' teams last season. The Foothillers made it to the Division  II quarterfinals under Foggiano's direction last season.  </P> <P> Grossmont led, 10-5, after the first quarter, but Adams warmed considerably in  the second quarter, scoring seven points and hitting a three-pointer to give  the Mighty Eagles a two-point lead with four minutes left in the half. Adams  had three three-pointers on the night.  </P> <P> Granite Hills, ranked seventh in the county, countered the Foothillers'  third-quarter surges with shooting by Sallie Wade, who scored nine second-half  points and finished with 13, and Brande Wray, who had 10 points.  </P> <P> "We have a lot of talent on the team," Klingshirn said. "If we balance the  scoring, it will relieve some of the pressure on Christina. We have capable  scorers out there. It's still early. We just haven't jelled yet."  </P> <P> Grossmont and Granite Hills exchanged three-pointers early in the third period,  but a 12-4 run gave the Mighty Eagles a 39-31 lead.  </P> <P> Point guard Susie McManos scored 15 and Lori Redondo had 11 for the  Foothillers. TERRY RATHER  </P></p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Fierce artillery attack on Dubrovnik THE United Nations is expected to vote for stiff sanctions against Serbia today in the wake of fierce attacks yesterday on the historic Croatian port of Dubrovnik and the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. Defying growing international anger, the Serb-dominated Yugoslav federal army launched a ferocious artillery assault on Dubrovnik. Sarajevo meanwhile suffered its worst bombardment in nearly three months as Serb irregulars, backed by the army, tightened their grip on the city. Witnesses said sirens wailed as the attack on Dubrovnik began and residents ran to basement shelters for cover. Smoke rose over the old city and from the Hotel Argentina, outside the walls of the medieval centre. One rocket hit St John's Tower, part of the city's walls. 'There is one hell of a battle going on, apparently to get our airport,' said Ms Ruth Ewins, a British woman living in Dubrovnik. Other witnesses said mortars struck the centre of the medieval walled city, damaging part of the 14th-century Dominican monastery and the baroque cathedral. The attack came two days after army units withdrew from the surrounding hills and as Croatian forces were within a few miles of regaining control over the Adriatic coastline. The motive for the attack was unclear, but one European diplomat said the assault was made by army units 'out of spite' for being forced to withdraw from Dubrovnik's hinterland. In Sarajevo, Serb militia continued to exchange fire with Moslem and Croat forces after the army pounded the city with multiple-rocket launchers in the early hours. Mr Boro Kontic, a Bosnian journalist contacted by telephone, said shelling 'was the worst kind ever', adding that the army and Serb irregulars were still preventing food, water and medicine reaching the besieged city. Ms Nada Mladena, a Serb paediatrician, told an independent Belgrade radio station that Serb extremists had attacked a children's clinic and a Serbian orthodox church in Tuzla, north-east of Sarajevo. In New York, diplomats said private consultations would continue this morning and were expected to be followed by a vote on sweeping sanctions, including an oil embargo, on Serbia and its ally, Montenegro. Diplomats thought that China and Zimbabwe might abstain on the vote in the 15-member Security Council. But Russia and India might go along with the sanctions, being pressed hard by the US. The proposed sanctions are nearly as comprehensive as those imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait, such as a ban on all trade, except for food and medicine, as well as the cutting of air links and sports exchanges. The resolution also calls for a freeze on Serbian and Montenegrin financial assets abroad. However, diplomats said that the US would drop a proposal to expel Serbia and Montenegro from the UN. Serb leaders were defiant and Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnian Serbs, said in Belgrade that any sanctions against Serbia would be 'dishonourable, unjust and counter-productive'. The European Football Union gave Yugoslavia the go-ahead to play in next month's European soccer championship finals in Sweden. But it will review its decision if the UN imposes a sporting boycott on Serbia. Aid sought for refugees, Page 2</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain 1st Rank Yu. Koshelev under rubric </F> "Discussion Rostrum": "Organization of Combat Training (Problems  of Improving Its Effectiveness)"]    [Text] It is common knowledge that combat training is  conducted on ships to train their crews to perform combat  missions and keep ships in constant combat readiness, and it is  the most important and determining thing in the life and  activity of naval formations and units. But today, when the  number of ships performing missions on long deployments has  dropped considerably, the opinion has appeared that preventing a  reduction in the personnel's level of training and in  cohesiveness and combat readiness of ship crews and staffs has  become the primary combat training mission.&lt;sup&gt; 1&lt;/sup&gt;  Such an  approach to determining combat training goals appears too  oversimplified to me. We know that the level of preparedness of  any ship crew inevitably has inherent ups and downs, and there  are many reasons for this: The commander was replaced, some of  the personnel were discharged to the reserve, there was a  significant interruption in operation because of repairs or a  difficult ice situation, and so on. Consequently, it is more  proper to consider the primary combat training mission to be to  ensure a level of preparedness corresponding to the assigned  combat readiness of the ship, unit or formation.    Is it possible to perform this primary mission effectively  today with the increasing understrength in personnel and the  considerable scarcity of fuel, spare parts and other supplies?  We will attempt to analyze the state of affairs in terms of  certain fundamental requirements placed on the organization of  combat training.    First of all, high effectiveness of combat training is  possible only when its organization is scientifically  substantiated. The question arises: Why have there been no  practical results to this day from work done by military  academies and institutes on such a pressing problem? Finally,  where is it possible to turn for training aids and theoretical  recommendations for improving the effectiveness of combat  training?    New officers coming onto the Navy Combat Training staff and  into local entities for directing combat training learn from  their predecessors and, along with positive experience, also  adopt their shortcomings. Neither military schools nor the Naval  Academy train specialists along that line. This is difficult to  do independently because of an absence of sufficiently developed  methods aids. And the main normative document, the "Rukovodstvo  po boyevoy podgotovke VMF" [Navy Combat Training Manual],  developed in the early 1980's, declares only certain basic  provisions and clearly is out of date.    The very organization of the combat training process has  stagnated and progress in improving it is very slight. Formation  base exercises probably are the only innovation in recent years.  Accounts and reports going to the Combat Training staff often  remain ungeneralized as they return to the fleet in  recommendations; moreover, they are not even reviewed. Then why  are our accounts required?    In 1988, who scientifically substantiated the need for  setting up staffs of main specialists in combat training  directorates and helped in their very difficult formation only  to have this same staff planned for elimination five years  later? As a result, dozens of first-rate officers, organizers of  specialized training in the fleets, will be out of a job...    For what reasons was the network of fleet training  detachments resubordinated to the combat training directorate if  other directorates will handle specialized training of navymen  when the staff of main specialists is eliminated? The fact is we  now do not even have such specialists as communicators, chemical  warfare personnel, motor transport personnel, and so on who must  organize basic military training.    For example, who proved theoretically that a submarine needs  20-30 days to rehearse and pass a ship-type training task? Why  not 10-40? But if this is substantiated, then how is one to  explain the absence of new standards in connection with  transition to a two-year term of service for draftees, the high  personnel turnover caused by this, deterioration of their  overall preparedness, problems in manning crews, the freeze on  development of training facilities and so on?    Of course, it is impossible to have rules for all instances  in life, but fundamental, scientifically substantiated  recommendations determining the organization of the system of  personnel training measures in the fleets must be worked out  regularly.    Secondly, combat training effectiveness is achieved by high  quality of planning, i.e., by compiling realistic, materially  substantiated plans that are coordinated with plans for ship  repairs and trials and with capabilities of assets for  supporting combat training.    To be sure, planning quality depends directly on the  professional training, industriousness and initiative of staff  officers of formations, large strategic formations and  directorates. Nevertheless, it seems to us the reality of our  plans is far from perfect often for entirely other reasons.  Thus, annual plans for training command and control entities and  fleet forces for each new training year are draw up and approved  during October-November of the preceding year, but the actual  plan of execution for ship repair goes to the fleet only during  March-April, the practice missile ordnance limit during  February-March, the plan for trials during January-February, and  documents changing the fleet table of organization structure  throughout the year. All this forces the leadership to regularly  adjust already approved combat training plans, usually in the  direction of their reduction, which dampens the ardor of staffs  and crews and allows insufficiently responsible commanders to  fulfill them incompletely or not on time. For example, 125  activities for the record (over 15 percent of the plan) were  excluded from the Pacific fleet combat training plan or  postponed to later dates in the winter period of the current  training year. The entire training system suffers from this. If  there is no thoughtfulness and constancy in it, there also will  be no good results.    We see a solution only in comprehensive planning of all  fleet  activity, but this does not appear possible at the present time  above all because of unstable financing, uneven deliveries of  fuel and other supplies, and problems connected with the call-up  of young replacements.    Thirdly, effectiveness of combat training is achieved  because  of constant monitoring of its course and of the quality with  which missions are rehearsed and because of commanders' firm  knowledge of methodologies determining the conduct of combat  training measures. In my view, this thesis requires no special  commentary. Everything depends only on ourselves, on personal  organizational work of commanders in chief, commanders and staff  officers at all levels. Behind each combat training violation  stands a specific person and he must bear personal  responsibility for this. But now as a rule responsibility is  placed only on combat training directorate officers for  omissions in combat training. And what is the level of  leadership in combat training of the subordinates, for example,  of the commander of a Pacific Fleet ship formation if neither he  nor his deputies put to sea a single time in the winter training  period? It turns out that directing the housekeeping activity of  subordinates and organization of their everyday routine and so  on is more in view than performance of combat training missions,  which means that defining it as the principal form of fleet  activity in peacetime is only a declaration.    Fourthly, effectiveness of combat training measures depends  on availability of modern means of supporting them and proper  use of what is available. This too is a sore subject. We now  lack not only modern guided surface and airborne (high-speed,  small-size, low-flying) targets, but even a sufficient number of  the old ones. The shortage of funds keeps us not only from  producing new ones, but also from repairing damaged targets. To  a certain extent it is possible to find a solution to the  situation (and we are finding one) in additionally equipping  written-off craft and vessels as naval targets, which is  considerably cheaper than building new ones. But special  financing is not provided even for these purposes, and using  what are even at that miserly funds intended for ship repair  hardly is advisable.    Seventy percent of missile firings in the fleet were carried  out against simulated targets in the winter training period,  which inevitably leads to a drop in the training level of the  fleet's ship crews and shore-based missile units. This problem  cannot be resolved without special financing, otherwise it will  be necessary to change criteria of personnel preparedness.    Fifthly, combat training effectiveness cannot be raised  without high quality of base training and full-fledged use of  training facilities.    In the last two years this matter has been given very  careful  attention both on the Navy Combat Training staff and in fleet  directorates. Conduct of formation base exercises has become a  system; they allow preparing ships and staffs for comprehensive  performance of missions at sea and rehearsing interworking with  ship, air and shore-based formations and units without expending  materiel at authorized control stations, battle stations, and  simulators.    Positive examples of the effectiveness of formation base  exercises are cited by Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Navy and  Chief of Navy Combat Training Directorate Vice Admiral A. V.  Gorbunov in the article "And Still We Go To Sea."&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  And if at times the return from exercises is not up to  expectations, evidently this is above all the direct fault of  the corresponding commander and staff. There are conditions for  conducting formation base exercises in all formations; it is  only a matter of the organizing abilities and personal  preparedness of formation commanders.    To improve the methodology and quality of formation base  exercises, at the beginning of each winter and summer training  period they are planned and conducted as demonstration exercises  under the direction of commanders in chief of large strategic  formations ("teachers also have to be taught"). But base  training is not only and not so much formation base exercises;  it is the training of each individual specialist, battle  station, combat team and crew as a whole. It is impossible to  organize it qualitatively without a modern training facility.  Again the question rests on financing. Construction of a network  of fleet training centers essentially has been frozen:  Insignificant funds are allocated only for creating or  renovating individual simulators. At the same time even the  existing training facility is not being used effectively enough.  It is difficult to change commanders' psychology with respect to  full-fledged base training, which is the only thing capable of  even partially compensating for the constant reduction in  training of personnel at sea (although everyone understands that  no base training will fully replace practice at sea). There are  objective difficulties in organizing base training itself: The  low personnel strength level of crews and the related need for  constantly using them for fatigue duties, numerous details,  searches for deserters and so on to the detriment of training;  the lowered overall training level of draftees in connection  with adoption of laws halting the call-up of students for  military service; transition to a two-year term of service; and  the unsatisfactory state of health of young replacements (every  third draftee of the last levy is underweight, every fifth one  is unfit for service afloat and so on). All these problems  evidently can be solved by a transition to contract service, but  for now this system of training has not been properly worked  out, and generally this is a separate discussion.    Sixthly and finally, combat training effectiveness depends  on  keeping weapons and technical equipment of ships in exemplary  condition and on their timely, quality servicing and  maintenance. This probably is the most difficult problem for the  fleet. Financing of ship repairs is constantly being reduced.  There is a growing number of ships whose operation is hampered  and at the same time there is an increased likelihood of  equipment breakdowns because of the expiration of time periods  between repairs and between drydockings. There is also a growing  number of ships being removed from the fleet order of battle  exclusively because of the absence of funds for ship repair or  modernization. The destruction of economic ties with many  enterprises manufacturing arms and equipment which ended up in  "nearby foreign countries" led to a restriction on or cessation  of warranty servicing and repair of equipment and deliveries of  spare parts, instruments and accessories. On the other hand, the  drop in the personnel's level of specialized training leads to a  growth in equipment breakdowns, which in turn leads to the need  for additional repair expenditures.    As a result, the reduction in the number of combat-ready  ships and in their sorties to sea has a negative influence on  morale in collectives: Discipline drops and criminal activities  grow.    Summing up what has been said, it is possible to dwell on  two  main, although possibly not indisputable, conclusions:    1. The level of preparedness of a significant number of ship  crews to perform missions in accordance with their immediate  purpose is steadily dropping. We can only slow this process by  various organizational measures and by toughening demands and  increasing responsibility at all levels, but the Navy is  incapable of stopping it on its own.    2. Personnel proficiency will not correspond even to  necessary combat training of fleet forces without capital  investments in the creation of new naval assets and in the  development of a system of basing, ship repair, training  facilities and means of supporting combat training. But  changing, simplifying or reducing preparedness criteria only  creates an appearance of sufficiency of combat readiness, and it  will be necessary to expend enormously more funds subsequently  for its actual restoration as a result of this.    From the editors: We invite officers to take part in  the discussion and express their opinion on the components of  combat training examined by the author.  Footnotes    1.

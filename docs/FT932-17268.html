			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Banks to acquire Norsk Data NORSK DATA, the troubled Norwegian computer service group, is to be acquired by Den norske Bank and Fokus Bank, the group's two biggest financial creditors, under a compromise proposal to rescue the group from bankruptcy. Unsecured creditors have been offered a cash dividend payment of 25 per cent of what they are owed. Norsk Data reported a fall in 1992 pre-tax losses to NKr382.4m (Dollars 55.5m) from NKr849m in 1991 and charged 1992 accounts with extraordinary expenses of NKr287.3m against a restructuring charge of NKr655m in 1991. The group said DnB and Fokus, two of Norway's top three banks, had agreed to refinance outstanding debt, estimated at NKr600m. They have demanded that Norsk Data's share capital be written down to zero, and that a share issue be undertaken by partly converting the banks' debt to equity. DnB holds about two-thirds of the group's debt. Norsk Data's directors back the proposal, providing it does not entail differentiation of treatment of existing shareholders, and will formally recommend acceptance at the annual general meeting, probably in May or June.</p>

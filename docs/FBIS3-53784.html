			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special report" by Ayesba Haroon] </F>   [Text] The seizure rate of heroin, opium and charas by the  12 Federal and provincial law-enforcing agencies, till June  1993, shows a sharp decline as compared to the corresponding  period in 1992.    Lack of political will showed itself in poor allocations of  finances to these agencies and a legal cover riddled with [word  indistinct] and loopholes that gape so wide that entire  battalions of offenders slip through them. A glaring legal  omission being the jurisdiction of speedy law court does not  cover FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas] -- hot spots  for drug production and trafficking.    The accumulative effect of the lopsided political will and a  Swiss cheese legal set-up reflects in poor follow-up of  registered cases, lower seizures, and a social climate that  offers no resistance to narco money. Given the fact that around  two-thirds of the heroin produced in Pakistan is consumed within  the country and that the number of drug addicts is on the rise,  reduced seizures do not mean that production or trafficking of  narcotics has been curtailed -- as some members of the Narcotics  Control Division would have the public believe.    From 2,900 kilograms (kg) of heroin seized in 1992, the  figure has fallen to 2,179 kgs in 1993. And when compared to  5,677 kgs of heroin seized in 1991, the quantity seized has more  than halved. Number of cases registered have also fallen  sharply -- from 23,494 in 1992 to a mere 10,296 in 1993.  Quantity of opium seized has also fallen by around 1000 kg. In  1992, 3,422 kgs of opium were seized, but the figure slid down  to 2,421 kgs in 1993, and from 2,850 cases registered the number  was reduced to 1,448 in 1993.    In the case of the charas, the quantity seized reduced from  188,123 kgs in 1992 to 138,097 kgs in 1993. While the number of  cases registered in 1993 were 9,618 as compared to the 20,847  cases registered in 1993.    Successive governments tried to prove their commitment  towards eradicating the drug menace by making all sorts of  speeches. However, no-one worked to develop an effective legal  framework to effectively check this menace. The caretaker  government of Moin Qureshi, promulgated an Ordinance, whereby  the death penalty would be awarded to the drug offenders:  namely the Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Ordinance, 1993 whereby  the assets of an accused awarded punishment lesser than life  imprisonment are also liable to forfeiture.    The law against narcotics offences relating to trafficking  provided for maximum punishment of life imprisonment. The  government has decided to amend the law in order to award death  sentence for the drug traffickers or financing the trafficking  of narcotics or offences relating to import or export of drugs  from Pakistan and inter-provinces.    Narcotics offences are mainly dealt with under the following  laws: The Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930; The Prohibition  (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979; The Customs Act, 1969; The  Code of Criminal Procedure, 1989 (Act V of 1898); The Police  Act, 1861; The Opium Act, 1957; The Opium Act, 1878; and The  Anti-Narcotics Task Force Ordinance (XII of 1993).    There are 14 [as published] agencies on Federal and  provincial level that are involved in the enforcement of the  above-mentioned laws. Apart from the provincial police  departments, provincial Excise Departments and the Frontier  Constabulary of NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] all other  law-enforcing agencies come under the ambit of the Federal  Government. The services of the defence forces can also be  utilised for the purposes whenever the Federal Government  decides.    Given the fact that there is such a large number of varied  agencies involved and seven different laws to deal with  narcotics offences. It is not a wonder that a complete  confusion prevails. An offence registered under the Hadd cannot  be punishable by death penalty and an injunction of the speedy  courts is not applicable to the federally and provincially  administered tribal areas; while different laws apply to the  carrier and to the offender who finances the trafficking.    Lack of efficient coordination between the various  government  agencies involved, the [word indistinct] inherent in partial  application of the laws, coupled with the fact that money and  political pressure can delay/change/erase the cases is used by  the offenders to their maximum advantage. Also the Narcotics  Control Board cannot spend the kind of money the offenders use  while fighting legal cases against them. In one case, while the  Ministry used around Rs [rupees] 3 lakh, the offenders spent a  hefty Rs 33 lakh -- and went scot-free.    Not only are the agencies short of manpower but the  personnel  is also not provided with adequate personal security to deal  with dangerous offenders. While the agencies are unable to  coordinate their actions, the drug barons are equipped with the  advanced electronic gadgets for surfeiting the movement of the  agencies.    The law-enforcing agencies have failed to control the  smuggling of acetic anhydride, the chemical used in making  heroin. Previously, it was imported in abnormal quantity but  after its import was restricted, it started being smuggled in  from India. Recently a group of Rangers was booked for  smuggling the chemical from India.    In a bid to give a modicum of sanity to the to the mess, the  President and the Prime Minister [PM] have asked for  recommendations to formulate a national drug policy which  contains a comprehensive legal package. It is stated to be a  long-term policy. The PM's camp wants to make it a consensus  legislation which would fetch them points both at home and  abroad.    To restrict the inflow of drugs in their country the United  States of America made clear its dissatisfaction regarding the  performance of the local anti-narcotics agencies a few years  back and announced the funding of a special tasks force. The  Ordinance for the force was repeatedly promulgated and a number  of officers from the services other than those involved in drug  combat were selected, but the force could not take off.    However, according to sources, the Americans reduced their  funding and in the second half of last year, the Army was asked  to take over the proposed organisation. A serving general is  now heading the force, which is still to commence active  operations. Unless anti-drug operations are supported by the  political will of the rulers, not much headway can be expected  in combating this menace. There needs to be social uprising  against the narco barons and their influence in political,  bureaucratic and professional bodies must be exposed. Otherwise  we will enter the 21st century drugged out of our senses.</p>

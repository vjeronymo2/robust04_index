			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The sound of cheap CDs As the UK's national heritage select committee begins hearings today on the high price of compact discs, one Hong Kong-based company continues to sell CDs at less than half the price of the large groups while claiming to be twice as profitable. Naxos, an independent classical label, says it sold 5m CDs worldwide last year for about Pounds 4.99 each. Although there is a wide range of prices in the UK, CDs featuring well-known performers can sell for nearly three times the Naxos price. Klaus Heymann, Naxos's founder and owner, says the secret of cheaper CDs does not lie in reducing manufacturing costs. Although the company has its headquarters in Hong Kong, it manufactures in Germany, Japan and the US. Heymann says to reduce costs by manufacturing in lower-wage countries would hurt Naxos's sales in Asia. 'The south-east Asian market will only buy CDs made in places like Japan and Europe - preferably Germany,' he says. It costs 80p to manufacture a CD, even in Japan and Germany. As the large music companies never tire of pointing out, manufacturing is a small part of the cost of producing a CD. Heymann says he has some advantages over large companies when it comes to manufacturing. The company owns no factories. It contracts out all its manufacturing. Its repertoire is classical rather than popular, so that demand is more predictable. But Heymann says he makes savings elsewhere. He does not use well-known performers such as Luciano Pavarotti and Herbert von Karajan. Instead he searches for artists who are keen to reach a wider public. Naxos orchestras include the UK's Northern Chamber Orchestra and the Budapest Symphony. Naxos performers are paid a flat fee rather than royalties. Naxos, unlike the large record companies, does not produce more than one version of any particular piece of music. With staff of only eight people in Hong Kong, Heymann estimates his overhead costs are 5p for each CD sold, compared, he says, with more than Pounds 1 for the large companies. He sells his CDs to distributors around the world for Pounds 1.70 each. They sell them to retailers for an average of Pounds 2.78. Heymann says that his net profit margin on sales of Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.2m) last year was 25-30 per cent. Given public demand for well-known names and orchestras, many of Naxos's cost-savings could not be replicated by the large companies. But Heymann believes the big producers could still cut costs if they were less profligate. Naxos has no champagne signing ceremonies, he says. 'I'm not critical of the majors because of their prices,' he says. 'With the way they operate, they need those prices. I'm critical of the way they operate. Paying an artist a Pounds 50,000 advance for a recording that will sell 10,000 copies is crazy.'</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Schools' opt-out rate is low THE GOVERNMENT'S campaign to persuade schools in England and Wales to opt out of local authority supervision has so far made little impact, with only 50 schools planning to ballot on opting-out in the coming month. Local education authorities are responsible for more than 21,000 schools in England. Only 277 have opted out so far. That number rises to 440 if all schools at some point in the opting-out process are included. Mr John Patten, education secretary, is targeting secondary schools as the most likely candidates for grant-maintained status, under which schools receive a lump sum - often larger than that available from their local education authority - determined by the Education Department and are free to spend it largely as they want. His statement last week that financial advantages for grant-maintained schools would continue was a deliberate attempt to increase the opt-out rate. But the education white paper, published in July, appeared to signal an end to the incentives, except for schools in low-spending authorities, and tight public spending will be a serious constraint.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of  the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC), arrived here today on a  five-day official goodwill visit to Belgium.    In a written speech delivered at Brussels airport, Li said  China and Belgium stand on the two ends of the Asian and  European Continents and are far off geographically, but Belgium  is not unfamiliar to the Chinese people.    He said the Chinese people admire the Belgians for the  achievements scored in the long-term cause of developing their  national economy and building their country.    Li recalled the cooperative relationship between China and  Belgium, saying the Sino-Belgian ties have well developed since  the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1971.    There have been many exchanges of high-level visits between  the two sides and the bilateral trade volume has increased  dozens of times, said the Chinese leader.    He noted that there is a new momentum for the two countries  to promote their cooperation in all fields thanks to the efforts  of both sides over the past few years.    So long as China and Belgium observe the principle of  seeking  common ground while reserving differences, and of mutual respect  for each other, non-interference in each other's internal  affairs and mutual benefit, Li said, the mutually beneficial  relationship of cooperation between the two countries can be  developed steadily.    This will not only serve the interests of the Chinese and  Belgian people, but also world peace, stability and development,  added the Chinese leader.    Li will hold extensive talks with Belgian leaders on  bilateral relations and international issues of common concern.    He expressed hope that his visit, which came at the  invitation of the presidents of the Belgian Senate and Chamber  of Representatives, will further enhance the understanding  between the two peoples, thus pushing forward the Sino-Belgian  friendly cooperative relationship in future.    Li is on a five-nation European tour which has already taken  him to Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.</p>

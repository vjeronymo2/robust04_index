The decision emerged at a meeting of related cabinet  ministers held at prime minister Morihiro hosokawa's official  residence.    The top government spokesman quoted the premier as telling  the meeting that it is natural for Japan to take necessary  market- opening steps on its own volition, regardless of its  trade negotiations with the United States.    Takemura told a news conference the planned government  package will not only cover four areas pinpointed earlier but  will also include other necessary measures to further open  Japan's markets.    The government said last week it will map out a program to  speed up deregulation, strengthen import and investment  promotion steps, revamp competition policy and improve  government procurement processes.    Friday's meeting brought together Hosokawa, Takemura and  chiefs of the foreign, finance, trade, posts, health and  transport ministries, as well as those of the Economic Planning  Agency and of the Management and Coordination Agency.    The schedule of the next such cabinet meeting is not yet  fixed, Takemura said.    The cabinet meeting came as the U.S. is increasing pressure  on Japan to slash its huge trade surplus following the collapse  of bilateral trade talks.    On February 11, Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton  failed to strike a deal on ways to cut Japan's trade surplus  with the U.S. Tokyo spurned a demand from Washington to set  numerical targets to gauge the openness of its markets to  imports.    Asked if Japan will maintain its position of refusing  numerical targets in working out a fresh market-opening package,  Takemura said, "of course, that's our basic stance."    He said no ministers referred in their meeting to an idea of  setting nonbinding targets for measuring progress in opening  Japan's markets.    Takemura also said they did not discuss a proposed dispatch  of a special envoy to the U.S. to break the deadlock over trade.</p>

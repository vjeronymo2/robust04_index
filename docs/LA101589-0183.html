			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRAUDULENT TITLE TRANSFERS A SNAP IN STATE;  </P> <P> LAW: IN CALIFORNIA, PROPERTY CAN BE TRANSFERRED WITH AN OWNER'S SIGNATURE ON A  GRANT DEED AND A NOTARY SEAL. THE COUNTY RECORDER'S OFFICE IS NOT REQUIRED TO  VERIFY THE REAL ESTATE DOCUMENTS IT REGISTERS.  </P> <P> Authorities express frustration at the difficulty in catching unscrupulous real  estate operators.  </P> <P> Unlike many other parts of the country, the law and real estate practices in  California make it very easy to fraudulently transfer title of property.  </P> <P> The transfer of property can be achieved with nothing more than an owner's  signature on a grant deed and a notary seal. The county recorder's office is  not required to make any effort to verify the real estate documents it  registers.  </P> <P> Once the document is recorded, it automatically becomes part of the official  title chain, and the new owner -- legitimate or not -- can take out loans or  even sell the property.  </P> <P> "It's easy to do and a relatively large amount of money is involved," said  Sheriff's Detective Tom Hart. "The risks are minimal (to unscrupulous  operators) and the rewards are great."  </P> <P> When fraud is carried out, it is often buried in a long string of paper work.  Investigating such paper trails requires real estate expertise that law  enforcement agencies complain they do not have.  </P> <P> And in places where there is expertise, such as the state Department of Real  Estate, there are no criminal investigators. Pending legislation, however,  would give real estate regulators search warrant powers they currently do not  have, thus strengthening their ability to build cases against lawbreakers.  </P> <P> Officials also point to laxity in the regulation of the notary public business.  In several court cases involving real estate fraud, serious questions have  arisen about the legitimacy of some notary seals. The signatures of homeowners  known to be in convalescent homes or hospitals have in some cases appeared as  notarized authorizations to sell property, according to lawsuits.  </P> <P> Currently, the state employs only three investigators for notaries public.  There are about 150,000 licensed notaries public in the state.  </P> <P> Prosecutors say there is often confusion about whether the abuses committed  fall under criminal or civil jurisdiction. The statute of limitations is  relatively short -- three years for forgery and two for fraud -- and has often  gotten dangerously close to expiring by the time the victim realizes his home  is no longer in his name.  </P> <P> Further, prosecutors and investigators say they often need multiple victims  before a clear pattern can be established sufficient to incriminate those  responsible.  </P> <P> There are laws on the books that would prevent some of the abuse, such as the  Home Equity Sales Contract Act and the Mortgage Foreclosure Consultant Act,  both of which lay down rules for how contracts should be written and how sales  of foreclosure property should be conducted. But many people find ways around  the laws or ignore some of the requirements, public-interest attorneys say.  </P> <P> Besides, experts in real estate say, there is little regulation that can stop  frauds that work because of the gullibility, desperation or ignorance of  homeowners.  </P> <P> "Basically, you're trying to protect people from themselves," said James N.  Laichas, senior vice president of Ticor Title Insurance.  </P> <P> Sometimes, equity schemes straddle a narrow line between what is legal and what  is not, what constitutes questionable business ethics and what constitutes a  crime. For example, lenders are not legally required to verify the  credit-worthiness of someone taking out a home equity loan, but many of the  loans carry terms or payments that are far beyond what the borrower can meet,  and he is certain to default.  </P> <P> "When there is forgery, it is clearly a crime," said Compton Deputy City Atty.  Wilmont Odom. "The problem is those who dance on the edge of the law."  </P> <P> Whether they can be prosecuted or not, questionable property transfers  increasingly are ending up in court.  </P> <P> Paul E. Lee, director of litigation for the Legal Aid Foundation of Los  Angeles, has represented several defendants in alleged equity fraud cases. "At  any one time, we have 30 to 40 cases in court," he said, "and a new one comes  in virtually every day."  </P></p>

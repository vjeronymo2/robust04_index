			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Borisav Djuric] </F>   [Text] After a fragile lull of several days, the Muslims  have continued their attacks on the Srbobran [Donji Vakuf]  front. Members of the 7th Corps of the Muslim army early this  morning carried out a fierce artillery-infantry attack on the  Koscani plateau. The fighters of the Army of the Serbian  Republic were ready for this attack. After fierce fighting, the  Muslims were repelled, suffering major losses in manpower. On  the Serbian side, several fighters were wounded slightly. NATO  aircraft were again the allies of the Muslims, flying low over  the combat area.    It was quieter on other parts of the Srbobran front. In  fact, this is only a brief lull before a new advance by Islamic  fundamentalists. It is completely clear that the Muslim  offensive, which started exactly seven days ago, will continue.  Although the enemy suffered a large number of casualties in the  first part of this offensive, the 7th Corps is persistently  trying to take hold of Serbian territories, even if it means  over the dead bodies of its soldiers.    Although an air raid alarm has been sounded, the enemy  artillery in Bugojno has not been pounding Srbobran today.</p>

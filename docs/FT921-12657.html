			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Letter: Missing the mark by trying for too many targets on the civilised life of Quebec City Sir, Daniel Green's travel article on Quebec City, 'On the very edge of civilisation' (January 18), misses the mark by trying for too many targets. If, as Green asserts, Quebec City is at the very edge of civilisation, he fails to assess for us the civilised aspect - the gastronomie, theatre, music and nightlife of this urban centre which has survived and flourished for more than 350 years in the midst of anglophone North America. As for the nearby hinterland, Green seems to view it by reference to the US. He speaks of 'New England-style' houses, but certainly the older houses have a design indigenous to Quebec. He speaks of the south shore of the St Lawrence River as 'the American shore', part of a 'civilised, settled, comfortable continent' (sic) and implies that this is because 'the US is a few miles away'. The northern US border as a centre of civilisation? It would come as a great surprise to most observers that northern Maine is civilised, at least by comparison with either Quebec City or with other parts of the north-eastern US. And as for the furthest hinterland, Green missed his train by eight hours for which he surmises his good fortune - au contraire, we may think it is ours] In an article replete with non sequiturs, perhaps the most curious is Green's surprise that his hostess at Auberge Mange Grenouille has a personality 'both French and American', surely a penetrating glimpse into the obvious.

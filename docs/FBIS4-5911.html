			<p>BFN     [Text] Various statistical information, which had been  under exclusive control of the government, will now be released  to the public through the National Statistical Office (NSO).    On the supply list will be 440,000 statistics regarding  about  500 areas, including income, health, industry, labor, money,  foreign exchange rates, inflation, economic growth and  international statistics, NSO officials said yesterday.    The only exceptions from the free release will be such  statistical figures that may infringe on individuals' privacy or  private businesses' trade secrets, they said.    To gain access to the official statistics, one has to have a  personal computer and subscribe to related computer network  systems run by private information suppliers, the officials said.    For instance, Korea Securities Computer Corp. has already  been providing stock market information through its Stocknet  network from March and Dacom plans to supply a statistical  service through its Chollian network from June.    Other than the computer network services, the statistics can  be sold in the form of diskettes and magnetic tapes at the  request of individuals and corporations with certain fees for  using computers.    The NSO will also operate an ARS (audio response system) in  the fourth quarter of this year, by which time it will provide  ready answers on 1,000 basic statistics with only one phone call.</p>

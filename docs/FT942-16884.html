			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (12): More than just a place to sleep - Property A US company said recently that Russian property law was in such disarray that it had no idea who owned the hotel it was running in Moscow. Hotel companies in the US and western Europe usually know who owns their establishments; the difficulty is finding investors who want to own them. The established patterns of hotel ownership in the US and Western Europe were severely disrupted by the fall in property prices in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Hoteliers and investors are now having to establish different strategies for financing hotel acquisitions and new buildings. Mr Paul Slattery, a London-based leisure analyst with Kleinwort Benson, says the relationship between US hoteliers and property investors used to be stable. American financial institutions regarded hotels as a worthwhile investment. They would buy the bricks and mortar and give a hotel group a contract to run the establishment. The US financial institutions employed hotel experts and analysts, some of whom became well-known figures in the travel industry. Other, smaller investors also became involved in hotel property ownership, which provided them with tax advantages in the US. The frenetic pace of hotel building, however, meant that the supply of hotel rooms in the late 1980s began to outstrip demand. The economic downturn, the drop in hotel occupancy and the fall in property asset values combined to make the hotel industry a far less attractive proposition. Mr Darryl Hartley-Leonard, president of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation of the US, says: 'Business in the 1980s was based on the beliefs that inflation would increase and demand would grow with supply. Both were violated.' The Marriott Corporation of the US illustrates the dilemma. Marriott's strategy during the 1980s was to build hotels and then sell them to limited partnerships which used the start-up losses as tax write-offs. A combination of changes in US tax laws and falling property prices put an end to this strategy in the late 1980s. Marriott responded by selling off some of its operations, such as airline catering, fast foods and restaurants. Then, at the end of 1992, Marriott announced it was splitting itself into two companies. One, Host Marriott, would specialise in owning property assets; the other, Marriott International, would run hotels. After a year of dealing with the protests of bondholder groups, the split was formalised in October last year. Mr Stephen Bollenbach, Host Marriott's president and chief executive officer, says the split has had a positive effect: analysts and institutions who follow his company are now specialists in property rather than leisure and understand the prospects for his business better. Host Marriott's share price has risen sharply since the beginning of the year. At the end of last year, Inter-Continental Hotels, owned by the Japanese Saison group, announced it was following suit. By the end of this month, Inter-Continental should also have formalised the formation of two companies  -one managing hotels and the other owning properties. Hotel groups in Europe faced a slightly different problem. European hotels were smaller and there were fewer large chains. Many hotels were family owned. European hotel groups which wanted to expand and did not want to invest in new property assets said they hoped to acquire management contracts. Someone else would buy the hotels; they would run them. Mr Slattery of Kleinwort Benson says the traditional structure of a management contract was that the managing company would receive a fee calculated as a percentage of turnover, say 3 per cent, and, typically, 10 per cent of gross operating profit. The difficulty for those companies seeking management contracts is that investors in property assets are no longer prepared to bear the risk alone. Mr Hartley-Leonard says bluntly: 'The pure management contract has gone. People investing in hotels want to know that the operator is committed to them.' Mr Peter George, group chief executive of the Ladbroke group of the UK, which owns Hilton International, says there are exceptions to this in the developing world. Where the local government believes the presence of a Hilton hotel, say, would increase the attraction of the country to investors and business travellers, it might be prepared to take ownership of the property and ask the Ladbroke subsidiary to manage it. In other parts of the world, however, companies investing in hotel assets are demanding that the operating company takes a partial equity stake or guarantees specific rates of return to the owner. But who are these brave individuals who are prepared to invest in hotel assets? In Asia, where there is still a need for new hotels, Mr Slattery says there are property groups and wealthy individuals interested in building or owning hotels. There are also companies with an interest in buying European hotels. When the debt-laden Ciga group, an Italian-based luxury chain, went on sale recently, there were at least three serious bidders: Host Marriott, Forte of the UK and ITT Sheraton of the US, the eventual winner. The Forte bid was particularly interesting. Forte originally offered to take over the management of Ciga for Pounds 33m in cash. Forte also agreed to insert some of its own luxury hotels, with a value of about Pounds 125m into a Ciga operating company. When it became clear that other bidders were offering more cash, Forte teamed up with the Quantum Fund, owned by Mr George Soros, the US investor. Together they offered Pounds 270m. Although the bid was topped by ITT Sheraton, Mr Slattery believes the Forte/Soros combination is an example of the new sorts of financing arrangements that hotel companies will now be examining.</p>

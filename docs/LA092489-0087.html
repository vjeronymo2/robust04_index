			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE:: SONGS BY DUPARC, GOUNOD, WOLF, BRAHMS, SCHUBERT AND OTHERS. LOTTE  LEHMANN, SOPRANO; ERNO BALOGH AND PAUL ULANOWSKY, PIANISTS. BMG MUSIC CD  7809-2-RG (COMPACT DISC).  </P> <P> This disc is particularly welcome since it includes five songs released here  for the first time and in repertory not generally associated with the beloved  German soprano. The French is admittedly sketchy, the Italian not bad at all.  However, over half the disc is given to Lied. She had been singing opera more  than 20 years when she came to this country; her voice, never particularly  beautiful, was hardly in its prime. The recordings here date from 1935 to '49,  after her arrival here, yet the color and expressivity, despite a peculiar  vocal production, make every word count. No texts. WALTER PRICE  </P></p>

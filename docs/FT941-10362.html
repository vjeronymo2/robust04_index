			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Polish coalition in compromise The leaders of Poland's two-party governing coalition have patched up their differences after a bruising clash over control of economic policy sparked by the resignation of Mr Marek Borowski, the deputy premier and finance minister. The compromise, which came on the eve of yesterday's large demonstration in Warsaw by the Solidarity trade union, commits the coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SLD) and the Peasant Party (PSL), to support this year's draft budget but saw the SLD forced to abandon its support for Mr Borowski. The SLD is now searching for a new candidate to head the finance ministry. Meanwhile, Solidarity put well over 20,000 supporters onto the street in its first public challenge to the coalition government, which has its roots in the communist past. The union is demanding changes in the budget to increase public sector wages and cut planned energy price rises and threatens to back its demands with selective industrial action. The draft budget which goes to a final vote in parliament at the beginning of next month has been agreed with the International Monetary Fund. The budget is central to Poland's chances of winning a 20 per cent reduction in its Dollars 32bn Paris Club debt at the end of March. The reduction is linked to IMF approval of the country's economic policies. During the crisis Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister and PSL leader, indicated that he would push for more expansionary policies and criticised the tight budget prepared under Mr Borowski's direction as being 'a liberal continuation' in a reference to the practice of free market governments since 1989. Now Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the SLD leader, who lost ground in the eyes of the public during the clash, has managed to bring Mr Pawlak around to supporting the budget. But he lost Mr Borowski and only managed to salvage the principle that the finance ministry stays within the sphere of influence of the SLD as originally agreed when the government was established last autumn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Manuel Cabrera] </F>   [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 22 January--Today, the  Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] and the  Public Security Directorate of this municipality intercepted  drugs worth $40 million on the international narcotics market.  They consisted of 235 kg of pure cocaine and 137 kg of  marijuana, which were seized today in two simultaneous  operations conducted by the aforementioned forces, according to  the Federal Judicial Police first commander, Jose Maria Barragan  Barajas.    Based on the investigative report submitted to the agency of  the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office [MPF], the first  confiscation was made at the international bridge crossing to  the United States, at Juarez Avenue. It occurred after three  persons riding in separate vehicles following one another failed  to meet their "contact," presumed to be an official of the  neighboring northern country's government who was involved in  the drug traffic, and who was to help them cross over to the  United States. They decided to return with the alkaloid instead,  prompting a pursuit by the Mexican police, who had been notified  by the U.S. authorities.    Jaime Marquez, aged 18; Luis Miguel Martinez Garcia, 18; and  Carlos Tapia Rodriguez, 19, the latter presumably related to a  drug trafficking family of the same surname, were intercepted  with the 235 kg of pure cocaine. They made their statements at  the MPF, subordinate to the PGR.    Meanwhile, concurrently, the authorities captured a drug  trafficker protecting himself with a reporter's credentials, who  had managed to evade the Federal Judicial Police mobile units  engaged in surveillance on the state's highways. This report was  also made by Commander Jose Maria Barragan Barajas.    He explained that the subject under arrest, Juan Carlos  Serafin Olvera, had identified himself with credentials of the  newspaper DIARIO DE LA MANANA, and with a metal press badge. He  was driving a cream-colored Ford Marquis vehicle with license  plates DTM-1878, in which 137 kg of marijuana were found.    The aforementioned morning paper, which used to circulate in  this border area and is not being published at present, was  advertised on various parts of the confiscated vehicle. Found in  the same car were three press credentials in the name of  Salvador Noel Chacon Olguin, displayed in the rearview mirror  and on the windshield so that the vehicle would not be stopped.    When presented to the news media, Serafin Olvera admitted  that, after the closing of the newspaper DIARIO DE LA MANANA,  where he had worked seven years as a police photographer, he  began carrying marijuana from the Chihuahua capital to this  locality. For each trip, he was being paid the sum of $1,000:  $500 upon receiving the shipment, and another $500 when he  delivered it.    The four persons arrested in the two police operations, as  well as the cocaine and marijuana and the four luxury vehicles,  were placed at the disposal of the acting agent of the Federal  Public Prosecutor's Office.</p>

These leaflets contain instructions and  calls to the Iraqi people and Army to rebel against tyrant  Saddam's regime and to cut off the road before the cliques of  terrorism and crime that want to destroy Iraq and humiliate its  people through starvation and oppression.    This was revealed by our sources in south Iraq in a report  in  which they said that groups of Islamic Resistance men  distributed revolutionary leaflets in the city of al-Basrah and  the district of al-Qurnah. The sources added that the biggest  drop took place at the end of last week. It included the  district of al-Majarr al-Kabir, Qal'at Salih, al-Maymunah, the  city of al-'Amarah, and the subdistricts of al-Salam and Nahr  'Udayl, which belong to the governorate of al-'Amarah.    The antiregime leaflets were also distributed in the  districts of (al-Mudaynah), al-Qurnah, and al-Dayr, the  subdistricts of al-'Uzayr, (Salhah), and al-Huwayr, and the city  of al-Basrah, all of which belong to al-Basrah Governorate.    Our sources affirmed that the distribution has caused a big  uproar among the regime's circles. It has forced it to place  its forces on alert and carry out large-scale search operations  in these areas and arrest citizens.</p>

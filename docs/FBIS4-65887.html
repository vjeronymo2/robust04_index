			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Umberto Brindani: "Behold Bobo: The Secret of </F> Roberto Maroni"]    [Text] He is a true believer of the  boss, a moderate, and a skilled negotiator, but there is still  another reason for the rise of the Northern League's number  two--one that is never mentioned.    "And for interior minister: Maroni," Umberto Bossi mumbled.  "Maroni who?" the PANORAMA correspondent asked. "How do you  spell it?" Bossi, annoyed, spelled it for him. "He is a lawyer  from Varese and is my friend." "What is his first name?" the  correspondent asked. "Roberto."    It was in late November 1991. Giulio Andreotti was prime  minister, Vicenzo Scotti was interior minister, the DC  [Christian Democratic Party] was still in existence, and Achille  Occhetto headed the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. It was a  century ago; the newspapers were still writing "the Leagues,"  and the real League--Bossi's League--had a total of one deputy  and one senator: Bossi himself. In his little office in Rome,  the boss agreed to play the role of "shadow prime minister" and  rattled off the list of hypothetical cabinet ministers: Speroni  for foreign affairs, Formentini for economy, Ms. Pivetti for  immigration, Miglio for institutional reforms. It was only in  fun, because the threshold of power seemed so far away. The  reality is that now, two and one-half years and 178 members of  Parliament later, it is easy to verify that Bossi was wrong  regarding his own list. Except for one person on the list: the  self-styled "lawyer" from Lozza, a town of 900 souls located a  stone's throw from Varese.    Maroni is not a lawyer; he only has a law degree.  Nonetheless, he is the new interior minister--a fact that needs  to be emphasized, because it is one of those things--such as  Fiorello being the idol of the masses or Nelson Mandela the  president of South Africa--that is hard to believe. Since  Wednesday 11 May, Roberto "Bobo" Maroni, 39, is married to Emi  Macchi, has two small children, is a former employee of Avon  Cosmetics, and is also an amateur bluesman [preceding word in  English] and (to hear him tell it) a good soccer player--has  been the chief at Palazzo Viminale, the ministry that has the  secrets and the dossiers as well as 4,215 officials, 208  prefects, and 150,000 employees (including 100,000 police).    No one therefore any longer ridicules, in the manner of Mino  Martinazzoli, Maroni's scatological nickname. No one any longer  asks, "Maroni who?" The complete "color" commentary on his  personality has by now appeared in the political columns: his  passion for the Hammond organ in the Distretto 51 band  [preceding word in English] (13 members, and a rhythm and blues  [preceding three words in English] repertoire ranging from  Wilson Pickett to Otis Redding); the sax, in the manner of Bill  Clinton; and the mini Olympics with his old friends from Varese.  Maroni's political biography has also been extensively reported:  the student marches in his youth ("But I never got into  trouble"); his votes for Proletarian Democracy; the founding of  Radio Varese (originally the voice of the local Left, today the  voice of the League); the momentous meeting with Bossi in 1979;  the memorable fiasco of the little local-dialect newspaper NORD  OVEST (three issues, 20 copies sold); his election to the Varese  municipal council in 1990; his election to the Chamber of  Deputies in 1992, in which he received 30,000 votes; and his  experience as League caucus leader in the Chamber.    Paradoxical as it may seem, the Maroni of the past two or  three years is precisely the Maroni who is least well-known. But  how in the world did this "pudgy little League fellow"--the  gentle and likeable Bobo of the impossible negotiations (with  Occhetto, with Mario Segni)--manage to land the one cabinet post  that in Italy ranks second in importance only to Silvio  Berlusconi's? Bossi wanted him there of course, to some extent  because of his gifts of equilibrium and moderation, and to a  great extent because of his unshakable loyalty to the boss's  directives. But there is a secret reason for the irresistible  rise of the "saxophone man," and a culprit as well: the press.    Many League leaders, encouraged by the supreme leader, have  always harbored a dislike, verging on hatred, of newspapers and  journalists that is unrestrained, self-confident, and almost  ontological. Talking to the "hacks of the regime" was a sin; at  most, you were allowed to make an occasional sarcastic remark in  their presence. Give them an interview? Fine, but they are not  to be trusted. The League's press secretaries served as a  barrier to protect the boss [preceding word in English]. And as  for its spokespersons, of what use are their statements if Bossi  changes his mind from one day to the next?    But Maroni was different. As a little boy he perhaps wanted  to be an astronaut or big league soccer player, but assuredly  not interior minister. He knows how to play the "advocate" in  writing (as demonstrated by the brilliant "Lombard diaries,"  published in PANORAMA). And he has a talent that is not found  among League supporters as a whole and is perhaps a legacy of  his leftist activism: self-ridicule, which enables him to view  the League's menacing slogans objectively. As a result, this  right-hand man of Bossi always enjoyed a privileged relationship  with journalists. He spoke to the "hacks" and in return clearly  enjoyed a growing popularity with them. All they had to do was  dial 0337 et cetera, and he answered. He responded to them  (without going too far); preached the Bossi doctrine; and kept  his appointments.    Any journalist who has covered the League in recent years  remembers a Maroni dressed in jeans [preceding word in English],  preferably white; a wrinkled jacket; dreadful multicolored ties;  and a portable phone ("My battery doesn't last long"). If you  ran into him at the Varese city hall or in the Chamber of  Deputies offices, he always appeared to be there by chance ("See  what I have to do"). And at the great League festivals,  congresses, meetings, and swearing-in ceremonies--whether he was  there for work or pleasure--he always spent the night in the  company of the "specialized" journalists, speculating about the  mystery that surrounded the lineups in the 1961-62 soccer  championships.    All this effort and approachability have obviously borne  fruit in terms of image, but if that image had depended, for  example, on the period of Maroni's activity in Varese as  councilman in charge of road construction and maintenance, one  would have had to shudder at the thought of his becoming  interior minister.    Should the road through the Sacro Monte be closed to  traffic?  Maroni asks the advice of his newspaper friends, who supply him  with a dozen ecological intellectual slogans [preceding word in  English] of the "Breathe your mountain" type." He thanks them,  thinks it over, and after a week comes up with this Lombard  populist opinion: "The mountain is respected if you take the  shuttle."    And there is more. In Maroni's city they tell this version  of  the old story of the "rotating" one-way streets. Hardly had the  new municipal council taken office in early 1993 when it became  necessary to reduce the levels of pollution and traffic. The new  one-way directions were adopted, and the merchants were furious.  Maroni adopted a posture of goodwill and agreed to meet with  them--one at a time and one per evening--and promised each one  that he would systematize the solution. Because Maroni is  someone who keeps his promises, he really changed the one-way  streets--changed them every morning, because every evening he  was confronted by a merchant who had been angered by the changes  made that morning.    The story may have been somewhat embroidered by an envious  fellow resident, but that is "Bobo's" philosophy: Be careful not  to displease anyone, even if it means contradicting yourself. In  February he proclaimed: "None of the proposed cabinets includes  any elected officials from the AN [National Alliance]. That will  absolutely never be," and we know what happened. Two years ago  he in fact told PANORAMA: "With someone like me as interior  minister, all of Italy's skeletons of the past 20 years, from  Piazza Fontana to Ustica, will be jumping out of the closets."  Poor fellow, not even he believed it at the time. Let us hope  this time he will have the courage not to contradict  himself--even if he has to displease someone.</p>

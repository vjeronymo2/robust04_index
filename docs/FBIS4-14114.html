			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (INA)--Shabib al-Maliki, minister of  justice and leader of the Iraqi delegation to the meetings of  the 10th session of the Arab Justice Ministers Council, has  asserted that Iraq, under His Excellency President Saddam  Husayn, is very interested in promoting and enhancing joint Arab  action in all areas.    In a speech delivered to the Arab Justice Ministers Council  in Cairo, the minister said Iraq will keep Arab reconciliation  at the top of its political agenda despite the circumstances of  the embargo clamped on it. The embargo, the minister noted,  will not distract Iraq from its pan-Arab role of defending the  interests of the Arab nation and its fateful causes.    Shabib al-Maliki explained to the Arab justice ministers  that  Iraq has fulfilled its commitments per the relevant UN Security  Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 687, Paragraph 22  of which provides for the expeditious lifting of the sanctions  clamped on Iraq.    The justice minister urged Arab and international peoples,  as  well as the advocates and champions of justice, to strongly  demand that the UN Security Council comply with its own  resolutions and honor its commitments to Iraq, including the  commitment to lift the embargo clamped on its mujahid people.  This, he noted, is dictated by humanitarian and pan-Arab  duties, not to mention the requirements of Arab solidarity.    Al-Maliki said the tenets of fairness, which the Arab  justice  ministers enthusiastically promote in the Arab homeland, are  being disturbed in terms of international relations. These  tenets are enormously jeopardized. This compromises the  stability of world peoples in general, and the Arab people in  particular, because Arab and international developments have  made it easy for the forces of aggression and colonialism to  transgress against Iraq and the Arab nation.    The justice minister commended the fair-minded and honorable  people who have begun an effort to uphold right and promote  common pan-Arab interests to sincerely and conscientiously  express their solidarity with Iraq, demanding that the unfair,  aggressive, and unjustifiable blockade enforced against it be  revoked.</p>

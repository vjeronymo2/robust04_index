			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW / L.A. FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> 'BLUE METEORITE' OFFERS A STYLIZED TWIST ON BUTOH  </P> <P> Fey, virtuosic, arduous,dreamily high-flown, coldly task-oriented, deliberately  derivative and too self-consciously arty for its own good, "Blue Meteorite"  supposedly represents the flip side of the astringent Japanese dance style  known as butoh.  </P> <P> The hourlong piece by Saburo Teshigawara, performed at the Japan America  Theatre on Thursday night, features the choreographer and three members of his  company, Karas, moving in a dreamscape furnished with a blue-painted wall, a  facing wall of glass panes and a rug of glass shards.  </P> <P> The manner of moving is a wonder to behold. Teshigawara -- in whiteface, a  white shirt, pants and black jazz shoes -- keeps his legs in a perpetual state  of turned-in, soft-kneed, weighted flexibility so that his upper torso can  pivot and slide in seemingly any direction, even when he is on half-toe. The  effect is almost as if he were able to rotate his body inside his skin.  </P> <P> He tilts; his arms slice the air; he falls; he recovers with the automatic  precision of an android -- and he falls and falls again. His face is frozen in  distress as he executes his puppetlike routines to an uncredited sound score  that begins quietly with small purrs and low machine sounds and swells to a  stern tattoo of drums.  </P> <P> Kei Kei Miyata, Shun Ito and Koichi Ienaga observe all this from their slumped  positions within individual ceremonial frames. Eventually they embark on a  rhythmically varied, punishing set of perfect falls and automatic recoveries.  </P> <P> Teshigawara becomes a latter-day incarnation of Nijinsky's Faun -- to the taped  accompaniment of Debussy's "Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun" -- as he  stretches and balances on the glass shards. Seeing his reflection, he twitches  with animal pleasure and reproduces the bolt upright seated posture and  mittenlike gesture of the original choreography.  </P> <P> The program statement says the glass is a symbol of "crystals of light and  fragments of time." But while the faun experiences disembodied bliss, the  audience feels empathetic pain for a real dancer lying on sharp glass, giving  the proceedings an ever-so-controlled aura of masochism.  </P> <P> Teshigawara's transformation from man to spirit is now complete. He flutters  and jumps and flashes his faun-hands, joins in a stomping line dance with the  others and flirts with the wall of glass. At the end, he makes tiny,  nearsighted writing motions in the air.  </P> <P> The gesture recalls the crabbed movements of butoh -- as if, in his white-light  ecstasy, Teshigawara is honoring the older dance form. But his version is a  postmodern mutant -- coolly appropriating famous choreography and organizing  co-performers into a robotic, backup-dancer look not far removed from pop music  video. A technically brilliant, fine-tuned glibness has replaced the flinty  power of butoh.  </P> <P> Performances continue through Sunday.  </P></p>

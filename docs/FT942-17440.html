			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Racial bias at Barclays alleged The Commission for Racial Equality has been asked by a union to investigate allegations of racial bias in the selection of staff at Barclays Bank for compulsory redundancy. The Bifu banking union says that almost 17 per cent of 432 Barclays staff selected for redundancy in London and the south-east are black or Asian. This compares with an 11 per cent representation of ethnic minorities staff overall in those areas. The union call has been made as Barclays today begins hearing final appeals against the redundancies.</p>

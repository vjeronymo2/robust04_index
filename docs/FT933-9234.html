			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Romanian coal strike ending A coal strike which has brought work to a standstill in the Jiu valley, Romania's main deep mining region, looked to be winding down last night after the government said union leaders had softened their pay demands, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. A government official said the union was demanding wages ranging from 87,000 lei (Pounds 72) a month up to 281,000 lei (Pounds 233), including supplements for night shift, overtime and dangerous work, compared to the original demand for up to 320,000 lei (Pounds 266). Discussions were continuing to see if the miners' proposals could be reconciled with an offer of an average wage of 166,000 lei including supplements from the RAH, the state-owned company which administers the region's 13 mines.</p>

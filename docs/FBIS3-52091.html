			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A senior political [Israeli] source said this  morning that the new PLO compromise contains nothing that could  advance the negotiations. He was referring to the offer Nabil  Sha'th sent last night to Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, again  by fax, since the prime minister said yesterday that everything  should be presented in writing from now on. Jerusalem sources  again explained that the talks will resume only on the basis of  the Cairo agreements. Our political correspondent Udi Segal  reports:    The recent Palestinian offer of compromise, relayed last  night to Israel, includes nothing that could lead to progress in  the negotiations, a senior Israeli political source said this  morning. He was referring to the letter which Nabil Sha'th,  Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, faxed to Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres. The document arrived last night around midnight  and included a Palestinian compromise offer, in a PLO attempt to  renew the Taba talks this week.    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres reported the content of the  offer to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Israeli sources again  stressed that the messages relayed to 'Arafat's aides, through  their fax machines, were unequivocal: We are not willing to  hold negotiations about the Cairo agreements which, from  Israel's point of view, are a basis for the resumption of the  Taba talks.    Israeli sources stated that over the past 24 hours, Egypt  also played an important role in the contacts with the  Palestinians, mostly held by fax. Regarding the ridiculous  claims by Sha'th that the document presented after the Cairo  talks was not an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, Israeli sources  said: Do not ask us; ask Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa.  He was with us in the same room.    Minister Yosi Sarid said that even the first document Sha'th  sent to Rabin on 30 December -- which included amendments to the  document formulated in Cairo -- indicates that a joint  Israeli-PLO agreement was indeed made in Cairo. Had we wanted  to write an Israeli position paper, Sarid said with a smile, I  do not believe we would ask for an Egyptian or Palestinian  advice. We could have done this alone at home.</p>

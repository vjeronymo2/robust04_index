			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / US Money and Credit: Confusion over Fed's slow reaction WILL the Federal Reserve ease again? Yes, if you have faith in Wall Street's army of bond analysts, most of whom are predicting a cut in US interest rates some time in the next few days. Last week's better-than-expected inflation news - producer prices fell 0.3 per cent and consumer prices 0.1 per cent during March - should have been the green light the Fed was waiting for. The numbers were encouraging. The 0.1 per cent decline in the consumer price index was the first monthly fall since 1986. The data showed moderation in housing prices continuing; commodity prices still falling; a slowdown in the growth of prices for services; and a sharp deceleration of core inflation, minus food and energy prices. Mr Ed Yardeni, analyst at CJ Lawrence, now predicts annual inflation for the year will be 3.2 per cent, a figure even the fiercest of anti-inflation hawks could live with. The dollar's recent strength has also been a stroke of luck for the monetary authorities. An appreciating US currency will negate the threat of imported inflation, and should give the Fed additional room to lower borrowing costs. However, the failure of the Fed to respond to all the good news with an immediate cut in interest rates has upset financial markets, which had been expecting - or rather, hoping - that Friday morning would see either the discount rate or the Federal funds rate lowered by 25 or 50 basis points. Not everyone got into a kerfuffle over the lack of immediate Fed action; the bond market managed to hold on to some of its gains on Friday. The stock market, however, lost its cool. Share prices rose on hearing the inflation data, then fell quickly on the lack of a Fed move, before finally recovering to end higher as dealers and investors looked forward to an easing this week. So why did not the Fed ease on Friday? The search for an explanation reached desperate proportions during the afternoon. The wire services reported speculation in the market that the Fed did not ease because Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman, was attending the funeral of Senator John Heinz on Friday morning. This meant Mr Greenspan was unable to be at the Fed's offices - just two miles from the cemetery - to twist the necessary Open Market Committee arms and push through an immediate rate cut. Another, only slightly more plausible, explanation was that the Fed did not move on Friday because it did not want to give the market the impression that the decision to cut rates was a hurried one, made without the full support of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. Much has been made in recent weeks of supposed divisions with the FOMC, and some analysts believe the Fed is sensitive to accusations that it is divided. Mr Richard Trainer, chief market economist at Bank of Tokyo's treasury group, said on Friday: 'The timing is important . . . with all this discussion of division, I don't think a quick vote over the telephone will give the right message.' A more likely explanation is that the Fed delayed its hand in order to give the markets more time to digest last week's economic news. The last time the Fed cut the discount rate in a hurry, in February, the long end of the bond market took a tumble, unnerved by the swiftness of the rate reduction. Critics later said the speed with which rates were lowered indicated Mr Greenspan had temporarily put his concerns about inflation to one side, and succumbed to political pressure to cut rates. This time, the Fed chairman may have decided a short pause for thought before easing would keep the inflation hawks, both inside and outside the Fed, off his back. There is one other explanation for the lack of a rate cut on Friday: the Fed may have eased already. Mr Bob DiClemente of Salomon Brothers is one Fed-watcher who believes reserve data and the persistence of a Fed funds rate below the 6 per cent target suggests the Fed may have already moved, behind the market's back. Persuasive though Mr DiClemente's arguments may be, the market would still like the Fed to give a clear signal that rates have been cut. If we can assume that the new target for Fed funds is 5 1/2 per cent, which is what Friday's matched sales transaction by the Fed appeared to indicate, then a discount rate cut of 50 basis points to 5 1/2 per cent should satisfy everyone.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Last  1 week  4 wks  12-month  12-month                  Friday   ago    ago     High      Low Fed funds (weekly average)  5.00   5.75   5.75    11.00      2.00 Three-month Treasury bills    5.66   5.86   5.96     7.94      5.54 Six-month Treasury bills    5.84   5.97   6.06     8.04     5.62 Three-month prime CDs         5.98   6.13   6.30     9.01     5.90 30-day Commercial Paper             5.80   6.05   6.20     8.28     6.05 90-day Commercial Paper             5.80   5.95   6.10     7.98     5.95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            Last         Change            1 week     4 wk.

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Hanson may opt for 'part-time' position LORD HANSON, chairman of the Anglo-US industrial conglomerate that bears his name, may elect to have a non-executive role as more of the day-to-day managerial decisions are left to Mr Derek Bonham. Mr Bonham has been appointed to the newly-created post of chief executive. Mr Bonham yesterday told the Financial Times: 'James (Hanson) has a lot to contribute. But he may become part-time and decide to elect for a non-executive role. The situation is likely to be reviewed as times goes on and he will make that announcement in due course.' It was not immediately clear whether Mr Bonham, who had been Hanson's finance director, had responsibility for Hanson Industries in the US as well as Hanson in the UK. Mr David Clarke, deputy chairman of Hanson Industries and the named successor to Lord White, chairman of Hanson's US arm, said: 'There is no conceivable way that Derek Bonham would have anything to do with those matters outside Lord Hanson's domain.' While Mr Clarke praised Mr Bonham's abilities and described him as a good friend, he said there was a clearly defined role for a chief executive in the UK while he would continue to be in charge of the US businesses. Mr Bonham said he had a developing role which would extend across both sides of the Atlantic. 'I am chief executive of Hanson PLC but there is only one balance sheet off which to drive the companies.' Both Mr Clarke and Mr Bonham stressed how they had enjoyed working together and how they were looking forward to developing the new partnership between them. Asked whether his new appointment would lead to his taking over the chairmanship of Hanson when Lord Hanson retires in 1997, Mr Bonham said: 'Let's wait and see. I prefer to take one day at a time. I want to make a success of this job first.' Tax wizard takes over the helm at Hanson, Page 18 Observer, Page 19</p>

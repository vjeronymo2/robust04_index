			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: MI6 comes in from the cold MR JOHN MAJOR'S decision to bring the Secret Intelligence Service in from the cold was long overdue after the public recognition of organisations such as the KGB in Russia and the CIA in the US. For most people, the biggest surprise about SIS - better known as MI6 - was not that it exists but that Mr Major's reference to the service and Sir Colin McColl, it's head, during the Queen's Speech debate was the first time that it has been officially recognised by the government. Mr Stephen Dorril - whose book, In From The Cold, on the development of the intelligence services during the 1980s and the 1990s is published in October  -said: 'We know quite a lot about MI5 and its structure, but we know very little about MI6, which seems to have escaped attention.' Like MI5, its sister organisation, MI6 developed from branches of British military intelligence during the First World War. It is responsible for the collection of foreign intelligence, particularly in the military and economic spheres. It also carries out counter-espionage, involving the infiltration of foreign intelligence services. The idea that the existence of a secret service should in itself be classed as a secret was exposed to ridicule in the 1980s with debacles such as the failed government prosecution of Mr Peter Wright for alleged breaches of the Official Secrets Act in the publication of Spycatcher, his account of his career in MI5. The announcement is part of a wider trend towards accountability. MI6 managed to maintain its cloak of secrecy longer than MI5 whose new head, Mrs Stella Rimington, was announced late last year. New MI6 offices close to Vauxhall Bridge in London are currently under construction. The organisation has about 2,000 staff and a budget of about Pounds 150m.</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's insurance The exodus of Names from the Lloyd's insurance market has squeezed the agencies which stand between them and underwriters. Sturge and A J Archer, the two quoted agencies, underperformed the stock market by 90 per cent over the last five years. Their response to plunging commission income has been consolidation: witness last week's acquisition by Archer of the unquoted Castle Holdings. The deal allows Archer to spread the cost of developing technology for analysing the performance of underwriting syndicates. If the reforms under consideration allow companies to commit capital to Lloyd's, such expertise may be a matter of survival. But there are pitfalls in empire-building. In a litigious business like Lloyd's, acquiring other agencies - contingent liabilities and all - can be risky. Big agency groups must also be wary of conflicts of interest. Both Archer and Sturge now own managing agents which act for underwriters, and members' agents which represent the interests of Names. The last round of Lloyd's legislation stopped insurance brokers owning managing agents. The coming proposals may demand a root and branch reform. So long as the market is shrinking, though, Lloyd's agencies will be under pressure to take out costs. That points to further mergers. Sturge and Archer can pay for unquoted rivals with quoted paper. Consolidation alone will not bring a reversal of fortunes. That requires a return to underwriting profits. But whatever structure emerges for Lloyd's, the strong will be best placed to benefit.</p>

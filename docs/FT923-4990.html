			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: D-Mark CP sector ranks fourth in Europe THE D-MARK commercial paper market has overtaken the sterling CP market to become the fourth largest such market in Europe, after France, Sweden and Spain, according to a report published this week by Moody's, the international rating agency. It has achieved this only a year and a half after its inception. However, the report warns that the delay in removing restrictions on German money-market funds is restricting the growth rate of the DM17bn market, by limiting the potential investor base. The level of issuance tailed off in the second quarter of the year. 'In other countries, CP markets have been driven by the existence of pure money market funds, which are not yet authorised in Germany,' said Mr Michael Buneman, one of the authors of the Moody's report. In the meantime, the bulk of D-Mark commercial paper has been placed with domestic or Luxembourg-based mutual funds (which are allowed to hold a proportion, but not all, of their assets in short-term paper) and domestic insurance companies. Moody's estimates that mutual funds hold around 30-40 per cent of current outstandings while insurance companies have a 25-30 per cent share of the market. Other investors include companies, central banks and domestic banks. Corporates are estimated to account for a 20-25 per cent share, which has fallen since the early stages of the market, and is likely to decrease further. There are still relatively few foreign investors apart from central banks. However, the liberalisation of Bundesbank rules on D-Mark issuance, which came into effect on August 1, is expected to boost the proportion of foreign issuers. The new rules allow foreign non-bank issuers direct access to the market rather than using a German subsidiary.</p>

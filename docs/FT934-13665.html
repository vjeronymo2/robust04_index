			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (20): Meaningful expressions - Financial Times writers Antonia Sharpe and Laurie Morse draw on the large mass of literature to compile a glossary of words and terms used in the derivatives industry GIVEN the rapid growth in the derivatives industry and the increasingly exotic nature of the products which are being launched, it is hardly surprising that newcomers to the industry are confused or misled by the terminology. In addition, the vast difference between the perceived meaning and the actual meaning of many of the terms poses serious problems for the industry's regulators, lawyers and insurers. In a recent paper, Mr Graham Cox, group economist at the Sun Life Assurance Society, points out that very often the perceived meaning of a 'hedge fund' is a fund with all risk eliminated by the use of hedging positions, whereas the actual meaning is a portfolio of leveraged positions, normally including derivatives. Mr Cox notes that there have been attempts in the past to sort out more effective and less misleading names for the various functions and products in the derivatives industry, but with little success so far. However, there are numerous dictionaries which give lucid explanations of the jargon and many banks and securities houses which trade in derivatives have published useful information packs detailing how the more complicated products work. Asset allocation: dividing investment funds among markets to achieve diversification or maximum return. As-you-like option (or chooser option or the call-or-put option) enables the holder to convert from one style of option to a different style of option over a preset period of time. Average rate option (or Asian option): an option in which the settlement is based on the difference between the given strike and the average prices of the underlying stock or index on selected dates. Barrier options: a family of path-dependent options whose pay-off pattern and survival to the expiration date depend not only on the final price of the underlying security but also on whether or not the underlying security sells at or goes through a pre-determined barrier at any time during the life of the option. Various Barrier options include: Down-and-out call/put: an option which expires worthless if the market price of the underlying security drops below a pre-determined price. Down-and-in call/put: an option which becomes effective if the market price of the underlying security drops below a pre-determined price. Up-and-out call/put: an option that expires worthless if the market price of the underlying security rises above a pre-determined price. Up-and-in call/put: an option that becomes effective if the market price of the underlying security rises above a predetermined price. Best-of-two option (or either-or option or alternative option): provides the option holder with a payoff based on the independent performances of two separate and distinct securities or indices. Box options: a tax efficient method of using cash to generate capital gains, while maintaining a conservative investment approach to funds management. Instead of placing cash in a money market instrument and generating interest income, equity options are purchased the payoffs of which create capital gains that can be offset against current capital losses. Call option: the right to buy a given stock, commodity, index, or futures contract at a fixed price on or before a specified date. Cap: contract between a borrower and a lender where the borrower is assured that he will not have to pay more than some maximum interest rate on borrowed funds. Clearing house: an affiliate of a futures or options exchange which matches and guarantees trades and holds performance bonds posted by dealers. Acts as a counterparty to every trade, reducing credit risk. Collar: a floating rate debt contract that establishes both a maximum and minimum interest rate to be paid by the borrower. Commodity Swap: a swap in which counterparties exchange cash flows based on a commodity price on at least one side of the transaction. Compound option: an option on an option. The holder has the right to purchase another option on a pre-set date, at a pre-set premium. Contango: a condition in a futures market where the more distant delivery months trade at a premium to the near term delivery months. Covered call: one of the most popular option strategies, using an existing equity position. Calls are sold on the underlying security with strikes which are higher than the market price. The strike price chosen limits the profit a security holder can realise from the position and this strategy is best used when the holder is fairly certain that there will be little movement in the security's share price. Currency swap: an exchange of equal initial principal amounts of two currencies at the spot exchange rate. Over the term of the agreement, the counterparties exchange fixed or floating rate interest payments in their swapped currencies. At maturity, the principal amount is reswapped at a predetermined exchange rate so the parties endup with their original currencies. Deferred strike or deferred start option (or forward start option): allows the holder to defer the setting of the strike price until some future time, up to an agreed deadline. Derivative: a contract the value of which changes in concert with the price movements in a related or underlying commodity or financial instrument. The term covers standardised, exchange-traded futures and options, as well as over-the-counter swaps, options, and other customised instruments. Equity swap: a contract between two counterparties to exchange two different cashflows over time. Over the life of the swap one party agrees to pay the rate of return on an equity or the equity index while the other party agrees to pay a floating or fixed rate of interest. Exploding option (or one-touch option): a European-style call spread with an early exercise price trigger. Floor: an aspect of a floating rate debt contract that specifies a minimum interest rate for a borrower. Forward: an over-the-counter agreement for a buyer and seller to exchange a particular good for a particular price at a specified future date. Futures contract: an agreement between a buyer and seller to exchange a particular good for a particular price at a future date as specified in a contract common to all participants in a market on an organised futures exchange. Collateral must be posted for performance bonds, and positions are marked to market at least once a day. Hedge: a transaction that reduces risk of an underlying security or commodity position by making the appropriate offsetting derivative transaction. Usually limits potential reward of the underlying position. Hybrid security: a complex security consisting of virtually any combination of two or more risk management building blocks - bond or note, forward, future, or option. Interest-rate swap: the exchange between counter- parties of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt in a single currency. Ladder option (or step-Lock option): provides the holder with a mechanism of locking in gains on an underlying security during the life of the option, before its expiry. Lookback option: an option the payout of which is calculated using the highest intrinsic value of the underlying security or index over the life of the option. In the case of a Lookback call, the highest market price is used whereas for a Lookback put,the lowest market price is used. Outperformance option: a call option which allows an investor to capitalise on diverging performances of two underlying securities, which can be individual stocks, customised baskets of stocks or a specific index. Put option: the right to sell a particular stock, bond, commodity or index at a specified future date at a specified price. Quanto option (or guaranteed exchange rate option or currency protected option): an option in which foreign exchange risks in an underlying security have been eliminated. Risk reversal: this strategy combines the purchase of a put option with the sale of a call option. The put option preserves the capital value of the shareholding while the sale of a call option reduces or eliminates the cost of this insurance, at the expense of giving up some of the upside potential of the stock. Swap: a contract to exchange a stream of periodic payments with a counterparty. Swaps are available in and between all active financial markets. Swaption: an option to enter into a swap contract. Texas hedge: a transaction that increases risk; two or more related positions whose risk is additive, rather than offsetting. Warrant: an option to purchase or sell an underlying instrument at a given price and time or series of prices and times. A warrant differs from a put or call option in that its is ordinarily issued for longer than a year.

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Australian group faces ADollars 445m break-up bid A ADollars 445m (USDollars 324m) break-up bid was launched last night for Foodland Associated, the troubled Western Australian retail, wholesale and property group. Mr Graeme Hart, a New Zealand entrepreneur, is joining forces with Australia's Coles Myer to acquire and then divide the company. The bid is being made by Rank Commercial, Mr Hart's private company, and is pitched at ADollars 5.27 a share. It is conditional on a minimum acceptance level of 75 per cent, and on approvals from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board and the Trade Practices Commission, the competition watchdog. The TPC said it would 'closely examine' the offer, paying particular attention to the role of Coles Myer. Coles is one of Australia's biggest retail groups. Mr Hart, a former truck-driver who has built his fortune by buying a series of companies at knock-down prices, is believed to be one of New Zealand's wealthiest individuals. His Rank company already owns a 14.9 per cent interest in Foodland, most of which was acquired from a single institutional shareholder last month. If the offer is successful, Rank says its aim is to spin off Foodland's substantial New Zealand assets - which include the Farmers Deka discount and department store group, and a 57.4 per cent interest in the Progressive supermarkets group - as a separate company, distributing shares in this entity to Foodland's remaining shareholders. Rank, which by then would own at least 75 per cent of Foodland, would pass its shares in this new company to Whitcoulls, the New Zealand bookseller and stationery group. Rank would offer its remaining stake in Foodland, which would be reduced to its Australian assets only, to Coles. Rank said the break-up bid was being financed by bank borrowings, to be supplied by National Australia Bank, Credit Suisse and Bank of America. The bank facilities were still subject to 'satisfaction of a number of conditions (including completion of documentation)'.</p>

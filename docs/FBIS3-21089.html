Opening the debate on the restructuring of the Research  Councils in the House of Commons, Mr Waldegrave announced that  15.4 million pounds, derived from additional funds and  reallocated resources, will be made available to "demonstrate  our commitment to the new partnership between the Research  Councils and industry."    The 15.4 million pounds will be used for a number of  initiatives including:    -- a new competitive scheme to encourage researchers to  collaborate with industry. The grants will be complementary to  the funding provided by industry for strategic research. A small  pilot scheme will be run with funding of 3.5 million pounds in  1994-95. The awards will be named ROPAs after the White Paper,  "Realising our Potential". The pilot will be coordinated and run  by three Research Councils - the Engineering and Physical  Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the Biotechnology and  Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the Medical  Research Council (MRC)    -- an additional 0.6 million pounds to the CASE Awards  available to firms which have demonstrated their ability to  provide the right environment for postgraduate training in the  past    -- priority in the distribution of research funds to areas  identified by industry as being of strategic importance. For  example 2 million pounds to the innovative manufacturing  programme, 3.4 million pounds to the human and animal genome and  immunology programmes and 4.5 million pounds to chemistry.    Commenting on the new ROPA scheme Mr Waldegrave said: "The  unique feature of this scheme is that the conventional peer  review system will not be used but industry's recognition of the  researchers will be taken as an indicator of quality and  relevance. It gives industry a major role in identifying the  researchers, who will be eligible to apply for support for  strategic research."    Mr Waldegrave concluded by emphasising the importance  partnership will play in taking forward the policies of the  science White Paper:    "Government took a strategic look at what scientific  research  and postgraduate training it should fund. And Government has  resolved to build on existing strengths to create a closer and  more systematic relationship with the science and engineering  base, industry and commerce.    "The new initiatives I have announced today will go a long  way to furthering those objectives. I congratulate Sir John  Cadogan, the new Director General of Research Councils on the  imaginative programme he has designed."    Detailed allocations to the Research Councils were announced  today by Mr Waldegrave in reply to a parliamentary question from  Cheryl Gillan MP, (Chesham and Amersham).    Mr Waldegrave also placed in the Library of the House a  paper  setting out in more detail the allocation of the 15.4 million  pounds to new programmes.

			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Three Americans in four now think of themselves as environmentalists, according  to a new Gallup Poll. Public concern about the environment tends to center on  ecological problems that are tangible and may be directly observed in people's  daily lives. Large majorities say they worry a great deal about pollution of  rivers, lakes and reservoirs (72%), contamination of soil and water by toxic  waste (69%) and air pollution (63%). After the wreck of an Exxon tanker that  spilled more than 11 million gallons of oil off Alaska, 41% of Americans say  they would seriously consider joining a boycott of Exxon's products; 7% claim  they already have done so. Almost as many (46%) are opposed to a boycott. Asked  to name the most important problems facing the nation, 4% now cite  environmental issues; 34%, various economic problems, and 27%, the drug crisis.  </P></p>

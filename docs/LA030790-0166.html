			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: CHRYSANTHEMUM FLOWERS, FORMIC ACID BATTLE NITS  </P> <P> Myths die hard. When we were children lice were considered a sign of  slovenliness. Memories of kerosene shampoos and short haircuts still send  shivers down parents' spines.  </P> <P> Even these days, most school nurses get a pained expression on their faces at  the mention of lice. They're on the front line of this epidemic.  </P> <P> Despite effective lice shampoos, ridding a school of these unwanted intruders  is not always easy, which is why most schools demand that their children's  scalps be free of nits (tiny white louse eggs) -- before the child can return.  </P> <P> A mother cornered us at a recent gathering and whispered that her daughter had  been sent home with lice. This woman was incensed that she had been called at  work and forced to pick her child up in the middle of the day.  </P> <P> She felt humiliated and annoyed that she had to spend several hours after  treating her daughter with lice shampoo trying to comb the nits out of the  child's long, curly hair.  </P> <P> Once upon a time the No Nit rule was the only effective way to control lice.  Over-the-counter shampoos (A-200, R &amp; C and Rid) only kill lice. The eggs,  which can hatch up to 10 days later, are resistant. Consequently, it was  essential to comb out the nits to prevent reinfestation.  </P> <P> Today, however, there are prescription products that are highly effective and  may offer an alternative to nit removal. Ovide (malathion) is capable of  killing nits as well as lice. And Nix Creme Rinse (permethrin) stays on the  hair to kill young lice as they emerge from the egg. With one application 97%  to 99% of children are louse-free after two weeks, even without nit removal.  </P> <P> Nix is easier to use than Ovide and the active ingredient permethrin is a  derivative of chrysanthemum flowers. The insecticidal properties of this plant  have been appreciated for centuries.  </P> <P> As effective as the new prescription products may be, schools are unlikely to  change No Nit policies, as they cannot require all children be treated with an  expensive prescription.  </P> <P> To make nit removal easier, parents may wish to try a new over-the-counter  preparation (Step 2 from the GenDerm Corp.). It contains formic acid which  helps loosen the eggs after lice shampoo treatment.  </P> <P> Despite the stigma associated with lice, anyone can have them.  </P></p>

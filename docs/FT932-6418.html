			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Arts: The Monarch in Madrid - The Victorian art exhibition visiting the Prado This summer, 'The Monarch of the Glen' is not in its offical home at the headquarters of United Distillers in Edinburgh. Landseer's immortal image of a stag in its Highland fastness is now casting its spell over a new public. Together with Frith's 'Railway Station', a close competitor for title of Most Famous Victorian Painting, the Monarch is now in Madrid with the British Council's exhibition, Victorian Paintings from Turner to Whistler. This enjoyable survey contains more than a hundred paintings and several drawings by a great number of artists. They have been lent from the royal collection and from public collections in some remarkably obscure corners of the British Isles, as well as by numerous private collectors. The Prado's civilised exhibition space is its last stop (ends July 31). As a great plus, there is a small exhibition of Victorian photographs of great quality which complement the paintings beautifully. In its first fortnight the show has drawn a large attendance of Madrilenans. The hope is that Victorian Paintings will fill what may well be a very substantial gap in many visitors' knowledge of art. Victorian painting is almost unknown in Spanish public collections. (Let us remember, however, that the reverse is just as true.) The Prado owns barely half a dozen 19th-century Victorian paintings, the most recently acquired being a superb evocation by David Roberts of the interior of the great mosque in Cordoba. Last century and this, Spanish private collectors held off the Victorians. In the homes of the aristocracy, there are the same kind of English hunting and horsey paintings which are to be found the world over. However, this exhibition marks Spain's first encounter with the strand of mid-century narrative paintings such as Abraham Solomon's 'Contrast' (the rude health of French fisherfolk on the beach contrasted with the consumptive young Englishwoman sketching them with a limp hand in her bathchair) and Egley's 'Omnibus Life in London'. The Prado will therefore also be a first time many visitors will have encountered the Pre-Raphaelites. The leaders of the Brotherhood come out of the show rather poorly. However, the later generation of the PRB is strongly represented. 'Isabel' by the little-known John Melhush Strudwick, and John William Waterhouse's 'Belle Dame Sans Merci' (his most famous work is the Tate's 'Ophelia'), almost take us to the end of the century. In the latter, we see how much English artists had come to admire the technique of Jules Bastien Lepage. Something which may surprise any visitor brought up on cliches about Victorian morality is the Pre-Raphaelites' intensely eroticised view of women. Rosetti's 'Blue Bower' from the Barber Institute uses vibrant colours and also the beloved 'language of flowers' to express sheer lust. His flame-haired model, Fanny Cornforth, is bowered by passion-flowers and morning-glory as symbols of the artist's infatuation. Strewn corn-flowers are her emblem. More suggestive still, to the point of being comical, is the drawing of 'Proud Maisie' by Frederick Sandys. His mistress is in profile, the hair cascading over her shoulders drawn with a scrupulosity which recalls Leonardo's sketches of water. Sandys' mistress bites a strand of hair and frowns, a petulant and predatory young woman who alerts us to the later century's growing alarm in the face of discoveries about the unstable, disorderly female psyche. The Aesthetic Movement and the British Realist School are well shown. Frank Holl's 'Gone', a study of emigrants at the Liverpool docks, was a painting which strongly impressed the young Van Gogh. However, the latest painting to be included is Sargent's portrait of the Sitwell family, Sir George and Lady Sitwell with their famous children, Edith, Osbert and Sacheverell. It is a fitting note on which to end. For one thing, Sargent loved Velazquez and learned much from him about the full-length portrait. Then again, this is a picture which testifies to the continuity of English upper-class life and taste between the mid-century and the eve of the First World War. But Sargent has also painted the young coming generation which was savagely to deride and destroy so much that the Victorian era held to be true and important.

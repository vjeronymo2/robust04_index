			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH DEFENDS POLICY, REJECTS IRAQI CHARGES;  </P> <P> HOME FRONT: DEFENSE OFFICIALS TELL HIM THE BUILDUP IN ARABIA COULD COST AN  EXTRA $1.5 BILLION OVER 2 MONTHS.  </P> <P> President Bush defended his Persian Gulf policy Wednesday, rejecting  accusations by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that the United States has  created a "struggle between Arabs and Americans" and charges by critics at home  that he has risked lives solely over the price of gasoline.  </P> <P> Bush spoke at the Pentagon after a briefing from top defense officials, who  told him that the huge U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia and the  surrounding waters could cost an extra $1.5 billion over the next 60 days, even  if no shots are fired, or about 3% more than the Defense Department was  planning to spend before the crisis began.  </P> <P> Afterward, the President left Washington to return to Kennebunkport, Me., where  he plans to meet today with Jordan's King Hussein, who may be carrying a  message from Iraq's leader. Bush also plans to meet with Saudi Arabia's foreign  minister, Saud al Faisal.  </P> <P> Bush and his aides have sought to lower expectations surrounding King Hussein's  trip, suggesting that it is merely a chance for the two men to talk, rather  than the prelude to a possible breakthrough.  </P> <P> As the crisis approaches the two-week point, Administration officials seemed  generally pleased with how the U.S.-led effort against Iraq has progressed.  </P> <P> Saddam Hussein's unexpected proposal to surrender to Iran all the fruits of the  eight-year war between the two countries, officials said, seemed to be a sign  that the Iraqi leader is feeling the pinch of the U.S. military buildup and  international economic sanctions.  </P> <P> The buildup escalated Wednesday as the Pentagon announced that the Air Force's  high-tech F-117 Stealth fighter would be sent to the Middle East. The  government did not say how many of the planes would be deployed or where they  would be based.  </P> <P> Despite the overall optimism, officials conceded that time and stalemate could  erode the U.S. position both in the Middle East, where President Hussein has  tried to position himself as a defender of Arab nationalism against Western  interlopers, and at home, where American patience for foreign military ventures  has often been short.  </P> <P> Bush's harshly worded speech, laced with references to "atrocities" and "sordid  brutality," seemed designed to stave off both of those potential threats and to  focus blame for the standoff in the Persian Gulf on "that one man, Saddam  Hussein," rather than on Iraq as a nation. In so doing, Bush tried to advance  the Administration's publicly unstated goal of using the crisis to push the  Iraqi leader out of power.  </P> <P> "Saddam has claimed that this is a holy war of Arab against infidel," Bush  said, following the widespread practice of referring to the Iraqi strongman by  his first name. "This from the man who has used poison gas against the men and  women and children of his own country" and who started a war against Iran "that  cost the lives of more than half a million Muslims."  </P> <P> "It is Saddam who lied to his Arab neighbors. It is Saddam who invaded an Arab  state. It is Saddam who now threatens the Arab nation," Bush said. "We, by  contrast, seek to assist our Arab friends in their hour of need."  </P> <P> The Iraqi leader, Bush noted, has tried to portray the conflict "as a struggle  between the 'haves' and the 'have nots.' "  </P> <P> "But Iraq is one of the 'haves,' " he noted, a country that has the  second-largest oil reserves in the world but which is poor today because of  Hussein's "ruinous policies of war against other Muslims."  </P> <P> Bush also vigorously rebutted domestic critics who have charged that only minor  economic interests, not truly fundamental national interests, are at stake in  the anti-Iraq campaign.  </P> <P> "What is at stake is truly vital," Bush said. "Energy resources are key -- not  just to the functioning of this country but to the entire world. Our jobs, our  way of life, our own freedom and the freedom of friendly countries all around  the world would all suffer if control of the world's great oil reserves fell  into the hands of that one man, Saddam Hussein."  </P> <P> In addition, said Bush, the U.S. effort is needed "not simply to protect  resources or real estate, but to protect the freedom of nations."  </P> <P> "Our action in the gulf is about fighting aggression" and "keeping our solemn  word of honor," Bush said.  </P> <P> As Bush spoke, King Hussein, who arrived in Washington Wednesday morning  piloting his private jet, was resting at a downtown luxury hotel. Today,  Hussein plans to fly to Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, N.H. From there, he  will travel by helicopter to Bush's Kennebunkport vacation home, arriving about  noon for a meeting of 1 1/2 or two hours, White House spokesman Marlin  Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> The Administration has had no indication that the king is bearing a message  from Saddam Hussein, Fitzwater added, saying: "We have no expectations one way  or the other." Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One as the President  returned to Kennebunkport, Fitzwater said that Bush would discuss with the king  U.S. concerns about Jordan's being used as a conduit for Iraqi trade, in  defiance of the U.N.-ordered sanctions against Iraq.  </P> <P> "We'll tell him what our problems are," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Bush, speaking briefly to reporters as he played golf after returning to  Kennebunkport on Wednesday afternoon, avoided questions about the meeting.  "Just wait and see what happens," he said. "Don't want to answer any  questions."  </P> <P> In Washington, Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Mashat said that the Jordanian king is  carrying a message to Bush from Iraq but that Mashat did not know the content.  </P> <P> The U.S. military buildup in and around Saudi Arabia now includes about 25,000  troops on the ground. Another 35,000 sailors, airmen and Marines are on the  armada of ships in the waters surrounding the region, with tens of thousands  still on the way.  </P> <P> Pentagon officials presented Bush with a series of estimates of how much the  military deployment will cost, depending on how many troops eventually are  sent, how long they stay and, most important, whether they actually have to  fight.  </P> <P> Because the bulk of the military's costs come from paying its soldiers, whether  they are in Saudi Arabia or the United States, the immediate budget impact is  not huge. But for the Pentagon, already under orders to find ways to cut  spending, the strain is noticeable.  </P> <P> The cost will balloon if fighting breaks out. Pentagon planners have long  assumed that a full-scale battle could cost $1 billion a day or more.  </P> <P> Pentagon officials also informed Navy captains Wednesday of the rules that will  govern the U.S. "interdiction" of ships carrying goods to Iraq. The rules  authorize Navy vessels to use force to stop blockade runners.  </P> <P> Separately, Customs Service officials announced the arrest in Florida of a  German and a Spaniard indicted on charges of having tried to buy TOW anti-tank  missiles for Libya.  </P> <P> According to the indictment, the two men tried to arrange the export of 10,000  armor-piercing TOW missiles and 20,000 artillery shells, half of them capable  of releasing poison gas upon impact. The weapons, according to the indictment,  were to be shipped to Libya for eventual use by Iraq, Iran or another Middle  Eastern country. The purchase price was $160 million, Customs Commissioner  Carol Hallett said.  </P> <P> The case is part of a continuing Customs effort to intercept illegal weapons  shipments.  </P> <P> Staff writers James Gerstenzang in Kennebunkport and Melissa Healy in  Washington contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. MILITARY AID TO MIDDLE EAST  </P> <P> Value of U.S. weaponry transferred to each country in past 20 years.  </P> <P> Israel: $11 billion  </P> <P> Egypt: $6 billion  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia: $23 billion  </P> <P> Kuwait: $1.5 billion  </P> <P> Israel and Egypt are the world's biggest recipients of aid financed by  low-interest, long-term U.S. loans. Other nations such as Saudi Arabia and  Kuwait pay cash for U.S. weapons.  </P></p>

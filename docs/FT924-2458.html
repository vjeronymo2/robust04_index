			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Rover to raise prices by 2.9% ROVER is to raise its car prices by an average of 2.9 per cent across the range from December 21, Kevin Done writes. The move follows Ford's announcement earlier this week of price increases from January 4 for UK-built Fiesta and Escort/Orion cars by an average of 4.5 per cent and for Sierra and Granada cars by an average of 7.5 per cent. Ford and other carmakers have blamed increased prices largely on the recent devaluation of sterling. But Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, said it had not been affected as badly by the devaluation because 80 per cent of its parts came from the UK. Game of chicken, Page 10</p>

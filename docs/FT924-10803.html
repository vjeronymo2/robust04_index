			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas in Dollars 15m loss for quarter MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, the financially-stretched US aerospace group, announced a third-quarter loss of Dollars 15m after taking a Dollars 167m after-tax charge to strengthen the wings of its controversial C-17 military transport, which were damaged during stress tests at the start of this month. The company announced a drop in revenues and profits at its commercial aircraft division and an increase in the debt burden of the aerospace side of the business. The loss for the period would have been even larger without a Dollars 37m gain from the sale of TeleCheck Services, a cheque acceptance service. The Dollars 15m loss worked through at 39 cents a share, and compared with profits of Dollars 77m, or Dollars 2.02, a year ago. Revenues dropped from Dollars 4.45bn to Dollars 3.96bn. The C-17, which McDonnell Douglas is developing for the US military, has been dogged by delays and cost over-runs. The company said the quarter's charge reflected the estimated cost of strengthening the wing, and the growth of other costs in test, assembly and procurement. The charge also provided increased reserves for remaining work on the programme. Excluding the C-17, operating earnings in the company's military aerospace business totalled Dollars 122m, up from Dollars 99m, thanks to increased earnings from the F/A-18 Hornet, the AH-64 Apache and AV-8B Harrier programmes. The missiles and space business had Dollars 78m in operating earnings for the quarter, compared with Dollars 18m a year ago. But the commercial aircraft side saw earnings dip from Dollars 92m to Dollars 52m, which the company said was due mainly to higher R and D spending. It delivered 20 MD-80 twin jets during the quarter, against 40 a year ago, and eight MD-11 trijets, up from six.</p>

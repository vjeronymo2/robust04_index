			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Straw warns on Banham review LABOUR yesterday issued a warning to the government not to tamper with the Banham review of local government structure, Alison Smith writes. Both ministers and officials within the Department of the Environment are known to be unhappy with the review so far and to be considering ways in which its future activities could be curtailed. One suggestion is that after the first areas have been reviewed, future tranches of work would be optional, and the structure of councils in some areas would not be reviewed unless there was a substantial move for change. But Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, called instead yesterday for an expanded commission, a faster process of review and new guidelines covering matters such as identifying natural communities and costing proposals. In a letter to Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, Mr Straw said Labour was still committed to unitary authorities based on district councils, in place of the current two-tier structure.</p>

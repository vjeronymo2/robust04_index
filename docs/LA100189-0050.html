			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: BEING LATE CAN GIVE YOU A REAL RUSH  </P> <P> The kid's plane left at 11:30 a.m. Hold that number in your mind. The airport  is 30 minutes away.  </P> <P> At 10:15, he was playing tennis. At 10:30, he put a load of his clothes in the  dryer. At 10:40, he was in the shower washing his hair. At 10:55, he was on the  phone talking to a friend with the relaxation of a man just after surgery. At  11:05, he was going through every room in the house looking for his airline  ticket and sunglasses. He left at 11:08, confident that all the traffic lights  would be green and the plane would be 30 minutes late in leaving.  </P> <P> He is youth, a part of society that never suffers from an anxiety attack. He is  a carrier who spreads the condition to everyone within a radius of 10 miles.  </P> <P> I must have had a time in my life when I honestly believed I would never have a  flat tire on the way to the airport. I would never need a raincoat on a  vacation. I would never need a safety pin at my wedding. If there was, I can't  remember.  </P> <P> Just being around kids who never plan, never anticipate and never sweat drives  me crazy. Don't ask me why, but I freak out when I hear one of them on the  phone at 9 o'clock at night ask, "What do you want to do?" When I am tired and  want to go to bed and sleep, they have some nerve flaunting the energy to do  anything.  </P> <P> My children accuse me of planning my next headache. It's true. I'm an organized  person. I read movie reviews to see if I should take extra nose tissue along to  mop up. I never enter a taxicab without remembering the driver only carries  under $10 worth of change. Whenever I have to make a left-hand turn, I leave  the house early.  </P></p>

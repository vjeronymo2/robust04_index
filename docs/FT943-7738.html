			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Poll indicates Swedish EU referendum will be close The gap in Sweden between opponents and supporters of the European Union is narrowing ahead of a referendum on November 13, an opinion poll published yesterday showed, Reuter reports from Stockholm. The survey, published in the daily Goteborgs Posten, said support for a No vote had fallen by four percentage points from the previous poll to 41 per cent. Support for Europe remained unchanged at 37 per cent, meaning the difference between the two camps was only four percentage points, the narrowest gap since April 1992. Swedes are becoming more indecisive about whether to join the 12-member Union. The survey, conducted by the Sifo polling institute, showed the number of undecided voters had increased to 20 per cent in August from 16 per cent in the previous June poll. Sweden hopes to join the Union along with Norway, Finland and Austria from January 1, 1995.</p>

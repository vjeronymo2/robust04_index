			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets ZURICH Holderbank holds its press conference and analysts' meeting on Wednesday at which a breakdown of 1993 results, and projections for 1994 will be given. A raft of annual meetings is scheduled for the week, beginning with Oerlikon-Buhrle tomorrow, with Ascom, Nestle and Rieter on Thursday and Forbo on Friday. A CS Holding roadshow will be in Edinburgh on Wednesday and in Frankfurt on Friday. The Swiss bank has expressed an interest in buying a 20 to 30 per cent stake in Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein with an option to take control later. FRANKFURT Among a range of economic data due this week are April M3, which Nomura forecasts to rise by an annualised 13.5 per cent, and preliminary cost of living figures. The Bundesbank meets on Thursday but no move on rates is expected after the half-point cuts in the discount and Lombard rates last time. James Capel does, however, expect another reduction before the bank's summer recess, which begins after the July 21 meeting. Full-year figures come from Kaufhof, the retailer, and Viag on Wednesday. In March, Viag paid DM2.3bn in cash, plus a minority blocking stake of 25.1 per cent in the enlarged Viag group, to take full control of Bayernwerk, Bavaria's state-owned electricity utility, in a deal described as Germany's biggest privatisation to date. AMSTERDAM Nedlloyd publishes 1994 first-quarter figures on Thursday. Hoare Govett says that the operating results before extraordinary items are known to show a loss of Fl 57m for shipping, profits of Fl 9m for European transport and Fl 8m for other activities. Over the year, the broker expects a strong improvement from the shipping side while the transport and other activities could be down. Overall, operating profit and net profit should be up substantially and Hoare Govett is forecasting earnings per share of Fl 5.35 for the current year and Fl 8.90 for 1995. TOKYO Investors are continuing to focus on the currency market after confidence improved last week, as domestic institutions gradually moved back into the equity market. However, many investors are still wary over selling with the Nikkei index standing between 20,500 and 21,000, and the upside is expected to be limited.</p>

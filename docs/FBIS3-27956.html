With their efforts at  rationalization such as the closing of branches and forced  reductions in personnel approaching the limit at this point, the  author proposes specialization in money markets as a recipe for  their survival.  <H5>  Shedding Light--the Midyear Results </H5>   We will focus our attention on the contents of the combined  September 1993 midyear results for all securities companies.  Although all companies showed increased earnings after a long  dry spell, reflecting the impact of the temporary upturn in the  stock market during April and May 1993, in contrast to the  broad-based profitability of the four leading securities  companies, the performance of the majority of medium-sized firms  in terms of earnings was conspicuously dull, with continued red  ink (see table). Particularly noticeable was the further trend  in the expanding earnings differential between the four largest  companies and the remaining ones, as might be expected from the  size of the earnings bulge of the top four companies.    The primary reason for the upturn in earnings was an  increase  in commissions from stock trades. The four leading companies saw  an increase of 151 percent over the same period a year ago while  the second-tier companies experienced a growth of 140 percent.  The four leaders solidly increased earnings commissions in bonds  and underwriting, and bonds were the primary contributor to  trading profits for the second-tier companies and below.

On the other hand, retrenchment of administrative expenses  such as the closing of branches and reductions in personnel  remained at 0.3 percent for the four leading companies, but the  average for the second-tier companies and below was 9.4 percent,  with the bulk of their efforts going to rationalization.    Nonetheless, in addition to their using invested negotiable  securities and latent real estate profits, found here and there  among the second-tier and lower companies were lower required  net-worth ratios as efforts at efficiency and rationalization  extending over three years appeared to be pushing the limits of  the old system.    The situation is serious because rationalization at this  point will only make business retrenchment--that is, lower  market share--increasingly inevitable. The issue then is that  the future shape of the "securities markets" and the "securities  industry" will not be visible at all without signs of a recovery  being visible as in the past. Lacking a picture of the future,  they face continued pressure on investment, expenses, and  reductions in personnel.  <H5>  Changes in the Securities Industry's Environment </H5>   The explosive drop in the stock market that began in 1990  can  be explained as a phenomenon resulting from the bursting of the  bubble economy. Without dwelling on the surface phenomena of  "investors leaving the market," "stagnation in the stock  underwriting market," and "worsened earnings by securities  companies," which have been pointed out, the extended market  stagnation caused by the plunge into a major economic slump  following the collapse of the bubble seems to have given rise to  qualitative changes in the basic structure of the stock market.    Furthermore, the entry of banks into the securities business  through the reform of the financial system which began this year  has begun to usher in momentous changes in the functions of the  securities markets, as well as simply being threatening.    Environmental changes of this kind have been forcing  fundamental changes in Japan's securities system since 1965 and  appear especially to have shaken the operational base of the  smaller securities companies.    How should the securities business respond to these changes?  As the smaller securities firms look to their own well-being and  strength, they worry about their next move, wondering what to do.    Changes in market structure caused by the extended  securities  slump are summarized in the following three points:    The first is the "affixing of a low relative weight to  stocks  in the securities markets."    By allowing only new listings in the stock underwriting  market, market dullness invites a stop to capital expansion.  Capital acquisition needs of corporations at present are being  financed through bank loans and debt underwriting here and  abroad. We see the underwriting of hybrid securities, including  swaps. Furthermore, "stocks" are in disfavor in the application  of capital, symbolizing the retreat of banks and business  corporations from "financial engineering" investments. High-risk  Japanese stocks are being avoided.    In this way, stocks apparently have lost the degree of  importance they once had for capital acquisition and application  and, with substitute vehicles appearing on the market, continue  to be frozen in their present form. For Japanese securities  companies, which grew up on stock trading, and especially the  smaller securities companies whose very existence to a great  degree is owed to stocks, the phenomenon of the "changes in  mainstream trading vehicles" has to be termed revolutionary.    The second change could be summarized by the words "changes  in investor structure." Changes in the structure of stock  ownership, which started with the financial institutions, are  steadily manifesting this impact in what has become a topic of  daily conversation: "mutual dissolution." In what has become  symbolic of the avoidance of "financial engineering," business  corporations are increasingly distancing themselves from stocks,  and "corporations" are now a major cause of the "sell" anxiety  and are the reason for the gloomy market.    The "individual," who can substitute for the "corporation,"  in particular with "investments from household savings," calls  attention to this. In Japan the "pure investment" institutional  investors for investment trusts, annuities, and insurance, which  ought to play the role of channel between the individual and the  markets, are still weak. Household savings is an area that is  still to be exploited.    In any event, although organizational investors play a role  in this field as in Europe and the United States and are  expected to be major players in the market, the fact that the  investor structure continues to change means that the customer  structure for securities will continue to change as well.    "Changes in investment philosophy and methodology" is the  third change. The explosive drop in stock prices and the  recession have again forced investors to recognize the  importance of return on investment, of controlling risk, and of  the efficacy of diversified investments. They have stimulated  the development of new derivative investment approaches.  Furthermore, emphasis is being placed on the importance of an  infrastructure with analyst functions and research mechanisms to  make it easier to put funds to work, which in turn has given  rise to an opportunity for establishing evaluative mechanisms  for investment performance.    Securities companies require superior talent and systems in  order to cope with the development of these kinds of investment  techniques. This demands that smaller securities firms make  fresh investments.    Responding in concert and in step with the above market  changes, the fact that various securities system reforms are  being moved forward under authoritative leadership cannot be  overlooked in considering the environment of the securities  industry. Regarding this, reform to this point has had an  especially large impact in the following three ways.  1.%     1.%The entry of banks into the securities business.    2.%The equipping and activation of a debt market.    3.%The trend toward deregulation of commissions    As described above, with the current environment, which says  that there must be a debt market in order for business financing  not to be a function of the stock market, providing a favorable  climate for bank-affiliated securities companies, beginning with  the Industrial Bank of Japan, it is an extremely satisfactory  beginning that bank-affiliated securities companies are  reporting that they anticipate being in the black from the  beginning of the fiscal year.    Furthermore, with the opportunity for entry into the  management of debt underwriting by bank-affiliated securities  companies or into acceptance groups, changes in the traditional  syndication rules of the underwriting market will be inevitable.  And there has been a trend toward a formula of acceptance by  only a few leading securities companies. As a result, the  scenario has manifested itself of shutting out lower-tier  securities firms--being degraded to participating in selling  groups--which is beginning to harm medium-sized securities  companies.    Together with the anxiety that the trend toward a monopoly  by  the leading securities companies in this kind of underwriting  market, starting with debt, will extend to stocks, it is feared  that a cost differential in the purchasing of market instruments  will emerge for midsized securities companies.    Whereupon, reform of the securities system itself will be  largely toned down, with the brakes applied from the viewpoint  of protecting the securities industry and with the  intensification of the securities recession, by adopting such  approaches as "bank-affiliated securities companies will not be  permitted to transact [immediate] stocks" and "we will  investigate the deregulation of commissions once we look into  large transactions." These measures make the goals and ideals of  basic system reform vague, but have the temporary effect of  pacifying the tenacious victim mentality of the smaller  securities companies regarding system reform.  <H5>  Coping by the Smaller Securities Companies </H5>   The changes in market structure accompanying the extended  recession we have discussed thus far and the trend to system  reform in response cannot halt this trend or turn the tide, even  in the future when we see recovery from the depressed stock  market. Rather we may need to consider that the part of the  system frozen out by system reform will once again take  possession. How are smaller securities companies to try to cope  in the midst of this turmoil?    However you look at it, the trend now is to maintain  efficiency and rationalization in order to eliminate losses. Key  to rationalization is the closing of branches, reductions in  personnel, postponing new investments, and use of latent  profits. Included in this are home office transfers and  campaigns for reduced overtime as steps to an increased  drawdown. As a result, marketing costs for second-tier firms and  below have been reduced by 27-31 percent and personnel by 26  percent over a three-year period. For the midterm accounting  period of September 1993, the reduction in marketing costs was  9.4 percent and in personnel 10-13 percent.    However, despite these efforts, we find here and there  securities companies with worsening net-worth ratios, who are  consuming their latent profits, and unable to avoid losses. As  discussed above, from this point on rationalization will  accompany shrinkage in business scope and lower market share.  All the more because the situation is so serious one has to  wonder where will it all end.    For example, one must say that moves to make rapid changes  in  the character of companies in order for them to survive the  trend in market changes are inadequate. The smaller securities  firms have not trained people who either are able to deal with  derivatives or are conversant with the debt market, and for this  reason still need time and further investment. All companies  would like forward-looking, "power up" investments of this sort,  but the issue is one of a balance between this and the press of  rationalization. Furthermore, some assert they are having  difficulty setting goals, much less establishing a reform  schedule.    A variety of opinions on all aspects are being offered these  days to smaller securities firms groping for ways to survive in  the changing financial environment. What these opinions all have  in common is that these companies avoid an "integrated  securities" syndrome, determine their own customer focus, and  specialize in running individual operations. There are, in fact,  two or three good examples of owner-run securities firms. While  courageous talk is easy, in truth the going is probably pretty  tough.    When we think about this based on the above trends, the  results of system reform and internationalization, especially in  the near future, I think we will see an era of international  syndication ushered in, where, like London, Japan's underwriting  market in stocks and debt will be hybrid. Players in this will  be limited to those who employ talent and systems, namely the  top-ranking securities firms turned investment banks, securities  firms affiliated with the leading banks, and securities firms  affiliated with overseas investors. The smaller securities  companies fear being shut out of the underwriting market.    Should this happen, the smaller securities companies on  their  own will retreat from an "integrated securities approach," with  the majority probably specializing in secondary markets. One can  imagine that securities companies focusing on the secondary  market will either take the form of U.S. discount brokers with  large volume sales of securities to individuals and ordinary  investors, or will specialize in developing investment advising  with high added value aimed at special classes of customers.    The former are hoping for a large volume sales format  despite  a total deregulation of commissions, while the latter seek the  format of investment adviser, having studied the successful  earlier examples of the financial planner as exemplified by  Merrill Lynch salesmen. But they will then be expected to be  able to do commodity planning and development to meet customer  needs with the know-how to put assets to work.    Furthermore, business diversity will be indispensable to  ensure operational stability. First, deregulation of sideline  businesses such as investment advising and investment trusts is  to be expected, even if very small. Furthermore, relaxing the  regulations on dealer positions may become an issue in promoting  increased trading earnings as an earnings remedy.  <H5>  Problems Remaining for the Future </H5>   As market changes and reforms move forward, securities  companies must accommodate this trend, preferably by thinking  for the future. In order to do this, it will be necessary for  underwriters, investors, market-affiliated people, and the  authoritative leadership to join together early on, to lay out  the future image of Japan's securities markets and to state it  clearly and widely. Whereupon, should the picture that is laid  out be overly severe for smaller securities firms, perhaps it  would be best to consider a policy of additional time. A future  image would better work as a guide on which to advance reform  and rationalization among securities companies. Creation of such  an image for the future is the number-one topic demanding  attention.    It has been asserted that administration policy should shift  from a business-oriented policy to a market-oriented one. I  think that this administration policy as it should be is largely  borne out by investigation. The most important facets to a  securities policy are perhaps market regulation and protection  of the investor. In this sense, the immediate subjects for  deregulation are such things as deregulating the development of  market instruments, deregulating sideline businesses, and  relaxing rules governing dealer positions. In addition, in order  to protect the investor, it may be necessary to set in place  something like the U.S. SIPC (Securities Investors Protection  Corporation).</p>

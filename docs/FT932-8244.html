			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Venables ally comes under threat MR ALAN Sugar's attempt to undermine the powerbase of Mr Terry Venables at Tottenham Hotspur, the north London football club which the pair rescued in 1991, has turned to Mr Venables' one supporter on the board. It is understood that Mr Jonathan Crystal, a barrister who joined the board in August 1991, is to be asked to resign. Mr Sugar, who owns 48 per cent of Tottenham's shares, has made it clear that he resents Mr Crystal's influence over Mr Venables. Another of Mr Venables' associates, Mr Eddie Ashby, who has acted as a consultant at Tottenham, had his services terminated by the board on Monday. The same meeting discussed Mr Crystal's directorship - in his absence - including the possibility of holding an EGM to consider his removal. On Friday, Mr Crystal was the only board member to vote against Mr Sugar's move to sack Mr Venables as chief executive. He was later reinstated, by a High Court order, until a hearing on May 25.</p>

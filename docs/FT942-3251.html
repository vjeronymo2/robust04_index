			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium takes up LME pace-making The aluminium market picked up the baton at the London Metal Exchange yesterday as copper's surge faltered in the face of strong resistance. The white metal chalked up its ninth rise in a row, with the three months position shrugging off news of a further rise in LME stocks, to reach a peak of Dollars 1,447 a tonne, the highest level for three years. It was trimmed back by profit-taking to Dollars 1,442.25 at the close, up Dollars 15 on the day, and drifted further in after hours trading to Dollars 1,436. But dealers were still looking for more gains and some suggested that a breach of resistance at Dollars 1,450 could herald an assault on the Dollars 1,500 level. 'The fundamentals are recovering with stockpiles gradually decreasing, while demand for cars and construction is also showing signs of picking up,' Mr Yasuo Tanaka, senior account executive of the LME dealing team at Rudolf Wolff in Tokyo, told the Reuters news agency. Mr David Coutts, executive director of Australia's Aluminium Development Council, was more cautious. He said in Sydney that the recent voluntary production cuts made in the world's six major producing states to counteract over-supply had been factored into the current price. 'The price improvement has been justified until now but unless something else happens the market could react again with a negative price impact,' he warned. In early trading the copper market had looked set to build substantially on Monday's break above Dollars 2,400 a tonne as the three months price quickly climbed to Dollars 2,440. But that appeared to be the signal for a long-awaited bout of profit-taking, and by the close the price was back at Dollars 2,409.50, down Dollars 2. The reversal continued after hours, taking the market down another Dollars 20. But traders were not disheartened. 'Copper was due for a bit of a shake-out,' one told Reuters. 'The market will be healthier for this.' At the London Commodity Exchange coffee futures continued their surge towards last month's five year highs as deepening supply fears encouraged buyers and kept sellers away. The September position closed at Dollars 2,396 a tonne, adding Dollars 108 to Monday's Dollars 140 rise, after touching Dollars 2,412 at one time.  ----------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------- Aluminium           +3,850  to  2,661,525 Aluminium alloy       -140  to  31,060 Copper              -3,750  to  367,450 Lead                  +450  to  359,125 Nickel                 +18  to  131,910 Zinc                  -975  to  1,192,075 Tin                   +185  to  29,745  -----------------------------------------------</p>

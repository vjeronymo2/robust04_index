			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Madden's team goes global to fund Ontario - Capital &amp; Credit If you want to do business with the Canadian province of Ontario, one of the biggest borrowers in the international bond market, here's some important advice. Don't insist on dealing only with John Madden, the assistant deputy minister who is responsible for the province's borrowing strategy, because the rest of his team is equally important. Since his arrival at Ontario's finance ministry in late 1992, Mr Madden has concentrated on building a team approach to raising the large sums needed to fund the province's ballooning budget deficit - not an easy task when its credit rating was on the skids. An integral part of the strategy which they devised was a decision to embrace the global bond concept which became fashionable a few years ago. By so doing, the province was able to raise copious amounts through a small number of transactions. 'We have developed large, liquid benchmarks with maturities of five, seven and 10 years and these have served us well in the current climate,' Mr Madden said during a visit to London last week. Extensive pre-marketing of deals, listening to what investors want and awarding mandates on a negotiated basis rather than through competitive bidding have also worked in Ontario's favour. This year, Canada's largest province is well ahead of its funding programme, having raised CDollars 4bn of its borrowing requirement of CDollars 7.7bn. It also expects to pre-borrow a further CDollars 2bn to CDollars 3bn for next year. 'We like to stay ahead in our funding, it allows us to be flexible,' Mr Madden said. However, difficult conditions have prompted some changes to the way Ontario taps the market. 'We are having to shorten the time needed to launch a deal and we have to be careful to size and price appropriately,' he said. This was evident in Ontario's recent offering of 10-year global bonds - the size was restricted to Dollars 1bn and the yield spread of 67 basis points over comparable Treasuries was wider than the spreads on Ontario's bonds in the secondary market. But by the end of last week, the spread on the bonds was unchanged, a rare occurrence in the current climate of sliding bond prices. Although the province will continue to rely on global bonds for around 60 per cent of its funding, like many other borrowers it is becoming more dependent on private placements and structured deals. It has raised around Dollars 800m under its Dollars 2bn medium-term note programme, at 15 basis points below Libor for five-year maturities and Libor minus 20 basis points in the one to three-year area. Although Mr Madden has made it a priority to be open with the banks in order to garner their support, he has avoided becoming a sitting duck by not making them privy to risk-management decisions behind each deal. 'Everyone knows our goal is to get back into fixed-rate Canadian dollars, but we come home a different way each time,' he said. Although Ontario still needs to raise a lot of money, its debt burden should get lighter in the next few years. The budget deficit is forecast to drop to CDollars 8.1bn in the 1995-96 fiscal year, from CDollars 8.5bn in 1994-95, and to CDollars 7bn the following year. This should allow its credit rating to bottom out at current levels. Bankers, who find Mr Madden's homespun attitude of encouraging dialogue a refreshing change to the cloak-and-dagger behaviour of other borrowers, believe that his current job will not be his last. 'Although he is handling one of the largest accounts in the world, he will be looking to move on,' says one banker, adding that he would be an ideal candidate if the post of chief financial officer at a large organisation became vacant. At 38, Mr Madden has ample time to return to the private sector whence he came (a chartered accountant by training, he came to government from Beneficial Canada where he held a senior financial post). He rules out a political career, though his convincing remarks about wanting to serve the people of Ontario and making the world a better place for his children would go down a treat during any election campaign. He even tolerates the incessant flash of a photographer's camera. But wherever he ends up, one thing is sure: his future colleagues will end up believing that any successful deal is due to them, not him.</p>

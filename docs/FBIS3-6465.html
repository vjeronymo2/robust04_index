			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Somphon Thapanachai and Peter Maitri Ungphakon] </F>   [Text] Australia's Trade Minister Bob McMullen yesterday  renewed his country's calls for Thailand to grant Australians  business rights equal to those allowed Americans, and for lower  tariffs on breakfast cereals. The calls were made during a  meeting with Thai Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon and  included a request for Qantas, the Australian airline, to be  granted more landing rights and easier tax terms.    One of the issues Mr Uthai raised during the meeting at the  Commerce Ministry was a complaint about excessively tight  immigration restrictions for Thai businessmen and women, and for  students. No resolutions were reached during the meeting, but Mr  McMullen stressed afterwards that he considered the differences  to be a small part of a "rapidly growing and harmonious" trade  relationship.    Some progress was made on setting up a bilateral economic  commission, but details have not yet been completed, Mr McMullen  said. With Thai and Australian leaders due to meet again in the  next few weeks, including Australia's Prime Minister Bob Keating  -- who will visit Thailand to open the bridge across the Mekong  River to Laos next month -- an announcement on the commission  might be made in a month or so, he said.    Mr McMullen is on his first trip outside Australia since his  appointment in January. He is making a series of courtesy calls  in ASEAN before attending a meeting in Kuala Lumpur of the  Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), a regional body  representing governments, business and academics.    Australia, along with other developed countries, such as  those in the European Union, has been calling for rights equal  to those granted to Americans under the 1966 Thai-US Amity  Treaty, which allows US citizens to engage in a number of  services and professional occupations normally restricted to  Thais.    Under pressure, both bilaterally and through the Uruguay  Round of multilateral trade talks, Thai ministers and officials  have been considering whether to withdraw the special rights  granted under the Thai-US treaty or to extend the same rights to  other trading partners.    Mr Uthai said he explained to his Australian counterpart  that  the Thai-US treaty was signed when Thailand had no elected  government. The present, elected Government is reviewing the  treaty to determine whether it should be maintained, revoked or  amended. "I personally do not want to talk about revoking the  treaty because it may harm the relationship (between Thailand  and the United States). But a revision to reduce the coverage  of the treaty is necessary to make it reflect the current  situation," Mr Uthai said.    Australia also wants Thailand to reduce the import duty on  breakfast cereals from 60 percent to 20 percent. From  Canberra's point of view, this would mainly affect products made  in Australia by Kelloggs, a US company. Kelloggs wants the duty  cut so that it can better compete with Nestle's corn flakes,  which are made in the Philippines and enjoy a 6 percent tariff  as an ASEAN Industrial Joint Venture -- a programme that cuts 90  percent from basic rates for at least four years.    Thai sources say that in previous discussions, they proposed  that the Australians talk to ASEAN as a whole. They also  suggested that Australian-made breakfast cereal could be given a  different customs classification because it is made using a  different process.    The Australian national flag carrier, Qantas, wants  increased  landing rights, but the two sides differ over whether the  flights should be considered as using Bangkok as a stop-over  point for passengers or as an origin or destination point.  Qantas also desires its value-added tax [VAT] assessment to be  "zero-rated" instead of "exempt". The former would allow the  airline to claim VAT rebates for tax paid on purchases even  though no tax is paid on sales, while the latter does not  because it puts the airline outside the VAT system. The Finance  Ministry has ruled that zero rating will be reciprocal, meaning  it will be granted only to companies from countries that also  grant zero rating to Thai firms. Mr Uthai said he had told Mr  McMullen that these issues are not handled by the Commerce  Ministry but he would pass on the requests.    The two sides had prepared information for discussing  multilateral issues such as the future of the Cairns Group of 14  agricultural exporting nations, and the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) group, but Mr McMullen, who left yesterday  afternoon for Manila after less than a day in Bangkok, said  there was not enough time to discuss these matters.    He said he could discuss the Cairns Group and APEC with  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak and Mr Uthai at  the PECC meeting in Kuala Lumpur next Tuesday. Briefing  reporters at the Australian Embassy, Mr McMullen said his  priority for the year is "open regionalism" through the  development of APEC, which would be the dominant framework of  Thai-Australian relationships and such issues as the Cairns  Group. His comments reflected what Thailand and other ASEAN  countries see as Australia's aggressiveness on developing trade  and investment cooperation within APEC. ASEAN advocates a  slower approach.    Mr McMullen said he favours making the Cairns Group a  permanent body to monitor implementation of the Uruguay Round  agreements on agriculture. The Cairns Group was set up to lobby  in the Uruguay Round for farm trade liberalisation. Australia  is chairman and Thailand plays an active role. Dr Suphachai has  also said he favours making the Cairns Group permanent.    The group is to meet in Marrakech, Morocco, next month, when  the 118 participants in the Uruguay Round convene to sign the  round's agreements. Another formal Cairns Group meeting is to  be held in May in Uruguay.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng said today the Chinese Government pays close attention to  maintaining basic price stability and will take measures to  control price increases this year within the range set in his  government work report.    The just-adopted government work report has spelled out this  year's price control goal, he told a reception for Chinese and  foreign reporters.    Therefore, to stabilize prices is a common task of  enterprises and the entire society, as well as governments and  relevant departments at all levels.    He attributed price increases to a variety of factors. One  factor is that prices were raised to rationalize price relations  and establish a rational pricing mechanism in an effort to shift  to a market economy.    Other factors included an overextended scale of investment  in  fixed assets and an excessive increase in consumption funds.    It should be noted that since China initiated the policy of  reforms and opening up, "we have taken a gradual approach in  reforming the price system. In implementing every price reform  measure, we have taken in full consideration the tolerance of  the state, enterprises and the people, thus avoiding major  repercussions," he said.    "Practice shows that the approach is successful," he said.    He listed the following measures to maintain basic price  stability:    -- Maintaining a basic balance of commodities supply and  demand by stabilizing the production of grain, cotton and other  farm products;    -- Continuing to exercise macro-controls over the prices  of important commodities vital to the national economy and  people's livelihood; and    -- Taking a series of measures to resolutely control  excessive increases in fixed assets investment and the overissue  of currency.</p>

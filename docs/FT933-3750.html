			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / As they say in Europe: Insults lose sting SEPTEMBER is usually a good month for connoisseurs of conflict. September is when wars start, currencies crash and politics resume. But all those who expected a revival of cross-border rows as a natural accompaniment to mists, mellow fruitfulness, and the first worries about what is wrong with the central heating, will be disappointed by this September, a month that promised so much. September 2 saw the erection of a replica of an old statue of Kaiser Wilhelm I on the banks of the Rhine, glaring down on the battlefield of Sedan where the French took such a beating at the hands of his troops a century and a quarter ago. (The original was destroyed by the Americans in 1945 in the final assault on the Third Reich). The insult was doubled by the choice of the day - the anniversary of Sedan, which falls neatly between the anniversary of the invasion of Poland in 1939 and the Anglo-French declaration of war two days later. The British papers chortled gleefully at this appalling provocation. Nothing happened in France, though. There were no screaming editorials, just the occasional paragraph noting German protestations that the choice of the date was 'an accident of the calendar.' If you want to upset the French these days, you have to strike at the heart of the country - like suggesting that the money thrown away on farm subsidies should be reduced, or that their football teams should not be allowed to bribe their way to the European Cup. A couple of days after the affair of the Kaiser's statue, the body of Hungary's Admiral Horthy was transported from Portugal and re-buried at his home. Horthy was the man who used his friendship with the Nazis to ensure his country regained bits of other countries in which large numbers of Hungarians happened to live. In this endeavour, he had the support of his countrymen but not of his neighbours. Again, the expected explosion did not materialise. Only the Romanians got excited about the affair, but it was routine stuff by their standards. The Bucharest daily, Adevarul, put the news of the re-burial on the front page and accused Hungarian leaders of representing Horthy as a 'dedicated hero.' Others warned of the damage to 'Hungarian domestic policy and Budapests's international relations.' In Slovakia, an early Horthy target and a country where the situation of the Hungarian minority continues to spur domestic strife, the re-burial ranked only eighth on the news bulletins. This apparent apathy might, I surmised, have resulted from the fact that the Slovaks themselves were busy putting up plaques to those who collaborated with their Nazi protectors during their country's last, somewhat inglorious, period of independence. The British may well sneer at the way other nations commemorate national heroes whose sole claim to merit is that they were (as in the case of the Kaiser) not horrible or stupid like their successors or (like Horthy) someone who bore a passing resemblance to a human being in a period and region dominated by psychopaths. But 1993 is the year of the offensive memorial, and the British themselves led the way when the Queen Mother unveiled a statue of the late Lord 'Bomber' Harris in May. He was the man who master-minded the attempt to lay waste to Germany during the second world war. The memorial was probably not the result of any desire to annoy but rather a guilty feeling that Harris had been overlooked unfairly in the past. The Germans were upset because the statue appeared in 1993 and not 1946, which would have been understandable. In other words, this year is the one where the peoples of Europe feel they can again ride rough-shod over whatever sensitivities their neighbours may possess. But the odd thing is that, not only in France but also in eastern Europe, there seems a certain preparedness to react with moderation. Government-to-government relations remain reasonably civilised in spite of the pursuit of campaigns, in one country or another, to revive ancient grudges. Scarcely a day passes when the Hungarian press does not mention the tribulations of their brothers in Transylvania or Slovakia; yet, somehow, the governments rub along together. A year ago, there were forecasts that the Yugoslav nightmare would spread throughout the Balkans; that has not happened. The Greeks threatened heavens-knows-what over the Macedonian question but the swords have remained sheathed. The Bulgarians, unexpectedly, have not taken advantage of their new freedom to attack anybody and Albania has not been provoked by Serb oppression of its sons in Kosovo. Dare one think: is Europe growing up? Is it possible for one nation to indulge in absurd or offensive gestures wthout enraging others? And, if that is the case, will the indulgence now cease?

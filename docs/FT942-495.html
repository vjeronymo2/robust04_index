			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Thailand to invite power bids The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand will invite bids to build and operate 3,800MW of power generation capacity in September, hoping to attract investment of up to Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn), writes William Barnes in Bangkok. The bids will be split into a 1,000MW project to start between 1996 and 2000 and smaller projects to start between 2000 and 2001. EGAT will thereafter accept annual bids for a further 1,700MW of power generation capacity a year between 2003 and 2006. The independent operators will have to sell electricity to EGAT for distribution.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Bangemann sharply criticised THE DANISH prime minister and a prominent opposition leader have sharply criticised Mr Martin Bangemann, German member of the European Commission, for suggesting at the weekend that the European Community needs a mechanism for expelling member states which do not want to pursue further European integration, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. Prime Minister Poul Schluter said: 'I would advise Mr Bangemann to look after his own job and leave the decisions to the 12 member governments.' Social Democratic party foreign affairs spokesman Bjorn Westh labelled Mr Bangemann's remarks as 'stupid arrogance'.</p>

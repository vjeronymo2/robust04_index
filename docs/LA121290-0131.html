			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EQUITABLE PROPOSES NEW OWNERSHIP PLAN;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: TO QUICKLY RAISE NEEDED CAPITAL, THE FIRM MAY TAKE STEPS LEADING TO  A PUBLIC STOCK OFFERING.  </P> <P> Equitable Life Assurance Society, the nation's third-largest life insurer, said  Tuesday that it plans to radically alter its ownership structure in a move it  hopes will enable it to quickly raise needed capital.  </P> <P> Equitable said it plans to transform itself from a mutual insurance company, in  which policyholders essentially own most of the company, into one in which  public stockholders will be the owners. If the plan is carried out, Equitable  will become the largest U.S. life insurer to "demutualize."  </P> <P> Insurance industry analysts said the conversion most likely will take at least  two years to carry out, and possibly much longer. A formal plan must be  approved by the company's board and by regulators. It must be voted on by  certain categories of policyholders. Such conversions typically give rise to  major lawsuits.  </P> <P> But in a telephone interview, Richard H. Jenrette, Equitable's chairman and  chief executive, said the three investment banking firms that Equitable has  retained have devised a plan under which the company may use the conversion to  raise capital much sooner. Equitable hopes to sell debt securities that will be  convertible into Equitable stock once the conversion is completed, Jenrette  said.  </P> <P> Jenrette said the company -- which, like other large insurers, is facing some  significant financial problems -- hopes to raise at least $500 million in  several installments by selling such convertible notes or bonds. If the  demutualization should fail to take place, he said, the company would be  obliged to pay back investors. Jenrette said the conversion will be carried out  under a new New York state law that may allow the process to be completed  sometime in 1992.  </P> <P> The announcement follows reports about significant financial troubles at  Equitable. The New York-based company is facing major losses, in part because  of the declining value of its investments in real estate, mortgage loans and  junk bonds.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its rating of  Equitable's claims-paying ability to A from A+. The agency also lowered ratings  on insurance and debt issued by several Equitable subsidiaries. It said the  company will remain on its Credit Watch list with "negative implications" and  said its rating of Equitable's commercial paper could be downgraded soon.  </P> <P> S&amp;P said: "Today's announcement that it plans to demutualize indicates that  the company recognizes its need to seek significant external capital."  </P> <P> Concern about Equitable's financial health reached a crescendo several weeks  ago, when a rumor swirled through the financial markets that the company was  about to file for bankruptcy protection. The rumor was swiftly denied.  </P> <P> Jenrette said Tuesday that "there are some problems, but they're not  life-threatening." He added: "Equitable is not in bad financial shape."  </P> <P> Jenrette said the conversion was being carried out to give the company more  flexibility in raising capital. He said the change has been under consideration  since shortly after he became chief executive in May.  </P> <P> Analysts said Equitable's move may prompt other big life insurers to follow  suit, possibly including the two largest, Prudential Insurance and Metropolitan  Life. Many are under intense pressure to raise capital, in part because of  expected losses on investments.  </P> <P> Equitable was founded in 1859 as a stockholder-owned company. But, along with  some other New York insurers, it converted to mutual ownership in 1918 at the  recommendation of the New York state Legislature, after scandals that had  rocked the industry.  </P> <P> Insurance industry analysts William Bitterli of Northington Partners and  Frederick Townsend of Townsend &amp; Schupp, both in Connecticut, said the  conversion back to stock ownership is unlikely to have a negative impact on  policyholders, who may realize a financial gain.  </P> <P> Equitable said it plans to carry out the conversion by issuing stock to  policyholders who now have an ownership stake in the company. The policyholders  would be able to sell the stock when Equitable makes a public offering of  shares. It remains to be worked out how much stock qualified policyholders are  likely to receive.  </P> <P> Although policyholders technically own the mutual insurance companies, in  practice they have had little say over company affairs.  </P> <P> Jenrette, who came to Equitable after the company's financial problems prompted  the departure of Chief Executive John B. Carter, has some experience taking  companies public. Jenrette is a founder of the Wall Street firm Donaldson,  Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities, which was the first Wall Street firm to sell  its own stock to the public.  </P></p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Major pledges to stay on as leader Mr John Major has told close colleagues that he is utterly determined to fight any challenge to his leadership whatever the results of next month's European elections. His decision to ride out the expected Tory defeat in the June 9 poll was taken two or three weeks before the sudden death of John Smith, the Labour leader. It was followed by the strong pledges of loyalty offered by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, at the party's Scottish conference in Inverness last week. Mr Major's assurance that he will not resign has since been reinforced by the radical shift in the political landscape caused by Mr Smith's death. It ended a period in which colleagues had been uncertain how he would react to further assaults on his leadership. In earlier conversations the prime minister had left the impression that he might stand down. Ministers now hope the fall in the political temperature at Westminster will head off a disastrous performance in the European elections. Few expect the party to hold anything like the 32 seats it won in 1989, but talk of a collapse leaving it with less than a dozen seats has subsided. Private opinion polling commissioned by Conservative Central Office suggests the party might hope for a share of the vote several points above the 28 per cent it recorded in this month's local elections. In spite of the party's bitter internal strife over Europe the polls also suggest it remains more trusted by the voters than either Labour or the Liberal Democrats to handle Britain's relations with the European Union. That has strengthened the resolve of ministers to focus as much as possible during the campaign on European issues in the face of efforts by the opposition to turn the election into a referendum on Mr Major's domestic policies. The Tories' main concern is that its supporters will stage a protest vote by staying at home. The party's manifesto - emphasising the government's commitment to a decentralised free-market Europe - will be launched by Mr Major next Monday. Labour and the Liberal Democrats are expected to set out their platforms on the same day. But the formal truce in national campaigning which followed Mr Smith's death will end on Saturday when Mr Hurd will set out the basic principles underlying the government's approach. Mr Hurd, who will also unveil the party's advertising slogan for the campaign, is thought to have warned Euro-sceptic members of the cabinet not to undercut the government's positive message.</p>

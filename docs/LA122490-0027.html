			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> AN INSIDIOUS REJUVENATION OF THE OLD LEFT;  </P> <P> SOCIALISM'S DICTATE OF CLASS CONFLICT SPROUTS IN TRENDY CAUSES.  </P> <P> The Committee for the Free World, the most spirited anti-communist voice in  post-Vietnam America, closed shop this week. "We've won, goodby," explained  founder Midge Decter. The most skeptical coroner has spoken. Communism is dead.  </P> <P> Another story, however, has been largely missed: Socialism is dead, too. At a  recent gathering of the left (for a memorial tribute to radical historian  William Appleman Williams), fellow historian Christopher Lasch, with admirable  candor, said this:  </P> <P> "We have to ask ourselves whether (Gorbachev) isn't presiding not just over the  collapse of the Soviet empire but over the collapse of socialism as well. It is  all very well to argue . . . that the socialist ideal was never to be confused  with (Soviet-style) 'actually existing socialism.' But the whole point of  Marxian socialism as distinguished from utopian socialism, if anybody  remembers, was precisely that it was not merely a speculative ideal."  </P> <P> Socialism, despite what Gorbachev pretends, was never the doctrine of loving  thy neighbor as thyself. It is a political doctrine of class conflict rooted in  a rejection of private property and a faith in "social control" -- that is,  political control -- of the means of production.  </P> <P> Well, the returns are in. Socialism is a prescription for economic ruin. But if  socialism is finished, what's left of the left? Judging from its recent  activities, it is improvising well:  </P> <P> 1) Environmentalism. A natural successor to Marxism. Europe's Green parties led  the way, showing friends of the Earth the connection between opposition to  development and anti-Americanism. There is a certain shamelessness in the left  adopting the environment as its cause, considering the indescribable  environmental wreckage left by "actually existing socialism" in Eastern Europe  and the Soviet Union. Environmentalism is nonetheless the perfect escape hatch  for the left, because it enables the left to do precisely what it tried to do  under the banner of socialism: allow educated elites to tell everyone else how  to live. Social control is now asserted on behalf of the spotted owl.  </P> <P> 2) Peace. With the gulf crisis, the left (with some help from the isolationist  right) has been busy trying to revive the long-dormant anti-war movement. But  here one gets the feeling of people going through the motions, of a reflexive,  almost nostalgic anti-interventionism.  </P> <P> After all, the last time the peace movement got terribly exercised it was to  warn the world in panicked tones of the imminence of nuclear catastrophe and of  the urgent need to take nuclear weapons out of the hands of Ronald Reagan. Now  that a Third World adventurer and thug, a man who has used weapons of mass  destruction in the past and has pledged to use them again, is about to get his  hands on a nuclear arsenal, the anti-war left can find no "just war" reason to  disarm him.  </P> <P> This is more than inconsistency. This is bad faith. Hence, I suspect, the  weakness of the peace movement so far.  </P> <P> 3) Deconstruction, a.k.a. the Balkanization of America. This is the major  project of the left in the universities, the monastic refuge to which, like a  defeated religious order, the most radical left has retreated. How to undermine  a culture it cannot abide? By attacking its most central values: the idea of a  common Western culture and the idea of a common American citizenship.  </P> <P> How? By proclaiming and championing a new oppressed -- no longer the bloated  and ungrateful working classes, but a new class of selected ethnic and gender  groups. Blacks, Latinos, women, homosexuals, Native Americans -- the list is  long, the bids are open -- are now wards of the left.  </P> <P> In their name is launched an all-out assault, first, on America's cultural  past. As John Searle points out in the New York Review of Books, the demand is  not just for an expansion of the West's cultural canon to include works by  women or people of color, but the destruction of this canon as representative  of a white male-dominated system of cultural oppression.  </P> <P> So much for Western Civ. The other attack -- on common citizenship -- consists  of the division of Americans into a hierarchy of legally preferred groups based  on race and gender. From Canada to Lebanon, every other multi-ethnic society  that has attempted such tribal stratification has come to grief. The left,  helped by a nobly motivated but intellectually bankrupt "civil-rights  community," would march us just that way.  </P> <P> Of the three projects, Balkanization is the most serious. America will survive  both Saddam and the snail darter. But the setting of one ethnic group against  another, the fracturing not just of American society but of the American idea,  poses a threat that no outside agent in this post-Soviet world can match.  </P></p>

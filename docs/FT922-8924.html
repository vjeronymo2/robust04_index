			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / People: Steeling up on non-execs The rapid rise of Tony Pedder in the British Steel hierarchy is confirmed by his appointment to the main board at the relatively youthful age of 42. Pedder is one of three younger career steel men promoted to an increasingly elderly boardroom just a few months before Sir Robert Scholey, the 70-year-old chairman, retires. Pedder, who joined the group in 1971, is the most senior of the three new faces joining the board. He was made managing director of British Steel Stainless in November 1987 and in October 1991 moved to be managing director British Steel Commercial and Distribution. Harold Homer, the 51-year-old managing director of British Steel General Steels, and John McDowall, the 50-year-old managing director of British Steel Strip Products, have also been promoted to the board. McDowall, a Scotsman, began his steel career at Ravenscraig in 1967, and Yorkshire-born Homer joined the Park Gate Iron and Steel Company in 1957. Apart from reducing the average age of the 16-strong board, the arrival of the three new executive directors means the boardroom is no longer dominated by non-executive directors.</p>

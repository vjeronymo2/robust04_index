			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (1): The portable revolution - Portable computers have matured in the past few years, though there is still a long way to go. 1994 seems set to be the year of the subnotebook computer and suppliers are enthusiastic about the potential of the market Competitors in the Whitbread Round The World yacht race, now in Auckland preparing for the fourth leg of their 32,000-mile journey, can attest to the power of portable computing. Every boat in the race is fitted with a notebook PC as the terminal for its satellite-based communications system. Information - weather data, for example - can be transmitted and received from anywhere in the world. The computers automatically transmit daily reports on each yacht's location, direction and speed to the race office in Southampton. Appropriately enough, the maker of the notebooks, Toshiba of Japan, is sponsoring one of the leading boats. Electronic notebooks are light, robust and reliable enough to withstand the rigours of an ocean-going yacht race. That is powerful testimony to the way that portable computers have matured in the past few years. There is still, however, a long way to go. Power is still the biggest drawback. Even with the most advanced chemical technology and the best power management systems, battery life is only a few hours and the machines are too heavy for comfort. Remarkable computing power can be shoehorned into a notebook. Tadpole Technology, a UK-based electronics group, has managed to build a notebook computer with the power of a Sun workstation. It has designed a notebook workstation for IBM which will be launched soon and is likely to develop notebook workstations for other US manufacturers. Today, notebooks have for the most part displaced the larger, heavier laptop machines as the portable computers of choice. 1994 seems set to be the year of the subnotebook computer as manufacturers compress powerful systems into pocket-sized packages and their customers devise new ways of computing on the move. The portable revolution is being driven by the needs of business. Over 90 per cent of the UK's larger companies already use portables to some degree. For some companies they are simply small, light substitutes for desktop machines. But for most, they have become an indispensable tool for field workers - salespeople, inspectors and engineers. (Inevitably, the backlash has started. Some people worry that portables could become the computer equivalent of an 'electric fork', an unkind term for an gadget that works as well whether the power is on or off. They argue that glitzy technology is no substitute for old-fashioned business discipline.) What counts as a portable computer? Definitions can often seem to be mere semantics as the lines between categories blur, but there are at least four distinct kinds. 1: Notebooks. Battery or mains powered, these are typically the size of a sheet of A4 notepaper and weigh less than three kilogrammes. They have full-sized, backlit displays and full-sized keyboards and at least 80 megabytes of hard disk storage. A further refinement may be a 'docking station' which converts the notebook into a desktop system. Most PC manufacturers now offer a range of notebooks with proprietary features to distinguish them from the competition. IBM, for example, eschews conventional mouse or trackerball systems in favour of a keyboard mounted strain gauge - 'Trackpoint' - for cursor control. 2: Subnotebooks. Again, these are battery or mains powered. They are the size of a paperback book and weigh a kilogramme or so. Subnotebooks are already available from, for example, Olivetti of Italy and Tulip of Holland. They have back-lit displays, adequate if tiny keyboards and are capable of running the latest version of Microsoft's Windows. Olivetti's Quaderno has a digital sound recorder built in. 3: Palmtops. These - for instance Hewlett-Packard's 100LX or the Psion Series 3 - are described as 'unconsciously portable' and are small enough for a user to carry at all times. The HP machine is preloaded with Lotus 1-2-3 which can be called up at the press of a button. 4: Personal digital assistants. This is a new category, which includes the Apple Newton, the EO 440 and the IBM Simon, handheld devices which combine computing power with communications capabilities. Suppliers are enthusiastic about the potential of the market. Mr Nick Eades, IBM UK's brand manager for portable computing, says that growth in the portable market has been 'phenomenal' this year. Mr Lewis Schrock, Compaq's director of product marketing, foresees an explosion of different categories of machine as the market fragments. 1993 was not a bonus year for every PC maker, however. Dell Computer, a pioneer of direct marketing and the third largest US personal computer maker, recorded its first ever quarterly loss after being forced to abandon a poorly conceived line of notebook PCs. Mr Glenn Henry, Dell's former chief technologist, said the abandoned range was simply not competitive. Dell had not thought through its mobile computing strategy, he said. The company has now formed an alliance with Sony of Japan and is expected to return to the portable market with competitive products this year. Calculating the size and growth rates of the global market for portable computers is difficult. It is a comparatively new market and the principal market research companies are still analysing their figures for 1993. There is little doubt that overall world shipments in 1993 came to about 6m units, 3m in the US and 1.5m each in Europe and Japan. Mr Bruce Stephen, of the US-based company IDC, says preliminary worldwide indications are that Toshiba and Compaq are running neck and neck for first place in portable computers, with Apple Computer in third place. Toshiba and Compaq both use MS/DOS and Windows as their operating system, while Apple continues to use its own, unique System 7. Compaq was the the market pioneer for portable computers in the 1980s, but was slow in following Toshiba into the notebook sector. The absolute numbers, however, are not as important as the growth prospects (four desktop computers were sold for every portable last year). Worldwide, growth in notebooks and subnotebooks in 1994 is expected to be 20-25 per cent, well ahead of the 6 per cent or so expected for the computer industry as a whole. The significance of the sector is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that technology developed for portables is beginning to make its appearance in desktop machines. Examples include power management and PCMCIA cards. Batteries based on lithium technology can give twice the power for the same weight but portable computers are power-hungry. Smart software has been devised to minimise power requirements, essentially by turning off parts of the computer that are not active. Exactly the same technology can be used in desktop machines to reduce power consumption and give a more environmentally friendly or 'green' system. A few watts of power saved per machine can add up when a company with several thousand PCs leaves then on continuously. PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card Manufacturers International Association) cards are the size of a credit card and can be slipped into any computer with a PCMCIA slot. They offer the functions of network adaptors, modems and disk drives. It is possible, for example, to build a 1.8 inch 340 megabyte hard disk drive into a PCMCIA card. Some argue that the establishment of the PCMCIA standard will prove as important to portable computing as IBM's PC design was to the desktop computer business.</p>

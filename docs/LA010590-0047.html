			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRANSMITTING AIDS  </P> <P> Question: Is it possible for one woman to give the virus that causes AIDS to  another woman while having sex?  </P> <P> Answer: Transmission of the AIDS virus from one woman to another is very rare,  but it has been reported. Transmission may occur as a result of the exchange of  blood either during menses or as a result of trauma.  </P> <P> For Thomas, Charlottesville, Va.: Regardless of the temperature, you should not  work on your car in a garage with the doors closed. Carbon monoxide can do a  lot more damage than simply causing a headache.  </P></p>

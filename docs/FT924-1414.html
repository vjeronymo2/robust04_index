			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Case on council swaps is settled out of court THE first of a batch of nine lead cases between banks and councils over interest-rate swap agreements has been settled out of court. This is the latest in a steady stream of settlements since the House of Lords ruled such contracts invalid in January last year. The ruling left 80 banks facing losses of about Pounds 560m. They have since sought to recover about a quarter of their losses by suing councils for restitution of funds paid under the swap contracts. A report in Local Government Chronicle suggests that the rest of the nine lead cases may not now come to court following the settlement of the first group of six lead cases last year. The case in question, between Birmingham City Council and SG Warburg, was due to go to court in January. The amount of the settlement has not been disclosed. Warburg's writ involved three swap agreements and one forward-rate agreement, but the claim mainly concerned one swap. Warburg was trying to recover a Pounds 5m principal payment and Pounds 5m in interest. The leading cases, due to go to court in January, are now Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, which is claiming Pounds 1.15m from the London Borough of Islington, and Kleinwort Benson which is claiming Pounds 360,000 from Sandwell, West Midlands.</p>

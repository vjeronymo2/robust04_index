			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UN opposes Cuban embargo THE United Nations general assembly last night called for an end to the US embargo against Cuba, imposed some three decades ago when the government of Fidel Castro seized billions of dollars' worth of US assets, Michael Littlejohns, UN Correspondent in New York, and Agencies report. Canada and Mexico, parties to the new free-trade agreement with the US, were among 59 states voting for the measure, which Cuba drafted. The US vigorously canvassed against the resolution but was rebuffed largely because of new legislation signed by US President George Bush last month which extended the embargo to foreign sub-sidiaries of US corporations and foreign commercial shipping. Many countries that might otherwise have sided with the US moved to the sidelines, including EC members. There were 71 abstentions and only Israel and Romania sided with the US. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, has been asked to prepare a report on implementation of the resolution in time for next year's assembly session. Unlike mandatory Security Council resolutions, assembly decisions are not binding.</p>

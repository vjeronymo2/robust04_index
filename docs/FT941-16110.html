			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Feltrim Names seek further talks on offer Leaders of the Feltrim Names, one of the largest groups of lossmakers at Lloyd's of London, are to seek to reopen negotiations with the insurance market's council in an attempt to improve the terms of last month's Pounds 900m settlement offer. In a letter sent to 2,000 Names, the committee of the Feltrim Names' Association said it could not recommend acceptance. But it stopped short of outright rejection, encouraging hopes that Lloyd's may still be able to settle legal actions by more than 17,000 of its Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - before they reach court. Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the association, said: 'The offer is not good enough to accept, but it is not so dreadful. I'm confident that it can be improved upon.' A total of 22,921 Names have until February 14 to vote on a proposal which offers the great majority of them less than 40p for each pound of losses. The Feltrim Names Association will meet next week to determine its stance. Members are legally bound to vote on the settlement in line with their association's position. Another large group of loss-makers - members of Merrett syndicate 418 in 1985 - will meet today to determine their position, while a third one - the Gooda Walker Names - assembles next week. In its letter the Feltrim Names committee says that its members taking legal action are being offered Pounds 236.7m, equivalent to 39.5 per cent of their losses. The committee estimates that it could obtain between Pounds 310m and Pounds 425m in legal action, although it says other costs such as legal fees would have to be deducted from this amount. In addition, the insurance funds available to meet payouts on this scale could be reduced as a result of successful legal claims by other lossmakers. The offer 'is sufficiently near to the lower end of the range of resources available to meet any judgment that it must be given serious consideration,' says the letter. At the same time the committee is critical of the absence in the settlement offer of any 'cap' on liabilities that might accrue to the Feltrim syndicates in the future. 'The requirement by Lloyd's for accepting Names to give up all their legal rights and remedies whilst leaving you with residual liabilities for deterioration seems to us to be manifestly unfair as well as extremely dangerous for members,' it says.</p>

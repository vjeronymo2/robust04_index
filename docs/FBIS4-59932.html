			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- In a statement to  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Ma'n  Abu-Nuwar has denied that Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali submitted his resignation to the Jordanian monarch, as  claimed by some local papers recently. He said that the  repetition of such rumors is a matter of speculation by some  people, and that the decision in this connection is up to the  king.    Abu-Nuwar did not rule out the possibility of a cabinet  reshuffle after 'Id al-Adha, saying that: "The reshuffle is up  to the prime minister. That is possible if he sees a need for  it."

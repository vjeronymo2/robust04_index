			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU CAN HELP: SHE'S 'SWEATERING' OUT THE VEST SOURCE  </P> <P> Corrine Brawley of Anaheim is looking for sleeveless sweater vests made by  Milrank, but can't find them anywhere. Do you perchance have a source or so up  your sleeve, or will Brawley not be able to join the vested interests until she  slows down the arms race?  </P> <P> Lee Fink of Van Nuys is in the market for some doormats made of hemp woven over  slats of wood. Can you help before Fink wonders whether we're trying to do him  dirt, or will he just have to scrape by while stubbing his toes on some  inferior product?  </P> <P> M. J. Sturges wants to get hold of a dental bowl with a lid that hold false  teeth in a cleaning solution; he remembers some with names such as Mom, Pop and  Grandma. Can you come up with a few sources for Sturges to sink his teeth into,  or will he have to chew on the fact that all his efforts have not made a dent  toward a solution to his problem?  </P> <P> With the hot months upon us, Pat Heinemann of Whittier would like to get her  hands on a sturdy, portable battery-run fan that will fit into a woman's purse.  Can you help take the heat off Heinemann, or will she just have to sweat out  the situation because people may think her breath-taking request is full of hot  air?  </P> <P> Reader-to-Reader Help Line: Marguerite at (818) 990-1848 would love to send  someone a Hungarian-language birthday card, but where to find them? Realizing  that this request is strictly from hunger, please steppe on it before  Marguerite has to make a (buda)pest of herself. . . . Richard at (619) 273-9351  needs replacements for a Model 65-7A Sunbeam toothbrush, which has been  discontinued and is not compatible with its successor model. Please don't give  Richard the brushoff by gumming up the works.  </P> <P> Note: The Reader-to-Reader Help Line is only for one-time items or for products  no longer available in stores. And you must give us written permission to  publish your telephone number, so that others may contact you directly.  </P> <P> For Frances Vose of Moorpark, who wanted a small electric ice crusher, we have  one retail source. Peggy Mantz of Ojai says she saw some of these crushers at  Deb's Collection, 900 E. Ojai Ave., Ojai, (805) 646-3993. We also heard from  several readers who wouldn't mind giving their ice crushers the cold shoulder.  If Vose is interested, we'd be happy to put the addresses on ice for her.  </P> <P> For our many readers who are always looking for out-of-print and/or  difficult-to-find books, we now have a source in the San Fernando Valley. Rose  and Jerry Blaz of the BOOKie Joint, 7246 Reseda Blvd., Reseda, Calif. 91335,  have informed us that they specialize in used hardcovers and paperbacks,  magazines and comics; they also offer a search service that attempts to locate  books. The telephone numbers are (818) 343-1055 and (818) 345-2983.  </P></p>

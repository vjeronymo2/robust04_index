			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Germany disrupts the flow of traffic: Cabotage and the EC's single market AN Italian lorry driver sets off from Milan with a truckload of white goods and delivers them three days later in Edinburgh. Faced with the prospect of driving an empty truck back to the Continent, he would jump at the chance to pick up a load of whisky and deliver it to London on his way. But single market or no single market, he cannot do so under EC rules - unless, that is, he has the necessary permit. The free movement of goods and services, one of the basic preconditions of the single European market, has a hollow ring about it when it comes to road haulage in the Community. Three months into the new era of supposedly unrestricted trade, hauliers still cannot ply for hire within other countries' borders except under a quota system. The harmful effects of this lack of accord spread far beyond the haulage industry itself. Up to 20 per cent of lorry mileage in the EC is estimated to be empty running. If more efficient use were made of the vehicle fleet, transport costs would fall and the problems of congestion and pollution could be sharply reduced. As it is, long-running negotiations over liberalising the haulage regime have become bogged down in an argument between member states over road charges: an argument that will continue today as EC transport ministers meet in an attempt to reach a solution. Taken by itself, the issue of cabotage - EC jargon for the right to ply for hire in another's territory - might not have proved particularly controversial. Although some member states were concerned about the possible impact on their domestic haulage industries, all would probably have agreed on a gradual transition to a liberalised regime. Progress was blocked, however, when Germany linked the issue to a much wider debate about whether member states should be allowed to charge other countries' lorries for the use of their roads. Germany's complaint was that its geographical position at the heart of the EC meant it was bearing by far the heaviest burden of international road traffic. As a result, it needed to invest large sums in roads. German lorry owners were already contributing towards the cost through heavy annual road taxes, it pointed out. In contrast, vehicles from other countries were not only getting free access to Germany's roads, but in most cases paying much lower annual road taxes in their own countries too. The solution Germany proposed was to require all lorries using its motorways, whether German or international, to pay an annual fee of up to DM9,000 (Pounds 3,800) for a licence or vignette to be displayed in their windscreens. At the same time the road tax on German lorries would be reduced. The proposal caused uproar in the EC and was ruled unlawful in 1990 by the European Court on the grounds that it would be discriminatory. But Germany continues to insist that there can be no deal on cabotage without an agreement on road charging, too. At first sight, the row over the German scheme may appear inexplicable: tolls, after all, are already found on many EC motorways and bridges. But the difference between these tolls and the German road charges is that existing tolls were introduced to pay for specific pieces of transport infrastructure. The German charges, in contrast, were seen as a general tax. Conceivably, the German plan would have attracted less opprobrium had it not been linked to reductions in the annual road tax for German lorries. But with other countries also looking for new sources of revenue to meet the rising costs of providing transport infrastructure, road charging has now turned into a significant issue in its own right. Germany apart, several countries - France, Spain, Italy and Britain, for example - favour road charging under certain conditions. Some of the smaller member states, however, are deeply suspicious of the idea on any terms. Among them are countries like Ireland that are dependent on transit through a neighbouring country (in this case, the UK) for access to the rest of the Community. Others say if every country adopted the German scheme, the consequences could be farcical: drivers crossing the EC would need so many vignettes they would be unable to see through their windscreens. The smaller member states want to see a uniform system under which everyone needing access to other EC countries' roads would pay the same annual fee, and the money collected would be distributed to EC countries according to how much international traffic they carried. That plan, however, runs into two obstacles: it would look like the imposition of a common tax at EC level, and the allocation of the funds would cause perpetual rows. Where the debate will end, nobody knows. Ultimately, the ideal would be for lorries to be charged according to whose roads they used, not according to the country they were registered in. But the technology needed to achieve that goal is complex - and the politics, more complex still.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Hungary torn between gentleman and the jackboot: The ruling party is facing a far-right challenge HUNGARY'S political stability and that of much of central Europe could hinge on the outcome of the congress of the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum which begins today in Budapest. Three years after Mr Jozsef Antall led his party to victory at Hungary's first free elections, the moderate prime minister faces a struggle for the soul of the party against right-wing nationalists led by Mr Istvan Csurka. The ultra nationalist writer is seeking to swing the forum away from the moderate conservatism, which has attracted foreign investors, towards a more assertive nationalism tinged with xenophobia and anti-semitism. He hopes to capitalise on voter dissatisfaction with the results of economic reform to date, popular demands for the punishment of former ruling communists and nervousness about rising anti-Hungarian sentiment in neighbouring states where more than 3m ethnic Hungarians live. The latest opinion polls show that the forum, which gained around 25 per cent of the vote but 43 per cent of the parliamentary seats in the 1990 elections, is now supported by only 8 per cent of the electorate. Mr Antall is expected to argue that the party must strengthen its appeal as a party of the centre if it is to retain its position at the heart of Hungarian politics and keep Hungary an island of tranquility in an increasingly volatile region. That means winning back voters nostalgic for the lost security of the communist years, competing with the youthful Fidesz party for the younger vote, and convincing waverers that the liberal economic reforms, and open-door policy for foreign investment, are the only ways to ensure a return to the stable growth which will raise incomes and reduce unemployment from present politically dangerous levels. For months Mr Csurka has been waging his campaign for a radical right-wing shift in the forum's policies through an unremitting barrage of essays and pamphlets. The most famous was a fiercely nationalist, anti-semitic diatribe thrown into the still pond of the August summer holidays. He called on the HDF, and Hungarians at large, to resist a conspiracy of Jews, communists, liberals, journalists and bankers who threatened Hungary's identity. He also re-awakened the debate over the future of the 3m ethnic Hungarians who now live outside the boundaries drawn by the 1920 Treaty of Trianon which deprived Hungary of two-thirds of its former territory. He provided ammunition to anti-Hungarian nationalists in neighbouring states by referring to Hungary's Lebensraum, a term coined by the Nazis for territorial expansion. To crown it all, he urged Mr Antall, who is ill with cancer, to resign. Most recently Mr Csurka has turned his guns on the western companies which have invested more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) in Hungary over the last three years, more than in any other east European country. One bizarre allegation gives a flavour. Westerners, through their agents in the press, had inspired the recent outbreak of pig-plague so they could snap up Hungarian meat processors cheaply, he alleged. The nationalist writer's eccentric rhetoric, far from condemning him to the margins of politics, has strengthened his position. However, Mr Antall is unwilling to jeopardise the stability which he prizes so much by breaking with Mr Csurka, because this would split his party, cause the loss of its parliamentary majority, and open an electoral second front on the right of the forum in the 1994 elections. Yet the prime minister is acutely sensitive about the damage to Hungary's international reputation caused by Mr Csurka's continued role in the governing party. Mr Antall's own background in the Hungarian gentry gives him little in common with Mr Csurka's crude populism. The prime minister's moderate supporters hope that their command of the party leadership and control of the agenda will allow them to head off any challenge from the floor. The far right plans to strengthen its influence by making gains at the expense of moderates in the policy-making 20-man party praesidium. But Mr Antall yesterday threatened to resign if the the praesidium elections did not confirm his moderate line. The main question for Mr Antall and his supporters is not so much how to prevent Mr Csurka's supporters either taking over the party or leaving it, but how many policy concessions the prime minister will have to make to keep the party together until the elections. Pessimists fear that the governments pre-congress purge of alleged liberals from the state-owned radio and TV, one of the Csurka nationalists main demands, could well be a harbinger of things to come. But Mr Antall is expected to survive as party leader and prime minister of a country which is well aware that a hardening of nationalist rhetoric in support of ethnic Hungarians across the present frontiers could bring Balkan-style tensions to the borders of western Europe and dash hopes of the prosperity which lies tantalisingly around the corner.</p>

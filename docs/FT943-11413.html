			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Confusion over compliance move Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for financial advisers, has become involved in an apparent misunderstanding with one of its members - Knight Williams - over the need for stronger compliance measures. The regulator said it had suggested that Knight Williams' compliance function should be strengthened with a senior appointment that had its approval. However, Mr John Williams, Knight Williams managing director, said the recent appointment of Mr Colin Pinnell, formerly head of legal services at Fimbra, to oversee its legal and compliance department had 'nothing to do with any suggestion from Fimbra,' which had 'never said to us that we should strengthen our team'.

In the second round of presidential elections, which are due  in May, 1995, Rocard would score 42 percent against 58 percent  for Balladur, said the Louis Harris poll for the weekly VALEURS  ACTUELLES. But Rocard improved his score by four points on a  similar poll carried out a month ago while Balladur lost four  points.    If the contest was with Chirac, Rocard would win 44 percent  of the vote against 56 percent for Chirac, the poll said. The  figures were identical to last month's.</p>

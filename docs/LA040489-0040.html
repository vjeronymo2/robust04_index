			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREDIT;  </P> <P> REPORTS THAT ECONOMY IS SLOWING GIVE BONDS A LIFT  </P> <P> Bond prices strengthened Monday, although they were knocked off their highs of  the day by central bank action to reduce the value of the dollar.  </P> <P> The Treasury's key 30-year bond rose $3.13 per $1,000 in face amount and its  yield, which moves inversely, fell to 9.06% from 9.09% late Friday.  </P> <P> The central banks' dollar sales were more effective than usual because the Bank  of Japan joined in the dollar-lowering efforts after a long absence from  intervention.  </P> <P> Finance ministers of seven major industrialized democracies said Sunday after a  meeting that they would combat the dollar's appreciation by selling the  currency in coordinated intervention.  </P> <P> Bonds held their gains for awhile after the dollar began its descent but  eventually weakened, said Marilyn Cohen, an analyst at Capital Insight Inc. in  Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> An outlook for a declining dollar makes investors reluctant to invest in  dollar-denominated securities as well as raising the risk of inflation spurred  by more costly imported goods.  </P> <P> The bond market was helped by a report the National Assn. of Purchasing  Management released over the weekend that suggested economic growth slowed  significantly in March.  </P> <P> The report further eased fears of inflation and higher interest rates, which  hurt the value of fixed-income investments such as bonds.  </P> <P> Another report released Monday by the Commerce Department showed construction  spending remained unchanged in February, viewed as another signal the economy  is slowing.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-, medium- and  long-term governments rose about 1/4 to about 3/8 point, financial information  service Telerate Inc. reported.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a  $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, rose 4.07 to 1,124.77.  </P> <P> In corporate trading, industrials also strengthened. Moody's investment grade  corporate bond index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with  maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.92 to 299.07.  </P> <P> In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal  bonds rose 1/4 point to 90 1/4. The average yield to maturity dropped to 7.78%  from 7.79% late Friday.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded  at 9.875%, down from 10% late Friday.  </P></p>

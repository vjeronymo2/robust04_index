			<p>BFN     [Text] President Denktas concluded his contacts in Turkey  and returned to north Cyprus this afternoon. In a statement to  the correspondents at Ercan Airport, he said that he had found  an opportunity to make useful assessments of the latest  developments on the Cyprus problem with the government officials  in Turkey. Denktas said:    [Begin Denktas recording] We had an opportunity to assess in  detail the latest developments on the Cyprus problem with  President Suleyman Demirel, Speaker of the National Assembly  Husamettin Cindoruk, and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. As far as  I can see, we tend to agree on contining the talks if the rights  and powers that have been gained at the Vienna talks are  included in the document, dated 21 March, or if the inclusion of  the gains in that document is accepted. However, the decision  on the matter will be made by the Turkish Cypriot people.  Turkey will support the decision we make, be it in favor or  against. Considering the fact that not much time is left, I  shall ask the Council of Ministers to meet and discuss the  situation as it is seen from Turkey's viewpoint. If we can  adopt a decision, then we may brief the political party leaders  early tomorrow morning. Or, we may hold a joint meeting to try  to adopt a decision. [end recording]    A correspondent recalled Greek Cypriot Leader Glavkos  Kliridhis' statement that the process on the package of  confidence-building measures [CBM's] has ended. Denktas said:    [Begin Denktas recording] The Greek Cypriots say that Christ  is resurrected once every year. The package will not be dead as  long as we do not both agree that it is so. Nor will the  package be valid if we do not jointly say that it is. In fact,  no agreement can be reached if we do not jointly reach  reconciliation. It would be good if they realized that state of  affairs. They have to reach an agreement with us for  reconciliation and peace in Cyprus.    They may unilaterally say that the package is dead. Well, it  is not dead. We are holding talks on that package. Gustav  Feissel, the UN Secretary General's deputy special  representative, informed us at our latest meeting with him that  the UN officials would look into the matters we brought to their  attention and would reply to the Turkish Cypriot side. How can  the package now be dead? Talks are still being held on it.    We discussed the matter in detail with the officials in  Ankara. It was observed that we had overlooked this or that  point. I do not wish to expound on them. However, I wish to  say that either an effort is made in good faith to achieve a  result or the package is declared dead at a certain point. That  is what Kliridhis has done.    No one can accuse us of delaying the matter. The past two  months have been lost; it has been described as a delay. How  was that period lost? It was lost because they [UN officials]  changed the CBM's package in Kliridhis' favor, regardless of the  fact that Kliridhis and I had agreed to it right at the  beginning. Considering the changes, we have tried to establish a  balance. The process of establishing a balance caused a delay.  Had they not changed the package that we agreed to at the  beginning on the condition that nothing should be changed in it,  we would not have lost any time in the process. I wish to  reiterate that Feissel informed us at our latest meeting that we  are right and that they will look into the matter.    Why did we hold talks in Vienna? They were reluctant to  establish a balance in the package which they themselves had  violated. However, they suggested that we should hold talks in  Vienna. We went to that city. Why did they suggest that we go  to Vienna if the results to be achieved in that city were not to  be regarded as having strength and being valid? Why did they  ask us to go to Vienna and spend funds if the results were not  to be included in the package? Certain agreements were reached  in Vienna. We have asked that they be included in the package.  However, we have been informed that the UN Secretary General is  holding his pen and is about to submit his report, which will  blame the Turkish Cypriot side. Well, what shall we do? You  must agree. To What should we agree? You must agree to a  package that has shortcomings and has not been balanced. That  is an injustice to the Turkish Cypriot side.    Therefore, Kliridhis has described the package as a dead  document. Well, the person who has described it as a dead  package is probably able to resurrect it if he wishes to do so.  However, we demand that the matters agreed on in Vienna be  included in the package. We shall be ready to continue the  talks if these things are included in that document. If they  are not included, then it is up to them to decide what to do.  [end recording]</p>

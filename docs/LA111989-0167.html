			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SOME FAMILIAR NAMES VIE AT ASCOT ON THANKSGIVING  </P> <P> The usual sprinkling of Indianapolis 500 veterans and a familiar generational  continuity reflect the kind of tradition that surrounds the 49th running of the  150-lap Thanksgiving Night midget auto race at Ascot Park on Oct. 23  </P> <P> In this event, where 70 drivers will attempt to keep perennial favorite Ron  Shuman of Tempe, Ariz., from victory circle, the Indy ranks will be made up of  Rich Vogler of Indianapolis, Billy Vukovich III of Coursegold, Calif., Stan Fox  of Janesville, Wis., and Johnny Parsons of Brownsburg, Ind., from recent grids.  </P> <P> And in a field that follows some of the biggest names in auto racing, who have  been at Ascot or its predecessor tracks since the Turkey night race began at  Gilmore Stadium in 1934, Vukovich represents the best of a third generation.  Grandfather Bill got a Thanksgiving win in 1948 and father Bill, Jr., had three  seconds.  </P> <P> Parsons would like to emulate his father, Johnnie, who won in 1955. Also  youthful P.J. Jones hopes to try and match the success of his dad, Parnelli,  who won in 1964 and 1966. The series has had one father-son duo on its victory  list with Tony Bettenhausen (1959) and son Gary in 19677 and 1970.  </P> <P> However all those names -- and people like A.J. Foyt, Mario Andretti, Sam  Hanks, Johnny Rutherford Rodger Ward and Jones (Indy 500 winners who have  started in this event) -- didn't match the modern exploits of Shuman. The  latter, better known for prowess in sprint cars, has won six times in the last  10 years. And, in that span, his laps led -- 663 out of 1,000 -- is more than  all the other contestants combined.  </P> <P> This year, Shuman is coming off a third place in 1988 and will be most  concerned with Vogler and defending champion Chuck Gurney, who will team in a  pair of Arias-powered machines entered by Larry Howard of Murrietta, Calif.  </P> <P> Four of Shuman's six wins came in Howard-owned midgets. When Vogler broke a  jinx on Ascot's half mile with his first victory in the midget half of the  Pacific Coast Nationals, it was in a Howard machine.  </P> <P> For Gurney, a repeat would cap a season that has seen him win the Belleville  (Kan.) Nationals, midget racing's richest event and the United States Auto Club  national championship for Silver Crown (championship dirt) cars.  </P> <P> Two other former Turkey night champions, Kevin Olson of Machesney Park, Ill.,  and Brent Kaeding of Campbell, Calif., along with Southern California's two top  pilots -- Sleep Tripp of Costa Mesa and Robby Flock of City of Industry.  </P></p>

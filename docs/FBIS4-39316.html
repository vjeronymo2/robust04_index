			<p>BFN     [Text] There are no problems in Russian-Kazakh relations  which could hamper their integration, Kazakh Foreign Minister  Kanat Saudabayev said in an interview with Interfax. Saudabayev  is now in Moscow on a non-official visit.    For instance, he said that there were no problems concerning  the Russian-speaking population in Kazakhstan since this  amounted to 95 pct of the Kazakh population.    Saudabayev stressed that there was no alternative to the  process of economic, political and cultural integration between  Russia and Kazakhstan.    Today Saudabayev discussed increased cooperation between the  two countries with Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council  Ramazan Abdulatipov. Saudabayev announced that they had agreed  that the legal basis for the integration had already been  established or was being established. The goal now is to make  it concrete.</p>

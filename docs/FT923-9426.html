			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / India takes ballot box into political vacuum: The government is insisting on elections in Kashmir where no structures exist IN THE state of Jammu and Kashmir, where armed separatists have been fighting a bloody war with Indian security forces for nearly three years, virtually no civil administration or political structures exist. Yet the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao has decided to hold elections there. The decision is regarded with grave scepticism in Srinagar, the state capital. Militant groups have warned against participation. Mr Girish Chandra Saxena, the governor, admits that there was a sharp spurt of violence after the government's intention to hold elections became clear last month and recently advised New Delhi that the situation was 'not yet conducive' to hold them. 'Elections are the only solution to the Kashmir problem,' said Mr Rao at the weekend. 'In a democratic country, how long can we keep a state away from the election process?' However, he is reluctant to set a date. 'I cannot say now when the election will be held. But once it is held, the situation will greatly improve.' At a time when Kashmiris are questioning the basis of their accession to India in 1948, elections within India's constitutional framework are perceived as an attempt by New Delhi to sidetrack the real issue. Kashmir has been the main obstacle to peace in the sub-continent for 45 years, with both India and Pakistan claiming a territory which, many Kashmiris believe, belongs to neither. The people of the mountain state have been demanding a United Nations-supervised plebiscite promised to them by the Indian government in 1948. India, which holds that Kashmir is a domestic problem, has fought three wars with Pakistan to retain Kashmir and has an estimated 400,000 army and para-military troops in the state, a considerable drain on its exchequer. News that elections were imminent led to an escalation of violence through July, after a lull from April to June. During the week that Mr Rao assured parliament in mid-July that 'certain conditions of peace' had been achieved in the valley, the official death toll was 99. Srinagar, which has turned from a tourist destination to a war-zone in three years, suffers long hours of curfew and daily killings, as security forces fight a ruthless battle. Often it is the hapless civilian population which suffers more than the heavily armed militants. Cordon-and-search operations, meant to 'flush out terrorists' are often excuses for the security forces to wreak revenge on innocent people for militant attacks. Women and children are not spared. The authorities managed to hold back the security forces to some degree in the early months of the year. But in the last few weeks, several instances of men in uniform going berserk have been reported. Eighteen people died on the day home minister SB Chavan made a whistle-stop visit to the valley, flying in and out amid top security, and not venturing out of the high-security zone into the city. The minister's gunmen sprayed civilians with bullets when a car tyre burst, killing six. Despite the violence, the government sees political advantages in proceeding with elections. The ruling Congress party is increasingly perceived to be in tune with the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party on the Ayodhya temple issue and on its reformist economic policies. A seemingly liberal policy on Kashmir would help Mr Rao to dissociate his party from the BJP, which takes a hard line against separatists. Elections might also be seen as a way to reassure the insecure Moslem minority by conveying the impression that democracy was being restored in India's only Moslem-majority state. An elected local government would allow the Rao government to share the responsibility. 'India wants to fire their guns from someone else's shoulders,' said Mr Javed Mir, commander-in-chief of the pro-independence Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF). However, elections could also provide a much-needed rallying point for militant groups in search of a common ideological platform. Logistically, elections in the foreseeable future seem virtually impossible in a state where militant organisations such as the JKLF and the pro-Pakistan Hizbul Mujahideen can paralyse the entire Kashmir valley by declaring a 'civil curfew'. A senior bureaucrat in Srinagar says: 'Nobody here believes that an election will help, but even if they did, does the government expect people to come out and vote when they risk being shot in the back?' He recalls the last general elections in 1989, when a militant group placed television sets as 'rewards' for voters at the entrance of some polling booths and coffins at the exit. The militants' message was heeded, even at a time of relative peace. Given a lack of willingness to vote or to stand as a candidate, the credibility of elections would be in doubt. Elections seen as a means to foist a government on to an unwilling people could only intensify separatist tendencies. 'The government's being adamant that elections will be held here, is only further proof for us that India is not interested in Kashmir,' says a bank manager. 'They are only trying to pull the wool over the world's eyes, and pretend they are a great democracy.'</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS TAKE OBSERVER SEAT AT GATT TALKS FOR 1ST TIME  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, stepping up its drive to integrate into the world economy,  took a seat as an observer at GATT today for the first time since the 96-nation  trade forum convened more than four decades ago.  </P> <P> The ruling council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade agreed to  Soviet observer status after Washington and Tokyo dropped objections, and  Soviet Ambassador Evgeny Makeyev was immediately ushered to a seat in the  group's assembly chamber.  </P> <P> Diplomats said the White House may have been trying to send a positive signal  to Moscow ahead of a superpower summit in Washington in two weeks, at a time  when doubts are being raised on whether the two sides can agree on a strategic  arms pact.  </P> <P> "I think there's a general desire to see the summit go well," one Western  diplomat said.  </P> <P> Makeyev expressed Soviet interest in becoming a full member of GATT and said  Moscow is also studying what kind of relations would be appropriate with other  institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  </P> <P> "This (observer) status offers to the Soviet side an opportunity to get  acquainted with the methods of work of various GATT bodies for studying the  conditions of a future accession to GATT," he told the trade forum's council.  </P></p>

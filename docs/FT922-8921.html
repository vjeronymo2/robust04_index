			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / People: Pretty moves to Kwik Save Derek Pretty, 44, who resigned from his position as group finance director of Budgens in January, has turned up in the same position at discounter Kwik Save. Chief executive Graeme Seabrook says Pretty was 'clearly the best candidate' the headhunters produced. Acknowledging that his departure from Budgens was 'one of the question marks I had', Seabrook admits he checked him out thoroughly. However, he found that 'Derek clearly arrived there after the damage had been done, and did a pretty good job trying to sort it out'. A year into Pretty's Budgens stint, institutions forced out the chief executive, and ushered in another set of managers. Seabrook established that 'the new team simply had one finance guy too many'. Pretty's retailing experience, which spans J Sainsbury, Waterstone and Kingfisher, appealed to Kwik Save in its search for a replacement for Simon Moffat who departs for Hillsdown Holdings. Seabrook describes Pretty's new assignment mainly as 'keeping the show on the road. Moffat has spent the last 18 months successfully bedding down the various parts of the job'. Before Moffat, Kwik Save did not have a group finance director.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Feature comprising leaked document attributed to </F> "`Russia-Ukraine-Crimea' independent expert group," plus  comments from Ukrainian Embassy counselor, "independent  consultant" Oleg Rumyantsev, Russian Foreign Ministry, and  Russian intelligence officer: "`Likely' Plans of Unlikely  Adversary"]    [Text] The document that has come into the possession of  the editorial office is bound to evoke contradictory comment.  Is it a forgery? Another attempt to sound out public opinion?  A practical joke?    The latest sensational leak -- everyone is still talking  about the scandal over the notorious "Theory No. 1" -- may well  prove to be a canard. But the situation in the  Russia-Ukraine-Crimea "triangle" is too serious for us to ignore  the confidential document we have received.    About a year ago the Ukrainian Defense Ministry elaborated  plans for landing Ukrainian troops in the Kuban and the Don  which are to be implemented "in the event of an exacerbation or  destabilization of the situation in Russia and a deterioration  in relations between Kiev and Moscow to a critical point."    Back then the Ukrainian leadership began to take measures to  create arms systems designed for mass destruction. In  particular, the Pavlograd chemical plant was set the task of  organizing the production of more efficient missile fuel on the  basis of technological documentation obtained from Russia's  "Soyuz" Production Association. At the same time the Yuzhmash  plant has been developing production of tactical missiles, an  experimental batch of which was to be produced in the first  quarter of 1994.    A number of chemical and biological institutes received  additional funding and instructions to step up work to develop  binary chemical and bacteriological weapons. The Cybernetics  Institute (Kiev) and the "Monolit" MPO [expansion unknown]  (Kharkov) began work to study the possibility of recoding the  guidance system of the strategic missiles stationed in Ukraine.    In December 1993, concerned at the situation in  Russian-speaking areas of Ukraine, Kravchuk instructed the Kiev  Psychology Institute to carry out secret sociological studies in  the Donbass, Odessa, Nikolayev, Kherson, Kharkov Oblast, and the  Crimea, which established that between 50 and 80 percent of the  population of these regions advocates unification with Russia or  a transfer to its jurisdiction. This prompted the start of the  personnel reshuffle among the leadership of power [silovoy]  structures and the stepping up of work to staff them according  to ethnic and nationalist principles. In west Ukraine,  particularly in Lvov, paramilitary camps and volunteer militia  detachments began to be set up under the control of the local  security services; according to certain of their members, they  are being readied in order to "smash the Muscovites soon" (the  reference is to pro-Russian citizens of Ukraine).    At the same time Kravchuk and his team attempted via the  pro-Ukrainian lobby in the U.S. Congress to secure support for  their position regarding Russia, as a result of which they  received assurances and approval from Washington for vigorous  action with respect to Russia, the Black Sea Fleet, and  especially Crimea and Ukraine's Russian-speaking population.  During his U.S. visit in March 1994 Kravchuk allegedly received  confirmation of this.    In late March 1994 the upper echelons of power and  Ukraine's power structures actively worked on former Crimean  Supreme Council Chairman Bagrov to get him to agree to lead the  pro-Ukrainian nationalist movement in the republic in opposition  to the Crimean president.    Meanwhile the movement of firearms and other weapons to  Crimea, intended primarily for the Crimean Tatars living on the  peninsula, from Chechnya was begun via structures in opposition  to the republic's president and taking part in deliveries of oil  and petroleum products to Crimea.    On 23-24 March 1994 Ukraine's security organs received  instructions whereby Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet stationed in  Sevastopol were categorized as prime targets of intelligence and  counterintelligence interest. In view of this they were set the  task of carrying out operational monitoring of the political  situation in the region, setting up contacts with the opposition  to the Crimean president and total monitoring of the command and  personnel of the Black Sea Fleet, and forming in Crimea,  especially in Sevastopol, operational combat groups made up of  pro-Ukrainian, opposition, and nationalist elements.    The ultimate aim of all these actions is to declare a state  of emergency on the peninsula, introduce direct presidential  rule by the Ukrainian president in Crimea, and declare the  extraterritoriality of the Black Sea Fleet and then make demands  for the withdrawal of the Russian troops. At the same time it  is believed in Kravchuk's immediate entourage that the Black Sea  Fleet problem should be solved through its simple forcible  seizure by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.    The most "convenient" and likely pretext for starting to  implement this plan may most likely be the staging of a  provocation in Crimea during the holding of the "nationwide  poll," resulting in mass disturbances providing legitimate  grounds for an "appropriate" reaction by Kiev.    As a result of an assessment of the development of the  economic and political situation in Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea  the U.S. National Security Council concluded that the  preconditions had emerged for the formation of another "trouble  spot" in the CIS capable of destabilizing the situation in the  Black Sea region.    On the basis of this, they worked out the following as one  of  the most probable scenarios for the development of events in the  region favorable to transnational companies:    Subjective factors will not make it possible to begin normal  dialogue between Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea. In these  conditions Crimea independently holds a referendum and announces  its secession from Ukraine. Ukraine declares a state of  emergency in Crimea and moves in its troops. Then a clash  begins between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian movements in  Crimea, and the troops of the Black Sea Fleet are inevitably  drawn into the conflict. Russia is forced to intervene  vigorously in the process, as a result of which the two states  become involved in a military conflict.    It is very noteworthy that the Americans are currently  taking  specific steps to secretly evacuate members of the families of  embassy officials from Russia by May and to introduce  restrictions on travel both to Russia and on the territory of  Russia by U.S. citizens.    [Signed] "Russia-Ukraine-Crimea" independent expert group    [Dated] 15 April 1994  <H5>  Ukrainian Embassy's Reaction </H5>   Vadim Dolganov, counselor at the Ukrainian Embassy to  Russia:    Neither the embassy nor any other official Ukrainian organs  are going to comment on this document. This is all nonsense.  But it is rather dangerous. What is assembled here can be  gleaned from the Russian mass news media.    I myself come from Kharkov. The document says that between  50 and 80 percent of the oblast's residents advocate  reunification with Russia. That is nonsense! It is simply  impossible to comment on it. But, once again, this nonsense is  tendentious. That is, you can discern a clear attempt to drive  a wedge between eastern and western oblasts of Ukraine, which  are indeed different in their ethnic composition, and to play  the "Crimea card." But, you know, the problem is that the  people who are staging this whole thing fail to understand a  simple thing, or maybe they do understand it -- you could swap  Ukraine and Russia around in these dirty documents. And you  could say the same thing about Russia.    What is most terrible is that such material is appearing at  a  time when the Ukrainian and Russian leaders are beginning to  reach agreement on some complex problems.    Consultant's Viewpoint    Oleg Rumyantsev, president of the Russian Foundation for  Constitutional Reforms and independent consultant on Crimea:    It is difficult to say that this document is totally  accurate. However, when I was executive secretary of the  Constitutional Commission I traveled to Crimea at the invitation  of a number of public associations to find out the attitude  taken by Crimea's residents to the draft Russian Constitution  and the prospect of restoring our unity (August 1993). At that  time I received from extremely well informed sources data  partially reminiscent of this.  <H5>  Russian Foreign Ministry's Opinion </H5>   We were told in confidence by the Russian Federation Foreign  Ministry that no information that Kiev is working on tactical  missiles or binary weapons has been officially received by  Moscow.  <H5>  Special Services' Commentary </H5>   We learned from a confidential conversation with a senior  officer of Russia's intelligence organs that they very carefully  studied the U.S. CIA's secret report to President Clinton  regarding the situation in Ukraine. This report fell into the  hands of the British press by unknown means. Some of its theses  chime with the text of the document published today.    Representatives of Russian intelligence services displayed  particular interest in those passages in the CIA report  analyzing Ukraine's economic position and concluding that, if  the present rate of development of the crisis is maintained, the  republic may split up within two years, leading to the emergence  of several new state formations which will possess nuclear  weapons. On the whole, the source noted, the U.S. intelligence  agency's conclusions largely coincide with the Russian experts'  assessments. Moreover, it was learned recently that Ukrainian  military specialists are attempting to decipher the launch codes  of intercontinental missiles.    The source also added that he agrees with the U.S. report's  conclusions regarding the possibility of a social explosion in  Ukraine. Clashes between the Russian-speaking population of  eastern oblasts and the west Ukrainians cannot be ruled out  here. The source believes that Russia should relax the economic  pressure on Kiev and be more flexible in its approach to the  problems of Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet.</p>

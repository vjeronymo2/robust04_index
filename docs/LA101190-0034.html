			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: HE HAILS C.A.B.S  </P> <P> I'm a C.A.B. man. This has nothing to do with my preferred method of  transportation. It has to do with my preference for Angus beef over the meat of  most any other breed.  </P> <P> C.A.B. stands for Certified Angus Beef, a program that guarantees -- better  than any other beef-grading program today, including that of the U.S.D.A. -- a  consistently high quality of beef. The program, which was established primarily  for the restaurant trade, came into existence in 1978, two years after the  U.S.D.A. lowered its standards for Choice beef. Restaurants need top-quality  beef; many of them build their reputations on it. The C.A.B. program helps  assure them of a consistent supply of good beef.  </P> <P> Today about half of the beef that comes to market is graded by the U.S.D.A.,  and about 90% of this is graded Choice. But of that number, more than 70% falls  into the lowest acceptable marbling range for the grade. In contrast, Certified  Angus Beef accepts only the highest two marbling levels (the upper 30%) of the  U.S.D.A. Choice grade, from carcasses of Angus-type cattle.  </P> <P> Recently the folks at C.A.B. decided to put together a book, "The Art of  Cooking With Certified Angus Beef," containing recipes prepared by 36  world-class chefs who rely on C.A.B. in their restaurants.  </P> <P> My favorite recipe from this fabulous collection is Cowboy Steak with Red Chili  Onion Rings, the creation of Mark Miller of the Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe. I have  followed him from the Fourth Street Grill in Berkeley, to the Santa Fe Bar and  Grill in Berkeley to Santa Fe, New Mexico where I think he's found a home.  </P> <P> If you like this dish as much as I did, you will enjoy "Coyote Cafe: Foods From  the Southwest," a new book by Miller.

Place on barbecue rack over  medium-high heat and grill to desired doneness, about 7 minutes per side for  medium rare. Transfer to plates. Drain Salsa and spoon onto steaks. Serve  steaks immediately with Onion Rings. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Salsa  </P> <P> 2 small red onions, diced  </P> <P> 2 pounds tomatoes, cut into 1/4-inch dice  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons fresh lime juice  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons finely chopped seeded jalapeno chiles  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons olive oil  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Cover red onions with water in large bowl and let soak 1 hour. Drain  thoroughly. Transfer to medium bowl. Add tomatoes, lime juice, cilantro, chiles  and olive oil. Season to taste with salt. Toss well. Cover with plastic wrap  and chill until ready to serve. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.)  </P> <P> Onion Rings  </P> <P> 4 white onions, sliced into 1/16- to 1/8-inch-wide rings  </P> <P> 3 cups milk  </P> <P> 3 cups sifted flour  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chili powder  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons cornstarch  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon salt  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon ground cumin  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons sugar  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons Hungarian hot paprika  </P> <P> Oil for deep frying  </P> <P> Cover onions with water in large bowl and let soak 1 hour. Drain thoroughly.  Combine milk, flour, chili powder, cornstarch, salt, cumin, sugar and paprika.  Mix to blend. Dredge onions in flour mixture, shaking off excess.  </P> <P> Heat oil in deep fryer or heavy saucepan to 375 degrees. Add onions in batches  and cook until golden brown, about 45 seconds. Drain on paper towels. Serve  immediately.  </P></p>

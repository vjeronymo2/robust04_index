			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Anger among backbenchers over pit closures unlikely to lead to revolt ANGER AMONG Tory backbenchers over the latest pit closures is unlikely to result in any significant revolt in the Commons, Ivor Owen writes. Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, MP for Batley and Spen, who was one of the four Tory MPs who voted against the government when the issue was debated in March, yesterday directed her main criticism at British Coal. She accused it of not doing enough to take advantage of the subsidies offered by the government when it sought to secure a reprieve for 12 of the pits threatened with closure. Mrs Peacock said she intended to contact Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to discuss whether the government could take any further action. Mr Winston Churchill, the Conservative MP for Davyhulme, who abstained in the March vote, said he would have gone into the lobby against the government had he known how the situation would develop. He criticised Mr Heseltine for failing to exert his authority by 'telling the generators that they must not run down their coal stocks'. Any further opportunity for MPs to vote on pit closures is likely to arise only if the shadow cabinet decides to initiate a debate on the issue.</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Anti-dumping study sidelined for 90 days: The latest move over a political embarrassment THE Democratic chairman of the International Trade Commission has sidelined for at least 90 days a controversial study of the US anti-dumping and countervailing duty regime and its impact on the American economy. Mr Don Newquist, head of the agency which determines whether US companies have been injured by alleged dumping and subsidies, has written to Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, asking him to confirm that the new administration of President Bill Clinton wants the study to go ahead. He claims that budget pressures, and questions from a congressman, have prompted his call for a review. Mr Jim Kolbe, a Republican congressman, has written to Mr Kantor to protest against Mr Newquist's 'unilateral decision' to delay the study. He has complained that Mr Newquist has misconstrued comments he had made to justify delaying the investigation. He claims that Mr Newquist's letter does not properly reflect the fact that he was highly supportive of it. Mrs Carla Hills, the former trade representative under President George Bush, waited until five days before she left office to ask the ITC to mount the two-year study of the effects of 'unfair trade' cases on the consumers, producers and workers. Mrs Hills' timing remains a mystery. Just eight months before leaving office, she specifically omitted the issues of dumping and other 'unfair trade' from a study on the economic effects of American import restraints. She is likely to have been well aware that a study into the effects of dumping would be potentially embarrassing for President Clinton, pitching powerful domestic industries such as cars, steel and textiles (which are traditionally strong Democratic supporters) against US exporters and consumers, all of whom have to pay higher prices because of such duties. Many foreign companies and trade lawyers in Washington see the laws as inherently biased against foreign defendants. Mr Newquist has said he will take up the investigation if he does not hear from Mr Kantor in 90 days. Otherwise, he will follow the trade representative's recommendation. He said the commission was facing personnel and budget reductions in conjunction with the administration's attack on the budget deficit. Mr Kantor, as one of the few officials who can order ITC investigations, was asked to comment on the requested study 'in light of our resources. . . and the other priorities you may have'. Among those 'other priorities' are studies on trade in mackerel and durum wheat, and recent investigations of magnetic switches, the peas and lentil industries, and the trade in meat and live cattle with Canada. The political implications of the study will not be lost on Mr Kantor, who was the president's campaign chairman and frequently expressed sympathy with 'the people standing on the unemployment line' who have no interest in 'abstract lectures about the value of free trade and exports'. Mr Kantor's recent comments suggest he regards the US dumping and countervailing duty regime as providing 'a fair hearing process'. He said recently: 'Forty nations of the world have dumping laws; I would say the US process, both in terms of fair hearing and transparency, is probably as good as or better than any process in the world.'</p>

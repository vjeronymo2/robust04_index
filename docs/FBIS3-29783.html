In welcoming Ajit Singh and his wife, Cam said Vietnam-ASEAN  ties saw rapid and constant development in recent years,  culminating in Vietnam being accorded observer status at ASEAN  ministerial meetings for the past two years. Ajit Singh, who  had the honour of being the first state guest this year, was  received at the newly-renovated government guest house in Le  Tach Street.

Ajit Singh and Cam later  adjourned for closed-door talks at the same venue.    Earlier, while waiting for Ajit Singh, Cam told reporters  they would discuss [words indistinct] Vietnam cooperation in  training and communications, among other things. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Betterware makes Pounds 14m but warns on outlook Betterware, the direct home shopping group, yesterday reported a 3 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits held back by lower interest receipts and the absence of a large exceptional gain in the year-ago period. Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 14.1m in the year to 26th February, up from Pounds 13.7m the previous year. This was broadly in line with forecasts which had been sharply reduced during the year after the founding family sold some of its stake and interim results showed a marked slowing of its UK sales growth. Turnover grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 63.2m (Pounds 56.3m) underpinned by a 14 per cent increase in UK sales which grew to Pounds 50.5m and a fourfold increase of sales in France to Pounds 2.8m. The pre-tax figure was struck after net interest receipts of Pounds 823,000, down from Pounds 1.14m in the year-ago period. Profits in the year-ago period were inflated by an exceptional Pounds 1.53m VAT credit. Earnings per share increased to 9.4p (8.4p) helped by a lower tax charge of Pounds 4.39m (Pounds 5.14m.) A proposed final dividend of 1.95p (1.5p) makes a total for the year of up 30 per cent to 2.6p (2p.) The shares closed 5p lower at 123p. Mr Walter Goldsmith, chairman, said it had been 'a challenging year' but that Betterware had emerged stronger as a result of a series of steps including the opening of a new Pounds 10m distribution centre near Birmingham, the strengthening of the senior management and further expansion in Continental Europe. Operating profits increased by 5.5 per cent to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 12.5m), but excluding the VAT refunds, underlying operating profits grew by 19 per cent. UK margins were higher helped by a greater emphasis on product development. The UK average order level held steady at around Pounds 8 compared with Pounds 13 in the French operations which were started two years ago and made around Pounds 300,000 in profits last year, and Pounds 10 in Spain where Betterware began door-to-door sales in September. Mr Andrew Cohen, chief executive, said the group plans to begin operations in Germany and will invest about Pounds 1m. COMMENT The group has a twin strategy for maintaining margins and growing sales in the maturing UK market. It is driving down costs by designing more efficient tools for its outsourced manufacturing while trying to encourage its customers to spend more by offering free give-aways with larger orders. The real engine for growth should be continental Europe. Pre-tax profits are likely to edge up to about Pounds 14.5m this year, producing flat earnings of some 9.5p. A year ago Betterware was a soaraway stock trading on a forward multiple of 24, but the shares have fallen sharply in the past 12 months as the reality of slower UK growth sunk in and the Cohens sold some of their shares. They are now trading on a mundane prospective p/e of 12.9, a cautious rating reflecting challenges at home and abroad.</p>

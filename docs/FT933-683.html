			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Arts: A Bernstein birthday concert Leonard Bernstein, who would have been 75 last August, was much loved by the London Symphony Orchestra, one of the European musical organisations with whom he maintained a regular connection almost to the end of his life. The 'Bernstein Anniversary Concert' which the LSO and its chief conductor, Michael Tilson Thomas, gave at the Barbican Hall on Sunday was a way of reminding us all, players and audience alike, how much the connection meant and, nearly three years after his death, how vitally it endures. It was a touching, convincing and for the most part thoroughly enjoyable way. The mixture of the most familiar of Bernstein's works (West Side Story in its concert suite) and those less so (the concert suite from his last opera, A Quiet Place, and the song-cycle Arias and Barcarolles) was nicely judged. More confidently and completely (I believe) than any other non-US orchestra, the LSO has gained mastery over the Bernstein idiom, especially since Mr Tilson Thomas has been at their helm. Rhythmic articulation is unfailingly spring-heeled. There is no faint-hearted holding-back in the utterance. The LSO brass, whose contributions were all evening a source of roof-raising excitement, showed this particularly in the 1949 Prelude, Fugue and Riffs, with its cunning interweave of jazz, both the Big Band variety and the bluesy, and contrapuntal ingenuity. The danger of their overwhelming the clarinet soloist (the excellent Andrew Marriner) was avoided by only the narrowest of margins - and the less-than-ideal Barbican acoustics tend anyway to work their clotting effect on big, loud climaxes - yet the feeling of dangerously heady exhilaration was, if anything, thereby increased. Bernstein's musical language still does not appeal to everyone. Arias and Barcarolles (1988), most of its eight songs on modestly good-humoured texts by the composer himself, strikes a vein of rueful tenderness - the theme is love marital, parental and domestic, freely but sometimes questioningly felt  -that some critics (particularly British ones) still mistake for sentimentality. It was originally written for voices and two pianos. A first orchestration for strings and percussion (1989, by Bernstein and Bright Sheng) had the effect of enlarging the canvas, not to entirely positive end. On this occasion a new scoring (by Bruce Coughlin) for full orchestra was given its first outing: the enlargement process is taken still further, and every ounce of the soloists' artistry was required to sustain intimate contact with the audience. As these were Frederica von Stade and Thomas Hampson, singers with beautiful voices capable of displaying kaleidoscopic shades of colour and verbal nuance, contact was indeed sustained. But I hope their success in doing so, comprehensive and delightful at it was, will mislead no-one into considering the original, piano version of Arias and Barcarolles now superseded: it remains infinitely truer to the spirit of the work.

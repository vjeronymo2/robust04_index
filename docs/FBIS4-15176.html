			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs has disclosed that  on Wednesday he had a telephone conversation with Swedish Prime  Minister Carl Bildt, in which the Swedish leader was cautious  about the order from Russian President Boris Yeltsin [on  establishing military bases], and expressed the supposition that  Russia could revoke the document, as has repeatedly happened  with Russian statements. At a news conference Birkavs said that  recently Russia has adopted resolutions testifying to its  unwillingness to normalize relations with Latvia: For example,  it has decreed very unfavorable customs tariffs for mutual  relations and high levies for the use of roads.

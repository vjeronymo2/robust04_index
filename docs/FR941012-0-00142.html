			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the final rule, OSHA is clarifying its intention that the employer bears the burden of proving that personnel other than the machine operator who are in the loading or unloading area are essential to that activity. OSHA notes that this is a case-by-case determination that requires the employer to evaluate the needs and conditions present at the time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(6)(iii) of the final rule requires that no transport vehicle operator remain in the cab during loading and unloading if logs are carried or moved over the cab, unless the employer demonstrates that it is essential for the operator to be in the cab. This provision also requires that when the transport vehicle operator remains in the cab during loading or unloading operations, the employer must provide operator protection such as, but not limited to, reinforcement of the cab. The proposed rule specifies that no transport vehicle operator remain in the cab during loading and unloading unless the employer demonstrates that it was necessary for the operator to be in the cab. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA received many comments on this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). Several commenters stated that there were so many situations in which it is essential for transport vehicle operators to be in the cab or on the vehicle during loading and unloading that the exceptions would overwhelm the rule (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). For example, commenters said that self-loading logging trucks must be operated by the driver from an elevated seat above the cab (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36). In other loading operations the operator is required to move the transport vehicle back and forth in the loading chute to position the log on the load (Ex. 5&hyph;34).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters said that the cab may be the safest place for the transport vehicle operator to be during loading and unloading (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;34). One commenter said that greater hazards were posed for the operator when not in the cab (Ex. 5&hyph;34). For example, the operator outside the cab can be struck by logs that fall off the load or come out of the jaws of the loading machine, or by the loading machine itself. This commenter pointed out that in the State of Washington there have been numerous fatalities and serious injuries reported when the operator was outside the cab, but none reported when the operator was in the cab (Ex. 5&hyph;34). As such, this commenter said that many logging establishments will only permit logs to be unloaded if the transport vehicle operator is in the cab (Ex. 5&hyph;34).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes the record shows that in some situations the safest place for the transport vehicle operator will be in the cab (e.g., Ex. 4&hyph;129). The WIR survey appears to support this position, in that only three percent of all injuries reported involved mobile equipment (Ex. 2&hyph;1). By contrast, almost one-fourth of all injuries reported resulted from being hit by a tree or falling in the work site. However, there are some hazards to operators who remain in cabs during loading and unloading. Any time logs are carried or moved over the cab, it is possible due to equipment failure or operator error that the log could fall on the cab and seriously injure the operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In other standards OSHA has recognized the hazard of carrying loads over people. These standards include requirements that material handling equipment operators avoid this practice ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  29 CFR 1910.179, 29 CFR 1910.180, 29 CFR 1910.181). In many new self-loading trucks, the hoist mechanism is behind the cab, a location which prevents the movement of logs over the cab (Ex. 5&hyph;71). In other situations, however, logs are still moved or carried over the cab. It is not safe for the operator to be in the cab in those situations. Therefore, when logs are carried or moved over the cab, the final rule requires that the operator not remain in the cab if the employer has not demonstrated that it is essential for the operator to do so. If it is essential for the operator to be in the cab when logs are carried or moved over the cab, the employer must provide protection for the operator. The final rule states that this protection includes but is not limited to reinforcement of the cab.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

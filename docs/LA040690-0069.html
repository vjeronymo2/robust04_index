			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT TIME;  </P> <P> SUIT OVER WATCH BATTERIES IS WOUND UP AFTER 11 YEARS  </P> <P> John DeTomaso, a cargo employee for Pan American World Airways, thought he had  a good idea on how to make a few extra bucks. So, in 1978, he paid $300 for  unclaimed merchandise that the airline stored in bins and periodically sold to  the public sight unseen.  </P> <P> In the luck of the draw, two of his bins contained a surfboard, Indian-style  costume jewelry and cheap clothing, he said. Another bin contained 13,000 watch  batteries.  </P> <P> Those batteries generated a legal dogfight between DeTomaso and Pan Am that  dragged on for 11 years in California's courts.  </P> <P> The case went through 25 judges, four arbitration panelists and two different  juries. Along the way, one judge died and one of the attorneys, who spent  thousands of hours on the case, retired.  </P> <P> And the legal paper work generated by both sides filled five Bekins moving  boxes and two file cabinets.  </P> <P> "I still don't believe it's over," said DeTomaso, who this week received a  check from Pan Am for $118,931.44, bringing to an end a suit he brought against  the airline in Los Angeles Superior Court.  </P> <P> "And I don't quite understand any of what happened, including the 44 cents,"  the 46-year-old Torrance resident said.  </P> <P> Pan Am attorney George Henzie said the case became so bizarre that at one point  DeTomaso "even blamed his appendicitis on Pan Am. . . . It was the kind of case  that leads lawyers to retire early."  </P> <P> DeTomaso had no idea what would lie ahead of him that September day when he  took delivery of the cargo bins and set out to sell the batteries. DeTomaso  said he had little success until a store clerk suggested he try a big  electronics firm.  </P> <P> In one of those twists of fate that change people's lives, he called Texas  Instruments in Dallas.  </P> <P> "I told this woman (at Texas Instruments) that I had 13,000 watch batteries,"  DeTomaso recalled. "And she says to me, 'Gee, we are missing 13,000 watch  batteries.' "  </P> <P> It wasn't long before Pan Am's director of security and an FBI agent showed up  at DeTomaso's front door. He showed them the cargo bin of watch batteries that  was stored in his garage.  </P> <P> Pan Am confiscated the batteries and fired DeTomaso, but the FBI dropped the  matter, saying it had no jurisdiction.  </P> <P> DeTomaso then filed a grievance through his union demanding that he be  reinstated.  </P> <P> During a grievance hearing, it was brought out that the batteries had been  flown by Pan Am from Hong Kong to Los Angeles, where they were to be sent to  Continental Airlines for delivery to Texas Instruments. But somehow they ended  up in the abandoned cargo pile.  </P> <P> The airline said the employee purposefully took a wrong bin, but DeTomaso  denied the allegation, saying it was pointed out by a cargo supervisor.  DeTomaso produced three canceled $100 checks he had used to pay for the cargo,  as well as a copy of the inventory slip listing the batteries.  </P> <P> DeTomaso was eventually reinstated, but he sued Pan Am for $8,000, the amount  he claimed he could have made had he sold the batteries.  </P> <P> "They said, 'Nuts to you,' " said Robert Cleaves, DeTomaso's attorney. "They  wouldn't even give him the amount he paid for the bins, $300."  </P> <P> DeTomaso claimed in his suit that he suffered emotional distress and defamation  of character -- alleging that he had been humiliated in front of his son and  ignored by his co-workers.  </P> <P> In 1983, a Superior Court jury awarded DeTomaso $265,000 in general damages and  $300,000 in punitive damages. But Pan Am appealed, and the verdict was upheld  by state a Court of Appeal. Pan Am dug in its heels again, appealing to the  state Supreme Court.  </P> <P> The justices threw out the award, ruling that under the federal Railway Labor  Act, DeTomaso could only challenge the airline's alleged emotional abuses  through union grievance arbitration.  </P> <P> However, the state Supreme Court gave the green light for DeTomaso to sue Pan  Am for the value of the batteries it had taken from him.  </P> <P> The case was retried and in 1988 the second jury decided that the airline had  sold property to which it did not have title. Jurors awarded DeTomaso $4.50 for  each battery, plus interest.  </P> <P> Once again, Pan Am appealed.  </P> <P> "We raised 12 legal grounds for the appeal and I'm still firmly convinced that  they were all correct," said Henzie, who by that time had taken over the case  for another partner.  </P> <P> Last month, the state Court of Appeal upheld the second jury verdict.  </P> <P> DeTomaso said he plans to retire in two years after 25 years with Pan Am and  use the money for real estate investments and to start a ceramic tile  contracting business. "I've never quite felt that I belonged since it  happened," he said.  </P> <P> Said Pan Am's attorney Henzie: "We thought it very unfair that he was permitted  to recover more than double what you can buy those batteries for, $1.99 from  Radio Shack."  </P> <P> But DeTomaso disagreed.  </P> <P> "The batteries each cost $5 plus tax," he said. "I had to buy one last week for  my daughter's watch."  </P></p>

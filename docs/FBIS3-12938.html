"Much as the Sudan favours a cease-fire and a complete  cessation of hostilities, previous experiences have shown that  treating the issue of the cease-fire separately is a futile  exercise", the foreign minister told a press conference in  Kampala.    Abu-Salih who arrived in Uganda from Kenya on Friday, with a  message from President 'Umar al-Bashir to Preesident Yoweri  Museveni said, Khartoum believes that fighting is not a solution  to war. "We want a just and genuine peace in the Sudan", he  said. He claimed that much of the fighting in the southern  Sudan is betwen the rebel factions themselves and tribes hostile  to the rebels.    The foreign minister who returns back to Kenya Saturday said  Sudan fully supports peace initiatives by the four heads of  state in the Inter-Governmental Authority on Desertification and  Development (IGADD), the objectives of which is to reach a  negotiated peaceful settlement of the civil war in the southern  Sudan.    "These countries sharing the same borders with the Sudan,  being fully knowladgable of the root causes of the problem, are  better placed to help bring about the desired peaceful  settlement", he said. He added however, that proper  negotiations should be consucted by his government and the  rebels to reach a peaceful settlement.    The Khartoum [as received] in 1992 launched the latest  massive military operation against the southern rebels led by  the SPLA which accused the central governmment of trying to  Islamise the entire country.</p>

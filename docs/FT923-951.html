			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Set fair for progress: Middle East peace talks have adjourned on an optimistic note but with no breakthrough If there is one person who encapsulates the state of the Middle East peace negotiations, which adjourned yesterday after a month of talks in Washington, it is Ms Bushra Kanafani, Syria's spokeswoman. Ms Kanafani is canny, cautious and clipped as befits the secretive, ruthless regime she represents. But the severity of old sometimes gives way to a lighter tone, even to good-natured bantering with Israeli journalists. 'You know we have a saying that before it rains it must become cloudy,' she said this week. 'But it is not cloudy yet, so I cannot expect rain tomorrow.' So it was that the first round of peace talks held since Mr Yitzhak Rabin came to power in Israel in July, pledging to accelerate the peace process, ended yesterday without any significant breakthrough. But just as Mrs Kanafani's manner contains tantalising hints of a change of attitude, so there are grounds for believing that the talks may yet produce positive results. All sides have agreed to return to the table in late October. As Mrs Kanafani said: 'Don't take it that we are pessimistic. Don't take it that the discussions so far have not been very useful.' This, in itself, is something of an achievement. Almost a year and six rounds of negotiations have now passed since the talks were launched at last October's Madrid peace conference. In that time negotiations have become the established way of doing business for the Arabs and Israel in a way that was previously unthinkable. Five strands of multilateral negotiations are proceeding on arms control, economic co-operation, water resources, environmental issues and refugees, involving dozens of Middle Eastern and other nations. 'The peace talks might fail,' says Mr Robert Satloff, deputy director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a Jewish-funded think tank. 'But things can never go back to the way they were before. Arabs and Israelis meet regularly to discuss problems now.' While the four tracks of bilateral negotiations between Israel and, respectively, the Palestinians, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, have failed to resolve their wide differences, they have been characterised by cordial and determined efforts to keep the process going. Israel and the Palestinians have still not fully agreed the terms for negotiating an initial five-year period of Palestinian self-government in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Such an agreement would precede talks on a permanent territorial settlement. The Palestinians remain afraid that this two-stage approach will prejudice their goal of an independent state. There are positive signs, however. Mr Rabin - in contrast with his predecessor Mr Yitzhak Shamir - has turned a blind eye to close consultations between the Palestinian delegation from the occupied territories and the Tunis-based Palestine Liberation Organisation. Equally significant, in the past week the two delegations formed small, informal working groups to try to find ways forward which were not tape-recorded as all the main negotiating sessions have been. In the Syrian-Israeli talks the issue revolves around the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since 1967. Mr Rabin, despite opposition at home, has signalled a willingness to give back at least some of the heights if Syria commits itself to a full-fledged peace treaty. Syria puts the issue the other way around: It will not commit itself to full peace until it is assured of getting back all the Golan. The intention to issue this week an initial joint document of principles that would be the basis for negotiations fell down on the Golan question. Talks between Israel and Jordan and Israel and Lebanon are less difficult than those with the Palestinians and Syria. But here lies another complication: how to co-ordinate all four sets of negotiations so that they move roughly in step. Privately, all sides agree that in the end, they are unlikely to be able to make real progress without the active intervention of the US, which has stayed mainly on the sidelines. 'At a certain point only the Americans can come up with a solution on the Golan that will be less than the Syrians demand right now and more than any Israeli government could afford to propose by itself,' said a senior Israeli delegate. Until recently there was an assumption that the talks would not resume until after the US presidential election in November. Now all sides have agreed to come back before then. No great shift in US Middle East policy is anticipated should Mr Bill Clinton defeat President Bush. But it will be hard to make significant advances in the peace process until a new administration is established and able to give the talks its full attention.</p>

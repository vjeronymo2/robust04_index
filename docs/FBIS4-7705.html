			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Throughout the day yesterday, Serb-Montenegrin  aggressors continued their heavy offensive on the free territory  of the Gorazde district.    According to the press center of the Gorazde district,  during  the seventh day of the offensive on the town yesterday, the  aggressor used over 350 types of the most destructive weapons  and about 100 tanks and armored vehicles. Units of the  Herzegovina, Sarajevo-Romanija, Drina, and Uzice Corps--as well  as a large number of mercenaries from Romania, Russia, and  neighboring municipalities--are taking part in the bloody  onslaught on about 60,000 people, including refugees. The  aggressor's fiercest attacks were directed against the southern  section of the front, on the right bank of the Drina River,  where--despite the defenders' fierce and heroic struggle--the  chetniks succeeded in breaching our defense lines.

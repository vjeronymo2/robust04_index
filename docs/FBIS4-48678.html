			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, May 25 (AFP) -- The United Nations  cancelled its two daily flights to Kigali on Wednesday [25 May]  after the Canadian Hercules C-130 used in the operation was hit  by a bullet in the Rwandan capital on Tuesday, a UN military  spokesman said. The spokesman said the bullet, which had been  fired by a light weapon, had left a hole in one of the plane's  wings.    The incident was not discovered until the plane was  inspected  on its arrival back in Nairobi. The spokesman said the bullet  must have been fired either when the plane was landing at Kigali  or taking off. It was not known when the UN Assistance Mission  to Rwanda would resume its relief flights to Rwanda. The  spokesman said the military would be consulting engineers to  decide what needed to be done to make the Hercules safe.    With a shaky truce more or less holding, a UN special envoy  flew into Kigali Tuesday to discuss the deployment of 5,500  troops the United Nations hopes to muster, in a bid to protect  civilians and safeguard relief convoys.    Meanwhile relief workers reported Tuesday that thousands of  Rwandans were fleeing Kigali before the expected rebel takeover  of the capital, which they fear will usher in reprisals for the  massacres of Tutsis. Up to half a million people have been  butchered in ethnic bloodletting since April.</p>

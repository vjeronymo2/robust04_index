			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Round-up" by Wang Nan: "World Airline and Aircraft </F> Industry Turns Upbeat"]    [Text] Washington, June 27 (XINHUA) -- After four years of  losses, the prospects for the world airlines and aircraft making  industry are turning upbeat.    Optimism was at first seen in increased plane orders, such  as  the five billion dollars order from Saudi Arabia, 10 billion  dollars order from Singapore Airlines, and possible purchases  from China.    The world's 224 airlines are expected to garner a profit of  one billion dollars this year, representing one percent of total  sales, after losing 15.6 billion dollars since 1990, according  to the latest forecast.    The International Air Transport Association (IATA), based in  Geneva, reported that in the first quarter of this year, world  passenger traffic grew nine percent, and freight traffic grew 12  percent.    IATA saw a 7.4 percent growth in scheduled passenger and  freight traffic service in 1993, and expected 8.9 percent growth  this year.    Every one billion profit of the world airlines, as is the  case this year, observers said, translates into a cash flow of  three billion dollars, the down payment for 30 billion dollars  of plane orders.    Worldwide deliveries of commercial passenger jets of 100  seats or more, which plummeted to less than 600 in 1993, is  expected to reach more than 700 in the late 1990s, boeing said  in its latest forecast.    The European Airbus Industrie, with worldwide market share  at  25 percent, predicted that the world's new orders of passenger  planes, which were less than 100 in 1993, will reach 200 this  year.    The reasons for the cautious optimism, according to  observers, included the recent restructuring drive by many  airlines, which have significantly reduced their unit costs and  improved productivity.    The spate of alliances among major carriers, meanwhile, have  enabled them to knock down old-time government barriers and  expand routes into foreign territories.    Other reasons, observers said, range from more privatization  of government-owned airlines across the world, to moderate  economic growth in the industrial world, and declining fuel  prices and interest rates.</p>

Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed below, the Commission finds that the NYSE's proposal to extend, through April 30, 1994, the pilot program providing for the Exchange's OHT facility and the pilot program for procedures regulating matched MOC orders is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  and in particular, with the requirements of section 6(b)(5). <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  The Commission believes that the NYSE's proposal to extend the OHT facility pilot, comprised of Crossing Sessions I and II, is reasonably designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, and remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is also approving a three-month extension for matched MOC orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See OHT Approval Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3, and Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 28167, 29393, 29761, and 30004,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 5, for a complete description of the NYSE OHT facility, the NYSE matched MOC order procedures, and the Commission's rationale for approving the proposals on a pilot basis.

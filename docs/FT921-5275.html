			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / US 'needs visionary policy' to hone competitive edge: A new federal advisory council, is calling for a radical and national reappraisal for industry MIGHT THE next US president, Republican or Democrat, be tempted to experiment with some form of 'industrial policy'? If the first report* from the bipartisan Competitiveness Policy Council is any guide, future administrations will certainly face increased pressure to develop explicit policies for different industrial sectors. As part of a comprehensive 'competitiveness strategy,' involving a shift from budget deficit to surplus, the council argues that the federal government should set out 'visions' of 'industry paths that would be compatible with a prosperous and competitive American economy'. The council bemoans the fact that the country's two top economic officials (Treasury Secretary and the Federal Reserve chairman) focus mainly on financial matters, saying that the US needs to expand the role of the Department of Commerce or International Trade Commission. In addition to assessing US business strength, an expanded agency could monitor the activities of foreign governments and companies to provide 'early warning of competitiveness problems'. The US intelligence community, having lost its Cold War responsibilities, could also be mobilised to gather such information. The council, a federal advisory committee, is chaired by Mr Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington think-tank. It was formed last year under the aegis of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988; 12 members appointed by the administration and both houses of Congress are drawn equally from business, labour, government and the public. It should not be confused with either the residential Council on Competitiveness, headed by Vice-President Dan Quayle and concerned mainly to reduce the federal regulatory burden, or with the private-sector Council on Competitiveness, a pressure group set up in 1987. Mr Bergsten, a former economic official in the Carter administration, is well aware that sector-specific industrial policies are likely to be the most controversial aspect of the group's competitiveness strategy. 'I am not trying to imitate Japan Inc,' he said, but rather 'to improve the federal government's analytical capabilities so that it can respond intelligently to proposals for assistance from specific industries.' But, why should government develop sector-specific expertise, when the US has relied successfully on the free-market for decades? The council regards this as a misreading of history and says that the US has 'carried out strategies towards certain sectors of the economy and key industries from the birth of the republic under different rubrics - including agricultural policy, defence policy and aerospace policy.' In spite of some failures, the results 'have sometimes been spectacularly successful: the world's most efficient farms and commercial aircraft, a robust computer industry and many more. There need be no embarrassment over conscious endorsement of a such a policy ..' Both Republican and Democrat administrations, the council points out, have frequently employed import quotas, tax incentives, government procurement and numerous other devices to support individual sectors and even individual companies such as Chrysler and Lockheed. The trouble, it says, is that such support is typically 'episodic and ad hoc.' The report argues that the country's eroding competitiveness reflects three main problems: A proclivity to think and act short-term while competitors, especially Japan and Germany, adopt longer-time horizons. It says short-termism is endemic in all the three main sectors of households, companies and government. Perverse incentives throughout US society. Examples include tax laws that penalise saving, a political process that rewards spending and tax-cutting, and an education system that offers few rewards for hard work. A failure to think globally. The council says that business and government policymakers remain insular in spite of the doubling of trade relative to gross national product (GNP) that has left the US as reliant on external markets as either Japan or the European Community The council's advocacy of industrial policies forms part of a tripartite approach to competitiveness problems. The second key element is more stable and effective macroeconomic policies designed principally to boost US savings and investment. The council notes that the US has been living off a huge stock of capital, much of which was accumulated in the century between the Civil War and the Second World War. Prior to 1940, the US savings rate was among the highest in the world, and considerably higher than Japan's. But, while other country's savings rates rose, that of the US remained static. The council says that the conversion of federal budget deficits into surpluses is essential if the savings rate is to be raised, but it declines to recommend specific tax increases. It also advocates radical tax reforms to reduce consumption and boost private saving. The third element in the council's strategy consists of fundamental structural reforms, including an overhaul of education and training, health-care provision, corporate governance and financial markets, technology policy and trade policy. The council plans to make specific recommendations in these areas in a report timed to influence the winner of this November's presidential election. Mr Bergsten concedes that many of the council's proposals stand a better chance of being implemented if a Democrat were elected president, but he stresses that Republicans on the council, from both private business and state government, are strong supporters of initiatives such as sector-specific industrial policies. After three years of stagnation, the centre of economic gravity in the US seems to be shifting rapidly. Policies that seemed unthinkable in the Reagan era may yet form central planks in the policies of future administrations. *Building a Competitive America.

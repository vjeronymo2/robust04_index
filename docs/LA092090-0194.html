			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FLICKS FILM AND VIDEO NOTES;  </P> <P> BEWARE OF DOGS;  </P> <P> THE CENTURY THEATRES' WIENERS CAN BE SALTY, BUT THE SEATS ARE CUSHY AND THERE'S  FUN IN THE LOBBY.  </P> <P> For this week's Ventura County theater review, the fourth in the series, we  took a look at the Century 8 Theatres complex at 2875 Elba St. in Ventura.  </P> <P> Food: Know that saying "You can't tell a book by its cover"? Well, you  apparently can't tell a hot dog by its bun, either. The appetizing sesame seed  bun (and the attractive double wrapping) hid what turned out to be a very salty  dog that wasn't particularly easy to swallow.  </P> <P> The popcorn was a pleasant surprise. It is advertised as being served with real  butter, and it tasted like the real thing.  </P> <P> Restroom: Very clean. For people washing their hands, there is the option of  the blow-dry machine or paper towels -- a nice feature for moviegoers whose  skin chaps easily. The color scheme is a pleasant brown and white.  </P> <P> Pre-movie entertainment: Ahhh. Something different. A combined  advertisement/movie trivia slide show with symphonic Muzak playing softly in  the background. So, do you know the name of Indiana Jones' sidekick in "Temple  of Doom?"  </P> <P> Pre-movie ads: One.  </P> <P> Previews: Two.  </P> <P> Theater features: A high-domed ceiling and a curved screen give each theater a  spacious, circular effect. Seats are soft and comfortable and rock back and  forth -- a great place to take a nap if the film gets boring.  </P> <P> Special added attractions: A stress tester, sex meter, photo booth and video  arcade in the lobby.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Short Round (played by Ke Huy Quan).  </P> <P> This Sunday from the Ojai Film Society: "Time of the Gypsies" (1989). With a  cast of mostly Gypsies, this Yugoslavian- Romanian film tells the story of an  orphaned Gypsy boy with magical powers who resorts to thievery, baby stealing  and murder to come up with enough money to get married.  </P> <P> The film won the Director's Prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival. Show  time at the Ojai Playhouse is 4:30 p.m.; tickets are $6. LEO SMITH  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On May 1, the Russian interior troops will be beefed  up, but they will not be put in a state of alert, Interior  Troops Commander Colonel General Anatoliy Kulikov announced  during a briefing in Moscow. He said that the security of some  of the military facilities would be enhanced to exclude the  seizure of weapons and military equipment. "But there are no  plans to draw forces to Moscow from other regions," he said.    To quote Kulikov, on May 1, interior troops will be in  reserve and help the police if necessary. Kulikov referred to  the law which says that the interior troops shall not be used  for dispersing unsanctioned rallies or demonstrations, but shall  be involved in dealing with mass disturbances. He also  announced that in a number of regions, above all in the North  Caucasus, the interior troops had to act in the backdrop of a  complicated criminal situation. In 1993, interior troops came  under fire 130 times in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. As a  result, seven servicemen were killed and 133 were wounded. This  year, interior troops were attacked more than 20 times.    He proposed that the Interior Minister be allowed to change  the structure and dislocation of the interior troops depending  on the criminal situation. He also noted that almost 17,000  interior troop servicemen had no housing. "Spending on the  interior troops meets only 60 percent of our needs," said  Kulikov.</p>

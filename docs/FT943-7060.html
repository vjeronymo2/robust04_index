			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Equifax raises UAPT bid Equifax, the US credit data group, yesterday fended off what would have been a terminal blow in its bid for UAPT-Infolink, by raising its offer for the UK company to 650p a share. Equifax is involved in a fight with Trans Union, its main US rival, for the hand of UAPT, the credit referencing company. An initial 500p bid was topped by a 550p offer from Trans Union, but Equifax hit back with a 600p offer. However, the bidding war was complicated by the fact that Equifax owns a credit information business in the UK, and is faced with a possible referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission by the Office of Fair Trading. Trans Union, which has no UK operations, therefore won the board's recommendation. The fight came to a head yesterday when a group of five institutions, representing 21 per cent of UAPT's shares, were about to accept the 550p Trans Union offer. The offer compares favourably with a share price as low as 75p earlier this year. Equifax has now persuaded those institutions to defer judgment until an OFT decision is made, in exchange for the offer of 650p a share. In addition, the board of UAPT has agreed to rescind its recommendation of the Trans Union offer. Trans Union's bid is due to close on August 31, but it can be extended. However, Trans Union has stated that it will under no circumstances raise its offer. The OFT will therefore decide the outcome. Its decision is expected shortly.</p>

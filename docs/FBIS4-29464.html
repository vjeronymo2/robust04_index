			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 16 Jun Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] Nobuo Matsunaga and his party, who had represented  Japan in the OECD Ministerial Council meeting, met with Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata at the Diet on the morning of 16 June, and  reported to him on the discussions made at the council meeting.  They reported that in a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor,  both sides agreed that: 1) even though the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks have resumed, it will be impossible to resolve  everything by the time of the industrial nations' summit (Naples  summit) in July, and 2) the two countries must turn the  Japan-U.S. top leaders' meeting at the Naples summit into a  success by making progress in the framework talks, and it is  necessary to make preparations for that.    In his report to Hata, Matsunaga said: "The United States  has become realistic." The prime minister responded: "That is  good."    In regards to the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea)  suspected  nuclear arms program, Matsunaga reported he told Secretary  Christopher: "The ultimate target common to Japan and the  United States is to have North Korea come to a table of dialogue  and to have that country observe international rules. Our task  is to make efforts toward peace." He also reported he told  Christopher: "Japan will render its maximum possible  cooperation, but if we have too high expectations on the  effectiveness of sanctions, we can be disappointed."</p>

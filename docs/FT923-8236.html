			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / World Trade News: CBI warns US against harming British trade THE Confederation of British Industry (CBI) yesterday warned of damage to UK trade links with the US if Washington adopts laws aiming to raise more taxes from foreign companies operating in the US. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, has told Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, and key Congressmen that proposed tax changes 'strike at the heart of long-standing international tax principles underpinning successful free trade and investment around the world'. The proposals were 'conceptually flawed, unworkable in practice, and discriminatory'. Britain is the biggest foreign investor in the US, with holdings of Pounds 56bn. Mr Davies said the proposed new taxes would have 'disturbing implications for British investment in the US, and US investment in the UK'. Retaliation could not be ruled out. The proposed US measures, some in a draft bill put to Congress in May and endorsed by Mr Bill Clinton, Democratic presidential candidate, are prompted by suspicions that foreign companies artificially lower their US profits by manipulating transfer prices with their US-based subsidiaries, in an apparent bid to cheat the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). They are intended to raise new revenues without taxing US voters more heavily. Mr Clinton wants to raise Dollars 45bn in the next four years by 'cracking down on foreign companies that prosper here and manipulate tax laws to their advantage'. International anxiety over unilateral US action where international agreement is seen as essential has led to the OECD studying the issue. Mr Jean-Claude Paye, OECD secretary-general, has told Mr Brady the bill 'could have a damaging effect on the future development of world trade and the long-run interests of the US'. The issue has grown as foreign direct investment flows have surged. Foreign direct investment flows in 1990 amounted to Dollars 225bn (Pounds 117bn), the UN's World Investment Report says, increasing 34 per cent a year between 1985 and 1990. Trade between parent companies and foreign-based offshoots accounts for 40 per cent of total world exports, which amounted to Dollars 3,485bn in 1990. The transfer pricing proposal would tax foreign companies as if their gross profit margin were three-quarters of the US industry average, whether or not they actually made a profit. Critics say such an assumption cannot be made. Another proposal would put an arbitrary minimum tax level on foreign-owned companies, discriminating between them and US companies. It would impose capital gains tax on foreign shareholders with over 10 per cent of stock of a US company, imposing a tax on insurance premiums.</p>

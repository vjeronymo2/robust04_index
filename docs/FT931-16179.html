			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Technology: The way to leap ahead New technologies can both excite and frighten companies without the resources or knowledge to exploit them properly, however much they may stand to benefit. 'For this reason,' says Fraunhofer, a German applied research organisation, 'many small and medium-sized ventures prefer to play safe and manage without the latest forward-looking equipment.' To try to help such timid or inexperienced businesses, Fraunhofer's Production Technology Institute in Aachen has got together with the Institute of Technology Management at St Gallen University, Switzerland, to produce a technology 'calendar'. The idea is to offer information not only on technologies relevant to particular products, but also about the economic and human resources needed to implement them. For example, some complex processes may well be technically and financially suitable for certain companies. But lack of qualified people could make it hard to introduce advanced production methods. The technology calendar comprises a special database (called dabit) on innovative technologies and guidelines telling companies which materials (such as plastics, ceramics, and special steels) can be subjected to which processes (such as cutting or coating by laser, water jet cutting, or injection moulding) and at which manufacturing stage. Those using the calendar - though developed in Germany and Switzerland, it is aimed at companies around the world - can either just tap into dabit to keep up to date with particular technologies or make use of guidelines developed for particular technological, financial and employment circumstances. However, companies in some countries will obviously be in less need of such assistance than in other parts of the world. As experts at Aachen and St Gallen point out, the success of many Japanese companies stems from the fact that they invest more than twice as much in developing and applying advanced production technologies than comparable US concerns.</p>

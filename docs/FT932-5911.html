			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Visions of Europe: A basis for the future Europe is not yet a love story. Neither for the Danes, nor for the British - for no-one. If anything, it is an arranged marriage: love is declared, with due solemnity, in the set-piece speeches of sanctimonious politicians. For the people, on the other hand, Europe lacks contours. Complex and indigestible, it has become a synonym for privileged bureaucrats, subsidised farmers and the all-consuming desire for regulation down to the smallest detail. We see Europe as nothing but office complexes in Brussels and parliament buildings in Strasbourg. We catch a glimpse of it, too, when heads of governments run out of any other ideas for making visionary statements: then, they turn to Europe. It is a wonderful and worthwhile objective, but it can be misused. When national governments blunder in the field of domestic politics, Europe, they judge, is always to blame. Politicians see in Europe an always-flexible tool, to be turned to any use that suits their momentary purpose. Should we extend Europe to the east? Should we limit it just to the 'core' countries? Should we try to establish a monetary union straight away? All terribly important, to be sure. But, first of all, we must make sure that Europe has its feet firmly on the ground. There has to be genuine political co-operation in all relevant areas, including defence and foreign policy. Europe has to be something more than simply a collusion of interests between the merchants and the money-changers. In its failures over Bosnia, Europe has presented a picture of disaster. We must not and cannot allow this to happen again. From a political point of view, Europe has not yet acquired morality; it certainly has no countenance. For the moment at least, it has no strength. Europe is suffering from a dramatic crisis of leadership: it risks losing its backbone, in the same way that, in individual nations, shortcomings at the top - in government, in big companies and in trade unions - are becoming increasingly apparent. We are, however, trapped by reality: for we must see that there is no alternative to Europe. We are condemned to want it, condemned to assist in its construction. No-one can believe that conflicts of the sort that we witness in the former Yugoslavia cannot be played out elsewhere, in the heart of Europe. Not just in the Balkans, but, in truth, anywhere between Trieste and Glasgow, war is possible. People's yearning for orientation, their wish to make sense of and identify with their circumstances and their environment, can lead, in troubled times, to nationalism and radicalism. In Europe, we have not yet overcome the rule of armed force. The dissolution of the old power blocs of east and west makes it all the more vital that Europe should be both strong and free from political and economic shocks. Certainly, we need hard currencies; but even more, we need a definition of what Europe is, demonstrable to its people and recognisable for the world outside. Some believe they do not need Europe; such people have already lost the battle. Yet only illusionists believe they can have Europe and yet somehow avoid argument and irritation in the years to come. The people of Europe have no choice but to get their act together. The Maastricht treaty provides a basis for this; it may be a bad one, but, to make a start, it is sufficient. Over time, the treaty may be seen as no longer reflecting the interests of the members of the Community. If this happens, there is a way out: the treaty will simply have to be changed] The author is editor of the German weekly magazine Stern</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: First private sector copper smelter to be built in India INDIA'S FIRST private-sector copper smelter is to be built near Bombay in collaboration with MIM Holdings of Australia. Copper smelting, reserved for the public sector, was deregulated last year as part of an overall industrial liberalisation policy. Now Sterlite Industries, producer of copper rods, has announced that it is setting up a smelter to produce 60,000 tonnes of copper cathodes a year from imported concentrates, probably from Zambia or Chile. India has a 47,500-tonne smelter, which is operating at half of its capacity, and most of the local requirements are met by imports. Few copper smelters have been built in industrial countries in recent years, partly because of the introduction of new methods of producing copper and partly because of strict environmental laws. Thailand and Indonesia, which also have planned copper smelters, are talking to MIM about buying the technology. Every year as by-products, the Sterlite copper smelter will produce seven tonnes of gold, which will be higher than India's present total gold production of five tonnes, and some 20 tonnes of silver. Mr Anil Agarwal, chairman, says annual demand for copper in India is expected to rise from the present 150,000 tonnes to 250,000 tonnes in 1995. He claims the smelter will be competitive internationally because it will use latest technology.</p>

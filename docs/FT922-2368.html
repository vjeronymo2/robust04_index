			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Pemex to be split into four units THE Mexican government is to divide Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) into four semi-autonomous divisions in an attempt to improve productivity at the state oil company, widely regarded as inefficient, writes Damian Fraser. The four subsidiaries will be responsible for production and exploration; refining; natural gas and basic petrochemicals; and secondary petrochemicals. Each company will be free to decide its operating and investment plans, with full responsibility for financial results. The subsidiaries will answer to a board of directors headed by the director-general of Pemex and comprising members of the government and petroleum industry. A statement from Los Pinos, home of President Carlos Salinas, said the new structure would not affect any of Pemex's foreign financial obligations. Pemex is Mexico's largest company, with sales last year of Dollars 18.6bn (Pounds 10.2bn), of which about 40 per cent were exports. The company, long seen as a potent symbol of national sovereignty, came under intense criticism after an explosion in April that killed more than 200 people in Guadalajara, Mexico's second largest city.</p>

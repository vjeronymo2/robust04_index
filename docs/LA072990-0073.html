			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRONG ON BOSTON  </P> <P> As a former resident of Boston for 38 years, I enjoyed Robert Burns' articles  on the city in your July 1 issue ("Boston Pops!"). But I'd like to point out  that the principal photo you used was incorrectly captioned. The building shown  in the photo was not Faneuil Hall but Quincy Market, which is just east of the  hall and very close to it.  </P> <P> FELIX DOHERTY  </P> <P> Bellflower  </P></p>

Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FOUR MEXICANS FOUND DEAD IN FUMIGATED RAILROAD CAR IN TEX.  </P> <P> Four Mexicans were found dead this morning in a railroad trailer pasted with  warnings that it was being fumigated, police said.  </P> <P> The cause of death was not immediately known, but the victims, all men, had  suffered diarrhea and vomiting, symptoms of poisoning from the fumigant  commonly used on rail cars, said Sgt. John Burney.  </P> <P> A Southern Pacific car inspector found the victims about 8:50 a.m. after a  brakeman noticed that the door was open. The bodies were found in the back of a  trailer riding piggy-back on a flatcar.  </P> <P> A hole had been cut in the top of the trailer, apparently for ventilation,  Burney said. The car was carrying tortilla flour.  </P></p>

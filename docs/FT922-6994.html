			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / People: Spending a bit of money on pubs Ross Cope, formerly with specialist mortgage provider First Mortgage Securities, is the new treasurer of Inntrepreneur Estates (IEL), the pub investment company set up last year by GrandMet and Foster's. He is an expert in securitisation, or repackaging debt as saleable securities, and is looking forward to bringing 'a novel financing technique into the pub market'. At First Mortgage Securities he had been treasury director, funding and securitising UK mortgages; hence Cope, 44, claims to be one of a small clutch of people 'who have actually done it rather than simply talk about it'. But while the funding side may have been a success, the specialist mortgage providers that sprang into life during the boom years of the 1980s, have been particularly badly hit by repossessions, and are narrowly eyeing their future commitment to the market. As a technique suitable for thinly capitalised companies, securitisation should work for IEL, which owns pubs and leases them out on 20-year contracts. One of Cope's tasks will be to refinance the Pounds 1.32bn loan taken out at IEL's inception. An accountant who had a spell as treasurer of Girobank, he is a fan of GrandMet's concept of managing pubs as properties in their own right. 'After a month in the new job, I have worked out how you spot Inntrepreneur pubs. They are the ones that look up-market, with a bit of money spent on them - basically they don't look like pubs.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Employer Interest and Involvement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A 1993 survey conducted for the NAVE asked employers about their familiarity and satisfaction with vocational programs. About 60 percent of employers responding to the survey (which had a high non-response rate) said they were familiar with vocational education programs in their local areas. Forty-one percent were familiar with secondary vocational programs, and 47 percent with postsecondary programs. How should the reauthorization encourage business interest and involvement in occupational education? Along these lines, should the reauthorization seek to strengthen cooperative education, and, if so, how? Should employer involvement, through activities such as provision of work-based learning experiences, be given more prominence in the Act? If so, how can the Act increase business involvement, including increased workplace education in vocational and basic skills? What about other federally supported programs, including adult education programs?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Sex Equity and Single Parents Programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Perkins Act requires States to set aside 10.5 percent of Basic State Grant funds for programs to eliminate sex bias in vocational education and programs for single parents, single pregnant women, and displaced homemakers. Have these provisions worked effectively to eliminate sex bias and provide appropriate opportunities for single parents and displaced homemakers in vocational education? If not, what changes should be made? Do the two set-asides mesh with State priorities or are they overly restrictive? Are the two set-asides still needed?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current law also requires that each State employ a full-time sex equity coordinator who administers the sex equity and single parents set-aside programs, collects and disseminates data on programs, provides technical assistance to local programs, and carries out other responsibilities. Is this requirement an effective means of ensuring gender-equitable practices in vocational programs? Is it still needed? Is it overly prescriptive?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Native American and Hawaiian Natives Programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, under Basic State Grants, the Department sets aside funds for Native Americans and Native Hawaiians. What role should Perkins play in providing vocational education for these populations? Are the current set-aside programs working effectively, or should they be revised? Would the population served through the program be better served if the program was administered by the Department of the Interior? Should the education needs of Native American youth be addressed through current means, or should greater efforts be made to provide resources for these students as part of more comprehensive systems? If so, how would this work? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Tech-Prep Education <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Tech-Prep programs have expanded tremendously since their introduction in the mid-1980s. The tech-prep approach is one of the few models for local school-to-work opportunity programs and can be built on by States as they implement statewide school-to-work opportunity systems. However, the NAVE found considerable inconsistency in the quality of these programs and in the extent to which they have incorporated all the program components described in the literature and the legislation. Should the reauthorized Act continue to provide categorical support for Tech-Prep education, or should broader support for School-to-Work Opportunities programs, including other models, be offered? If the Tech-Prep program is continued, how can the Act be amended to improve the quality of local projects? Should the Tech-Prep Education program include a mandatory work-based learning component? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Research and Dissemination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> What should the role of the Department be in conducting vocational education research, and how should it be conducted? Through a national center or centers, as is currently the case for most of the Federal effort? Through field-initiated research? Through discretionary research projects determined through annual priorities? What should be the role of the Department in disseminating research results, descriptions of effective practices, and other information on vocational education? How can vocational education research and dissemination activities, along with similar activities in other programs and Departments, be structured in order to ensure maximum benefits and the efficient use of resources? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Demonstration Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Vocational Education Demonstrations Program authority provides the Department and educational institutions an opportunity to try new approaches to vocational education and to learn about the effectiveness of these approaches. The Department has funded a large number of demonstration projects in a variety of areas. Has the field found these demonstrations useful in obtaining information on effective educational approaches? Should a Federal vocational education demonstrations program authority be continued? If so, what areas of inquiry might be emphasized? How should the demonstration projects conducted under this authority mesh with the newly authorized School-to-Work demonstration projects and other, related Federal demonstration activities? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Vocational Education and Occupational Information Data Systems <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

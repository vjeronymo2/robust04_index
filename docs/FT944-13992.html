			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Amdahl back in the black after shake-up Amdahl, one of International Business Machines' largest competitors in the mainframe computer market, continued its recovery in the third quarter, after a broad restructuring last year. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 14.3m, or 12 cents a share. This compares with a net loss of Dollars 275.7m, or Dollars 2.41 a share, in the same period last year when the company took a Dollars 235m restructuring charge. Revenues declined by about 7 per cent to Dollars 364m from Dollars 393m. Demand for mainframe computers was 'relatively strong' during the quarter, Amdahl said, with seasonal softness in Europe largely offset by strength in all other geographic regions. Mainframe prices, which fell precipitously over the past two years, are now 'reasonably stable'. Amdahl blamed its revenue decline on lower sales of data storage systems because of a product transition. The company introduced new storage products late in the quarter. 'We've accomplished many of the goals established during last year's restructuring,' said Mr Joseph Zemke, president and chief executive. For the year to date, net earnings were Dollars 33.9m, or 29 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 1.14bn. In the same period last year, the company lost Dollars 539m, or Dollars 4.74 a share, on revenues of Dollars 1.24bn. The 1993 losses included restructuring charges of Dollars 478m.</p>

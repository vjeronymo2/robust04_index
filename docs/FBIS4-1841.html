			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 2 (CNA) -- Vice Economic Affairs  Minister Sheu Ke-sheng Saturday [2 April] told local enterprises  they must further improve their product quality if they hope to  win a greater share of the highly competitive international  market.    "Taiwan was once known for its exports of low-end  products...but with rising wages and costs, those days are gone  forever. Today, only high-quality products can provide Taiwan  enterprises with new niches," Sheu said at the opening of the  second annual "Celebration of Excellence" product fair.    The five-day fair, sponsored by the Ministry of Economic  Affairs, features 625 high-quality products manufactured by 336  companies.    A screening committee has awarded 194 of the products the  "Symbol of Excellence."    Eight companies, including Philips, a semiconductor producer  and two bike manufacturers, won the top honors awarded by the  ministry during a ceremony Friday night.    The award, dubbed the "Gold National Award of Excellence,"  is  part of the government's effort to help local enterprises polish  the image of their products.    The winners of the gold award were each given NT$2 million  (US$757,575) in cash. Winners include Kuannan Enterprise,  United Microelectronics Corp., Giant Co., Merida Co. and  Philips Taiwan. Sixteen other firms won silver awards.    Vice Premier Hsu Li-the and Economic Affairs Minister P.K.  Chiang attended the award ceremony at the Taipei World Trade  Center.</p>

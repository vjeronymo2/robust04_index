			<p>BFN     [Text] Trade Minister Dr. Muhammad Mahdi Salih has told the  Iraqi News Agency that the assistance provided by the state in  accordance with the directives of leader President Saddam  Husayn, may God preserve and protect him, in order to ensure  food for the citizens at symbolic prices amounts to 99.7 percent  of the cost of the foodstuffs that Iraqi families receive under  the ration card.    The minister added: The official price of the foodstuffs  that are given to every individual under the ration card is  3.085 dinars, while their market price is 1,015 dinars. Thus  the state pays the difference of 1,012 dinars for every  individual. The official price of milk and the other materials  such as soaps and washing powders given to children below one  year is 3.400 dinars, while the market price is 700 dinars.  Thus, the state pays a difference in price of 697 dinars.</p>

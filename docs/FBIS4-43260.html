			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: "The New Poor Ever Increasing"] </F>   [Text] Up to 200,000 households may at times be thrown into  the ranks of the new poor, asserts researcher Pentti Ronkko.  Families in the tens of thousands already have such severe  economic problems that they are unable to handle the situation.  The present cost-of-living measures and the official relative  poverty levels are inadequate when it comes to identifying those  hit by the new poverty.    Ronkko's article on redistribution of incomes is included in  the book Unfortunate Social Position and Change in the  Welfare State, which is edited by Professors Mattik  Heikkila and Kari Vahatalo. The book is part of the Finnish  Academy's research program on the weaker population groups in  Finland.    Ronkko thinks that the structural defects in the welfare  state have set up an impoverization process within the middle  class. The decisionmakers and the state machinery have become  isolated from daily lives of their fellow citizens. Taxation,  income transfers, and the associated budget cuts have not been  targeted adequately, he states.    Ronkko writes that the welfare state's safety net is still  operating relatively well regarding the traditional low-income  groups and other vulnerable elements, even though several budget  cut decisions have also reached to impact them. On the other  hand, the safety net has completely collapsed for the heavily  indebted middle class.    Vahatalo, for his part, writes that long-term unemployment  is  not the only factor that has undermined the welfare state. In  particular, the housing policy has contributed to the  undermining, since it has never been carried out in a  goal-directed fashion, he asserts. Instead, market forces have  taken over in determining policy.    Vahatalo also points out that the position of students has  markedly worsened in recent times. They no longer dare to take  out student loans because of the high interest rates and  insecurity about the future job market. Vahatalo warns that this  defective educational support system may lead again to the  situation that parents' economic background will determine who  can continue his studies and who cannot.    Poverty also threatens to again become an inherited  phenomenon. During the good years for the economy, we were able  to get rid of this trend, but -- according to researcher Raimo  Parikka, we are now on the way to going back to the old pattern.</p>

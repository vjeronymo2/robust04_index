Such job-related family separations recorded up to  October 1992 soared by 62,000 or almost 15 percent over 1987,  the year of the previous survey on job transfers, and a further  increase can be anticipated, according to the survey.    "Due to problems such as children's schooling or house  ownership, the number of fathers leaving their families behind  when taking up a new job is likely to continue to increase," the  survey said. The higher the number of employees at a company,  the more likely that employees will be assigned to a post in  another city without their families.    Such male employees are most often to be found among those  in  the middle echelons of management. The vast majority, about 70  percent, are in their 40s or 50s.    These facts further corroborate the stereotyped image of the  salarymen living apart from his family as being "middle  management staff with a major company," the survey said. Most  men living a job-related single life had been transferred to  Tokyo, some 59,000, followed by 35,000 assigned to new posts in  Kanagawa Prefecture, and 30,000 working in Chiba Prefecture.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Coal enterprise in UK's best interests Sir, May I ask whose interests are being served by the seemingly endless campaign to rubbish RJB Mining? This company's efforts to secure intact a significant part of the UK coalmining industry serve the nation's best interests ('Putting Pounds 1bn down the mines', November 23). We each have a duty to see our considerable natural resources and expertise fully exploited. Surely we should applaud, support and be thankful for such a display of confidence, enthusiasm and enterprise. A weak and fragmented coal industry brings more than misery to the already hard-pressed mining communities. It creates more than a little financial pressure on the mining equipment manufacturers which belong to the association I represent. The army of public relations men and lobbyists who represent the new leading players in the energy industry sees this breakdown as its goal. Ultimately, it will precede the loss of a vast natural resource that can serve us all. Even in a worst case scenario, supplying 27m tons per year, RJB projects huge success providing the industry remains intact. The UK sits on more than 1bn tons of coal reserves. These figures speak for themselves. Will no one else? William F Morrell, director-general, Association of British Mining Equipment Companies, Webster Buildings, Wortley Road, Rotherham S61 1LZ</p>

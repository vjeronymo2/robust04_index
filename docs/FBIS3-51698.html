			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Ortega] </F>   [Text] Mexico City, 19 Jan (AFP) -- Luis Donaldo Colosio,  the leading Mexican presidential candidate, is facing problems  following the outbreak of guerrilla violence in southern Chiapas  State. Even Democracy 2000 -- a group within the ruling  Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) -- has withdrawn its  support for Colosio, because "he is not doing what is best for  our party."    "Democracy 2000 in Veracruz withdraws its support for your  candidacy and your political campaign because it believes this  modest current of (PRI) opinion has more clout in civil society  than organized or authoritarian PRI-ism," it was stated by  disgruntled members in a letter delivered to Colosio on Tuesday  during a campaign tour through communities in Veracruz.    Colosio, as well as a great many Mexican Government  authorities, were surprised by the Zapatist National Liberation  Army (EZLN) rebellion on 1 January 1994 in Chiapas, where the  candidate had plans to begin his campaign. The state had also  been considered a bastion of votes for the PRI before the  rebellion.    Mexican analysts have mentioned for several days the  possibility that the PRI may change its candidate for the 21  August presidential elections, while the PRI leadership remains  silent. Only traditional leaders such as Fidel Velasquez, head  of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), have openly  supported Colosio.    "Approximately 70 percent of Democracy 2000's 32  coordinating  boards in the country always supported Camacho's appointment as  presidential candidate. However, in a settlement reached during  the national convention, we agreed to support whoever was  designated (Colosio) -- someone who is not doing what is best  for our party at this time." According to Mexican political  tradition, the current president -- in this case, Carlos Salinas  -- designates the PRI candidate and the party merely ratifies  the appointment.    Following Colosio's designation, Camacho resigned from the  post of Mexico City mayor and accepted the post of foreign  minister to -- he said -- prevent divisions within the party.  Upon learning about the magnitude of the social rebellion in  Chiapas, Salinas appointed Camacho, who is famous as a  negotiator and has good relations with the opposition, as a  peace commissioner, and his political status rose, although it  was considered he had been defeated following the official  candidate's election.    PRI "democrats" indicated, "The political strategy outlined  by the Change 2000 Foundation for the upcoming elections  pertains to a Mexico that no longer exists and that was left  behind on 31 December 1993, when the mythological dream about  the country's modernization came to an end."    Colosio served as social development secretary before being  nominated the PRI's presidential candidate, and he was in charge  of resolving the critical problems of extreme poverty which  afflict approximately 13 million Mexicans, including the Indians  who comprise the EZLN and who are demanding social justice.    Members of Democracy 2000 argue: "The (PRI's) influence  peddling policy has failed, along with the supporter roundup  (mandatory trips to attend PRI rallies) methods and false mass  rallies -- all of which belong to a Mexico that has been left  behind with its traditional and institutional type of campaign."    Certain newspapers have reported that Colosio's rallies were  a failure, surpassed by current events in Chiapas, and organized  "in the PRI's own style," with supporter roundups and staged  scenes that include Indians and poor people from various places  in the country.</p>

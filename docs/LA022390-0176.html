			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> OBSCENITY CONVICTION REVERSED  </P> <P> A jury Thursday reversed the conviction of a music store owner found guilty  last year of violating obscenity laws for selling a rap music tape with  sexually explicit lyrics.  </P> <P> A jury of nine men and three women deliberated about an hour and a half before  finding Tommy Hammond innocent of the misdemeanor charge.  </P> <P> The case centered around a tape titled "Move Somethin"' by the rap group The 2  Live Crew.  </P> <P> Hammond, the owner of Taking Home the Hits music store in Alexander City, had  been convicted and fined $500 for violating the city's misdemeanor obscenity  ordinance in a nonjury trial, but under state law was allowed to take the case  before a jury.  </P> <P> Prosecutors claimed the tape, which included lyrics with graphic descriptions  of sodomy, sadomasochism and human genitalia, violated the city's 1983  obscenity ordinance.  </P> <P> According to attorneys and legal experts, Hammond would have been the first  person convicted in a jury trial of selling obscene recordings. His lawyers  said a guilty verdict would have put a chill over the entire recording  industry, with artists and record companies becoming reluctant to release any  material that might be deemed offensive.  </P> <P> Hammond, who stopped selling the tape after his arrest, said he would continue  to sell recordings by The 2 Live Crew but probably not the release that landed  him in trouble.  </P> <P> "I don't know if I will ever sell the tape again," he said. "I think I've had  enough of 'Move Somethin.' "  </P></p>

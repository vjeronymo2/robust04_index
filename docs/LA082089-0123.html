			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOLIDARITY AIDE NOMINATED AS POLISH PREMIER  </P> <P> President Wojciech Jaruzelski on Saturday formally nominated a longtime  Solidarity adviser, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, as Poland's new prime minister, who  will put together the first non-Communist government in Eastern Europe since  the end of World War II.  </P> <P> The historic step was announced in a four-paragraph statement issued by the  Polish news agency and climaxed a swift and incisively orchestrated drive by  Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to wrest the government from Communist control.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Message to Sejm  </P> <P> "In the nearest future," the announcement said, "the president will table a  motion to the Sejm (lower house of Parliament) Speaker on the appointment of  Tadeusz Mazowiecki to the post of premier and entrusting him with the mission  of forming a government. In the present situation, the president sees a need to  create a government enjoying the necessary support of parliamentary floor  groups and to build it on foundations of broad agreement between Poland's  political and social forces."  </P> <P> Mazowiecki, 62, the editor of Solidarity's weekly newspaper, Tygodnik  Solidarnosc, has been a member of Solidarity's inner circle of advisers since  the union was born in the Gdansk shipyards in 1980. Walesa's personal choice  for the job, Mazowiecki met with Jaruzelski for two hours on Friday and said  afterward he was ready to accept the position.  </P> <P> His election by the Sejm, probably on Wednesday, is a virtual certainty.  </P> <P> As a result of a new coalition with the United Peasants' Party and the  Democratic Party, Solidarity controls 264 seats, a majority in the 460-member  Sejm. With 103 votes between them, the Peasants and the Democrats on Wednesday  abandoned a 40-year alliance with the Communists, decisively shifting the  balance of power.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki, who told reporters Friday that he intended to spend Saturday  "walking in the woods," spent the day at a school for the blind run by  Franciscan nuns, where he was briefly interviewed by Polish television.  </P> <P> The economy, he said, is "the greatest problem" for Poland. "I think about it,  but no one has a miraculous answer. I think the most important thing is that  people think that things can be better. . . . We are capable of doing very  much. It is not easy, but it is possible if people feel they are on their own.  . . . The government has to give the feeling that it is creating possibilities,  not limiting them."  </P> <P> Mazowiecki, a devout Catholic, was one of Solidarity's leading negotiators in  the lengthy "round-table" negotiations that began last April. Like many of  Solidarity's leaders, he was imprisoned during the martial-law crackdown  imposed by Jaruzelski in December, 1981, and was released after one year. He  immediately returned to his opposition activities.  </P> <P> President Jaruzelski on Saturday also accepted the formal resignation of Prime  Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, who offered to step aside on Monday after attempting  unsuccessfully since his appointment Aug. 2 to form a government.  </P> <P> As the announcement of Mazowiecki's appointment was issued, the Communist  Party's 230-member Central Committee was meeting in an emergency session to  formulate a new strategy to deal with a situation that reflected the worst  fears of party hard-liners, who had fought hard against a yearlong government  rapprochement with Solidarity.  </P> <P> The hard-liners, however, appeared in general retreat, while the party's  younger and more progressive members lobbied for a proposal that would advocate  a technocratic government of "experts" free from direct links to political  parties. It was not a proposal likely to generate much enthusiasm from  Solidarity.  </P> <P> Wlodzimierz Lozinski, a spokesman for the president, said there is "some  division" within the Central Committee over the president's action, but  "generally speaking," there was support for accepting it, since "there is no  alternative."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Major Breakthrough'  </P> <P> Solidarity's leadership, in its own executive session in Gdansk, issued a  statement saying the move "should produce a major breakthrough in Polish public  life by doing away with the present policy of nomenklatura, " the system in  which party members are appointed to key positions throughout government and  industry.  </P> <P> Indeed, the formation of a Solidarity government appears to spell an end to the  Leninist principle that insists on the leading role of the Communist Party in  the affairs of state. The reversal of this cherished Communist idea promises to  upend power arrangements that have existed in the country since the Communist  takeover in Poland after World War II.  </P> <P> Under the agreed upon arrangement, the Communists will retain control of two  sensitive ministries -- defense and interior -- thus assuring the Soviet Union  that its security arrangements with Poland remain intact. The Communists also  expect to play a strong role in foreign affairs, and a bargain may be struck to  assign a Communist to the position of deputy foreign minister.  </P> <P> However, it seems assured that all other ministries will be in the hands of  Solidarity and its new coalition allies. Solidarity sources say that the United  Peasants' Party could wind up with four or five ministries and the Democratic  Party with two.  </P> <P> The key ministries of agriculture, industry, commerce, health, justice,  transport, communications -- in short, all government departments dealing with  domestic affairs and economic policy -- are sure to be in the hands of the  Solidarity coalition. The effects will be sweeping, although, as Solidarity  activists admit, the changes may be at times confusing, conflicting and perhaps  even chaotic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Political Reforms  </P> <P> Solidarity has made clear already that it will press ahead with further  political reforms. Speaking to a parliamentary caucus last week, one deputy  said that Solidarity can be expected to move as quickly as possible to bring  state-run television and radio under the supervision of Parliament, thereby  cutting out Communist control of the electronic media. It is also expected that  the Communists who have served as spokesmen for the government will be  replaced.  </P> <P> Solidarity has also said it wants to renegotiate the agreements reached with  the government in April, which called for fully free elections in four years,  and schedule free elections in two years.  </P> <P> The decision by Jaruzelski to accept a Solidarity prime minister and what  amounts to a Solidarity Cabinet can be taken as the ranking achievement so far  in the career of Walesa -- a career that clearly has still not reached his  peak. It is generally assumed that Walesa, when the chance comes, will seek  election as president of Poland, a possibility that no longer seems remote.  </P> <P> The drive for Solidarity to take the government was Walesa's own idea, one that  ran counter to the thinking of Solidarity's moderate-leaning brain trust, which  cautioned that Solidarity is not yet prepared or experienced enough to take  over a government.  </P> <P> The notion first began to be discussed after Solidarity's triumph in the June  elections, in which its candidates swept 99 of 100 seats in the new Senate and  won all 161 seats for which it could compete in the Sejm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No 'Grand Coalition'  </P> <P> The Communists tried unsuccessfully to coax Solidarity into a "grand  coalition." They watched ("paralyzed like rabbits," in the scolding phrase of  Communist Party leader Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski) while Walesa's lieutenants pried  loose the Peasants and Democratic parties from the Communist coalition.  </P> <P> After its embarrassing performance in the elections, the Communists' setbacks  continued. Jaruzelski himself was elected president by the margin of half a  vote in the Sejm. Gen. Kiszczak's election as prime minister was briefly  stalled by a premature threat by the Peasants' Party to vote against him. And  after his election, the threats mounted to vote against any Cabinet he  nominated.  </P> <P> At that point, Walesa's campaign -- some of it carefully waged behind the  backs, or over the heads, of some of Solidarity's more conservative advisers --  was on the edge of success. The defections of the two minor parties clinched  it.  </P> <P> A key element, however, was out of Walesa's hands: the acceptance of the idea  by the Soviet Union. Walesa, early last week, pointedly repeated his assurance  that Solidarity had no intention of withdrawing Poland from its Warsaw Pact  security commitments to the Soviet Union. A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman  called the statement "sensible" and went on to say that while the Soviet Union  was watching Polish events with "concern," it had no intention of interfering.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Major Turnaround  </P> <P> Moscow's acceptance of an opposition government in Poland represents a major  turnaround for the Soviet Union, which has considered Poland a key element (as  well as a most troublesome one) in the string of East European nations that  serve as a buffer against the West.  </P> <P> Diplomats and experienced observers of East European politics believe it is  inconceivable that Jaruzelski could have taken such a momentous step without  close consultation with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. And the  activities last weekend of Soviet Ambassador Vladimir I. Brovikov, who met with  Kiszczak, the outgoing prime minister, and the heads of the Peasants and  Democratic parties, suggest that the Soviets were kept closely informed and  were passing on their own counsel.  </P> <P> The implications, for the rest of Communist Europe, are far reaching. The  Polish experience gives the green light to Hungary, running second in the  reform sweepstakes, for similar changes, which could follow elections to be  held there next year.  </P> <P> Czechoslovakia, however, is likely to be the country where Communist leaders  will receive the news with the most shock and alarm. The hard-line Czechoslovak  leaders have dug in their heels against political reform and give little more  than lip service on issues of economic reform.  </P> <P> Significantly, the regime in Prague has been increasing its pressure on  opposition activists, common targets of arrest and police harassment. In recent  days, the leadership has attempted to forestall planned demonstrations Monday  (in protest of the 1968 Soviet-led invasion) by circulating rumors that police  may be issued live ammunition to deal with protesters.  </P> <P> The hard-line regime in East Germany, which is wedged between Poland and  affluent, democratic West Germany, also views the momentous changes in Warsaw  with alarm. Its concern is compounded by the recent flight of large numbers of  East Germans to the West.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Enormous Pressure  </P> <P> The pressures on Solidarity are enormous, now that it enters a new era, clearly  transformed from a union-based opposition movement to a political party -- even  though it has not yet accepted that definition of itself.  </P> <P> Solidarity faces its own internal divisions as well, including disputes over  how fast to move toward a market economy, steps that could cause steep price  increases and consequent worker demands for compensatory wage hikes. Walesa  could find himself in a replay of 1981, when he spent much of his time  crisscrossing the country in the attempt to get strikers to go back to work.  </P> <P> It is likely that the Polish public, and even demanding factory workers, will  give Solidarity a period of grace, but it is not certain how long the patience  will last.  </P> <P> "It is an incredible success for our struggle, but let us now see it in  practice," a delighted Walesa told the Associated Press in a telephone  interview from Gdansk after Jaruzelski's announcement. "This is just the  beginning."  </P></p>

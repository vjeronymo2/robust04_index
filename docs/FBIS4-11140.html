			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo -- Comments on the October elections have  divided the Catholic Church. Criticized by his fellow bishops  at the 32d General Assembly of the National Conference of  Brazilian Bishops (CNBB) for having made political remarks, CNBB  President Dom Luciano Mendes de Almeida yesterday stated that he  will no longer reveal his ideas about the October elections.  Dom Serafim Fernandes, archbishop of Belo Horizonte and vice  president of the CNBB, has said that Mendes de Almeida's  opinions reflect "only his personal views," and are not in  keeping with CNBB ideas about the current political situation.    Fernandes said: He has every right to express his personal  views on the electoral process, but they do not necessarily  reflect the CNBB's position.    In informal comments made at the Itaici convent on 17 April,  Mendes de Almeida described the PSDB-PFL [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party-Liberal Front Party] alliance as "a rather  coercive marriage." In recent days, the bishops have exchanged  caustic remarks over the release of an electoral leaflet  sponsored by the CNBB. The wording of the leaflet was  considered to be favorable to the PT [Workers Party].    Catholic priests and laymen have criticized Mendes de  Almeida's remark about the PSDB-PFL coalition. One of his main  critics was Dom Jose Carlos de Lima Vaz, auxiliary bishop of Rio  de Janeiro. Lima Vaz said Mendes de Almeida's remarks may lead  to misunderstandings, and may give the impression that the CNBB  has reservations about the PFL. Dom Boaventura Kloppenburg,  bishop of Novo Hamburgo, also criticized Mendes de Almeida by  noting that no one may state that the market economy proposal --  which is upheld by several parties, the PFL included -- is  unfeasible.    Mendes de Almeida had been criticized earlier for having met  last week with PT leader Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. The meeting  was seen as a move to bring the Church and the PT closer  together. According to Mendes de Almeida, the meeting was held  at Lula's request and was focused on specific issues, such as  the removal of the proposal to decriminalize abortion from the  PT program. He assured his CNBB colleagues that the Church will  not support any one candidate.    Mendes de Almeida said at the CNBB assembly: We ought to  meet with all the other presidential candidates, too.</p>

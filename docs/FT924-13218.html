			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: S-E Banken credit losses double to SKr6.85bn SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, suffered a SKr2.607bn (Dollars 474.4m) operating loss in the first eight months of the year, compared with a SKr1.68bn operating profit over the same period of 1991. Operating profits (before loan losses) totalled SKr4.24bn, down 13 per cent on the SKr4.85bn in the same period of last year. Receipts fell 7 per cent to SKr9.3bn. Credit losses have soared over the past eight months to SKr6.85bn, more than twice the SKr3.173bn for the January-August period of last year. Mr Bjorn Svedberg, president and chief executive, refused to make a forecast for the year because of uncertainties over interest rates. SEB says it has problems with 6.3 per cent of its current loans, totalling SKr19.741bn, compared with 3.0 per cent (SKr9.580bn) at the end of last year. Up to 78.2 per cent of credit losses in the first eight months derived from lending to property companies, banks and finance houses.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Extreme political decisions are taken when  politicians find themselves in a hopeless economic situation,  Commander of the Black Sea Fleet Admiral Baltin told INTERFAX  commenting on last week's talks on the Black Sea Fleet.    On 15 April, the Russian and Ukrainian presidents came to  terms on a gradual settlement of the Black Sea Fleet problem on  the basis of the fleet's division. Ukraine is to have 15 to 20  percent of the fleet.    Baltin believes that Ukraine will fail to ensure the combat  efficiency of the ships and the normal functioning of the fleet.  He noted that Ukraine had unilaterally established control over  35 percent of the Black Sea Fleet. So 65, not 100 percent of  the fleet will have to be equally divided, he said.    Baltin also announced that 18 months ago, Ukraine received a  missile cruiser, small antisubmarine boats, small amphibious  ships and a coast-guard boat, all of them new and 65-85 percent  combat ready. None of these ships have been brought to complete  combat readiness, said Baltin.    He pointed out, meanwhile, that if Ukraine had enough money  it would have a unique missile cruiser not to be found either in  the Black Sea, or in the Mediterranean or in the U.S. 6th Fleet.</p>

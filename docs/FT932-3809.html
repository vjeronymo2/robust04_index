			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Trade gap widens to Pounds 4.5bn: Export growth slows sharply despite benefits of sterling devaluation THE FIRST complete set of UK trade figures since the beginning of the year yesterday revealed the biggest quarterly trade gap since 1990 and prompted fears that recession in continental Europe, combined with domestic recovery, would bring about a sharp deterioration in Britain's trade position. The provisional figures showed that the visible trade gap widened to Pounds 4.5bn in the first quarter, compared with Pounds 4.35bn in the final quarter of 1992. The underlying deficit - which excludes oil and erratic items - was also the biggest shortfall for three years at Pounds 5.2bn, compared with Pounds 4.89bn in the previous quarter. The deficit on trade with other countries in the European Community, however, was not as large as expected. New figures compiled under Intrastat  -a system for measuring EC trade flows in line with the single market - showed a deficit of Pounds 1.1bn in the first three months of the year, slightly lower than the Pounds 1.12bn of the previous three-month period. In spite of the competitive edge given to British-made goods by sterling's devaluation last autumn, the growth of export volumes slowed considerably, reflecting the recession in other EC countries. The Central Statistical Office said underlying export volumes rose by only 0.5 per cent quarter-on quarter, while import volumes rose by 3 per cent. The CSO said the trade figures were more than usually likely to be revised, since Intrastat was taking some months to settle down. Economists said the overall deterioration in the trade deficit was limited by a sharp jump in the prices of exports, compared with a more modest rise for import prices. Export prices rose by 6 per cent quarter-on-quarter, against import price rises of 4 per cent. Mr Robert Lind of the Swiss bank UBS said: 'The numbers are consistent with the view that the deficit will deteriorate as recovery gathers pace. They also cast doubt over the Treasury's optimistic view of net-trade volumes this year.' The value of total exports in the first quarter was a provisional Pounds 29.6bn, 7 per cent higher than in the previous quarter. Import values totalled Pounds 34.1bn, also 7 per cent up on the previous three month period. The Treasury pointed out that in spite of the slowdown in export volume growth, exports nevertheless reached record levels in the first quarter. It said: 'UK businesses now have a great opportunity in markets both at home and abroad.' Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said the figures revealed 'just how sickly' the economy was. 'What is most worrying is that with the single market only three months old, our deficit with the EC was twice as bad as it was for the same period last year,' he said.

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> APPALLING SPECTACLE  </P> <P> Three days before Halloween, I went to the Museum of Man's annual haunted house  and was distraught with my findings. Upon entering the museum, the first thing  visitors see is a sign directing them to "Leningrad" and pointing them to the  next room. Meanwhile, on the ground, are people crying for help, acting as  victims of hunger and disease.  </P> <P> In the next room, supposedly "Leningrad," are doctors performing what appears  to be freak medical experiments on their patients. The patients are screaming  while their bones are revealed as stripped of flesh and covered with blood. The  initial impression given is that Leningrad is a place where people are dying  from disease, hunger, and abusive experiments, reminding learned students of  similar experiments from Nazi Germany.  </P> <P> This scene is appalling. It is representative of the type of propaganda that  should not be present in American society. What ideas does this plant in the  minds of our children about the Soviet Union? Exaggerated and dramatized  perceptions of foreign society, such as this, obstruct the movement for good  public relations with fellow world powers. Does this not damage the peaceable  effects of the Soviet arts festival?  </P> <P> In a haunted house, designed for young children, displays of this nature should  be left out. They definitely do not belong in a museum, a place where art and  history are preserved for knowledge and growth.  </P> <P> KENNETH OSGOOD  </P> <P> Coronado  </P></p>

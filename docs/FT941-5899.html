			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Swans' French suitor discounts rival: CMN is finalising a bid price and is close to a deal with receivers of the now leaner Tyneside shipbuilder The French-based company preparing a bid for Swan Hunter yesterday said it saw the apparent interest of Vosper Thornycroft in the Tyneside shipbuilder as a 'spoiler'. Mr Fred Henderson, leader of the Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie team planning to submit a bid to Swan Hunter's receivers later this month, said he believed Southampton-based Vosper was trying to make it more awkward for CMN to bid for the Tyneside yard. CMN's acquisition of Swans would, he suggested, dilute the advantage of a 'British political push' for Vosper, which exports 95 per cent of output and is a rival of CMN in the international market for patrol boats and corvettes. Mr Henderson, chairman of UK-based CMN subsidiary CMN Support Services, said: 'They have a political edge on specific occasions which they would lose the exclusive use of. We have had situations politically where we've lost out to VT although a navy had chosen our design in preference to VT's. It was the British political push.' Vosper might be concerned, he added, that CMN could make available to Swan Hunter its technology in minehunters, another class of vessel where Vosper is strong. Earlier this week Vosper confirmed that it had entered 'exploratory and tentative' talks with Swans' receivers, Price Waterhouse, but refused further comment. It did not wish to speak further yesterday. Swan Hunter went into receivership in May after failing to win a contract for a helicopter carrier, against competition from a consortium of VSEL and Kvaerner. Since then its bitter rivals have been watching its fate with grim fascination. Given the shrinking UK warship market they are unlikely to be enthusiastic at the tenacity of Swans' fight for life and its dogged search for a buyer. Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle East, said: 'The issue is the fight within the industry for what remains of the domestic warship building programme.' CMN is believed to have sought government assurances that if it buys Swans it can compete on equal terms for UK naval orders. Swans' receivers won the chance of selling the company as a going concern when the Ministry of Defence agreed that it could finish three frigates under construction when it went into receivership. They have also retained crucial design skills, maintained the MoD's goodwill, clinched EU agreement for intervention funding and slashed overcapacity. Work on the remaining two frigates is even ahead of schedule. Mr Gordon Horsfield, joint receiver, said: 'Swans is lean, fit and hungry.' Since May the number of employees has been cut from 2,476 to 1,038, more than halving to Pounds 6m the redundancy liability for any purchaser. Vosper's involvement came as a surprise. GEC, which was negotiating to buy Swans before the loss of the helicopter carrier, had been seen as the potential dark horse bidder. GEC refuses to comment. It has had talks with the receivers and remains in touch. 'GEC's still a stalking horse; I wouldn't write it off,' said Mr Dick Gonzales, chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions at Swans. Mr Henderson said he was not greatly concerned about Vosper's apparent interest. CMN lawyers were now doing due diligence checks and CMN and Price Waterhouse were 'flirting' over price but were within a reasonable distance. He expects to make a firm bid this month and getting an 'almost simultaneous' decision. There remains another imponderable if CMN is a sole bidder and offers a low price: the attitude of Lloyds Bank, which Swans owes about Pounds 12m. Lloyds said yesterday that it shared the receivers' objective of selling Swans as a going concern. Mr Gonzales said Swans' sale prospects were finely balanced. 'I would say it's 50/50.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Reporting from Simferopol in the Crimea,  correspondent Vladimir Plotnikov said the Crimean Supreme Soviet  today formed a new delegation for talks with Ukraine. The talks  are to concentrate on "reaching cohesion between the  legislations of the Crimea and Ukraine."    After the first round of these negotiations the Crimean  Supreme Soviet severely criticized its own delegation for making  too many unilateral concessions. "They demanded that the  composition of the working group should be reviewed, and so  today the new composition was approved. The criterion for  inclusion was Crimean patriotism. Only those deputies who had  voted for the restoration of the Crimean Constitution of 6 May  1992 were included in the group."    The working group has been instructed to be guided by the  1992 Constitution, and to "proceed from the idea that in the  process of delimitation of rights and duties between Ukraine and  the autonomous republic, the Crimea is of it own accord  delegating some powers to Ukraine." These are very tough  instructions, Plotnikov said, especially since Ukraine insists  on the revocation of the 1992 Crimean Constitution.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: TJ Hughes jumps to Pounds 333,000 TJ Hughes, the north-west based department store operator, nearly tripled pre-tax profits from Pounds 115,000 to Pounds 333,000 in the half year to July 30. The latest result however, included a 'one-off' Pounds 140,000 receipt arising from the purchase of a new distribution facility. Turnover of the USM-quoted company grew 14 per cent to Pounds 21.1m (Pounds 18.6m) while like-for-like sales growth was over 6 per cent. Sales were particularly strong in early spring and late summer, although TJ's earns the majority of its full year profits - historically over 90 per cent of the total - during its second half. Earnings per share increased to 1.11p (0.39p) and the interim dividend has been stepped up to 0.8p (0.75p).</p>

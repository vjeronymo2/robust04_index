			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati in </F> Tehran on 31 December -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Christians should see how  unlike Jesus Christ they are; how much injustice they committed  last year against the oppressed, especially Muslims; how much  innocent blood they shed; how many women and children died; how  so many people were exposed to extreme cold and heat without  shelter. What did Christians do in Bosnia? It is Christians  who are committing massacres and genocide. They really want  Islam and Muslims not to exist there. They are Christians.    Does that pope, who takes those stances regarding Israel and  recognizes Israel, see what is happening in Bosnia, and what  they are doing there? Of course, they are not Catholics, but  they are nevertheless Christians. He should see what his fellow  Christians are doing. There are some Catholics who act in the  same way; they are not all that innocent of that sort of thing.    Then they should work out what they are going to do next  year, how much corruption there is in those societies, moral  corruption, financial and economic corruption, political  corruption. Various kinds of corruption have penetrated the  depths of Christian society. Are they contemplating reforming  themselves? Are they thinking about bringing the growth of  corruption under control? They are galloping toward doom and  destruction, and they are unaware of it.    We hope that, God willing, Islam will proceed as fast as it  is advancing all over the world at present, and before long,  thanks to the blessings of this Islamic revolution and the blood  of these martyrs, Islam will conquer those countries. [crowd  chants "God is great," "Khamene'i is the leader," "Death to  America," "Death to Israel"]    One of our non-Iranian friends who resides in Europe  traveled  to Iran recently. Yesterday he was telling me some very  optimistic things. He said Islam is growing in Europe in a  spontaneous fashion. The youth there are showing their  inclination toward Islam by growing beards, while the women are  increasingly wearing Islamic dress. It seems, therefore, that  Islam in Europe is growing naturally. Perhaps these Muslims do  not even know the reason for their inclination toward Islam, but  what they do know is that they are enthusiastically interested  in Islam. The attraction of the Islamic revolution and Islam  has influenced them, and unwittingly they are being drawn toward  Islam. The other side, the non-Muslims are resisting this  trend. But the more they resist, the stronger the Muslims will  become.    He also said that the imam's decree on Salman Rushdie, and  the shameful stances adopted by Europe toward the issue, has  made Islam grow. These issues have caused a rejuvenation of  Islamic spirit in Europe at a time when the European Muslims had  all but forgotten their identity.    Our friend said that in Europe there are about 30 million  Muslims, who came to that continent from various countries and  faced degradation, ignorance, and suppression. They were fast  losing their identity, and although they were Muslims, they had  very little Islamic integrity in themselves. When the Salman  Rushdie affair occurred and the imam issued his decree, these  Muslims suddenly recovered their forgotten existence. They  returned to their origins, and found out once again what Islam  is all about. The women became intensely interested in Islamic  dress. This was to such an extent that certain governmental  organs said they would not employ women wearing Islamic dress.  This caused the Muslim women to protest and ask: What do you  exactly require? If you want specialized knowledge, expertise,  and academic qualifications, we possess them all. What  inadequacy do you find in us that induces you to reject us?    This issue in itself has turned into something which on the  one hand has brought disgrace to the governments, and on the  other hand has served to strengthen the resolve of the Muslims.  This is the process which is currently in progress in Europe.    In the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina, no matter how much they  try to cover up the atrocities, they will not remain hidden.  The people are beginning to understand what is being wreaked on  Muslims. They are understanding that the problem is over Islam.  Let me tell you this on the occasion of this very week in which  relief was going to be collected for the Muslims of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The issue there is not that of a group of  hungry Muslims. It is quite right that they are hungry; it is  quite right that they are living under the hardest conditions  from the point of view of the cold weather and shortage of fuel;  that they are living under astronomical high prices. All that  is correct. But if we give assistance and say that one must  help it is not merely because they are hungry, unclothed, and  cold; it is because of the issue of Islam and atheism [kofr].  That is, there Islam and atheism are confronting each other.  And they have resisted bravely for 20 months, are still  resisting, and have not yet surrendered. Bravo to those people;  bravo to that Islam which has given them so much strength! In  that situation we say that Islam must be helped. They want  Islam to cease to be. If those very people, the Bosnian  Muslims, let their Islam go and say they no longer want to be  Muslims, that they have an ethnicity and nationality that goes  beyond Islam, just like you -- rest assured the problem will  then end. Neither will Bosnia be dismembered, nor will the  Serbs aggress. The international policymakers and the players  on the stages of international politics will put an end to the  problem then. But they are suffering all that because they are  Muslims. We say that because they are Muslims Islam must be  helped. The issue is not one of individuals and human beings;  the issue is one of values.    What is being said is that in that same Bosnian war the  people are coming to understand what crimes are being  perpetrated. And what resistance they are putting up. And  automatically the leaning of the pure-hearted youths there  toward Islam increases and their loathing against those  policymakers -- who have created that situation and given  support to the aggressor -- especially Britain which is giving  support in such a way -- will be heightened.    Let's move away from that issue as well. I hope all Muslims  will be roused with fervor; all have a sense of responsibility,  all support Islam and not be so negligent. Is it not shameful  that there are more or less one and a half billion Muslims with  all those resources while so many Muslims are being suppressed  by a bunch of brutal Serbs? Would they not be able to put an  end to the problem by working together? May God awaken them  from their slumber. [passage omitted]    The position of Islamic authority should be maintained and  the Koran expresses the same meaning: People should be in  absolute obedience to this religious authority. [passage  omitted] This position is the hand and shadow of God and is  generally responsible for maintaining divine values. [crowd  chants approval] And as Ayatollah Khamene'i said: Things that  have been achieved by the great religious personalities  throughout history, in terms of power, glory, dignity, and  greatness for Muslims, were because of this absolute obedience.  When an order was issued, Muslims would not hesitate; they  would submit. It was the same with the imams, peace be upon  them, and their followers. In the same manner, the Muslims were  obedient to the sixth Shi'i Imam Sadeq, peace be upon him, and  other imams, peace be upon them, and the ulema and their  successors.    You have seen this and subsequent miracles in the 1892  Tobacco rebellion and other events, when the ulema ordered a  holy war. This must be maintained without damage. This is not  a personal issue. It is not an ordinary human, governmental, or  organizational issue; it is an issue of divine authority.  Obedience to this authority is obedience to God. A sin against  it is a sin against God. [passage omitted] Of course, this does  not mean no one should not make any comments; not at all. Nor  does it mean that the religious scholar or the just jurisprudent  are sinless like the imams. Everybody can express his view and  make suggestions. But obedience must be totally maintained so  as to maintain the power of Islam and Muslims, so as to allow  the divine authority to fight against the worldly powers, as did  our honorable imam [Khomeyni].    There is another issue regarding our honorable and dear  brother, the president, who has been highly praised: Khamene'i  has said that in this country, in the past 60-70 years, we have  not had a leader as capable, honest, and sincere as the  president. In all honesty this was lofty praise. May God also  guard him for us.    There is also an economic issue, and I would like to  concentrate on it. Ayatollah Khamene'i has said: Compare our  situation with those in neighboring countries and see how much  better we are. This is the truth. In analyzing our daily  affairs we should have two perspectives. We should neither deny  the positive points, for this would mean a denial of God's  blessings and would be followed by great punishment. If someone  has truly served, in whatever post, his services should be  recognized and praised. We should also see any possible  problems and act to solve them with all sincerity, honesty, and  without malice. If we maintain the two perspectives, society  will move toward well being, otherwise it will not. If we only  see the good and fail to notice the problems and shortages, we  will naturally error. If we only see the shortages we would be  making another mistake. [passage omitted]    Another issue which his eminence mentioned and to which we  should pay attention was that we should think of a solution to  our economic problems. He explained the issues of production  and consumption. These are issues that do not concern just the  government or just the nation; all must invest in them together.  Production should increase and there is no other way than that,  and consumption should decrease and there is no other solution.  If production does not increase and remains as it is, our  situation will get worse day by day. If consumption is not  controlled and does not decrease, no matter how much more we  produce we will still engage in waste. [passage omitted]    If we stop wasting bread we will be $365 million better off  each year. A great deal can be done with that, and many  problems can be solved with it. A report also mentions that a  third of foodstuffs are wasted in Iran. [passage omitted] What  should be done about that? Who should observe such issues?  That is where imports should be controlled, and that is not a  joking matter. Why should luxury goods be imported? His  eminence the leader also mentioned the same thing. Why should  illegal goods be imported? [passage omitted]    Another issue is the control of luxuries, control of  extravagance, control of foreign travel, and control of  overspending, which should be implemented. Everyone is  responsible. [passage omitted]    Of course, it is possible that some officials might not be  aware of things. Not everyone is aware of the details. But  those who know should feel responsible to confront the issue and  also inform the authorities to say what goes on in such and such  place; what comings and goings are taking place; what kind of  entertaining is going on and what kind of travels take place.  This kind of thing should be stopped and should be decisively  confronted. When a decisive action is taken, a network begins  operating to stop the implementation of that decisive action.  The same corrupt persons have formed a chain; when one of them  is about to be grabbed by the neck, pressure is exerted from  here and there, telephone calls are made, letters are written,  recommendations are made and strings are pulled saying that that  he should be released. Sometimes they defend him saying that it  is a disgrace to prosecute such a person. Is it a disgrace to  implement justice? Who is disgraced if someone who has  committed an act of treason is arrested? Yes, it is possible  that someone might be disgraced. Yes he should be disgraced,  but the grace of Islam, the country and authorities has been  safeguarded and others will be more careful not to commit such  acts. If there is negligence, all become bold. If decisive  action is taken, all take notice. [crowd chants slogans]    On the same subject of prices, I would like to say one more  brief sentence. Alongside all our other preoccupations, we must  also do something for the low-income strata. Some of the high  prices are inevitable, and nothing can be done about them, as in  effect they have been imposed on us. No one, therefore, can be  blamed. However, under the present circumstances, we must do  something about the strata with no income, who cannot endure the  impact of these bone-crushing high prices. We hope, God  willing, these issues are taken into consideration when policies  are being formulated. We know, of course, that these matters  are being attended to. At the same time, prices must also be  controlled, and people should not be left free to sell whatever  they want at any price they wish. [passage omitted]    I wanted to say a few words about the issue of marja'iyat  [the status of being a source of emulation], but I have run out  of time. Very briefly, however, I would like to say I am very  happy that the issue of marja'iyat is at present personified by  His Eminence Grand Ayatollah Araki. We hope that, God willing,  attempts made by others to take it to places [ja-ha] which are  at odds, to say the least, with the system, the state, and the  position of the guardianship of the Muslims' cause, may prove  fruitless, which I am sure they will.

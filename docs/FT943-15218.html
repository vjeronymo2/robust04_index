			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Shake-up of 'archaic' accounting moves closer Government proposals are due this week on radical changes to the way the public sector presents its accounts, bringing it more in line with the private sector. The Treasury is expected to issue a green paper in the middle of the week laying out its ideas on a shift from cash to accruals accounting. The details follow a commitment made by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in his Budget speech last November, when he called the existing system used by government 'archaic'. At the time, the Treasury said it planned to issue proposals on the idea in the first half of 1994. The changes are likely to introduce for the first time into the accounts of government departments' non-cash items such as depreciation of assets, superannuation and insurance. They will focus on outputs and results and will require information on assets, cashflows and service agreements. They should have widespread implications for accountability and implications for future management practices. Local government, privatised companies, universities and executive agencies are among the organisations that have already begun to introduce accounting changes to bring them more in line with practice in business. Accruals accounting is already used by the New Zealand government. In Australia, it has been introduced at federal level and for the state governments of New South Wales and Victoria. The US and Canadian authorities are both considering its introduction.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Mortgage lending shows autumn dip Net mortgage lending in November fell back to Pounds 1.65bn from Pounds 1.88bn in October, figures from the Bank of England showed yesterday. The statistics, however, still show a pick-up in lending from the first half of 1993, when the monthly figures averaged Pounds 1.2bn. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents building societies and centralised lenders such as banks, said the figures showed that mortgage lending remained robust. In terms of net lending, building societies continued to lose market share to banks. The seasonally adjusted figures in November stood at just less than Pounds 1.1bn for banks and Pounds 600m for societies. The number and amount of new loans approved, however, showed the building societies picking up a larger share than the banks. Overall, loans approved in November were Pounds 4.7bn, up from Pounds 4.3bn in October, with building societies claiming Pounds 3bn. Mr Coles said the overall rise in level of loans approved, confirmed the council's view that the housing-market recovery could be expected to strengthen during 1994. Bank and building society lending is a key component of M4, the broadest indicator used by the government to measure the money supply. Final figures for M4, published yesterday, showed seasonally adjusted growth of 4.9 per cent between November 1992 and November 1993. Such an annual increase is towards the bottom of the government's 3 per cent to 9 per cent monitoring range. However, growth in M4 has picked up recently; the annualised growth rate in the three months to November was 7.1 per cent. Meanwhile, the shorter leading index, published yesterday by the Central Statistical Office, confirmed evidence of economic recovery by rising 0.7 per cent in the month to November. The index is designed to pinpoint turning points in economic activity five months in advance. November's rise, based on only three of the five index constituents, was caused largely by the strength in share prices.</p>

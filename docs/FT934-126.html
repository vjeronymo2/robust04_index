			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Italy's Inflation continues to fall Italy's annualised inflation rate fell to 4 per cent in December, the lowest level in 24 years, writes Robert Graham. According to Istat, the national statistics office, consumer prices registered zero growth in December, as part of a continuing downward trend in the overall level of inflation. The potential inflationary effects of the devaluation of the lira have been offset by depressed domestic demand. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, predicted earlier this week that inflation could be at an annualised rate of 2.5 per cent by the end of 1994.</p>

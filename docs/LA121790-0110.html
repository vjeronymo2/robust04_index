			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT: INSIDERS HIT FLASH POINT  </P> <P> Corporate insiders are rapidly changing their minds about the value in their  own stocks. That could be bad news for the struggling market rally.  </P> <P> The Insiders newsletter of Ft. Lauderdale tracks the number of insiders buying  and selling their own companies' shares. The insiders must publicly disclose  their transactions in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> As the stock market sank in October and early November, insiders were wildly  snapping up their own shares -- a clear sign that they felt that the stocks  were dramatically undervalued. The Insiders newsletter's "Flash index," which  measures insider transactions over the most recent 30 days, counted nine buyers  for every one seller in October. That 90% reading was an all-time high -- and  it coincided with the start of the market's recent rally, which has lifted the  Dow Jones industrial index to 2,593.81 as of Friday, from 2,365 in October.  </P> <P> But in the past few weeks, insider buying has been on the wane. The Flash index  tumbled to 75% buyers by Dec. 4. And as of Dec. 12, the latest available, the  index was 60%, says Norman Fosback, editor of the Insiders.  </P> <P> Worse, a shorter-term Flash index, measuring trades over the past 20 days, fell  to 52% last week, Fosback says. That still means 52% buyers to 48% sellers, but  it's obvious that stock prices aren't nearly as interesting to insiders as they  were at October's lows.  </P> <P> Does the slide in insider buying mean that the rally is over? Fosback doesn't  think so. "If the index were a lot lower, I'd be concerned," he says. Still,  the rate of drop in the buying in recent weeks is very steep and bears  watching, he admits.  </P> <P> Teradata's Rising Star: Teradata Corp., the Los Angeles-based computer firm, is  in the middle of the hostile takeover battle between American Telephone &amp;  Telegraph Co. and NCR Corp. From Teradata shareholders' viewpoint, the middle  isn't such a bad place to be.  </P> <P> NCR owns 9.4% of Teradata and has been working closely with the company on new  technology. The two firms have side-by-side operations in San Diego as part of  a joint development agreement.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T wants NCR for the company's computer technology. Because Teradata's  expertise is key to NCR's technology, AT&amp;T in essence needs Teradata almost  as much as it needs NCR. What's more, AT&amp;T is already Teradata's largest  customer.  </P> <P> What this tangled web means, basically, is that Teradata probably has much  greater value than the stock market currently is assigning it -- but maybe not  in the short term. The stock closed at $12 Friday, up 75 cents for the day. It  has rebounded from a low of $6.75 in November but remains far below its 1990  high of $35.50.  </P> <P> Teradata's computers are very high-priced systems known as relational database  computers, which allow users such as AT&amp;T to keep track of trillions of  data bits. After Iraq invaded Kuwait, and recession fears mounted in September,  orders dried up as many corporate customers delayed capital spending decisions.  </P> <P> The result: Teradata reported a loss of 50 cents a share in the quarter ended  Sept. 30. A turnaround in profits may not arrive until mid-1991, because  customers are likely to remain cautious about spending. Rick Martin, analyst at  Prudential-Bache Securities, sees earnings of just 25 cents a share for the  year that will end next June 30. The company earned $1.25 a share last year.  </P> <P> Some traders who have jumped into Teradata stock recently are betting that  either 1) NCR will bid for all of Teradata, as a way to make itself too  expensive for AT&amp;T, or 2) AT&amp;T will win NCR and eventually swallow  Teradata as well.  </P> <P> On Friday, NCR rejected AT&amp;T's $6.1-billion offer. But some analysts say it  would make little sense for NCR now to buy all of Teradata to try to halt  AT&amp;T. Even if NCR were to bid $35.50 a share for Teradata -- the stock's  all-time high -- the price would come to just $540 million. It's hard to  imagine that such a merger would decrease NCR's attractiveness, when AT&amp;T  itself spends millions of dollars on Teradata systems.  </P> <P> "For both of these companies (AT&amp;T and NCR), Teradata is very strategic,"  says Jim Reynolds, analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> As for a potential purchase of Teradata by AT&amp;T down the road, analysts  caution that AT&amp;T wouldn't need to buy the entire firm to reap the benefits  of the technology. And, in fact, folding Teradata into AT&amp;T might ruin  Teradata's entrepreneurial spirit.  </P> <P> So it's clear that any bet on the stock now should only be for the long term.  The firm's sales success -- from $17 million in 1986 to $224 million in the  recent fiscal year -- shows that its systems have enormous acceptance. The  interest in Teradata by NCR and AT&amp;T merely confirms the potential in the  technology. So beyond the current economic slump, there's good reason to assume  that the firm's sales will rebound. But until the orders begin to flow again,  the stock could languish -- and a takeover seems remote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE SELLERS REIGN  </P> <P> Among NYSE stocks, insiders have sold these heaviest over the past year. Some  issues show heavy selling because insiders got generous stock options.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.88IN:3.21IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Number of insiders:  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Stock  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Buying  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Selling  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> General Motors  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 40  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Motorola  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 33  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Procter &amp; Gamble  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 23  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Gap Inc.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 21  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> U.S. Surgical  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 20  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Baxter Intl.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 19  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Humana  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 18  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Readers Digest  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 18  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Wal-Mart  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 18  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dillard Dept.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Through Dec. 4.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News release issued by the Government of the Republic of </F> Angola in Luanda on 7 February--read by announcer]    [Text] The Government of the Republic of Angola regrets  having to inform the Angolan and international public about the  resumption of offensive actions by National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] troops throughout the country,  particularly their direct aggression on the martyred city of  Cuito, the capital of Bie Province, on 5 February 1994. These  criminal actions fit within the framework of the campaign woven  by Jonas Savimbi's organizations to undermine peace efforts made  by the Angolan Government and the international community in  Lusaka. Accordingly, UNITA seeks to protract the suffering of  the Angolan people unnecessarily, and to worsen the tragic  situation faced by the residents of Bie Province, who are once  again deprived of international humanitarian assistance. It is  significant to note that whenever alleged progress is reported  at the peace talks, UNITA invents (?attempts), reports military  offensives that have not taken place, and, as is the case now,  resorts to the force of arms to gain new positions on the battle  front.    The Government of the Republic of Angola urges all the  Angolan people to be vigilant against UNITA's maneuvers, and  expects the international community, particularly the United  Nations to keep up their diplomatic pressure, including  sanctions against that organization to make it desist of its  warmongering stance, and to make it to negotiate a just and  lasting peace within the spirit of national reconciliation.    The military adventure that has been undertaken will have no  effect at the negotiating table. The Angolan Government will  not give in to absurd demands that UNITA might make in  contravention of the constitutional and democratic order that  has been established in the country since the September 1992  elections.    The Government of the Republic of Angola remains committed  to  gaining peace through negotiations, and to searching for ways to  resume humanitarian assistance to Cuito. Yet, it cannot remain  indifferent to yet another offensive or else it would put at  stake the survival of the affected residents and the protection  of state institutions.</p>

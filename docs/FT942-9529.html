			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: Shades of Berio On the South Bank this week, the next-to-last instalments of the Lucian Berio festival were mezza voce and secretive: his 1984 'in memoriam' for Cathy Berberian, Requies, and his recent third quartet Notturno, commissioned by the South Bank with the Vienna Konzerthaus. Tonight's final instalment, a semi-staged performance of his Calvino opera La vera storia, will be noisier. Franz Welser-Most conducted the London Philharmonic in Berio's last piece for Cathy, the inspired performer who was his first wife. Requies stretches an almost-melody - Berio calls it a 'shadow' that 'describes' a melody - slowly and gently through an aqueous texture of muted tremoli and floating whispers. The lyrical gist slips continually from one instrument to another, hazed or soft-filtered by chimes and dulcet marimbas. Its shadow-silhouette will stand out more when the LPO has had more time to play the piece in. There are the merest hints of protesting regret; otherwise a kind of measured, serene melancholy reigns. Mahler's 'Resurrection' Symphony followed. Hardly a response to the Requies; but in the wider festival-context, a neat choice after Berio's Sinfonia the week before, which famously enlists Mahler's scherzo as the running basis for its wicked collage of Great Post-Romantic Snippets. As a Mahler performance, it was the latest of Welser-Most's well-planned, narrow-chested, slightly over-anxious assaults on some post-Romantic peak. From the arrival of the solo voices, Marjana Lipovsek's warmly expressive mezzo and Felicity Lott's translucent, artfully fragile soprano, the performance took wing. Before that, the conductor had treated the opening movement - which all Mahlerians know to be a tumult of seismic upheavals, piercing laments and bursts of sardonic gall - as a quick-march with interesting surprises. The Andante and the scherzo were tame, under-pointed. But the later stages of the symphony warmed to a fine blaze, especially once the London Philharmonic Choir stood up; they sat for their first quiet entries, at palpable cost to the depth of their tone. On Thursday the Alban Berg Quartet played Berio's Notturno rather as they had played Haydn's 'Sunrise' Quartet, op. 76 no. 4: with exquisite balance and shading, and such cool composure as to dilute any latent drama. The Notturno is a highly patterned affair, in which distinct kinds of material and diction are constantly rotated, varied rather than developed. A great deal of that is in suppressed pianissimo, a-whisper with trills, sul ponticello croaks and tiny flickering figures, which the players turned brilliantly. For once, Bartok must have been standing behind Berio's shoulder: the Notturno sounded like a natural development from certain movements in the older composer's later quartets. To spot the kinship, however, was also to notice that Berio's beautifully-made piece lacked - in this performance, at least - a sense of arriving anywhere definite in its closing phases, unlike anything Bartok ever composed. It seemed as if it could equally have stopped two minutes sooner, or four, or six, without any loss of effect. I fancied that a more purposeful structure might be concealed there than we heard.</p>

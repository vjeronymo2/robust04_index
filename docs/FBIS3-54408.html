			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman (Petra)--His Royal Highness Crown Prince  Hasan, the Regent, Wednesday called for the establishment of a  religious institute whose main task would be the promotion of  inter-faith dialogue in the Middle East, since this region is  the source of monotheistic religions.    In the concluding session of the 11th Islamic Christian  dialogue which was organised by the Royal Academy for Islamic  Civilisation Research in cooperation with the Vatican council on  promoting relations with other faiths, Prince Hasan said such an  insitute would contribute to crystallising thoughts and ideas  promoting the cause of peace in the region.    Conveying to the participants in the dialogue the greetings  of His Majesty King Husayn, Prince Hasan stressed the need to  expand the participation of youth in inter-faith dialogue and to  make such meetings include the participation of all segments of  society other than the elite only. He said that he believes  university and college curricula should include ideas and  concepts affirming the importance of inter-faith dialogue.    Statements issued by the Vatican condemning the occupier and  aggressor at any time and in any place had contributed to  shedding light on the tragedies of many people, including the  Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Prince said.    The Crown Prince proposed making the Mediterranean Sea  linking the Arab World and Europe instead of being a sea  splitting the two.    "Some people are ignorant about the essence of the Islamic  message and accuse it of extremism at a time when 80 per cent of  the world's refugees and displaced persons are Muslims," Prince  Hasan said.    Cardinal Francis Arinze, president of the Vatican council on  promoting relations with other faiths, also addressed the  gathering held at the Royal Court, saying the two-day conference  signified the depth of understanding between the followers of  Islam and Christianity, who represent more than half of the  world's population.    "We should all work for the good of humanity to create a  better world and make a brighter future for all people,"  Cardinal Arinze said. "Providence had brought us here and  facilitated the holding of this dialogue at the present time in  history to work together seriously to achieve this goal through  the exploitation of all available means, including the media,  which as we have seen in the past, had the greatest influence in  making it easier for us to achieve our goals."    The cardinal voiced hope that this meeting will be an  incentive for the participants to be more prepared for the next  meeting which will be held in 1995 in Rome under the motto:  "Religion and the Environment."    The Vatican official voiced admiration of the special  relationship between Muslims and Christians in Jordan and  commended the Islamic-Christian joint culture which represents  the accumulation of centuries-old relationships distinguished  for justice and peace.    The cardinal presented Prince Hasan with the Arabic  translation of old scrolls as a token gift.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Son Song-pil, our country's ambassador to Russia,  held a news conference with reporters in Moscow on 9 March in  connection with the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. In  the conference, the ambassador briefed the content of a  statement by Kang Sok-chu, first vice foreign minister, to  reporters and said: Our country and the United States agreed to  take a joint action for a solution to the nuclear issue in New  York on 25 February. According to the agreement the  International Atomic Energy Agency's inspection has started,  beginning on 1 March, a working-level contact for the exchange  of special envoys between the North and the South has resumed,  and a statement was announced regarding the suspension of the  Team Spirit joint military exercise.    It is good thing that the agreement was reached on the joint  action and that the work for their realization has begun.  However, the measures taken for the joint action are still on a  primary level [kichojok] and are nothing but a beginning. The  problem we have now is how to implement the agreement.    If the measures for the joint action are properly  implemented  the DPRK-U.S. talks will be able to proceed smoothly and the  nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula will be able to be  resolved completely [kunwonjokuro]. The problem is that  barriers [nangwan] should not be created by putting forth  conditions. If barriers are created the situation will become  grave again.    We want the United States not to create obstacles to the  implementation of the agreement any longer. The people in the  world, as well, hope that the agreement reached between the DPRK  and the United States is implemented as it is and that,  accordingly, the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is  resolved peacefully.    However, acts are emerging now which arouse suspicions in  implementing the DPRK-U.S. agreement on the measures for the  joint action. In particular, Japan, not satisfied with the  agreement between the DPRK and the United States, is kicking off  a commotion, babbling that a special inspection should be  conducted and the like. Japan is trying to hinder a solution to  the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and, thus, is aiming  at justifying its nuclear armament. Japan has stockpiled large  quantities of plutonium and completed the means of delivery of  nuclear weapons.    Now that Japan's nuclear armament has reached a very  dangerous stage we cannot but enhance our alertness to this. It  is because if Japan is armed with nuclear weapons the  denuclearization of Northeast Asia cannot be realized nor will  the declaration of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula be  meaningful. Therefore, to achieve the overall denuclearization  of the Korean peninsula and the Northeast Asian region, Japan's  nuclear armament must be thoroughly blocked.    Whether or not the agreement on the measures for the joint  action is faithfully implemented depends entirely on the U.S.  side. We will keenly watch the U.S. side's actions. If the  U.S. side fails to implement the agreement with unwarranted  pretexts we will take corresponding countermeasures against it.    The ambassador also revealed the South Korean authorities'  crime of destroying the ecological environment and doing harm to  people's health by dumping nuclear waste on sea. He then  answered questions raised by reporters.</p>

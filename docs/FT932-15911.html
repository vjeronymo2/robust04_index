			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Oil explorers warn of tax threat NORTH SEA oil operators are preparing to warn the government that they will scale down oil exploration severely if changes to Petroleum Revenue Tax proposed in the Budget become law. The UK Offshore Operators' Association, the oil industry group, has drafted a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry, saying that many companies will be unable to meet previous commitments made to the government over future drilling activity because of the planned PRT changes. A survey published yesterday by Ernst and Young, the accountants, found that 85 per cent of oil companies expect job losses to result from the PRT changes. Some 40 per cent of the respondents expected job losses to be much higher than the Treasury's estimate of 10,000. The changes to the PRT regime would reduce the tax rate for existing oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it for new fields. The chancellor also proposed to abolish tax relief for exploration and appraisal work. This means that companies will have to pay 64p for every pound spent on drilling activity, compared with 17p now. Companies say they applied for previous licences to explore for oil in the North Sea on the basis that the rules would stay the same. As part of those applications, they committed themselves to drilling a certain number of wells. If no tax relief is available for exploration, many companies will be unable to fulfil their obligations, the industry argues. But its response to the new rules is complicated by a row between winners and losers from the changes. Amerada Hess has said it will halve its exploration activity, but British Petroleum said the changes would improve recovery of oil from existing fields. Last year 116 wells were drilled and some estimates expect this to drop to just 80 this year as a result of the depressed oil price and the PRT changes. Oil sector at odds, Page 9</p>

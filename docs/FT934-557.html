			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Israel and PLO still beg to differ Israel and the PLO failed to settle differences over control of borders between Gaza and Egypt and the West Bank area of Jericho and Jordan in peace talks in France yesterday, Julian Ozanne reports. The two sides agreed to consider a compromise whereby Israel would retain a veto over who could enter the West Bank and Gaza but the Palestinians would man separate checkpoints and deal with immigration, customs and tax formalities. The negotiators meet again in Cairo on Monday.</p>

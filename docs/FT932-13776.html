			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Sir Philip Shelbourne: Obituary SIR Philip Shelbourne, who died last Thursday aged 68, was a merchant banker and chairman of Britoil, the largest oil exploration group operating in the North Sea until it was taken over by British Petroleum in 1988. Sir Philip started his career as a barrister, moving to a partnership at Rothschilds merchant bank in 1962. He was chairman of Samuel Montagu when he was appointed chairman of the British National Oil Corporation in 1980. Sir Philip enjoyed power and influence, according to close associates, and his appointment to the corporation was controversial because of his lack of industry experience. Sir Alastair Morton, the corporation's managing director at the time and now chairman of Eurotunnel, resigned. The government sold 51 per cent of the corporation to the public in 1982, with the rest sold three years later. This left it vulnerable to takeover and BP launched a hostile bid in 1987. When BP was successful, Sir Philip retired. But in the course of the takeover bid the terms of his contract with Britoil became public, causing a furore. His retirement package included a Pounds 40,000-a-year salary and a Pounds 92-a-day lunch allow-ance. It was widely seen as a symbol of corporate excess at a time when oil companies were strapped for cash. BP terminated the package when it took over the company.</p>

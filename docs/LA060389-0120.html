			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SAUGUS SEEKS BASEBALL TITLE IN 3-A FINAL  </P> <P> Saugus High will attempt to win the first baseball title in its 14-year history  today when the Golden League champion Centurions play Kennedy of La Palma for  the Southern Section 3-A Division championship at 1 p.m. at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> "We've played some tough teams. But this team has really good chemistry," said  Coach Doug Worley, who led Saugus to the 2-A Division title game in 1986 before  losing to Artesia. "I think we're strong everywhere."  </P> <P> Especially when it comes to pitching. The game will bring to a close the  magnificent high school career of senior right-hander Roger Salkeld, who  probably will make a beeline for professional baseball after Monday's amateur  draft.  </P> <P> Salkeld (6-foot-5, 210 pounds) is 13-0 with 168 strikeouts in 100 1/3 innings  and is expected to be an early first-round draft choice, according to Sports  Illustrated, ESPN and Baseball America. Salkeld's career record is 30-6 and he  has 395 strikeouts in 257 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Salkeld, who posted his second postseason complete-game win in Tuesday's 10-3  semifinal win over Ontario, is expected to start. Senior left-hander Scott  Warr, who is 8-2 with a 1.77 earned-run average, is available for relief duty.  Warr also leads Saugus (23-4-2) with seven home runs.  </P> <P> Kennedy Coach Chris Pascal says that his team is ready and waiting for Salkeld.  </P> <P> "Our guys are anxious to see the guy," Pascal said. "They respect him, but  we're gonna go after him. My kids have risen to the occasion all year."  </P> <P> Kennedy (25-5), which won the Garden Grove League title -- its first league  title in 20 years -- has made a turnaround under Pascal. Last season, Kennedy  posted its first winning record in 19 years.  </P> <P> "There are liable to be some big boys on the hill," said Pascal, who is in his  fourth year.  </P> <P> The Fighting Irish have their own 6-foot-5, hard-throwing right-hander. Senior  Greg Hansell (12-1, 1.36 ERA) is scheduled to start. Hansell, a four-year  varsity player, has posted two playoff wins and has a 23-12 career record.  </P> <P> Senior right-hander Pete Montera (11-2, 0.95 ERA) also is 2-0 in the playoffs.  Shortstop Steve Rath, another four-year varsity member, is batting .446 and has  45 hits.  </P> <P> For Saugus, senior outfielder Matt Tull is batting .448 with a school-record 14  doubles this season. Senior center fielder Darrell Davis, who bats leadoff, has  29 stolen bases. Davis stole a school-record 30 bases last season.  </P></p>

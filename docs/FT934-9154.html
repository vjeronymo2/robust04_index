			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Pohl sees jobs crisis as main European task 'THE REAL issue' facing Europe is the task of reducing unemployment, combined with the challenge of opening the west of the continent to the former eastern bloc, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former Bundesbank president, said last night. The objective of the Maastricht Treaty for establishing fixed exchange rates and a common monetary policy in Europe was no longer the main priority. 'The question of whether the Maastricht Treaty will ever be implemented is open, to say the least.' But conditions for economic and monetary union were 'much less favourable' than in the 1980s. Mr Pohl voiced doubts over whether the anti-inflation consensus espoused by the treaty would prove durable in view of the 'tremendous problems' facing Europe. These included the consequences of German unification, where he pointed to errors over the introduction of the D-Mark into east Germany in 1990 and a wrong mixture of budgetary and monetary policies as contributing to high German interest rates after unity. German unemployment, now officially 3.5m, was the highest since the great depression of the 1930s. But German unemployment was nearer 5m-6m if hidden joblessness were included. 'It's obvious this is the real issue; it's the same problem in Spain or France.' German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will deliver a government statement on Europe today in the wake of a controversy triggered by sceptical comments on European union from a key conservative ally, Reuter reports from Bonn. Mr Kohl has so far not reacted directly to remarks by Bavaria's state premier Edmund Stoiber that his vision of Europe is outdated, and that the goal of a federal Europe, almost holy writ in post-war German foreign policy, should be abandoned. But Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in an interview in yesterday Express newspaper that Mr Stoiber's comments 'did us damage, and not just a little. My colleagues ..are worried Germany could be departing from the common goals of the Community.'</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Peace cost put at Dollars 1.55bn THE peacekeeping operation in Somalia that the United Nations is proposing to begin on May 1, replacing most of the US troops there, will cost Dollars 1.55bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in the initial 12-month period, according to an estimate given to the Security Council yesterday. This is more than the official estimate of Dollars 1.41bn for Cambodia, now the most expensive such UN enterprise. However, the final Cambodian bill is expected to be nearer Dollars 2bn. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, based the figures for Somalia on a military force of 20,000 with 8,000 additional logistical support staff, plus about 2,800 civilian personnel. In his report he proposed that the General Assembly, which would have to approve the budget, declares this to be an expense of the entire organisation shared by all 180 member states, with the US the biggest contributor. The cost of the military component of the operation was placed at Dollars 836m, with an additional Dollars 180m for air operations. It would bring UN peacekeeping expenses for 13 operations this year to a total of Dollars 4.205bn, about four times the regular budget. Somalia's feuding factions, clan elders, and religious leaders began yesterday what has been billed as a 'last chance' to salvage their wrecked nation, Reuter adds from Addis Ababa.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan marks time awaiting Fiat results MOST bourses were shut for the Whitsun holiday, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN, which had only just absorbed Friday's disappointing results from Montedison, awaited Fiat's 1992 figures, which were expected after the close of business. While most forecasts were for Fiat to announce a cut in its dividend for 1992 - estimates varied between a reduction of L80 and L150 from the 1991 dividend of L230 - some analysts commented that anything worse was likely to lead to overall selling in the market today. Fiat ordinary shares were L20 higher at L5,880, before slipping to L5,750 on the kerb. The savings and privileged shares fell respectively by 2.5 per cent and 3.6 per cent. The Comit index ended 0.46 easier at 538.99. Montedison was fixed L25 lower at L1,105 as a 30 per cent rise in first-quarter turnover helped to offset the negative impact of a 1992 loss of L1,244bn. Meanwhile, Ferruzzi, the holding group of Montedison, picked up L13 to L1,076: it had reported a loss of L1,519bn after Friday's close. Some brokers noted that investors had taken account of the conglomerate's decision to seek outside shareholders in an effort to reduce debt. Other gainers on the day included Stet, up L16 to L3,092, and Sip, ahead L20 at L1,976. Generali rose L80 to L36,780 but Olivetti lost L33 to L1,327. In the banking sector, Credito Italiano advanced L59 to L2,974 and Banca Commerciale Italiana put on L90 at L5,621. MADRID's general index fell 1.58 to 257.19, one week before the June 6 general election. In London, Mr David Roche, global strategist at Morgan Stanley, was inclined to believe that the fortunes of the Partido Populare, rivalling the socialist incumbent led by Mr Felipe Gonzales, were looking up ahead of last night's televised debates between the party leaders. Looking at a number of post-election scenarios last Friday, Mr Roche said an outright victory by the PP could lead to a push for growth, the float of the peseta outside the ERM and a dramatic reduction in interest rates. HELSINKI was quiet and the Hex index slipped 2.5 to 1,211.4 as turnover dropped to FM97.8m from Friday's FM173.7m. Some brokers observed that investors were awaiting interim reports, which start to be published from tomorrow. TEL AVIV's Mishtanim index retreated 2.45, or 1.2 per cent, to 203.34 following last week's gains, particularly in the banking sector.</p>

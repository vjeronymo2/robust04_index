			<p>BFN     [Text] On 31 May, accompanied by Wang Xianmin, standing  committee member and secretary general of the provincial party  committee, Yue Qifeng, secretary of the provincial party  committee, visited the office of the provincial government, met  with responsible comrades of the provincial government and its  overall departments, exchanged ideas with them, and discussed  with them the great matter of developing Heilongjiang.    Tian Fengshan, acting governor of the provincial government;  and Cong Fukui, Zhou Tienong, Yang Zhihai, and Wang Zongzhang,  vice governors of the provincial government, were present at the  meeting.    Yue Qifeng said that we should further deeply study the  third  volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and use  the theory on building the socialism with Chinese  characteristics to liberate and army our ideas and to guide our  work.    Yue Qifeng said: How to strengthen and improve the  leadership of the party is also an important issue. We should  bring into full play the functions of the government and its  functional departments. The provincial party committee will go  all out to support the work of the government.    In regard to the economic work, Yue Qifeng said: I agree to  the ideology of extension in five aspects and acceleration in  two aspects. The key is [words indistinct]. To really target  and see results, we should emancipate the mind and change our  ideas, the party as a whole should be mobilized, and all people  should go into action. It is necessary to achieve the  transformation and reform of state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises and to develop agriculture. We should also  cultivate new economic growing points and pioneer the second  battle field for the economy. That is, we should vigorously  develop town and township enterprises, the industries run by  districts and neighborhood committees, private and individual  enterprises, three types of foreign-funded enterprises, the  tertiary industry, and new high-tech enterprises. The  governments at various levels should emancipate the mind, create  conditions, offer policies to support the development of the  enterprises and industries of these kinds. All departments  should deeply conduct investigations and study and work out  methods. Only by so doing will the ideology of five extensions  and two accelerations not become an empty talk.    Yue Qifeng said: Local officers should do deeds for  localities. We should pay attention to the development of the  local economy. Only when the local economy is developed will the  overall situation be better inspired.    Yue Qifeng said: How to build our party in the new  historical period is an important task. The issues of what we  should grasp to promote party building, who should grasp party  building, and how to grasp party building should be explored.  Viewing the general situation, we know that party building and  the spiritual civilization are still two weak links at present.  We should not only see that our party has prestige, combat  effectiveness, and prospects but also not ignore the existing  problems. So, we should persist in the principle of being sure  that both hands are tough.    Acting Governor Tian Fengshan set forth requirements for the  work of the provincial government.    He said: The major task of the provincial government is to  implement to the letter the principles and policies of the party  Central Committee and the State Council and the policy decisions  of the provincial party committee. What is the most important  task at present is that the leaders at various levels should  concentrate their energy, be inspired with enthusiasm, be  diligent in performing their official duties, quietly immerse  themselves in hard work, and achieve their work in a  down-to-earth manner. The leaders at various levels should go  deep to the rural areas and enterprises, get in touch with the  grass roots, and bravely overcome difficulties and solve  problems. The government should embody the policy of taking a  two-hand approach in dealing with its work, ensure the smooth  implementation of government decrees, strengthen the improvement  of administrative honesty and diligence, resolutely correct the  unhealthy trends within trades, firmly foster the thinking of  service, and build itself into a government with high efficiency  and administrative honesty and enjoying prestige among the  masses of the people.</p>

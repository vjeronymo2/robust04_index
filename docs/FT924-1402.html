			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Pay rises for clerical and management staff have been around 3.5 per cent, says analysis PAY RISES for most clerical and management staff covered by awards in the past three months have been around 3.5 per cent, close to the rate of inflation, according to the latest quarterly analysis from Hay Management Consultants, David Goodhart writes. For the year to October, however, pay rises averaged 6.2 per cent - slightly higher than the rise in national average earnings for the same period of 5.5 per cent. Hay predicts average salary increases of 4 per cent over the next 12 months. About 10 per cent of the 568 organisations surveyed said they had implemented pay freezes for periods of between six and 12 months. About 50 per cent have frozen additional payments for skill shortages and 10 per cent have reduced them. A report from the Public Finance Foundation found that public-sector pay in the year to October 1992 had risen 6.4 per cent against 5.3 per cent in the private sector. Inflation increased by 3.6 per cent in the year to October.</p>

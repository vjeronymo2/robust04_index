He made the remark here this afternoon at a news conference.    "There are great potentials for cooperation between our two  countries. The agreement on trade and economy signed by the two  governments will provide a firm legal basis for our future  cooperation," said Meciar.    "China has a huge market as well as great economic  potential,  which is sure to expand in the future. We are glad to have  opportunities to cooperate with China."    Meciar emphasized:" the People's Republic of China is one of  the first countries which recognized Slovakia's independence,  and is also the first Asian country to set up an embassy in the  capital of Slovakia."    Meciar said Slovak people attach great importance to such an  attitude by China to Slovakia.    Replying to a question about Taiwan, Meciar said that the  Government of People's Republic of China is the sole legal  Government of China, and Slovakia does not support Taiwan's  admission into the United Nations.    "The trade and commercial relations between Slovakia and  Taiwan will never grow to the stage or level of political  recognition," Meciar said.    He noted that the issue of Taiwan is China's internal  affair,  and it is only the Chinese people who can decide the arrangement  concerning Taiwan.    Meciar also answered questions about regional issues in  Europe.    Meciar and his party visited the Great Wall this morning and  left for Shanghai, the biggest industrial city in China, this  afternoon.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MWD FINDS NEW CHEMICAL SPILL IN YORBA LINDA CREEK  </P> <P> On the same day last week when criminal charges were filed against the  Metropolitan Water District of Southern California for a toxic spill in a Yorba  Linda creek, a second spill fouled the same creek.  </P> <P> "It couldn't have been more horrible timing," MWD spokesman Jay Malinowski said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Feb. 6 spill involved a nontoxic substance, but state water quality  officials say they are investigating to determine if the water district, the  biggest in Southern California, violated its discharge permit.  </P> <P> The chemical that spilled from the water treatment plant in Yorba Linda was a  substance known as alum, or aluminum oxide, and is not considered toxic in low  concentrations, said Kurt Berchtold, a supervising engineer for the state  Regional Water Quality Control Board in Riverside.  </P> <P> "But it's not something we like to see routinely discharged," Berchtold said.  </P> <P> Last week, the Orange County district attorney's office filed felony charges  against the district and misdemeanor charges against four top MWD officials for  the Oct. 26 spill of 466 gallons of caustic soda into Telegraph Canyon Creek.  </P> <P> The district faces a possible $1-million fine, and each of its officers faces a  $75,000 fine and three years' imprisonment on charges of negligence and  knowingly disregarding the law. MWD has denied any criminal wrongdoing.  </P> <P> In the Feb. 6 spill, an estimated 10 gallons of alum sludge spilled into the  creek after workers poured the sludge into a holding pond for use in the water  treatment process, said Bob Gomperz, another MWD spokesman. The alum foamed up  out of the holding pond and into the creek because the pond was dry for the  first time in recent memory.  </P> <P> When water is in the pond, Gomperz explained, the alum reacts to help coagulate  smaller suspended particles in the water into larger ones that can be more  easily skimmed off. But since there was no water, Gomperz said, the alum turned  into white-gray foam in the pond and a strong wind at the time blew it over the  side.  </P> <P> The spill was not discovered until the next day, Gomperz said, when workers  discovered the foam coating a 200-foot stretch of the creek, which leads down  to the Chino Hills State Park.  </P> <P> Gomperz said that while it was not toxic, the alum is not supposed to be  discharged into the creek. A state official said the MWD is permitted only to  discharge 6,000 gallons of treated water per day into the creek.  </P> <P> "Only from an aesthetic point of view are we in possible violation of our  permit," Gomperz said, adding that the foam was quickly mopped up the day it  was found and that the district promptly notified state water quality  officials.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Nolan said her office is investigating the latest spill.  </P> <P> The October spill occurred, MWD officials said, when a pressure relief valve  malfunctioned and the caustic soda backed up into an underground drain line  that discharges into the creek. The spill was not detected until two days  later.  </P> <P> Nolan said her office has documents showing that the MWD had known since at  least 1984 that caustic soda -- used at the plant to reduce the water acidity  level -- would overflow into the creek if there was a malfunction of a pressure  relief valve. The soda, which consists of sodium hydroxide, burns the skin on  contact.  </P></p>

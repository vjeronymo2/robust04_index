			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Western Selection At March 31 1993 net asset value of Western Selection, the investment finance company, was 18.82p, and 21.75p taking the market value of listed associated undertakings. Operating profit for the half year to March fell from Pounds 27,000 to Pounds 24,000, but the previous period had to combat costs of Pounds 50,000 from discontinued operations. Earnings per share were 0.16p (losses 0.11p). The half year included the dividend from Burlington Group. It was maintained but the gross amount fell because of the reduced credits available following the Budget. Western has a 39.6 per cent holding in Creston. The latter plans an acquisition for shares, which Western supports, and that will reduce its stake to 15.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Construction Contracts: Transport studies RENDEL PALMER &amp; TRITTON has won a contract to project the expansion of the port of Mombasa in Kenya over the next 10 years, together with the development of an inland container transport network. The two studies are being funded by the World Bank on behalf of the Kenya Ports Authority. The 10-month study of Kenya's principal port has a wide ranging brief covering the port's layout, operational equipment, land use, traffic forecasts, manpower planning, management efficiency, computer applications for improving efficiency of port operations and a review of throughput costs. Container handling at the port is particularly important to the second part of the contract, a six-month study into the strategic development of inland container depots.</p>

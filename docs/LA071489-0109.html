			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> REVENGE . . . AND ROMANCE;  </P> <P> 'LICENCE': A DARKER VERSION OF BOND  </P> <P> Time marches, age withers and everything falls into decay . . . except James  Bond, still spruce and deadly after all these years.  </P> <P> The series has been with us since 1962 and, like many another old timer, tends  to repeat itself. Yet, every once in a while, it pulls in its stomach, pops the  gun from its cummerbund, arches its eyebrow and gets off another bull's-eye.  The newest, "Licence to Kill" (citywide), is probably one of the five or six  best of Bond.  </P> <P> At first, it's hard to suggest why. "Licence" (the title is deliberately  anglicized) milks the formula as before: a mix of sex, violence and exotic  scenery, with Bond on a one-man raid against an archetype of evil, while  seducing women and taking in sights. Here, the locales include the sea-spray  expanses of Key West and the garish palaces of Mexico City disguised as a  fictitious "Isthmus City."  </P> <P> Yet the overall tone has gotten more burnished, somber. The new movie sends the  new Bond, Timothy Dalton, on a desperate one-man vendetta against an apparently  omnipotent South American cocaine czar. And it isolates him, kills or maims  three of his best friends, strips him of his rank, his government, his very  license to kill. It leaves him with almost nothing but his wits -- and dear old  chic-weapons expert Q (Desmond Llewelyn), who pops up ex officio with another  bag of lethal cameras and exploding toilet accessories.  </P> <P> It even strips away a little libido. As Timothy Dalton plays the role -- with  wolfishly sad eyes -- this is a more wounded and sensitive Bond than we've ever  seen, the sort of Bond the late Laurence Olivier might have imagined. (The look  is there, but not the lines.) Bond's appetite for sex seems more distracted,  tentative. His women -- Carey Lowell as a helicopter pilot and double agent,  Talisa Soto as the drug czar's faithless mistress -- are more self-sufficient.  His armor has sprung a leak.  </P> <P> Where Sean Connery was wry and self-confident and Roger Moore natty and  self-mocking, Dalton projects something strange for a hero identified with  impeccable sadism: inner torment. The walk is tense; cigarettes pour out fumes  of Angst; the smile carries a hint of pain.  </P> <P> Connery always seemed to be enjoying the world hugely -- and he carried the  audience along with him, made them enjoy it as much as he did. Roger Moore  didn't seem to be enjoying the world so much as ignoring it and, instead,  enjoying himself -- or perhaps some internal reflection. Dalton, by extreme  contrast, doesn't project much enjoyment at all. He projects pain. And pain,  obsession and revenge are what "Licence to Kill" is all about.  </P> <P> It's not a film about an urbane adventurer, moving with eerie confidence  through a violent, chaotic world. It's a film about a bereaved friend,  half-crazed with grief, relying on his instincts and professionalism to carry  him through a situation rotten with peril. Like Stallone's Rambo or Eastwood's  Dirty Harry, this Bond has been stiffed by the world and abandoned by his  government. He is a loner, driven by overwhelming personal hurts -- confronted  with a cool, sexy foe who, in some curious way, almost recalls the old Bond.  </P> <P> Previous villains in the series tended to be older, more urbane, wicked  paterfamilias figures. Instead, Robert Davi, a heavy in "Die Hard," makes Franz  Sanchez -- who's modeled on modern drug kings like Carlos Lehder of Colombia's  Medellin cartel -- a sexy adventurer who metes out rough justice with style and  merciless sarcasm. And he has a code: loyalty matters to him more than money.  Against this new-style villain, Bond, the dark angel, twists what seems to be  Sanchez's only good quality -- his insistence on loyalty -- against him, trying  to strip away his friends one by one and convince him of their treachery.  </P> <P> It seems to isolate Bond as well as Sanchez. Yet it leaves him with everything  that counts: the gimmicks, the archetypes, the formulas, the old jokes of a  full 27-year and 16-film tour of duty. Like all Bond movies it has its  set-pieces, chief among them a roaring, rousing Mad Max-style climactic,  exploding chase involving three Kenworth trucks, jeeps and a small plane set on  a desolately beautiful Mexican mountain road. It's planned and staged with the  exquisite carnage of a silent comedy car chase, with gags topping gags, and  surprises leaping over each other -- just as one flaming truck leaps over the  plane.  </P> <P> Produced and co-written by old hands Albert Broccoli and Richard Maibaum (whose  tour dates back to 1962's "Dr. No"), directed and co-written by new veterans  John Glen and Michael G. Wilson, the movie whips up a combustible brew of old  and new. Is it just updating the new cliches: the incessant car crashes,  gruesome sadism, heavy hardware, feistier heroines? (Just as there used to be  obligatory sexpots-in-distress, Carey Lowell almost seems an obligatory lone  wolf.) Perhaps -- but all those movies stole from the Bond films, too, often  draining out the crucial elements that make them fun: self-kidding humor and  exotic locales.  </P> <P> "Licence to Kill" (MPAA-rated PG-13, despite extreme violence and suggestions  of sex) has the usual bursts of illogic, the gratuitous sex or violence. But  gratuitous sex or violence have always been fixtures of Bond's world. Often the  formulas grate on you. Here, they ignite. This is a guilt-edged Bond; there's a  core of darkness and pain in the glittery world exploding around it.  </P></p>

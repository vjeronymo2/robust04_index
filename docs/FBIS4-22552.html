He is dynamic, sociable, plain spoken, and immediately  grasps the essence of a problem. It is possible to say about him  that he is "everywhere." He is a member of the Standing  Commission of the Supreme Council of Ukraine on Economic Reform,  secretary of the Parliamentary Commission of Ukraine on  Privatization Issues, and counselor acting as prime minister for  social affairs.    This exceptional forty-year-old man graduated from a  construction technical school, served in the army, studied with  distinction at the Economic University, then did post-graduate  work and defended a candidate's dissertation on the problem of  the interaction of center and region with rational utilization  of manpower. Working at the Labor Institute, he taught at the  polytechnic institute, served as chief economist of the  Machine-Building Plant and a deputy chairman of a commercial  bank. In 1990 he was elected chairman of the Zhitomir City  Council. After two years of work there he resigned because of,  in his opinion, the artificiality of the institution of the  "representative of the president."    He has always regarded collaboration with the  government as his duty. Zvyagylskyy took note of him and asked  for assistance. Melnychuk is one of the authors of the  anticrisis program of the government.    Two basic methods exist for the reform of the economy of  Ukraine: one is linked with the recent past, when the government  lacked a clear goal and a concrete and effective program; the  second method is based on the elaboration of a well thought-out  strategy and the existence of a team prepared to carry it out.    That which is called in Russia as the first method, or  "Ukrainization of the economy," found its full embodiment in the  activity of Kuchma's government because of the total absence of  a comprehensive approach to the resolution of fundamental  economic problems. As an outcome macroeconomic results followed:  in the social sphere--prices became twice as high as wages; in  the financial sphere--emission increased by a factor of 17,  while the Ukrainian karbovanets - U.S. dollar exchange rate  dropped by a factor of 36. Why did that occur? Probably because  problems of currency regulation were being resolved incorrectly.  As a result the difference between the two currencies is the  volume of the capital exported abroad.    In addition to that the former government of Leonid Kuchma,  which had vast powers, with one of its decrees prohibited the  export of products outside of Ukraine that are cultivated by  peasants on their personal plots. This brought considerable  losses to border farms which always sold their products to the  neighbors. By the way, anti-Ukrainian moods of the Crimeans  constitute their response to such thoughtless economic measures.  After all, huge excise taxes were also established on the export  of wine and champaign.    At present the second method is making its presence felt  with  great difficulty. Everything necessary exists in Ukraine in  order to fulfill the strategic program worked out by a group of  specialists and adopted for use. With regard to the per capita  output of agricultural products Ukraine is in the top ten in the  world. Its production potential is great. There are two reasons,  however, hindering its development.    The former is connected with the old production structure  because of which Ukraine is putting out the most energy,  material, and petroleum-intensive products. Thus it turns out  that the more it produces the more it owes. If the structure is  not radically redesigned we will be unable to achieve anything  of substance.    What is the solution? Development of profitable branches and  profitable production in all branches, particularly the  agro-industrial complex, machine-building, light industry,  merchandizing, and material-technical supply.    It is likewise necessary to overcome one of the big  misconceptions to the effect that Ukraine requires a vast amount  of fuel and that it does not have any. With regard to the known  fuel reserves we are in a first-place position in Europe. Today  Ukraine is already satisfying two-thirds of its own petroleum  needs, while one third is supplied by Russia and Turkmenia. But  we are utilizing it in a highly irrational manner. As a result  we consume as much petroleum as Japan, while our gross national  product is more than ten times lower. We do not need such  expenditures.    We must eliminate the crisis of nonpayment. All enterprises  and farms are deeply in debt to each other. What is to be done?  The matter must be resolved without an emission through a  lowering of prices and an increase in funds that have to remain  with the enterprises and the value-added tax should also be  eliminated.    The next problem is associated with currency regulation and  regulation of the Ukrainian karbovanets exchange rate. The  government managed to lower inflation by controlling that  process. In 1993 the average monthly inflation rate amounted to  50 percent, and in January 1994 it was 19 percent, whereas in  February it was down to 12 percent. The Interbank Currency  Market artificially raised the exchange rate of the karbovanets  by a factor of two to three. At present the government itself is  setting it with consideration of the balance of payments and  other factors. A similar policy is being implemented today in  Austria, Sweden, and Poland. It has been used by the U.S.A.,  France, and Japan in times of crisis.    The government of Ukraine should continue further  development  of the privatization it started. Today 25 percent of industrial  production is accounted for by the non-governmental sector which  is functioning in a highly effective manner.    Integration with other CIS countries is a major problem. It  is quite clear the strong can integrate but the weak will "be  for hire." In order to restore links with them at a new level  Ukraine will have to resolve the entire complex of tasks which I  mentioned. But, as it is said, the road will be successfully  negotiated by the one who forges ahead.</p>

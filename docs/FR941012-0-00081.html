			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters, on the other hand, while supporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ROPS and FOPS requirements for new machines, opposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retrofitting older machinery (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;25, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;57, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;17; Tr. W1 203, OR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 170). Their opposition was based on several reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, commenters said that machines should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to be retrofitted to meet current standards when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the installed ROPS and/or FOPS met industry standards in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect at the time of manufacture (Ex. 5&hyph;22; Tr. W1 203, OR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 170). One commenter said that older machines in the logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry were equipped with rollover protection, but those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> machine structures still in service do not meet the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry standards (Ex. 5&hyph;22).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, some commenters said that retrofitting machines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be very burdensome and costly, especially given the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited useful life of such machines (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9&hyph;5). They said retrofitting would be expensive because it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require complete rebuilding and testing of the frame  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structure. These commenters also said that employers would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to hire outside contractors to test the retrofitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment since most employers did not have the personnel,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expertise or equipment to install and test protective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structures (Ex. 5&hyph;35). In addition, other commenters said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the retrofitting requirement would be too burdensome  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for small employers, both in terms of absorbing the cost in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small operations and in finding persons who could do the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retrofitting (Tr. OR 119, 263, 307).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, commenters indicated that the retrofitting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement was not essential since most of the machines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the proposed standard already are manufactured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with ROPS and FOPS as standard equipment (Tr. W1 184, 203,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OR 170). For example, most log-skidders manufactured after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1974 have ROPS and FOPS meeting the performance criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most mobile equipment used in the Southeastern United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already has ROPS or FOPS (Ex. 5&hyph;19). Other commenters said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that skidders now come with fully enclosed cabs (Tr. W1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 184).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all the comments and information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received in the rulemaking record, OSHA has decided for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several reasons not to require machines placed into service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the effective date of this standard to be retrofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with ROPS and FOPS, provided that ROPS and FOPS have not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been removed from machines so equipped at the time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture. First, OSHA has determined that many of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> machines currently in use already have protective structures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting various performance criteria. The final standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that these protective structures continue to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained throughout the useful life of the machine, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they be replaced where they have been removed (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed after machine accident).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, many machines currently in use and virtually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all machines recently manufactured meet the performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria specified in the proposed standard (Ex. 9&hyph;2; Tr. OR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 185&hyph;87). OSHA believes that older machines, that either do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have protective structures or have ROPS and FOPS meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier standards, are few in number and are rapidly nearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the end of their useful life. As such, OSHA believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most employers are substantially in compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for machine protective structures and will reach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full compliance in short period of time. Therefore, OSHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that compliance with the protective structure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement can be achieved without requiring retrofitting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Incorporation of standards by reference.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing notice, OSHA requested comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriateness of incorporating by reference updated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consensus standards governing machine protective devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed standard OSHA required ROPS and FOPS to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installed, tested and maintained in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following SAE national consensus standards: SAE 1040c June  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1979 ``Performance Criteria or Rollover Protective Structures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ROPS) for Construction, Earthmoving, Forestry, and Mining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Machines'' and J231 Jan 1981 ``Minimum Performance Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Falling Object Protective Structures (FOPS).'' The SAE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ROPS standard was updated in 1988 as was the SAE standard on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Deflection Limiting Volume-ROPS/FOPS Laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

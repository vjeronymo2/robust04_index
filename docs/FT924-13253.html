			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Switch advice hits Reuters INTERNATIONAL news and information group Reuters Holdings fell sharply at the start of trading as the full effect of a cautious recommendation hit the market. The shares opened 22 down and were 33 off at worst as investors digested a recommendation by investment bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd that they switch out of the stock and into SmithKline Beecham. BZW lowered its stance on the stock, arguing that at close of trading on Wednesday the shares had 'moved into the stratosphere with the likes of Glaxo, Wellcome and Rentokil' and hit a 50 per cent premium rating to the market. A BZW salesman advised yesterday: 'If you want quality, buy SmithKline, which we think is offering better earnings prospects on a lower rating.' There was also some disappointment filtering through from a presentation in New York on the prospects for Reuters new electronics dealing system, Globex. Globex is a small part of Reuters' revenue, but forecasts for its generative potential may have to be scaled back. By the close, Reuters had fallen 29 to 1225p, while SmithKline had risen 4 1/2 p to 517p in the 'A' shares and 4 to 455p in the Units. Pilkington eases A second day's heavy trading in Pilkington saw the rise in the share price of the last several days ease as the keen US buying interest was met with equal selling needs by UK institutions. Although the large turnover in Pilkington - 16m on Wednesday and a further 16.5m yesterday - alerted dealers to renewed bid rumours about the troubled glassmaker, seasoned brokers were dismissive, arguing that UK fund managers would be loath to bail out prior to a bid. They also pointed out that both Chase Manhattan Bank and Fidelity Corporation had this week raised their stakes in Pilkington and that yesterday's activity hinted at further buying by the two big US institutions. However, Pilkington, badly hit by poor trading, has long been touted as a potential bid target and talk of stake building refused to die away yesterday. Old favourites like Pittsburgh Plate and Glass (PPG) and French group Saint Gobain were among those being fingered. The shares declined 2 to 83p. Waters firm Water stocks reflected a rare oasis of optimism as the market considered their responses to price-cutting threats by the official regulator Ofwat. The most volatility among big league water groups surfaced in North West, which was twice down more than 6p but rallied each time and closed a net 3 firmer at 437p. The bear case that North West could be the hardest hit by enforced price cuts and uncertainty over the company's position is expected to continue until a decision is reached in December. However, some analysts were saying that, partly because the region contains the most polluted beaches in the country, the company faces a charge of some Pounds 430m as a result of tighter environmental controls and this high figure should justify more government grants. Anglian and Wessex were steadier as it was seen that the effect on their profits by any regulatory moves would be minimal - less than 1.5 per cent in the case of the former and 1 per cent in the case of Wessex. Ms Rachel Lucas at County NatWest was preparing a buy note on the sector yesterday. She said: 'It is safe to buy the water stocks ahead of results at the start of November. Anglian and Southern are particularly attractive and if North West suffers substantially we would recommend it.' Cable manufacturer BICC fell back heavily after a large placing, the shares tumbling 19 to 221p. Broking house Smith New Court bought 5m shares at 213p and placed them at 218p a share. Traders said that the placing was the latest of several large lines of BICC stock on offer in recent weeks, due to institutions apparently being increasingly nervous over the group's involvement in the Channel Tunnel and the negotiations with Eurotunnel over costings. There are also increasing worries over the safety of BICC's dividend. Turnover was 12m, making it the second most heavily-traded stock of the day. TV group Thames continued its sharp recovery, rising a further 13 to 181p, a gain of 45p since the start of the month. Analysts said the group had attracted the interest of US fund managers who look at the relationship between the market capitalisation and the asset value. Oil group Enterprise slipped 10 to 423p on concerns over its Pounds 95m issue of new shares, which are to be traded as American Depositary Receipts on the New York stock exchange. Shell Transport gained 4 to 522p and British Gas fell 5 to 255p. Some dealers were talking of a switch from Gas to Shell but there was also a feeling that a big switch the other way round had been unwound and the buying of Gas was now looking overdone. Bank stocks were weak as the market registered disappointment at the fading hopes of an interest rate cut. Barclays was particularly badly hit, losing 17 to 338p on heavy turnover of 10m shares. The shares also received a kick from news that Moody's Investors Service might cut the bank's long-term debt ratings. National Westminster also attracted the threat of a Moody's downgrade and fell 12 to 339p. The relative attractions of Far Eastern investment helped Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corp rise 7 to 444p and Standard Chartered gain 13 to 490p. Regional brewers bore the brunt of the selling in the drinks sector as fears grew that colliery closures would hit sales, with Greenalls retreating 8 to 363p, Wolverhampton and Dudley 15 to 514p and Scottish and Newcastle 8 to 398p. Grand Metropolitan was one of the brighter lights in the sector, adding 5 to 382p. US buying has buoyed the stock up in recent sessions and yesterday US-owned broker Merrill Lynch moved from neutral to buy. Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries suffered after disappointment with figures from US group Philip Morris, particularly its falling cigarette shipments. BATs were down by more than 40 at one stage and closed 19 off at 823p. The market gave a decisive thumbs down to the long-awaited board changes at Forte, the shares diving 9 to 141p in chunky turnover of 2.2m. Not everyone in the market liked the disposal and acquisition by pharmaceuticals group Medeva. Some said it had sold its basic generic products at too great a loss and paid over the odds for Armstrong Pharmaceuticals, a US developer and manufacturer of therapeutic drugs. However, others like Goldman Sachs, were positive and suggested yesterday's share price fall of 13 to 180p was more representative of the possible overhang of shares. Medeva is to issue 16m new shares to fund the US purchase. Slack European soft drinks volumes from Coca Cola hit Cadbury-Schweppes, the shares falling 10 to 429p.

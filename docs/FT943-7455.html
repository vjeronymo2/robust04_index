			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BDA chairman out after EGM Mr Brian Duker, chairman and chief executive of BDA Holdings, has been removed from the board of the property investment and development group. This follows an extraordinary meeting on Friday when shareholders holding 10.14m ordinary shares, or 56.01 per cent of the equity, voted in favour of the resolution to remove Mr Duker. Holders of only 629,136 shares (3.48 per cent) voted against. The meeting was called by two non-executive directors, Mr Richard Wollenberg and Mr Nigel Jamieson, who now intend to take an active role in running the company. Mr Wollenberg, formerly non-executive deputy chairman, has taken over as chairman. He said BDA 'intends to build out its existing developments and land bank and will seek new opportunities to take the company forward'. Mr A Dawes, presently in charge of building operations, has been appointed general manager. The board plans to seek additional directors in due course.</p>

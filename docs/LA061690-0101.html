			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> JOYNER-KERSEE STARTS LONG JUMP AT THE TOP  </P> <P> Jackie Joyner-Kersee, competing in her first open long jump competition since  winning the 1988 Olympic gold medal, had the best performance by an American  this year during qualifying at the USA/Mobil National Track and Field  Championships Friday at Cerritos College in Norwalk.  </P> <P> Joyner-Kersee, the American record-holder, leaped 22 feet 9 inches on her first  attempt in leading the qualifying for Saturday's final.  </P> <P> "I was surprised," Joyner-Kersee said. "I was not looking for that distance  today."  </P> <P> "Her speed and strength are there," Bob Kersee, her husband and coach, said.  "Her speed is better than it's ever been."  </P> <P> Joyner-Kersee, tuning up for next month's heptathlon in the Goodwill Games at  Seattle, was to put the shot later Friday.  </P> <P> She is the world record-holder and Olympic champion in the heptathlon and is  seeking to break her mark of 7,291 points set at the Seoul Games.  </P> <P> "My favorite number this year is 73," Kersee said of the hopes he has for his  wife of breaking the 7,300-point barrier.  </P> <P> While expressing pleasure over the showing in the long jump qualifying, both  Kersees were not completely satisfied because she missed the takeoff board.  </P> <P> "The key to me was running relaxed today," Joyner-Kersee said. "I was forcing  the speed. I get anxious when I'm long jumping."  </P> <P> Joyner-Kersee set the American record of 24-5 1/2 in the 1987 Pan American  Games at Indianapolis.  </P></p>

Speaking after the end of a session at which the tribunal's  judges adopted the court's procedural code, Claude Jorda told  AFP he and his 11 colleagues had reached a compromise over  trying alleged war criminals in their absence, admissable under  French but not under English law.    "We have taken the French concept to its limits, which has  allowed us to establish a procedure which, while not judging the  accused in absentia, will allow us to make public the charge  against him," Jorda said.    The code, a mixture of procedural systems from across the  world, is scheduled for publication in mid-March.    The judge added that international arrest warrants issued by  the tribunal would also be published, so that any accused  refusing to attend would be unable to plead his innocence before  any other body.    Under the tribunal's new code, evidence on charges against  an  absent defendant will be presented at public hearings, whose  proceedings will be passed verbatim to the United Nations  Security Council and the country believed to be sheltering the  accused.    Jorda said some alleged war criminals were being sheltered  in  "completely civilised countries," but refused to specify which.    Commenting on press reports criticising the court since its  inauguration last November under UN auspices for inaction and  lack of real authority, Jorda said the tribunal "wanted to do  better than Nuremberg," the site of the war crimes trials of  leading Nazis.    That court "was accused of implementing hasty procedures and  was above all a court of victors."    He added: "We needed a procedural code, without with there  would be neither prosecutor nor tribunal. That is the least  that we owe victims and accused."    "In respect of the mandate given us by the UN Security  Council, we have got as far as we could after starting off with  nothing...less than three months ago."    The tribunal's new clerk, Theo van Boven, said he was  confident that trials could get under way before the end of the  year.    Its next session takes place from April 25 to May 13. In the  interim its draft budget is expected to be approved by the UN,  said a statement from the tribunal.</p>

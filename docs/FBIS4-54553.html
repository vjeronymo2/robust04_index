			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw </F> Kaczmarek by Jerzy Sieradzinski; place and date not given:  "What Do Working People Get From Privatization?"]    [Text] [Sieradzinski] Is it not a paradox that, on the eve  of the May Day holiday, here I am, talking to you, a  representative of the Polish left wing, about  privatization--that is to say, about dismantling remnants of the  old era that displayed a preference for "social ownership of the  means of production," which, in practical terms, meant a  ubiquitous domination of state property?    [Kaczmarek] I am not sure whether it is a paradox or rather  a  certain factual logic in the sense that we, members of the left  wing, are searching for new possibilities of society's economic  and civilization-related progress. We want to develop our  economy in a more cost-efficient, faster, and efficient manner,  compared with our predecessors.    Of course, some people perceive privatization only in the  black colors of transplanting capitalism, whereas I also see in  privatization many positive aspects, which, for instance, are  about social enfranchisement. I am convinced that, if  privatization is conducted in a reasonable manner and is based  not on principles of doctrine but on criteria of efficiency,  such privatization has a very tangibly positive employee aspect.    [Sieradzinski] Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski has described this  sort  of reasoning as "social democrats wearing liberals' pants...."    [Kaczmarek] I read his article in POLITYKA, and I must say  that the author, who, after all was a liberal in his own time,  stopped developing his views in 1989. In the time that followed,  my generation of the social-democratic left gained many new  experiences. We went ahead, and it is hard to accuse us now of  also having changed our views on the issue of privatization. I  am convinced that our electorate--and keep in mind that we are a  party of employees--has also changed its position on  privatization. It no longer has the hostile or unfriendly  position that many of us had four or five years ago.    The people understand the fact that we have taken it upon  ourselves to attempt to build an economic and social system that  will allow us to render Poland part of the European arrangement,  which will be efficient and competitive and will result in  monies for the implementation of social programs. In my view,  that is the entire social democratic concept. Privatization is  only meant to be an instrument in its implementation.    [Sieradzinski] To me, the most important question is this:  What do people who work in enterprises that were state-owned  yesterday but that, beginning today, become private property  stand to gain from this? Do these people not feel like they are  just an appendix to the entire transaction?    [Kaczmarek] This is a fundamental issue to me, as well.  True,  the ministry I run implements just a third of ownership  transformations taking place in Poland, and it would be hard to  hold me accountable for everything that happens in that field,  but I can assure you that three things are the most important to  me: First, that the State Treasury obtain a decent price for  enterprises being privatized. Second, that the enterprises be  transferred to good hands, which implies a detailed description  in the contract of the obligations of the new owner vis-a-vis  the enterprise, contributing additional capital for investment  and modernization, securing new markets, and so forth. A third  very significant element of our privatization contracts is made  up of social issues.    The issue is about guarantees of not carrying out personnel  cuts in a specified time period, establishing new jobs,  prospects for salary raises, and observing many other rights  acquired by employees in the past.    I want to stress that this is a specific trait of our  privatization process. When you look at the eastern provinces of  Germany, you will see that such contracts do not encompass  social obligations. The fact that, for instance, the new owner  of the "San" company in Jaroslaw guarantees the employees that  there will be no personnel cuts over the next four years--that  is of enormous significance to those employees.    Tell me, can you think of a state-owned company where  employees have guaranteed employment for at least a year? The  example I gave you is not an exception. In an overwhelming  majority of enterprises that were privatized recently, the  investors took upon themselves an obligation to not make  personnel reductions, to increase employment, and to raise  salaries by 20 to 30, or even 50 percent.    [Sieradzinski] What if these guarantees turn out to be  nothing more than a piece of paper?    [Kaczmarek] There are penalties contained in contracts for  failure to meet obligations. In very flagrant cases, it is even  possible to invalidate the transaction signed. I can assure you  that we will use all legal means to make sure these provisions  are observed.    [Sieradzinski] You are trying to convince me that employees  should do nothing but be happy about privatization, but we know  that that is not actually the case. Take the case of the  Walbrzych "Porcelana" factory, the Warsaw "Polkolor," or the  infamous firing of women who happened to be on maternity leave  when the Compact Car Plant signed a joint-venture agreement with  Fiat.    [Kaczmarek] This confirms the argument that any  generalizations are dangerous. Employees in Kwidzyn, Jaroslaw,  the Warsaw "Wedel" company, the Szczecin shipyard, and dozens of  other companies have a completely different view on benefits  accrued from privatization. Because they finally have a genuine  owner instead of a state official exercising ownership  supervision from high above on behalf of the State Treasury, the  situation of those enterprises--and the feeling of social  security of their employees--is incomparably better today than  before privatization.    What also improves is the overall work environment; I mean  cleanliness and order in working halls or at construction sites.  Lunchrooms, cloakrooms, and uniforms for employees--they all  look different now. That also counts.    Of course, a lot depends on whether foreign investors  entering the Polish market intend to make links to it permanent  and to establish in Poland a modern basis for the development of  production or whether such investors regard the Polish market  purely in terms of an easy outlet for selling merchandise or  services and a place with a relatively cheap labor force. I can  assure you that there are increasing numbers of cases of serious  investors who can see their future in our market for many years  to come.    [Sieradzinski] You mentioned the Szczecin shipyard where, to  my knowledge, at least, a managerial/employee contract for  managing the company was extended at the end of March of this  year, and not everyone was happy to see that. Why is that?    [Kaczmarek] I paid a visit there recently, but I can only  guess what reservations voiced by various "advisers" may be all  about. One must get it out in the open: It so happens,  historically speaking, that every one of our shipyards has its  own political sponsor or "patron." Any attempts at reform  encounter particularly strong resistance in those places.    As for the Szczecin shipyard, a managerial contract was  signed as early as 1992, and it was just extended because it  proved extremely beneficial for the company. Let me remind you  that, at the end of 1991, all the shipyard had was just one  order to build a ship. Right now, its portfolio of orders  amounts to approximately $460 million.    It is the only shipyard where the time period to build a  unit  was reduced to 12 months. With 6,000 employees, the shipyard's  production level is double that of the two remaining shipyards,  where 16,000 people are employed in total. As the only shipyard  in the entire domestic shipyard industry, the Szczecin company  pays its debts to its creditors, and its employees make much  better money than in Gdansk or Gdynia. These are the facts and  nobody can question them.    [Sieradzinski] Rumor has it that there are even plans in the  shipyard to establish its own retirement pension fund.    [Kaczmarek] I have suggested to the employees that a kind of  employee trust fund be established that could be devoted to  paying out increased retirement pensions. I think that this kind  of long-term capital investment may be beneficial for both  employees of companies being privatized and the state budget.  After all, the state could possibly support such initiatives  through a system of tax breaks--that would be beneficial to  public finances, out of which huge amounts are currently spent  on subsidizing an inefficient and costly insurance system.    [Sieradzinski] Is the variety of establishing organs [organ  zalozycielski] that represent the State Treasury's interests not  an obstacle to you in coordinating the process of ownership  transformations?    [Kaczmarek] The issue is not even about the fact that we  have  over 70 establishing organs. What is important is whether branch  ministries are dealing with developing developmental strategies  for a given branch, with defining rules of the game among  economic units, or whether these branch ministries are trying to  mainly execute their ownership functions, without a strategy  that an owner should have.    Against this background, there have emerged quite a lot of  doubts regarding distribution of powers between my ministry and  several other ministries, such as agriculture, foreign economic  cooperation, and industry. My view is that I should be  responsible for the entire privatization process, while my  colleagues in charge of specific sectors of the economy should  exercise their ownership functions mainly through preparing  developmental strategies for the branches that different  enterprises could join, regardless of their ownership type.    [Sieradzinski] There is talk that it is precisely this  dispute that caused a delay in the government's presentation of  a privatization draft law within the framework of the Agreement  on State-Owned Enterprises.    [Kaczmarek] I cannot deny that, even though that was not the  only reason. The issue was also about enabling a prior debate by  the government on a draft for transforming large and  medium-sized enterprises into capital companies [spolki  kapitalowe] controlled by the state (a new form of  commercialization). We are past that stage right now.    There is no denying that another reason for the delay in  preparing the law was that it is very hard to "tinker" with a  document as important as this one without a deputy prime  minister responsible for the economy. My assessment is that a  governmental draft law on privatization, which would constitute  the basis of the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises, will find  its way into the Sejm at the end of May.    [Sieradzinski] What is the importance of a set of four  programs that have been worked out by your ministry and debated  recently by the government?    [Kaczmarek] We have proved to our critics that, after  learning about the effects of privatization implemented by the  previous governments up to now, we have our own idea for putting  the process in order. Let me remind you that the issue is about:    --Transforming large and medium-sized enterprises into  state-controlled capital companies, introducing a formula for  employee management and comanagement that would be different  from what it has been up to now.    --"Fast sale" of the greatest possible number of small and  medium-sized enterprises (employing up to several hundred  people) to employee companies [spolka pracownicza] and to other  economic units.    --Improving the process of managing state-owned enterprises,  which means abandoning bureaucratic management and replacing it  with parameter-based management accomplished through capital  structures.    --Setting in motion processes that will serve to improve the  structure of public finances, especially in the area of social  expenditures, such as health and retirement insurance.    [Sieradzinski] That is indeed quite a program, when you  consider the accusations being levied against the coalition of  having slowed down the rate of privatization, or of having  stopped it altogether.    [Kaczmarek] Such views do not correspond to the truth.  According to the report, during 1993, which was a good year for  ownership transformations, a total of 364 privatization projects  of various magnitudes were carried out. We have already  implemented 86 such projects during the first quarter of this  year, which is one-fourth of last year's amount. Apart from  that, eight emission drafts have been presented (there was a  total of three in all of 1993). We are preparing about 100  enterprises to be transformed into share companies [spolki  akcyjne] in connection with conciliation proceedings with  banks--we did not have that last year at all.    The program for setting in motion that National Investment  Funds is reaching its final stage. We will be able to announce,  probably at the end of June, that, for instance, an "alpha" fund  is being managed by "B" company, with a governing board made up  of the following people....and also that the particular fund  includes enterprises number 1 to 30, and so forth. This will  allow us to begin distributing participation certificates  [swiadectwa udzialowe] at the end of this year and the beginning  of the next one.    Really, a lot is happening right now, and to speak about a  slowdown in the rate of privatization is just another case of  political "setting at odds." But, first of all, it is to the  previous coalition that I "owe" the bad--outright  disastrous--atmosphere surrounding privatization. I spend a  majority of my time cleaning up after the past. So I am even  more surprised with the easy-sounding nature of critical remarks  addressed by former Minister Janusz Lewandowski regarding the  current privatization process. You could really use some  humility, Mr. Minister!    [Sieradzinski] So you can see no danger at all that  privatization could bring about?    [Kaczmarek] Yes, I can see such dangers. I am, for instance,  afraid that privatization of a group of enterprises might cause  disruptions in the traditionally established connections with  domestic producers from other branches.    The privatization by foreign investors in previous years of  enterprises, producing detergents and other chemical products  for households, led to a Kielce-based container plant suddenly  losing its orders. The same thing may happen in the case of  privatization of a large plant producing food concentrates. It  will turn out that a large domestic glassworks no longer has  orders for jar production, and, therefore, one will have to  eliminate the plant.    Only coordination of privatization measures by just one  ministry can shield us against the consequences of such  decisions, with the ministry basing its decisions on an analysis  of impact not just within a particular branch but taking the  whole economy into account.    [Sieradzinski] When you were accepting the post of  privatization minister, were you aware of the scale of  responsibility you agreed to take upon yourself?    [Kaczmarek] The examples of my predecessors prevented me  from  forgetting that. I promised myself that I would not promote the  kind of privatization that would bring to mind economic  scandals, deteriorating work conditions, or investors neglecting  the duties they took upon themselves.    I want privatization to become a process of enfranchisement  of society, to contribute to limiting unemployment, and to  provide a strong developmental incentive to the economy. Only  then will we feel the positive impact of privatization. I will  do everything in my power to keep this promise.    [Sieradzinski] Thank you for the conversation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 28 May (PL) -- An article by Cuban Division  General Jesus Bermudez Cutino, published today in GRANMA, terms  a fiction the plans that a U.S. national security directive  established to save the country's leaders in the event of a  nuclear war.    Bermudez' article, titled "March Over Ashes," refers to the  so-called Doomsday Project, a product of the Cold War that still  exists. The project allocates $8 billion to protect the lives  of high-ranking U.S. leaders in case of a nuclear conflict that  would practically eliminate all traces of life in the world.    The plan involves large columns of armored vehicles crossing  U.S. territory to avoid Soviet nuclear warheads, establishing  communications via satellite, and being the only survivors on  Earth, ruling the world that would reportedly remain, it adds.    The plan also includes the creation of several hundred  special operations commandos to protect the aforementioned  columns, "which would march with their valuable cargo of leaders  and `daddy's boys' over the ashes of the very same people who  had made such a miracle possible with their ingenuous  contributions," it adds.    Later, the article says that, despite the supposed end of  the  Cold War, most of this fictitious and diabolical structure still  prevails, although THE NEW YORK TIMES said it has been canceled.    Bermudez said this should become a reality so the resources  can be used to mitigate the hardships that paradoxically are  still on the rise in the richest country of the world -- where  unemployment, social abandonment, vice, and mendicancy increase  along with economic growth.</p>

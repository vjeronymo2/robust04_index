			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Michal Strak, minister and chief of the </F> Office of the Council of Ministers, by Janina Paradowska; place  and date not given: "An Apple on a Branch"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Paradowska] In your view,  what is the coalition's strongest cementing factor? Power for  its own sake?    [Strak] I will put it bluntly: lack of a better alternative  for each of the coalition's partners. And this lack of an  alternative is a more serious problem for the Polish Peasant  Party [PSL] than it is for the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD].  The numbers currently in parliament determine the fact that the  SLD, along with the Democratic Union [UD], could possibly create  a parliamentary majority, whereas the PSL would have to gain the  support of two parties.    [Paradowska] What could one possibly establish that would be  creative, based on a lack of an alternative?    [Strak] Lack of an alternative gives room for breathing and  makes it possible to conduct politics without a dramatic fear  that everything is about to collapse at any moment. So one can  plan various measures a few years in advance because the time  for the government to be verified is still somewhat in the  future.    [Paradowska] This way, one can earn the "government of  stagnation" label.    [Strak] We will see whether there will be stagnation. The  opposition can attach any label it wants, but let us wait  peacefully for what this government will be doing precisely in  this longer kind of term. I think the evaluation will not be  complete until the end of the parliamentary term. In my view,  the length of authorities' term of office is a sanctity in a  democracy. Unless we learn to respect it, it will turn out  that, when it comes right down to it, we have not yet matured  sufficiently to be able to function in a democratic regime.    [Paradowska] I came across the following sentence in one of  your interviews: "The PSL finds it easier to say what it does  not want rather than what it wants, which means it is easier for  the PSL to present its political vision with precision and to  regard it as a program." That is not a very encouraging  confession, coming from a representative of a team that has  gained power and wants to remain in power for the coming years.    [Strak] There used to be governmental teams that knew  precisely what they wanted but did not quite know what they did  not want, and how did they end up? We all know how. One could  use the following academic criterion: "Could you list 10 items  that you want?" But one could also approach it from the  standpoint of what should not happen. This question is very  important: At the stage of transformation in which Poland has  found itself currently, do we need positive schemes more, or  have we reached a point where various things have already  happened and we must make a selection, which means facing the  question of what constitutes a permanent accomplishment and  should be perfected further, and, on the other hand, what it is  that we decide to give up on. Let me use the example of  self-governments. After four years, we know that  self-governments at the gmina level should be further developed,  whereas, for the moment, we do not have to organize  self-governments at the powiat [small administrative unit]  level. So you see that it is equally important to have positive  as well as negative visions.    [Paradowska] So what are your positive and negative programs  at the post you occupy?    [Strak] The positive program is expressed by four draft laws  that concern: the Council of Ministers, organs of territorial  governmental administration, civil service, and amendments to a  law on state officials. Issue number-one, as far as the system  of ruling the country goes, is to lead to an order in the  governmental administration. A second element is about  continuing with self-governmental reforms at the gmina [smallest  administrative unit] level. The negative program is about the  nonintroduction of self-governmental mechanisms at the powiat  level or even at the voivodship level. Because relations with  the church are also included in my range of duties, it follows  that my positive program is to arrange these relations in a way  that would prevent friction from occurring in the  church-government rapport. Issues related to information  circulation are also within my field of interest, and, in that  area, we must lead to the government's stable presence in the  media.    [Paradowska] What do you mean by "the government's stable  presence in the media"?    [Strak] I mean that there should be opportunities where one  can read or watch how the government would like to see itself  portrayed. So we want to have a permanent column in  RZECZPOSPOLITA. I also think one should consider how to make use  of a provision in a law on radio and television that states that  public radio and television have an obligation to present the  position of the supreme organs of state power. Unfortunately,  how that should come about was not specified in the provision.  It is like an apple that someone has put on a branch high above  the ground and no one knows how to reach. So one should build a  ladder of some sort.    [Paradowska] In your view, what should such a ladder look  like?    [Strak] One must simply define it as there being a time slot  in the television schedule reserved for the government to  present its position, the same way it is happening now with  religious programs.    [Paradowska] There is the governmental "Balance" television  program.    [Strak] Because the government is criticized for not coming  through strongly enough in the media, one can presume that  "Balance" is simply not enough. It is possible that we will set  up a joint commission made up of government and media circles to  discuss this issue and similar ones.    [Paradowska] All of your predecessors used to say that the  Office of the Council of Ministers [URM] cannot be reformed,  that it is unmanageable, and that it must be broken apart. You  want to build new commissions around it.    [Strak] Generally speaking, I break anything apart with  great reluctance. I think that, if something is already in  existence, it is better to try to fix it. I have never been, or  will ever be, a revolutionary. But I think the main problem  with the entire power structure in Poland is that vertical  structures function--and quite well, too--but that there are no  horizontal structures functioning at all. There is no  interministry coordination. So I would like to lead to the  establishment of a whole range of bodies that would function  within governmental structures and that would deal with solving  different problems on a horizontal level. A single ministry  will not solve, for instance, the problem of border crossings.    [Paradowska] So there will be separate bureaus for border  crossings, plenipotentiaries for pathology, and so forth?    [Strak] It is not an issue of plenipotentiaries. These  issues are dealt with by specific people in the various  ministries, so one does not have to set up new posts, but we  must create for them an opportunity to jointly watch the same  reality. Coordinating functions can be localized in different  places--be it in URM or in the individual ministries. It is  possible that the issue of border crossings should be assigned  to URM, whereas the issue of national minorities should be  assigned to the Culture Ministry.    [Paradowska] What you are saying confirms the opposition's  accusations about the desire to have a maximum centralization of  all issues.    [Strak] That is not true. It can be concluded from  information that I got on the organization of the British  Government that over there, they have 150 different committees  functioning across the different ministries.    [Paradowska] To what extent are your plans to increase the  powers of voivodes [local governmental officials] linked to this  coordination? And, also, what is the essence of these  additional powers supposed to be about?    [Strak] That is quite a different issue. I would like to  empower voivodes with decisionmaking powers regarding personnel  issues in special administrations. So I do not want to take the  special administration away from the ministers, but I want to  make chiefs of the special administrations begin to feel that a  voivode is also their boss--perhaps not boss number-one but with  a sufficiently strong position that his view must be considered.    [Paradowska] But my understanding is that this arrangement  of a "ministerial Poland" that we have suits you, and there will  be no revolution in that regard, either?    [Strak] A major debate is ahead of us, concerning how the  entire power structure should be organized. I think the number  of ministries will remain more or less the same, but their  structures will change and they will stabilize. Political posts  will be clearly separated from substantive ones. In connection  with the work we are conducting, the Foreign Ministry has  already prepared its own organizational concept.    [Paradowska] So everything is in accordance with your  concept of puttiang things in order, perfecting them, but not  changing too much?    [Strak] One cannot destroy vertical arrangements that are  already in place and thanks to which the state is functioning  and is not in an anarchy. But in order to improve the process  of governing, horizontal coordination must be activated. Once  the ministries' structures are put in order, this mechanism will  be set in motion. I think that, if we have any reserves at all,  it is precisely in the area of improving the efficiency of  ruling.    [Paradowska] So far, you have been improving the efficiency  of ruling by replacing voivodes, or at least this is what you  are most famous for. Because you plan to increase voivodes'  powers, should one not adopt the appropriate statutory  regulations first and then look for the right people?    [Strak] In theory, this is exactly as it should have  happened, but, in practical terms, it must have happened the way  it really did.    [Paradowska] You could not overcome pressure by party  rank-and-file?    [Strak] It was not just the issue of pressure. Even before  it occurred to anyone that I would be URM's chief, I already  spoke at that point on my idea of what the regional power  structure should look like, and I also said that it must be  adapted to the changes taking place at the top. But one must  not forget that, despite all of the propaganda about it, we  replaced voivodes in just 29 voivodships.    [Paradowska] And you think that is not a lot?    [Strak] I do not know whether it is a lot or a little. It  is more or less the same as in France during the change of a  team.    [Paradowska] There are some differences. In France, there  is a corps of highly skilled officials who must, for instance,  be graduates of prestigious schools.    [Strak] In Poland, neither new officials nor old ones have  graduated from such schools. My point is that we have just  reached the limit of about 60 percent of changes that I regard  as rational, but that does not mean that there will be no  further changes.    [Paradowska] But the SLD has not participated in a major way  in this booty sharing.    [Strak] It is not an issue of sharing booty between the SLD  and the PSL. There were specific agreements between the SLD and  the PSL in all of the voivodships except Wloclawek. The SLD has  no reason to feel it was discriminated against. Of course, on  the surface it may seem like the PSL got more posts, but the  fact that the SLD candidates prefer to present themselves as  nonparty, that is their business and theirs alone. I will not  force anybody to show their current or past party identification  cards.    [Paradowska] Your most recent idea is to introduce terms of  office for voivodes, under which, with every change of  government, there would also be a change of voivodes and their  deputies.    [Strak] Why do you say change? Perhaps this is about  stabilization. The point is to establish clear rules of the  game and to lead to a situation where a voivode knows that, as  long as a particular prime minister is in power, his situation  is stable, while his future--I mean a renewal of the contract by  the next prime minister--will depend on whether the voivode is  loyal to the political arrangement that is in power at a given  time, and also on whether he will not do too many things that  could endanger his relationship with the government that could  gain power. Then nobody could hold it against him that, while  being a voivode under Prime Minister Pawlak's government, he has  good rapport with UD or with some other opposition party. In  that sense, the voivode is apolitical.    [Paradowska] I must admit I do not comprehend this  apolitical nature completely.    [Strak] Why don't you analyze the fate of those voivodes who  have remained at their posts but who do not get publicity? What  have they done to deserve this lack of reservations about them?  Simply put, in the previous period, they acted normally  vis-a-vis parties that were in the opposition; to them, there  were no better and no worse political forces or better and worse  Sejm deputies. They were voivodes for everybody. So they  avoided conflicts with anyone and now it pays back. So, if we  define the rules, we should tell voivodes outright: You are  supposed to cooperate with the government properly, and it is a  question of your skills to make those who come after us approve  of you, as well. Voivodes, both old and new, accept that. So  as to avoid destabilization in case of a change, we are  establishing the post of director general of the office  [presumably of URM], which will not be subject to fluctuations.  That will be exactly the state civil service. So we are  presenting a certain comprehensive structure whose essence is to  separate whatever is political (and thus subject to change, with  the voivode being a political official under this concept) from  what is civil service.    [Paradowska] I must admit ftaht I still cannot see what the  stabilization is about. What is stable about a situation in  which an entire government changes and almost, at the same time,  voivodship leaderships also change?    [Strak] Why do you continue to assume that everything  changes?    [Paradowska] Because the other parties will also have their  rank-and-file members, who must be awarded posts after the  victory. Unless that is so, it is your prediction that the PSL  will rule forever.    [Strak] My assumption is that, after the change of  government, a major portion of the voivodes will remain at their  posts and the new prime minister will extend contracts with them  because they will have had good rapport with everybody. Of  course, some change is always unavoidable.    [Paradowska] What criteria did you use while looking for  voivode candidates, naturally apart from the political criterion?    [Strak] These criteria are somewhat different with regard to  voivodes coming from SLD and PSL lists. The SLD suggested  people associated with the economy or with the administration of  the scientific community--for instance, former university  presidents or their deputies. So, basically speaking, the  arrangement of people there could be described as a  scholarly-economic one. Among PSL people, there are former  chief officers of groups of villages and people who served in  the state administration in the past. So one cannot say they are  completely without any prior experience or preparation.  [passage omitted]    [Paradowska] To what extent is everything that you do and  proclaim--the relationship to self-governments at different  levels, the new philosophy of stabilization regarding voivodes,  the administration reforms--a result of decisions made within  the coalition, and to what extent is this your own vision of the  state? Is this Minister Strak's private business?    [Strak] Being here, it is my task to articulate my party's  and the coalition's points of view. The coalition will be  delivered this batch of laws, and it will decide what to do  next. But it is beyond any dispute that the arrangement of  state power must be put in order. We will debate in different  groups regarding the way that should be accomplished, in both  the voivodships, during sessions by the Council of Ministers,  which, after all, is composed of coalition ministers, and in the  Sejm. I can assure you that party interests or my private  interests will not be of primary importance in that regard. The  greatest party interest that is ahead of us to be accomplished  is that, after four years in power, it will turn out that this  country's functioning has improved.    [Paradowska] Thank you for the conversation.</p>

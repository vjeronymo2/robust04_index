			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Palestinian delegates to peace talks in Washington arrive late in Amman Palestinian delegates to peace talks in Washington arrived in Amman three hours late yesterday because the Israeli authorities tried to stop three of their administrative staff leaving the occupied territories, Reuter reports from Amman. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the delegation spokeswoman - pictured above leaving Jerusalem - said the Israelis backed down when the delegates threatened to go home if the three could not cross the River Jordan with them. 'We told the Israelis that if they kept trying to impede the work of the delegation we would go back to our country and we really thought of doing so,' Mrs Ashrawi said. The Palestinians, together with the Jordanian half of their joint delegation, plan to leave for Washington this morning for the third round of bilateral meetings since the US launched the Middle East peace process in Madrid in October. In the second round in December, Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian delegates spent all six days arguing in the corridors of the State Department over the status of the Palestinian delegates.</p>

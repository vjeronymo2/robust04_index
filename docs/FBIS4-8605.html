			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Rome, April 14 (TANJUG)--NATO sources in Italy said  that NATO planes buzzed the Moslem-held town of Tuzla in  northeastern Bosnia for three hours on Thursday to deter Bosnian  Serbs from attacking U.N. troops on the ground.    A NATO spokesman said the U.N. troops in Tuzla were directly  threatened by Serb forces which repeatedly shelled the airport  and the town itself. Tuzla is held by the Moslems. The Serb  troops are deployed around the town.    Pairs of U.S. A-10 planes from NATO's base in Aviano,  British  Harriers from the Arc Royal air carrier and Jaguars from the  Gioia Del Cole base, and Dutch F-16s from Villafranca were  engaged in the "intimidation" action.    Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said on Thursday that  NATO transporter planes had been shipping war materiel to Tuzla  for days although the local airport had not been officially  reopened.    The airport can only be used for humanitarian flights,  Karadzic was categorical. He also said two transporters that  were about to land at Tuzla on Thursday decided otherwise after  the Serb side warned them not to land.    "I think this is better than to down them."    The Bosnian Serb command on Monday accused NATO of  transferring parts of it rapid deployment force to Tuzla.    Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, told  TANJUG on Tuesday he knew nothing about that but did not rule  out the possibility that troops and equipment for securing the  airport might have been airborne to Tuzla.    "We have warned them that the airport will be reopened only  on the basis of an agreement between us and Russian President  Boris Yeltsin, peace envoy Vitaliy Churkin and Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev," said Karadzic.    Bosnian Serbs opposed the reopening of Tuzla airport fearing  it might be used for shipping arms to the Moslems, and insisted  that Bosnian Serb and Russian U.N. monitors be deployed at the  facility to inspect its operation.</p>

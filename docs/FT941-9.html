			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / EU to draft work council directive The months of dialogue between trade unions and employers at European level in search of agreement on the establishment of works councils in European multinationals finally broke down yesterday. With voluntary agreement between the social partners ruled out, the European Commission will now proceed with a works council directive which is likely to be passed at the end of the year. The directive will require at least one meeting a year between employer representatives and top management of a company to discuss investment, production plans and redundancies. It is is likely to affect about 1,000 companies in Europe and become law in most countries in 1996 or 1997. Works councils have been a matter of controversy between European unions and employers for more than 20 years, with employers insisting that the form of consult-ation should be left up to companies. It had been hoped that a voluntary agreement between Unice, the European employers' body, and the European Trades Union Congress, might be possible, especially after Unice shifted towards the ETUC position by accepting the principle of a legal right to information for employees. But yesterday ETUC said that the withdrawal from the negotiations of the Confederation of British Industry, the main British employers' body, had undermined Unice's negotiating authority. The CBI was unhappy about the earlier concessions that Unice made. Mr John Monks, general secretary of the British TUC, one of the main affiliates of the ETUC, said: 'What the employers have now done is make a directive on this inevitable.' The directive is likely to be passed under the German presidency later this year, but will not become law for another two years at least. It will not directly affect the UK as works councils are covered by Britain's opt-out from the Maastricht Treaty. However, it is estimated that at least 100 UK companies will be affected through their continental European subsidiaries and most of them are likely to include their UK employees. Elsewhere, the directive will affect all companies with more than 1,000 employees operating in a minimum of two EU countries and with a minimum of 100 in one of the countries. The directive will provide for voluntary arrangements within companies to be agreed between unions and employers but will have a fall-back statutory model. That will require meetings of a works council at least once a year, with other meetings triggered by particular events such as mergers or mass redundancies. The directive will lay down the areas which must be the subject of discussion, the level within the company at which discussions must take place, and minimum and maximum participants. Statutory European works councils will not be a significant cost item for companies, although they will have to foot the bill for travel and interpreters. But European companies and employers organisations have long argued that while they agree with the goal of consultating and informing employees they believe that there should be flexibility about how it is achieved. Unions, on the other hand, have set great store by trans-national works councils and see them as the first step towards trans-national collective bargaining, a long-standing union goal.</p>

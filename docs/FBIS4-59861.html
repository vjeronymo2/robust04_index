			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Salah: "Mubarak Accuses Muslim </F> Brotherhood of Supporting Terrorism; Al-Hudaybi Stresses  Renunciation of Violence"]    [Excerpt] Cairo -- Signs of a new crisis between the  Egyptian Government and the Muslim Brotherhood group have  emerged in the wake of an interview President Husni Mubarak gave  to the German newspaper DER SPIEGEL, published yesterday. In  the interview Mubarak described the Muslim Brotherhood as "an  illegal group supporting most of the terrorists' activities."  Mubarak's statement provoked varying reactions on the Egyptian  political scene.    Counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, spokesman for the Muslim  Brotherhood, has denied the existence of any link between the  group and the extremists. He also denied that it supports  violent and terrorist actions. He told AL-HAYAH that violent  and terrorist actions have occurred over 25 years, and  investigations have proved that the Muslim Brotherhood has no  link with the extremist organizations whose members carried out  these actions. He stressed that the Muslim Brotherhood "has  never been implicated in supporting, inciting, or participating  in actions violating the law. So it is strange for accusations  to be leveled at it without any evidence."    Al-Hudaybi added that "Interior Minister Major General Hasan  al-Alfi, who is responsible for following up security conditions  and pursuing those who violate the law, announced in a news  conference about a month ago that the Muslim Brotherhood has  nothing to do with any violence or any link with terrorist  actions. And former Interior Minister 'Abd-al-Halim Musa said  the same thing."    On Mubarak's statement on conditions in Algeria, Al-Hudaybi  said that "what happened in Algeria was not the result of  aggression from the groups calling for reenforcing the Islamic  Shari'ah. It was the result of a military coup against the will  of the people, who had chosen the Islamists through free  elections."    On the national dialogue called for by Mubarak, Al-Hudaybi  said: "We have no information about the dialogue issue.  [Government] officials have announced openly that the Muslim  Brotherhood will not participate in it. We do not believe it is  a serious matter, as it was first mentioned eight months ago,  and no measures have been taken so far to initiate it. If the  government believed it was important, it would have taken steps  to initiate it and ensured the participation of all the  political forces on the Egyptian scene." He said that the  dialogue "will produce no results."    Al-Hudaybi said that the Muslim Brotherhood is subjected to  security harassment, "and from time to time members of the group  are arrested and interrogated in imaginary cases, even though  our position on violence and terrorism is clear and declared."

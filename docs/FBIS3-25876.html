Although this round of talks might also end without reaching  agreement Chiao said at the airport, "The increase in mutual  trust is a positive development."    Chiao's meeting with Tang, vice chairman and  secretary-general of the Beijing-based Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), was arranged based on an  accord reached during the talks between SEF Chairman Ku Chen-fu  and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan last April in Singapore. The  accord calls for quarterly meetings between SEF and ARATS  officials of the deputy secretary-general or department director  level.    The Chiao-Tang talks will take place Tuesday and Wednesday  afternoons and Friday morning at the Diaoyutai State Guest House.    They will focus on reviewing the results of the three cross-  strait technical talks held last year in the hope that more  progress can be made during future discussions.    The two heads of the intermediary organizations will also  look into the operations of both SEF and ARATS as well as review  the implementation of the agreements signed during the  "Ku-Wang" talks.    Issues related to a second "Ku-Wang" meeting will also be  considered during the talks, according to one of Chiao's aides.    Chiao was traveling in the company of SEF Deputy  Secretaries-General Shih Chi-ping and Hsu Huei-yu.    SEF Chief Secretary Wu Shu, who arrived in Beijing three  days  ago, held a meeting Saturday with ARATS Deputy Secretary-General  Zhao Zhengyu, to prepare for the forthcoming talks.</p>

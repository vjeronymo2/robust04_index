			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by EU Commissioner Jacques Delors at the signing </F> ceremony of the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement  in Corfu--live in French with simultaneous translation into  Greek]    [Text] [Greek translation begins while Delors'  introductory statement in French is already in progress] ...Amid  difficulties, but these difficulties were overcome and Russia  today signs the greatest agreement it has ever concluded with  any other country or any other group of countries. We owe this  to the work done by the experts, Russian experts on one side and  European experts on the other. We also owe it to the political  will expressed by yourself, President Yeltsin, and by the 12  members of the European Union [EU].    This agreement includes acts of the past and gives them a  more functional and fuller framework that will result in the  prospect for a zone of free exchanges. It will facilitate  exchanges of European businesses in Russia and to this I add the  signature of the European Charter for energy. I believe that,  in this way, many new possibilities will open for Russia with  its tremendous natural resources. This agreement allows for  exchange in many sectors and services, it is really an  innovation. Finally, I believe that within the framework of  this agreement we will be able to develop our scientific  cooperation, to use with our own resources the (?excellent)  resources that you have in the field of science [words  indistinct] and in the field toward cooperation and peace.    I believe that this agreement is a very good framework. Of  course, this agreement also includes the possibility for close  partnership in the political sector, (?regular) consultations  between yourself and the representatives of the 12 member states  and 16 [words indistinct] members of the EU.    Finally, through this agreement, Russia--which was, is, and  will remain, an important power--will be able to play its role  fully in our continent, at this end of Asia and the Pacific  Ocean.    I would also like say a few words about the Russian people.  The Russian people have followed a road full of obstacles and  difficulties. Difficulties for the deepening of democracy,  difficulties in reaching an open and competitive economy.  However, in the past, the Russian people have shown so many  possibilities of overcoming these difficulties and I am certain  that they will succeed in this difficult task. I would also  like you to allow me to convey, through you, this thought to the  Russian people who today are even nearer to us because this  agreement includes a great political significance. Thanks to  this agreement Russia, as a large power, will be able to enter  the 21st century.    Thank you.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Rafale's Weaponry Will Be </F> Formidable"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION  MAGAZINE  INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] The French fighter will have a vast panoply of  weapons, including Matra's new Mica air-to-air multitarget and  Apache air-to-surface missiles. Flight tests for the Mica and  Apache will be stepped up in 1994.    The Rafale's impressive array of weapons--gun, rocketry,  bombs, and missiles of all sorts--will make it one of the most  formidable fighter aircraft of its generation for all air-to-air  and air-to-surface missions (see AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION  MAGAZINE  INTERNATIONAL No. 1360 and 1408).    The Rafale will be able to neutralize a 1,000-square-meter  area using submunitions dropped by Matra's Belouga missile, or  destroy an airfield landing strip by studding it with  40-square-meter craters using Thomson Brandt Armements' (TBA)  BAP 100 antirunway bombs. It will also be able to use the Exocet  AM-39 to attack a ship 50 to 70 km away. Aerospatiale's Exocet  will be able to scuttle small ships and put regular or escort  destroyers out of commission (as was done in the Falklands).    Moreover, Rafale will have two, very effective laser-guided  weapons, fireable using Thomson-CSF's Atlis target-designation  optronics pod, for the attack of local, hardened ground targets  (concrete shelters, bridges...) and even ships. One is the  AS30L, which proved itself in the Gulf. Aerospatiale's big,  air-to-surface missile can be fired from a distance of 12 km,  carrying 240 kg that will impact at the speed of 450 m/s. The  other is Matra's BGL bomb, which can be dropped from over 7 km  away while flying 1,000 km/h. BGL bombs--with laser-guided  "kits"--come in three versions: 250 kg, 450 kg, 1,000 kg.    Rafale will also be equipped with the air-to-surface  standoff  Apache that Matra is developing with Aerospatiale. The Apache is  a cruise, "stealth" missile for both day and night attack of  various targets (airfield runways, command centers, tank  clusters, and so on) from a distance of 150 km. It weighs 1.2  metric tons and carries 750 kg of various submunitions  (antirunway, antitank, mine, etc.), including the Kriss  antirunway rocket being developed by TBA.    Apache flight tests began last 4 November when an inert  mockup was fired from a CEV Mirage 2000-N. They continued with  tests of piloted missiles, then trials of missiles propelled by  the Microturbo turbojet, whose final flight tests will take  place next July.    According to Jean-Paul Genest, technical director of Matra  Defense, "the first launches of complete missiles are scheduled  for late 1994 or early 1995." The propelled and guided Apache  will fly in ground followance mode using altimetric and  topographic resetting, then will be correlation guided to its  terminus using Thomson-CSF's Prometheus radar homing head.  Prometheus will be tested in advance on an airborne flight  aboard a Mirage 2000.    The Landes Test Center (CEL) is simultaneously testing the  Kriss submunition. A 900-m-long, 40-m-wide concrete runway has  also been built in Biscarosse, and will serve as a target during  Apache test overflights beginning in late 1994 and Kriss  jettisoning tests in 1995. The program's "main event" will be a  complete Apache flight that will end with the dropping of 10  submunitions, including one or two Kriss(s) (with real explosive  charges), on the runway. It is scheduled for 1996.    At the same time engineers will be working to adapt the  missile to the Rafale (two Apaches under the wings) and Mirage  2000-D (one under the fuselage), and to the Luftwaffe's Tornado  (two Apaches under the fuselage) in accordance with the 1992  contract signed with the MAW (Matra-DASA) consortium. The  Apache's first flight under the Tornado is scheduled for  mid-1996, and its start-of-service date for 1997-98. But France  would like to persuade Germany to move that up to 1996, so that  industrial production of the Apache coincides with its scheduled  introduction on the Mirage 2000-5.    Rafale will have two types of Matra missiles for air-to-air  missions. The infrared-guided Magic 2 can engage all sectors,  even frontally, without precise sighting during short-range (up  to 30 km) aerial combat. More important, the first multitarget  and dual-mode (infrared and electromagnetic) air-to-air Mica  missile will be able to perform all aerial defense missions up  to 80 km. The Mica will be the primary competitor of the Russian  R-77 and American AMRAAM missiles (see AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION  MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No 1451)  <H5>  Magic 2 and Mica </H5>   Rafale will be the 17th aircraft to carry Magic 2, which has  been in production for the last several years to equip numerous  foreign and French airplanes including the Mirage 2000. The  90-kg missile will be mounted on the wingtips of both French  Rafale versions (Navy and Air Force). Jean-Paul Genest says the  first Magic 2 launches with real missiles will take place in  1995.    In contrast, the Dassault airplane will be able to carry up  to eight 100-kg Micas on its wingtips and under the fuselage and  wings. The Navy will start with only the electromagnetic version  (with a Dassault Electronique AD4A radar homing head) mounted  under the wings or fuselage, and Magic 2s on the wingtips. Work  to adapt the Mica for mounting on Rafale's wingtips will begin  in 1995.    But Mica reached an important milestone last July when it  successfully completed its first multitarget launch  demonstration. A Mica with a radar homing head was fired from a  Mirage 2000 against a patrol of two subsonic C22L  target-missiles at CEL.    Another multitarget engagement is slated for this year, says  Genest. Two electromagnetic Micas will engage two Aerospatiale  target-missiles in a more complex scenario involving electronic  countermeasures. Genest also announced multitarget launches for  infrared Micas, scheduled in 1995-96.    The infrared Micas will feature Matra-SAT's infrared imaging  homing head, whose final version (type B) has just been  delivered after prior airborne flight tests. According to  Genest, "Matra will be ready to fire the first infrared-guided  Mica in late 1994."    Technically, says the company, there is an 18-month to  two-year lapse between the two Mica versions (radar and  infrared), and Mica's development program has been rescheduled  for completion at the same time as the Rafale. Consequently,  most Mica flight tests will take place in 1994-95, with a few  additional adaptation or assessment launches in 1996-97.    Mica's industrialization is being prepared at the same time,  at the Celles Saint-Denis factory (Sologne) where Matra will  install the Mica production line in mid-1994. Mass production of  50 electromagnetic missiles a month will begin in late 1995,  with production of the infrared Mica kicking off 18 to 24 months  later, around the middle or end of 1997.    Genest says that should mean that an EM Mica will go into  service by the end of 1996 or early 1997, first aboard French or  export Mirage 2000s, notably Taiwan's. Taiwan was the first  foreign Mica customer, and has ordered 960 of the missiles for  its 60 Mirage 2000-5s. Moreover, the Mica is competing against  the AMRAAM in Sweden to arm the JAS-39/Gripen (see AIR &amp;  COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No. 1458). And Matra will  complete research on how to adapt the Mica to "European" F-16s  (Dutch, Belgian, Norwegian, and Danish) in 1994.</p>

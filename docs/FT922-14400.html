			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley recovery under way - Profits of Pounds 2.7m before substantial exceptional charges LAURA ASHLEY, the international retail group which has suffered losses since late 1989, yesterday claimed to be on the road to recovery with a Pounds 9.4m turnround to profits of Pounds 2.7m before tax and exceptional items in the year to January 25. Mr Jim Maxmin, the chief executive who joined the group last July, said he was 'very pleased with the results' which were indicative of the progress management was making. The shares were unchanged at 93p. Mr Andrew Higginson, finance director, said that after two 'traumatic years' the group was now demonstrating a number of positive trends, although it was too early to talk of a 'total fix'. Borrowings had fallen from a peak of Pounds 103m in March 1990 to Pounds 4.4m at the year end, helped by the Pounds 45m injection from the Japanese Aeon group. He said that Laura Ashley had instituted a policy of managing for margin not sales. Gross margins had risen, especially in the second half, he said, as the group cut production costs and refused to chase sales by cutting prices. Overheads had been reduced. At the operating profit level the group made Pounds 750,000 in the second half compared to Pounds 383,000 in the first half and a Pounds 3.1m loss in the second half of 1990-91. Mr Higginson said that current trading showed a continuation of trends with the US still a problem, UK sales flat but gross margins up again, and European sales up 13 per cent with profits ahead 14 per cent. Sales fell to Pounds 260.7m against Pounds 327.5m or a pro forma Pounds 289.2m if disposals and the change of the Revman subsidiary to an associate are excluded. Operating expenses were down to Pounds 140m (Pounds 160.4m or Pounds 148.9m) and operating profits were Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 5.3m or Pounds 2.7m). Associates and royalties contributed Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 400,000 or Pounds 2m pro forma) giving pre-interest profit of Pounds 5m (Pounds 5.7m or Pounds 4.7m). Interest charges fell Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 2.3m. However, there were exceptional items of Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 4.8m) leaving a Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 11.5m) loss before tax. Exceptionals covered Pounds 3.4m costs involved in setting up a new distribution agreement with Federal Express, a Pounds 1.1m rationalisation in the North American head office, Pounds 4.7m of other restructuring costs and Pounds 2.6m of stock write-downs. Mr Maxmin said there would be no exceptional items in the current year. Mr Higginson said that careful tax planning had meant negligible tax was payable and the tax charge would be well below UK corporation tax rates for a couple of years. Losses per share were 3.9p (4.4p) and a 0.1p token dividend is paid to retain trustee status; the Ashley family and directors would waive their dividends. COMMENT It is hard to believe now that Laura Ashley made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 23.1m in its peak year, 1987-88. It will be some time before that level is seen again. Mr Maxmin appears to be doing all the right things, and there are some easy initial targets. A Pounds 9m cut in overheads in a year and a fall in stocks from Pounds 105m to Pounds 57m in two years with another Pounds 25m to come is an indication of just how fat and inefficient the group had become. But once those things are sorted out one must wonder how much money can be made from an international brand which may be strong but is definitely niche. Meanwhile, on current year forecasts of Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 8m pre-tax the shares look ludicrously overpriced on a prospective p/e of about 35 on a sub-normal tax charge. But with Aeon holding 15 per cent the downside is limited.</p>

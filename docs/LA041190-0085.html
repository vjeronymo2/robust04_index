			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER VIEWS: 'BOLTING' AS EARTHQUAKE PROTECTION  </P> <P> Question: In view of the severity of damage caused by the San Francisco quake,  would bolting structures to their foundations reduce earthquake damage  substantially? Also, what does the recently announced $360-million earthquake  bond issue involve? -- N.H.J.  </P> <P> Answer: There's a lot to be said for the bolting idea. Fred Turner, a  structural engineer with the California State Seismic Commission, says: "I  believe that anchoring housing to foundations and 'cripple walls' is the best  form of earthquake insurance anyone could buy."  </P> <P> The seismic commission is developing statewide policies on earthquake  preparedness. Actually, Turner adds, bolting housing to its foundation may not  be necessary, depending on where you live.  </P> <P> "After the Long Beach quake in 1933, state legislation was passed specifying  seismic fittings for all new structures," Turner says. "However, for private  structures, this was made optional except that Los Angeles, Long Beach and a  few other cities went a step further and made it mandatory."  </P> <P> This means that if you live in Los Angeles and your home was built after 1933,  your foundation and house probably are already anchored.  </P> <P> What makes anchoring particularly appealing, according to Shirley Mattingly,  director of the Los Angeles Office of Emergency Management, and Carl Deppe,  chief of the earthquake safety division of the L.A.'s Department of Building  and Safety, is that it's a relatively simple procedure and not too costly.  </P> <P> What's involved, Deppe says, is anchoring wall plates to the foundation with  bolts "either bolting directly through a plate that sits on top of the  foundation or utilizing angle irons. The biggest problem, of course, is getting  in there because the under-floor clearance makes it a tight fit. That's where  bolting sideways, with angle irons, may be the most practical way to do it."  </P> <P> But in addition to bolting, Deppe and Turner emphasize, it's also necessary to  stiffen and brace the cripple walls, normally with plywood. These are short  walls -- 1 1/2 to 2 feet high -- extending from the wood floor to the footings.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, Mattingly, Deppe and Turner agree, bolting and shoring up the  cripple walls is practical only for single-family residences. (Multiple-unit  structures require more extensive earthquake retrofitting.) The cost of such a  project is unpredictable.  </P> <P> "Conceivably," Turner says, "a homeowner who is pretty handy could, with the  proper instruction, do it himself. Otherwise, you're going to have to call in a  contractor and it might be as little as a few hundred dollars for an  uncomplicated job, but perhaps a couple of thousand -- depending on the size  and complexity of the house. And, of course, if you're talking about hillside  houses or homes on stilts, it's going to be much more than that."  </P> <P> The bond issue now before the Los Angeles City Council, which you mentioned, is  a two-part measure, according to Mattingly, and the larger portion, about $300  million, is for funding to reinforce public buildings and public structures  such as bridges. The balance of about $80 million, she says, is "for upgrading  private housing through low-interest loans."  </P> <P> The seismic commission is sponsoring legislation that would mandate angle  bolting, the bracing of cripple walls and the erection of restraints on  chimneys for all older housing.  </P></p>

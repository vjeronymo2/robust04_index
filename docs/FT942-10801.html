			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Arts: Square Dance cachet - Ballet English National Ballet's amoebic existence this month - the company split for visits to small theatres - took one half (with an orchestra) to High Wycombe's Swan Theatre this week. The especial cachet of the tour is the acquisition of Balanchine's Square Dance. It is a stunning piece, with the conventions of American folksiness re-thought for ballet. There was, in the staging of 1957, a 'caller' yapping through the Vivaldi and Corelli concerti which are the score. He was a pestilential bore, and has mercifully long been abandoned. As now mounted, and well presented and lit, by ENB, curtain-rise reveals a luminous area containing six couples in simplest Balanchinian dress against a cyclorama. The look of the stage, after the Raymonda grand pas which began the programme with dark draperies, chandeliers and mimsy costuming, was like cool water after a glass of treacle-ish madeira. (The effect of the performances the same). The dance sets out clean patterns, and there enter two principals - Hope Muir and Giuseppe Picone on Wednesday afternoon. Square Dance is uncompromising in its clarity, and must be uncompromised in performance. I thought ENB's dancers made a fine first shot at choreography which offers them discipline, ideals of physical acuity, and not a little gaiety. They look good. A little more physical drive will make them look better, but this is dance - marvel suits them and they seem proud and happy in it. Hope Muir has the qualities of bright assurance her role needs; Picone, a young Italian recruit to the company, promises marvels. Brave technique, a premier danseur's physique and elegance of means, mark him as a talent to watch. In the nobly contemplative variation which Balanchine added to the ballet for the tremendous Bart Cook (a solo also danced with memorable poetry by Sean Lavery), Picone showed just how gifted he is. The opening Raymonda grand pas also brought remarkable male dancing. Frederic Franklin has set this collection of Petipa variations very well. They are devilishly hard to bring off, and need grander forces than anyone but the Bolshoi or Kirov can field. ENB's dancers do an honest best, but it was the former Kirov danseur Dmitri Gruzdyev (now with ENB) who told the truth about its style. It is a matter of dignity and broad phrasing in movement: Gruzdyev knows how to sustain interest in what is really a collection of academic cliches because his training is sprung from Raymonda's traditions. Across the century since its first performance, blood-lines from Sergey Legat (who created the role) to Gruzdyev are still to be traced. This triple bill ends with Wayne Sleep's Savoy Suite. I was not enchanted by it at an initial showing last year. ENB's tour visits Crawley, Dartford, Darlington, Basingstoke, during the next fortnight.</p>

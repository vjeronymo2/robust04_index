			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Slow slow, quick quick, slow: Philip Coggan and Emma Tucker test the strength and durability of the UK recovery 'The main reasons for doubting the durability of the present recovery appear to be: uncertainty about the strength of world recovery, and of Britain's ability to improve its trading performance, a belief that the recent consumer boom will fade away without triggering a new cycle of increased investment and general worries about the future of wage inflation.' That view could easily sum up the current debate about the health of the UK economic recovery. In fact, the quote dates from a Financial Times economic survey of September 1983, just as the UK was embarking on its longest postwar boom. As in 1983, the current uncertainty about whether the recovery is sustainable has been fuelled by apparently ambiguous economic indicators. After relatively buoyant figures released in January, statistics this week have shown that manufacturing output fell in December, while in January unemployment rose and bank lending was exceptionally weak. On the other hand, January house sales were up on January 1993. Conflicting signals are the hallmark of the early stages of an upturn. In 1983, for instance, gross domestic product rose by more than 3 per cent, but monthly manufacturing output figures showed falls on five out of 12 occasions and industrial production dropped on three. It may seem hard to believe, but the UK recovery has already lasted as long  -seven quarters - as the recession which preceded it. The trouble for the government is that the growth rate has been too slow to generate a 'feel-good' factor among consumers. 'This is what GDP growth of 1 1/2 -2 per cent feels like - slow, halting and patchy,' says Mr David Fell, economist at Business Strategies Limited, which studies regional economies. The picture is confirmed by Mr James Watson, chairman of NFC, the transport company whose fortunes are dependent on the general health of UK businesses. 'Overall, we have seen a slow and steady improvement rather than a boom,' he says. Mr Allen Yurko, chief executive of Siebe, a leading UK engineering group, adds: 'We're not dismayed by the recent economic numbers and we believe the unemployment figures were a blip. There has been no downturn in our business recently.' Most economists believe that - in spite of all the gloom generated by this week's figures - the economy is still on the same, sometimes bumpy growth path. Mr Sudhir Junankar, associate director for economic analysis at the Confederation of British Industry, says: 'You are seeing growth, but from a very low base.' The recovery has not been strong enough to allow manufacturing output to return to its pre-recession levels. In December 1993 it was still 5.5 per cent below the peak month of March 1990; machine tool sales were little more than half the level in 1990. The danger now for the economy is that tax increases in April will undermine consumer spending and so delay the economy's return to health. Last year's Budget changes mean the tax paid by a married man on average earnings will rise from Pounds 118.36 to Pounds 130.88 a month. Recent statistics on retail sales have been sending out particularly mixed signals. This partly reflects difficulties statisticians have had in making normal seasonal adjustments for Christmas and New Year shopping on December and January's figures. However, there is some indication of weakness already, even before the April tax increases. The figures suggest that consumer spending is patchy, with large retailers doing better than small ones and some stores being forced to make hefty price cuts to attract shoppers. January's retail prices index, for example, showed prices of goods such as furniture and electrical appliances, recorded their largest monthly fall since comparable records began in 1956. Accordingly, the views of retailers on the outlook are mixed. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades panel, says: 'I don't believe that the pace of recovery is diminishing. There is no panic and gloom and doom out there. Most retailers say that by and large there is a reasonably steady pace of recovery.' But Mr John Bryson, centre manager of the Metro centre in Gateshead, says: 'Sales just fell off the cliff after the middle of January. People had run out of money after a good Christmas and January sales period.' The real fear of retailers, he says, is that the public have not realised by how much their disposable incomes will be cut. Mr John Clare, chief executive of electrical retailer Dixons, says: 'While the longer-term indices are suggesting that recovery is there, the market for discretionary purchases, as opposed to food and other basics, is still very tough . . . The worrying thing is that, when the taxes go up in April, it will be the first time that people have felt worse off for a long time. 'As we have come out of this recession, most consumers have generally felt better off. Now the government has decided to tackle its deficit and there is a danger that this will threaten the recovery considerably.' Estimates this week from the London Business School suggested that the impact of the tax increases in the next two financial years would be relatively mild, causing economic growth to slow to 2.2 per cent next year, from 2.5 per cent in 1994. Nevertheless, such growth rates would not be sufficient to bring down unemployment substantially, say, or to absorb idle manufacturing capacity. The likelihood of only modest growth may tempt the government into cutting base interest rates, from the current 5 1/4 per cent, to offset the effect of the tax increase. The Treasury is aware, however, of the risks of being buffeted by one month's set of figures, especially after the previous month's data had been stronger than expected - and the seasonal adjustments around Christmas are so unreliable. One of the reasons why the Bank of England and the Treasury were so heavily criticised by City analysts for cutting base rates by a quarter of a percentage point last week was that there seemed no immediate need to stimulate the economy. For the Treasury, this week's figures are not sufficient evidence that the economic recovery is faltering. Similarly, Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, says: 'These are the figures for only the first month of 1994 and we must not fall into the trap of staging a monthly examination in which we pull up the plant to see whether the roots are growing.' But that has not stopped some economists calling for immediate action to propel the economy on to a faster growth track. Professor Wynne Godley, one of the six advisers to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, says the government should put less emphasis on using interest rates to try to maintain some sort of currency parity with other European Union countries. 'People seem to forget that the US had a tremendous cut in interest rates a long time ago, as did the Japanese. We musn't be imprisoned by the daft notions of the French and Germans but should pursue US-type policies which have been shown to produce growth while not being inflationary,' he says. As yet there is little sign that either the Treasury or the Bank of England favours such an aggressive policy. They are happy for now with a low-growth, low-inflation economy. Observers will have to get used to monthly economic figures which point to a less than exhilarating return to growth.</p>

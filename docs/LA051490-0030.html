			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : MISSION ACCOMPLISHED, BUT 'STUFF'S A WONDER  </P> <P> Compare these two overheard observations about the Mission U.K. and the Wonder  Stuff when the English bands shared a bill at the Hollywood Palladium on  Friday. On the Mission: "They sound like everybody, and they sound like  nobody."  </P> <P> And the Wonder Stuff: "They sound like nobody else."  </P> <P> The headlining Mission piled up many influences and styles -- from Sgt. Pepper  psychedelia to Led Zep weightiness -- yet operated in an artistic void. On the  other hand, the Stuff, with perhaps even more identifiable influences, made its  folk-rock/grunge-rock brew seem effortlessly original.  </P> <P> Encores of Patti Smith's "Dancing Barefoot" (a solo acoustic spot for head  Missionary Wayne Hussey) and the Cure's "In Between Days" provided the only  real context for the Mission's music. But the Wonder Stuff's surprising melding  of John Lennon's tortured "Gimme Me Some Truth" and Jane's Addiction's equally  tormented "Jane Says" served to sharpen and expand already winning impressions.  And where Hussey performed as if he has some heavy message to impart, the  Wonder Stuff's Miles Hunt looked as if he was doing this just because he felt  like it. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

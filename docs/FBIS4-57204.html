			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Channel 7 News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity  [URNG] admitted it has imposed a war tax on large farm owners  but denied that it made death threats against farmers. Last week  the General Association of Farmers of Guatemala accused the  guerrillas of making death threats against 213 farm owners and  demanding a war tax in exchange for not destroying cattle  ranches and coffee, banana, and sugar cane crops.    The guerrillas issued a document in Mexico City arguing that  in a country at war, these political-military operations are  directed against the economic interests of one sector  responsible for the continuation of the armed conflict. This  measure only affects the properties and belongings of those  farmers who refuse to pay the war tax and who have derived large  profits from the sweat of a labor force resembling the colonial  encomiendas, the URNG said.    The URNG leadership warned that such operations will  continue  so long as the armed conflict continues and so long as it is not  resolved by negotiations or political agreements between  negotiating parties.    Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez Morales made these  comments to "Channel 7 News:"    [Begin Enriquez recording] We are doing all we can to track  down the individuals who are extorting money from farmers and  those who favor [words indistinct] job opportunity in Guatemala.  Guatemala's productive sector has been hit hard by the URNG.  They are now demanding war taxes of up to 2 million quetzales.  In general, they ask for 250,000, 150,000, or 100,000 quetzales  in war taxes. Those who do not pay face the destruction of  their farms. Workers from many farms -- we have confirmed  this in areas we have patrolled -- [words indistinct] farmers  are trying to collect money to pay and then disregard the  workers. [Words indistinct] pay the extortion or that ill-named  war tax and disregard their workers. I even spoke to producers  in [words indistinct] and Escuintla. I asked if they wanted to  form voluntary committees [words indistinct] I would do it.  Why? Because the rebels are giving me a reason to do this, and  the human rights agreement that was signed deals with this.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Spanish futures and options trade enters new phase - The launch of a bond contract tailored to generate more foreign business The launch of futures and options contracts on 10-year Spanish government bonds on Friday marks a further stage in the rapid expansion of the country's derivatives markets. The development of futures and options trading has been fuelled by the liberalisation of Spain's financial markets, allowing a large inflow of foreign investment. On the domestic front, new legislation designed to pave the way for collective investment trusts to use futures and options is set to boost trading further. Two and a half years after the country's first derivatives exchange was set up, Spain's two exchanges have been restructured to operate under a single holding company. Meff Renta Variable trades equity products in Madrid; Meff Renta Fija lists interest rate and currency products in Barcelona. The future on the 10-year notional government bond, and the option on the future, is of particular interest to international investors, whose bond holdings are concentrated at the long end of the yield curve. 'We have seen substantial interest from non-resident clients,' said Mr Luis Lucena, a government bond trader at Banco NatWest in Madrid. 'The (existing) five-year contract is not liquid, and the three-year contract is too short for non-residents.' The exchange also lists a three-month Madrid interbank offered rate (Mibor) contract. The contract will encourage spread-trading between different bond markets. Since most liquid bond futures are based on 10-year bonds, the creation of a 10-year Spanish bond future will allow dealers to trade between, for example, 10-year German bund futures and 10-year Spanish bond futures. However, some traders have expressed doubts about the potential liquidity of the 10-year contract, due to the small size of the cash market. The Spanish Treasury only started issuing 10-year bonds two years ago, but has assured the market that it plans to increase activity in the 10-year area. Even the moderately successful three-year contract is much less actively traded than the cash market, according to traders. On the equities side of the business, Meff RV launched futures and options on the renamed Ibex 35 Spanish stock index in January. Average daily volume in March reached close to 10,000 contracts (futures and options) per day, according to Mr Jose Massa, chief executive of Meff RV. However, the contracts are not sufficiently liquid for many institutional investors. 'The size of the contracts is very small,' said one London-based equity derivatives trader. 'You you would have to buy about 50 contracts to have the equivalent of one FT-SE contract.' Some traders have suggested that fees should be cut on large trades, both for equity and bond products, to encourage institutional participation. The exchange will start trading individual stock options in September. Initially, options on three to five liquid stocks, increasing to 15, will be listed. 'There will be a lot of interest in options on the major stocks, like Telefonica and the leading banks,' said one trader. Meff RF's currency contracts, on the other hand, have flopped. Both pesetas/dollar and pesetas/D-Mark contracts are scarcely traded. Because Spain acted quickly to develop its derivatives markets, it does not face the same problems as the Italians, who plan to launch government bond futures this summer, but will have to compete with a successful rival contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange.</p>

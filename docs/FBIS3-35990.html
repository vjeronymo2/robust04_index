Their Killers Have Not Been Found, Their Families Are Still  Awaiting Condolences...."]    [Text] U.S. congressmen make the development of relations  with Vietnam directly dependent upon Hanoi's readiness to  clarify the fate of U.S. MIA's in the Vietnam war. And that is  not a diplomatic whim: The history of the pretty difficult  relations between Washington and Hanoi cannot be rewritten --  what happened, happened. But it is impossible to inaugurate a  "new era" between them while the fate of the last soldier from  that almost 20-year-old war still remains unknown.    It is not always proper to draw analogies in such a delicate  area as relations between two countries, but they do sometimes  arise. Like, for example, today, on the eve of Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi, where it is expected  that a "major" interstate treaty on friendship and cooperation  will be signed. Credit and praise are due to those who have  tirelessly advanced this solemn moment. There have been  difficulties. And there still are: After all, Georgia is  signing a treaty with a country which it saw -- at the height of  the Abkhazian campaign -- as its main adversary and,  incidentally, stated so from the highest rostrums....    But, be that as it may, it would be good to inugurate the  "new era" in relations by eliminating misunderstandings. The  killers of Major Vladimir Berilov, Captain Yakov Ivanov, the  8-year-old captain's daughter Marina Savostina, and another 69  Russian servicemen and members of their families still roam free  in Georgia to this day. There is no statute of limitation for  these crimes. But if it is impossible for some reason to track  down the criminals (although the killer of a U.S. diplomat was  found in Tbilisi in just a matter of days. Excuses were not  enough. Was it because he was an American?) is it really  impossible to expresss, albeit belatedly, very belatedly, simple  human sympathy to the families of the Russians whoi have been  killed?    German World War II POW's who died in Georgia have had a  memorial erected in the republic's capital. Is it because they  were Germans?    But who will answer for the Russians, will they be  remembered  during the talks in Tbilisi?</p>

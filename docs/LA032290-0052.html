			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ PROVES TOO MUCH FOR CLIPPERS, 118-102;  </P> <P> CLIPPERS: MALONE OUTLASTS DEFENSE TO SCORE 28 POINTS. UTAH BECOMES THIRD  WESTERN CONFERENCE TEAM TO CLINCH PLAYOFF BERTH.  </P> <P> Karl Malone had scored only four points and no rebounds, and it was no real  surprise that the Clippers were leading the Utah Jazz, 29-21, after the first  quarter Wednesday.  </P> <P> And, to Malone, it was no surprise that he finished with 28 points, only three  below his average, which is second in the NBA. Also, it was no surprise that  the Jazz beat the Clippers, 118-102, and clinched a playoff spot.  </P> <P> Malone said the Clippers stopped him in the first quarter with the same kind of  defense other teams have tried.  </P> <P> "It's been something I've been faced with all year, double- and triple-teamed,"  he said. "But I'll let you in on a little secret -- they'll wear out before I  will."  </P> <P> He hasn't worn out yet. Nor has John Stockton, who scored 23 points and sparked  a fourth-quarter spurt to take control of the game.  </P> <P> Utah led, 87-86, with 7:55 left when Stockton's three-point shot started a 20-6  run to move to a 107-92 advantage with 2:23 to play. Darrell Griffith had 10 of  his 17 points during the final quarter.  </P> <P> Stockton was the catalyst to another spurt, this in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Los Angeles led, 38-26, early in the second quarter. Stockton started a 13-2  run that later tied it, 42-42.  </P> <P> "Stockton made about three great plays in a row," Utah Coach Jerry Sloan said.  "We were trying to find a way to win. It wouldn't have happened if we didn't do  something defensively."  </P> <P> The Jazz, leading the Midwest Division at 48-19, joined the Lakers and the  Portland Trail Blazers as Western Conference teams in the playoffs. Utah is  three games ahead of the San Antonio Spurs in the Midwest Division and has won  22 of its last 23 games in the Salt Palace. The Jazz's home record of 31-4 is  second best in the NBA behind the Detroit Pistons.  </P> <P> Thurl Bailey added 21 for the Jazz.  </P> <P> The Clippers were led by Winston Garland's 23 points and dropped their third  consecutive road game to fall to 26-41. They are 9-26 away from the Sports  Arena. The Clippers have lost eight of their last nine road games.  </P> <P> Charles Smith had 20 points for the Clippers and Ken Norman 17.  </P></p>

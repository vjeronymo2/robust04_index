			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 9 (XINHUA) -- A local newspaper  today quoted a senior Chinese official as saying that there is  lack of sincerity on the part of the British side from the very  beginning of the Sino-British talks over the Hong Kong issue.    Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong  Kong Branch, made these remarks at a public occasion held here  on Tuesday [8 March] night in response to the Hong Kong  Government's decision to table the remaining part of its  political reform bill to the Legislative Council.    Zhang said that the Chinese side had always wanted to  cooperate with the British side over the Hong Kong issue, but  the British side did not want that cooperation.    The unilateral action taken by the British side last  December  to table the first part of Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's  Political Reform Bill to the Legislative Council regardless of  the repeated admonitions by the Chinese side had already  signaled that they had not really wanted the talks, said Zhang.    "In fact, there is lack of sincerity on the part of the  British side from the very beginning of the Sino-British talks,"  he said.    Zhang listed a number of facts to support his argument.    In view of the records of the British side for not being  able  to abide by agreements, he said that the Chinese side had  insisted that certain principles of the talks must be set up  before the two sides began to talk.    But the British side refused to do so, he said, adding that  the Chinese side later made concessions over the issue so that  the talks could proceed.    However, said Zhang, during the talks the British side had  put forward a number of unreasonable demands including things  amounting to interference in the sovereign rights of China and  affairs that should be handled by the future government of the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.    In order to break the deadlock of the talks and achieve an  agreement, Zhang went on, the Chinese side later proposed to  solve the easier problems regarding the 1994-95 electoral  arrangements in Hong Kong first before more difficult ones were  touched upon.    At first, the British side objected to the proposal, said  Zhang. The two sides were not able to sit down to talk until the  Chinese side had accepted a number of preconditions put forward  by the British side, he added.    However, Zhang said, when the two sides were almost to reach  an agreement, the British side suddenly decided to withdraw from  the talks by finding some flimsy excuses.    Now it is very clear that the Chinese side has made its  utmost efforts in the Sino-British talks over the Hong Kong  issue, said Zhang, adding that it is the British side that has  sabotaged the talks and cooperation between the two sides.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos and  Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou, who returned to  Athens from Brussels at noon today, described the European press  attacks on the Greek [European Union--EU] presidency as unfair.  Mr. Pangalos stressed that intensive efforts and prudence are  needed during the process of accepting three new partners into  the EU, and added that his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel had  contributed considerably to these efforts. Our correspondent  Mirela Kalostipi has the following report.    [Kalostipi] Mr. Pangalos and Mr. Papandreou returned from  Brussels with harsh reproaches for the European press for its  systematic attacks on the Greek presidency. The alternate  foreign minister and the deputy foreign minister, who  successfully concluded the marathon meeting of the Ministerial  Council on the expansion of the EU, expressed great unhappiness  with press reports that undermine the Greek presidency's  efforts. However, Mr. Pangalos expressed gratitude for the  support of German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who--contrary  to the UK, French, and Spanish foreign ministers--has  contributed substantially to the presidency's efforts. Mr.  Pangalos said: Intensive efforts and prudence were needed. The  negotiations have been concluded with three of the four  countries--that is, Sweden, Finland, and Austria. By 1 January  1995 they will participate in various EU bodies by sending  ministers as observers and they will also participate in the EU  Council meeting to be held in Corfu.    The alternate foreign minister particularly referred to  Cyprus, saying that it should have already been included as a  candidate country if former Prime Minister Konstandinos  Mitsotakis had taken care of this in time at the European  meeting in Edinburgh. In any case, Greece will see that the  process for Cyprus' accession is speeded up--that is, earlier  than 1 January 1995.    Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou described the  European press attacks as unfair, but added that key elements of  the EU recognize Greece's efforts.    Responding to a question on an initiative by the EU  Commission president on the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia] problem, Mr. Pangalos made it clear that yesterday  he conveyed the prime minister's letter officially. He said Mr.  Jacques Delors is following the issue carefully. Referring to  Greece's legal arguments on the measures against Skopje, Mr.  Pangalos described them as sound.</p>

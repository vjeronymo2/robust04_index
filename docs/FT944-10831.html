			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Scots accountants seek review on audit liability risks Scottish accountants are to call for independent research into claims that court action over audit liability could destroy one of the Big Six accountancy firms. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland will ask the government later this week to begin an inquiry into calls for reform of the law on liability. At present the Big Six, backed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, are pressing the government to reform the Companies Act. They say that 'joint and several liability' means they are exposed to claims after corporate failures which could eventually lead to the collapse of one of the Big Six. But the Scottish institute's report, written by a working party headed by Sir James McKinnon, takes a radically different line and seeks to get an independent judgment on the real risks the big firms face. It says if a case does exist, it will be strengthened by independent research. It argues that an imbalance appears to exist between the level of damages sought and the funds available to meet such actions. The public interest claims made by the profession for reform of the law on audit liability are not proven, the report says. In the medium term the report seeks a statutory limit on liability and a series of other reforms. The report is likely to call for the limit to be substantial to meet responsible claims. It should be based on a set amount or a formula. One suggestion made in the past has been 10 times the turnover of the company involved. It also calls, controversially, for the principle of 'joint and several liability' to remain. It considers the alternatives to be inequit-able. Finally it asks the successor to the Cadbury committee on corporate governance, to be appointed next year, to consider requiring company directors to hold insurance cover against claims for damages.</p>

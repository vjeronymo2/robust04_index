			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ALEXANDER DELIVERS AGAIN AS TIGERS WIN, 4-2  </P> <P> In a career that began with the Dodgers way back in 1971, Doyle Alexander has  had his ups and downs.  </P> <P> Alexander, who will be 39 in September, has pitched for eight different major  league teams, and has won 17 games three different times.  </P> <P> But he may now be pitching as well as he ever has.  </P> <P> Although he only improved his record to 4-4 by holding the White Sox to three  hits in seven innings in the Detroit Tigers' 4-2 victory Monday at Chicago,  Alexander has been outstanding.  </P> <P> This was the big right-hander's 11th start. He has had only one bad outing,  against the heavy-hitting Angels when he was hammered out in the fourth inning  May 8.  </P> <P> In all the others except the start on May 19, he pitched at least seven innings  in each and never gave up more than three runs. On May 19, Alexander had a  two-hit shutout until he was hit in the face by a line drive in the sixth  inning.  </P> <P> Alexander suffered a hairline fracture of the jaw, but he hasn't missed a turn  and has given up only one run in 14 innings since the injury.  </P> <P> "I had to come out after seven today," Alexander said. "My lower back stiffened  because in the last two games, I was pitching more straight up than I normally  do.  </P> <P> "Up to this point this season, I've probably pitched as well as I ever have  before. Except for the one poor start I've pitched pretty doggone well."  </P> <P> Alexander impressed Chicago Manager Jeff Torborg for one.  </P> <P> "He was outstanding," Torborg said. "He obviously didn't have his best stuff  today. He finessed his way through and got a lot of outs with his fastball. If  he makes a mistake, it's with his fastball."  </P> <P> The Tiger offense was confined to a grand slam by Matt Nokes in the fourth  inning with two out. He hit the third of his career to make a loser of Eric  King (4-4).  </P> <P> After Alexander said he was too weary to continue, Mike Henneman took over.  Guillermo Hernandez had to get the final out.  </P> <P> Baltimore 6, Texas 1 -- The upstart Orioles have no respect for their elders.  They treated Nolan Ryan, 42, in a most shabby manner at Baltimore.  </P> <P> Mickey Tettleton, Larry Sheets and Cal Ripken hit home runs off Ryan (5-3) and  enabled Brian Holton to get his first victory as a starter in his sixth  attempt. The former Dodger gave up no runs on five hits in 5 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> Ripken's home run, just his third on the season, was his first in 40 games. It  is the longest he went without a home run in his career.  </P> <P> Although he had his home run ball working, Ryan struck out 10 in six innings.  He gave up only two other hits besides the home runs.  </P> <P> Cleveland 5, Toronto 3 -- Jerry Browne is becoming the Indians' most consistent  clutch hitter, but he still finds a run batted in something special.  </P> <P> Browne had three hits and drove in two runs in this victory at Cleveland.  Although he's batted in the No. 2 spot most of the season, Browne has driven in  22 runs.  </P> <P> He's wasted few opportunities. His .405 batting average with runners in scoring  position is best on the team. He has hit safely in 13 of his last 14 games and  has raised his average to .273.  </P> <P> "I'm no big RBI guy," the second baseman said. "It just happens that this year  I've come up often with men in scoring position."  </P> <P> Browne's hitting helped Tom Candiotti, who gave up two earned runs in seven  innings, improve his record to 6-2.  </P> <P> Mike Flanagan (3-5) of the Blue Jays left after two innings because of a sore  shoulder.  </P> <P> New York 6, Seattle 3 -- Just a couple of weeks ago, it seemed Richard Dotson  was in more danger of being dropped by the Yankees than Tommy John.  </P> <P> Suddenly, though, Dotson is beginning to resemble the guy who won 22 games for  the White Sox in 1983.  </P> <P> Dotson (2-2) beat the Mariners for the first time in five years in this game at  New York. He gave up nine hits in 6 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> The Yankees made it easy for Dotson by scoring five times in the first four  innings off Dennis Powell. Powell, normally a reliever, was a late replacement  for Erik Hanson, who had a stiff shoulder.  </P> <P> Dotson didn't learn about the pending release of John until after the game. "I  think he could still pitch," Dotson said.  </P> <P> Boston 3, Oakland 2 -- Marty Barrett celebrated the signing of a new contract  by delivering a game-winning single in the 10th inning at Boston.  </P> <P> Barrett signed an extension through the 1991 season with an option for 1992.  </P> <P> With one out and Randy Kutcher on second, Barrett rapped a single to beat Bob  Welch (6-4).  </P> <P> The absence of bullpen ace Dennis Eckersley with a shoulder problem has forced  Oakland Manager Tony LaRussa to change some plans.  </P> <P> Ordinarily, Welch, who gave up only five hits in nine innings, would not have  gone out to pitch the 10th. Eckersley would have.  </P> <P> Kansas City 7, Minnesota 1 -- Bo Jackson doubled and tripled to lead the  Royals' assault on Frank Viola at Kansas City.  </P> <P> The Royals pounded the Cy Young Award winner for seven runs and 12 hits in just  five innings. Viola's record fell to 3-7 and his earned-run average soared to  4.63. After a rocky start this season, Viola had won three of his previous four  starts.  </P> <P> Jackson, stretching his hitting streak to nine games, doubled home two runs in  the third and from then on Viola was no mystery.  </P> <P> Bret Saberhagen held the Twins to five hits in five innings, but had to leave  because of stiffness in his right shoulder.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Coalition Government Aims Only To Stay in </F> Power"]    [Text] The political situation has been mired in turmoil  triggered by Prime Minister Hosokawa's announcement of his  intention to resign. Now that the ruling coalition parties have  moved closer to reaching an agreement in which they will  maintain the coalition government and choose Deputy Prime  Minister and Foreign Minister Hata as the successor to Prime  Minister Hosokawa, the political turmoil has begun to show signs  of subsiding. If things go smoothly, a new prime minister will  be named and a new government inaugurated early next week.    The prime minister's personal financial scandal triggered  the  collapse of the coalition government. However, in fact the  Hosokawa government was on the verge of collapse after rapidly  losing its centripetal force [kyushinryoku] following enactment  of the Political Reform Law, which was high on the domestic  agenda of the Hosokawa government. The ruling coalition parties  were feuding over such major issues as reshuffling the cabinet  and planning a national welfare tax; the cabinet lost its  cohesiveness. The confrontation among the ruling coalition  parties stemmed from their policy differences, their different  policy-decision processes, their different political tactics,  and their diverging perspective of the coalition government.    Their confrontation abruptly surfaced in the wake of  Hosokawa's announcement of his resignation. The confrontation  could lead to a change in the coalition framework. There is  significance in the Hosokawa government bringing about a change  of government after ending one-party rule by the Liberal  Democratic Party. The ruling coalition parties that were united  by their consensus on the need to push for political reform  formed the coalition government. Now that the Political Reform  Law has been enacted, the Hosokawa cabinet has accomplished its  primary mission.    We hope all political parties will use Hosokawa's  resignation  as the best chance to rally political forces around a consensus  of policies and political beliefs, transcending the framework of  the LDP or non-LDP, in order to realign themselves. Even if the  coalition partners formed another new coalition government to  stay in power, their energy would be consumed coordinating the  infighting, leaving key policy tasks unaccomplished. Politics  would ultimately reach the point where politicians ratify policy  decisions made by bureaucrats.    While Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party]; Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito;  and former Deputy Prime Minister Watanabe of the LDP are making  visible moves, Sakigake [Harbinger] has announced a party  platform entitled "our party's basic attitude toward forming a  new government." These moves are aimed at realigning the  established political parties based on a consensus of policies  and political beliefs.    Under the present situation, where the Diet's deliberation  of  a draft budget for fiscal 1994 has yet to be held, it is  necessary to form a new government as soon as possible and keep  the current political turmoil from being protracted. In that  sense, there is not enough time left to choose a candidate to  succeed Hosokawa as prime minister and form a new government,  all of which could lead to a full-fledged realignment of the  political parties. If a new prime minister is chosen under the  present coalition framework, the action may be accepted  positively by the people as an emergency evacuation.    The ruling coalition parties lost their common policy goals  following enactment of the Political Reform Law. What are they  going to do in a post-Hosokawa government? The ruling coalition  parties widely differ from each other on how to reform the  current tax system, how to handle North Korea's suspected  nuclear development, how to shape an identical view on the  state, and how to realign the established political parties. It  would be lamentable if the adhesive that until now has held the  ruling coalition parties together is also used as a mean to keep  them in power--in other words, to keep the LDP from taking power.    The political upheaval is beginning to subside because the  ruling coalition parties have found it is in their interests to  keep the coalition framework from collapsing, deciding to give  priority to keeping themselves in power while shelving their  differences over major policies and basic political beliefs.  They have decided to do so based on the calculation they will  face difficulty maneuvering for a majority of seats in the Diet,  and do not want to abandon their savory positions as ruling  parties. If the coalition government remains in power with its  basic policy differences left uncoordinated, it will be a  temporary government tasked with getting the 1994 budget passed  in the Diet. Sooner or later, there will be full-fledged moves  to realign the political parties.</p>

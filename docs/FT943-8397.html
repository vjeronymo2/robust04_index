			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder chief to quit Australia's largest food processor, Goodman Fielder, said its chairman, Mr John Studdy, would stand down once an external successor is found and that two additional non-executive directors would be appointed, Reuter reports from Sydney. The company's future has been under a cloud recently after a revolt by shareholders, led by Melbourne businessman Mr Doug Shears, whose company Agrifood Australia owns 3.5 per cent of the stock. 'While Mr Studdy has the full support of the board, he recognises the need for a succession plan and the appointment in due course of an external successor,' Goodman said. 'The chairman has indicated a desire and a willingness to stand down, when a successor has been found. This transition will ensure the stability of the board and will allow the board to continue its process of change.' Mr Shears had rallied three groups of institutional investors with a combined shareholding of just under 16 per cent to his side, and called for a shake-up in the Goodman boardroom. Goodman has recorded flat profits for the past five years, resulting in its share price remaining little changed over the same period and making the company a regular subject of takeover talk. Mr Shears has carried on a battle with the Goodman board for nearly two years since his privately-owned food group sold the Uncle Toby's breakfast cereals business to Goodman in exchange for Goodman shares and a board seat. However, Goodman later refused Mr Shears admission to the board following disagreements with the management at the time. Goodman posted a net profit of ADollars 182m (USDollars 135m) on sales of ADollars 4bn in the year to June 1993. Analysts expect the company to report a slightly poorer performance in the 1993-94 year. Goodman shares closed 4 cents lower at ADollars 1.34 yesterday.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Accountancy rule adoption 'slow' COMPANIES are proving slow to adopt the new accounting standard on profit and loss accounts, according to Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monthly monitoring service of annual reports. Just six companies - 4 per cent of those issuing annual reports in the 11 weeks since FRS 3 standard was circulated in late October - have adopted its guidance. That compares with 16 companies, or 10 per cent, which adopted FRS 1, the other principal accounting standard, in the same period after its publication. FRS 1 was introduced in September 1991 and deals with cashflow. Mr Iain Martin of Company Reporting said adoption might be slower because 'people are not so sure about whether it is a good thing'. He said FRS 1 was welcomed as an improvement on the old source and application of funds statement.</p>

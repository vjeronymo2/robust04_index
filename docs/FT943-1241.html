			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Union optimistic over rail deal Both sides in the rail dispute were last night edging closer to a deal that could bring an end to nearly three months of disruption on the network. After more than 40 hours of talks over five days at the conciliation service Acas, RMT transport union officials believe a package of measures linking higher pay to improved efficiency is close to completion. Negotiations are expected to continue at Acas today. Last night, union officials said the talks were unlikely to produce an immediate settlement that could be approved by both the union and Railtrack, the state-owned company responsible for maintaining the network's infrastructure. They said it was more likely the RMT would acknowledge publicly that the best deal achievable in the circumstances had been negotiated and there was no possibility of further improvement. Any deal would have to be put to the union's executive before going to ballot. The 4,600 signal workers who have staged 19 days of strikes would have the final say on whether to accept any proposed pay and efficiency package. The union executive could decide whether to recommend acceptance or rejection of the offer but it could not exercise any power of veto. The RMT could hold a ballot this week if a settlement is reached soon. Union officials said the RMT would be likely to give some ground to secure a deal, although it would not give in to all management demands. 'It will be a typical compromise after a long dispute,' one senior RMT member said.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTRA TRIBUNAL AFFIRMS CONVICTION OF REBEL CHIEFTAIN ACCUSED OF MURDER  </P> <P> A Nicaraguan rebel appeals tribunal upheld the conviction of one commander,  exonerated another officer and reduced charges against four others in a  torture-murder case, a Contra spokesman said Thursday.  </P> <P> Five of the six Contras were given dishonorable discharges -- the stiffest  penalty that can be handed out by a Contra internal court system that was set  up in 1987. Leniency was recommended for one and another was freed of the  charges, according to a document obtained by the Associated Press.  </P> <P> The Contra tribunal, made up of four lawyers living in Miami, issued a lengthy  statement, finding that rebel commander Isaac Blacker Hurtado, known as  Israelita, "had the premeditated intention of murdering Managua 2," the nom de  guerre for the deceased.  </P> <P> Managua 2 was suspected of being an agent of Nicaragua's Sandinista government.  The six Contras were charged last March by a Contra court in connection with  his death and several rapes in northern Nicaragua. The United States pressed  for the investigation.  </P></p>

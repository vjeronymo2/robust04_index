			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Ban Regal cigarette ads, says watchdog THE HEALTH Education Authority yesterday called for a ban on advertisements for Embassy Regal cigarettes following research which is said to show that the advertisements appeal to children and teenagers. It is the first time the government-funded authority, which opposes all tobacco promotion, has attacked the advertising of one brand. The move came as the government's chief medical officer, Dr Kenneth Calman, disclosed in his annual report yesterday that the number of teenage smokers has not fallen significantly in recent years. The HEA has written to the Advertising Standards Authority calling for the withdrawal of posters which feature a middle-aged, irreverent character called Reg and his views on life. The posters - which appear mainly in Scotland, Wales and northern England - have the ASA approval required by all cigarette advertisements under a voluntary industry agreement. The posters have also won two top advertising industry awards. The HEA said its research showed that 91 per cent of teenagers in northern England had seen the 'Reg' advertisements compared with 49 per cent of adults. More boys aged nine and 10 than adults liked the campaign, it said. According to the HEA's findings: 'Reg's irreverent view of authority appears to be just what children want to hear. His flippant attitude to life is extended to smoking, and it has become clear that children felt that Reg is giving them permission to smoke.' The HEA says the research demonstrates that the campaign contravenes ASA rules. Those state that cigarette advertisements 'should not be designed, written or published in such a way as to make it likely that they will appeal more to those under 18 than to the public at large'. Examples of the slogans are: Reg on party politics - 'If you drop ash on the carpet you won't get invited again'; Reg on the Exchange Rate Mechanism - 'Erm'. The HEA says Reg has become an 'icon' among children who see him on the way to school every day. Surveys showed that 'children in Manchester no longer called each other a Wally to denote stupidity, they called each other a Reg,' said the authority. The ASA said yesterday that it would study the findings. The advertising agency responsible for the campaign, Lowe Howard-Spink, denied that it had targeted children for the campaign. Imperial Tobacco, the Hanson subsidiary which owns the brand, said the intention had been to 'persuade smokers of other manufacturers' brands to switch to our own, not to persuade anyone to start smoking or to smoke more'. The advertising agency and Imperial Tobacco both said they had not yet examined the HEA's methodology.</p>

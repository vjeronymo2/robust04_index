			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- Cities in the valley of  the Chang Jiang river fully support the construction of the  Three Gorges water conservancy project.    The project, to be built on the middle reaches of this  China's longest river, near Yichang city, Hubei Province, will  have a generating capacity of 17.68 million kw upon completion.    Shanghai, on the Chang Jiang estuary, took the lead in  encouraging its enterprises and organizations to set up economic  entities around the construction site to offer more jobs for  local people.    It also allocated special funds to help Yichang train  technicians.    Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, has completed 60 projects  with a total investment of 83.47 million yuan in co-operation  with Yichang city.    Located on the upper reaches of the Yangtze, Chongqing city  in Sichuan Province has set up production bases for building  materials and farm and sideline products specially geared to the  construction of the Three Gorges project.</p>

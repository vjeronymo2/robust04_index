			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Deputy Vitaliy Masol at the Ukrainian Supreme </F> Council following his nomination by President Leonid Kravchuk  for the post of prime minister, in Kiev -- live]    [Text] Esteemed chairman, esteemed president, esteemed  people's deputies: I would like first of all to extend my  sincere appreciation to President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk for  nominating me to the high and responsible post of Ukraine's  prime minister. I am sincerely grateful to Supreme Council  Chairman Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz for his support and to  all the people's deputies who asked me long before my nomination  as the proposed head of government to agree to this proposal. I  hope that they intend to support me during the voting.    In agreeing to lead the government, if I am appointed today  to do so, I am fully aware of the enormous responsibility placed  on anyone making this decision during this difficult period that  our young independent state is undergoing. I would like to  assure you in all frankness that my intention and consent to  take this important state office, if the nomination is  successful, is not based on some personal ambition or selfish  interest, but is based solely on an understandable desire to use  my intelligence, my experience, and my skill to overcome the  economic difficulties, improve the people's living standards,  and strengthen our statehood. This was the main purpose for  which our electors sent us to Ukraine's top legislative body in  an expression of supreme confidence and perhaps their last hope.    You understand that each of the possible candidates for this  post simply cannot today have a specific program of action for  the future government. Such a document may be drawn up on the  basis of an in-depth professional analysis of the state of the  economy and the practical needs of our development with due  account of proposals coming from the commissions and individual  people's deputies. All members of the government who will be  involved in the implementation of the program should take part  in its preparation.    Taking this into account, let me only dwell on the key  conceptual approaches and certain organizational and practical  issues which in my opinion require urgent solutions, and set out  my position, my views, on the most important sociopolitical  problems facing our state. I believe I should also outline my  ideas as to the principles of forming the new government and  organizing its work. That is, of course, if you should trust me  to head the government.    Esteemed deputies, my political orientation is based on the  premise that Ukraine must continue to develop as an independent,  law-governed, democratic state. Our common cause, regardless of  party affiliation, must be a concern for the strengthening of  Ukraine's sovereignty, preservation of its territorial  integrity, and inviolability of its borders. This is the most  important task for Ukraine's budding statehood.    Ukraine is a market economy, a state that cares for the  social protection of its citizens. Ukraine means privatization.  The economic crisis that we are going through has in the recent  years enriched us with a considerable, though, unfortunately,  mostly negative experience. To a great extent, it has become  clearer what should not be done. We have come to realize  particularly well that economic isolationism in all its forms  and the breaking of economic ties with our age-old partners and  neighbors were the main causes of the state's economic decline.    I am convinced that, while preserving its sovereignty and  independence, Ukraine must, in its development, maintain good,  equal, and friendly relations with all CIS countries, and above  all, with Russia. Recognition of our national identity, our  historic traditions, and our place in the world civilization  must not lead us toward self-isolation and naive complacency.  On the contrary, under certain conditions, it can become a  reliable basis and a necessary condition for sovereign Ukraine's  friendly relations with all peoples and nations, for our further  coexistence and cooperation in an interrelated and  interdependent world. Bearing the heavy burden of building  Ukraine's statehood, we must at the same time accelerate the  reforms in our economy and the transition to market relations,  provide genuine safeguards for the proclaimed equality of  different forms of ownership, and open the doors for  enterprising, industrious, and bold people.    The monopolized economy has lately been hounded into a dead  end; we need to find a way out of it as soon as possible. That  should be done primarily by improving the health of state  policy, increasing labor motivation, and halting the decline in  production. Of course, this will take some time, something that  we, unfortunately, of which we have almost run out.    I am profoundly convinced that, without implementing a  program of wide-ranging support for entrepreneurship,  particularly that which is evolving in the sphere of production  and innovation, it will simply be impossible for us to carry out  in-depth economic reforms in the very near future. Alongside  forming various funds and centers to provide this support,  including those with the participation of foreign investors, the  government must introduce tax concessions for the  entrepreneurial structures that are performing their activities  in our state's priority spheres, such as agricultural growing  and processing, construction and development in the construction  industry, and the production of drugs and consumer goods.    A clear system of credit support, concessions in the  provision of banking services, and commercial risk insurance  should function here. I believe that the entrepreneurs working  in industries of primary importance could be given wider  opportunities in the use of facilities within the production  infrastructure owned by the state. If we fail to do this, the  development of economic reforms in Ukraine, as well as our  entire economy, will for a long time remain in a state of  decline and stagnation.    It is precisely this current situation that is well  demonstrated by the results of the national economy's work in  the five months of this year. The economy's performance, I  would say, has been supernegative. What is more, contrary to  (?pseudo-) optimistic statements being made publicly of late,  the national economy's decline and crisis are constantly on the  increase.    Out of considerations of an ethical and moral nature and for  certain personal reasons, contrary to how things are very often  done, I would not like to start analyzing the state of the  economy by criticizing the previous government and quoting  figures in order to confirm the rate of our speedy decline. I  hope they are well known to you anyway.    Everyone of us, naturally, cannot help but ask the question:  What can explain this agonizing state of our economy, and what  are the main reasons for the steady rise in the tendency of  decomposition, chaos, and disintegration that has been observed  by us in the course of the last few years? I am absolutely  certain that if we do not find the real causes of this and do  not make the right diagnosis of our economy's prolonged disease,  we shall not be able to find effective remedies for it. Nor  shall we be able to take the right path to lead us out of the  economic crisis in the shortest possible time. Anything other  than that today not only has no future, but also poses an  extreme threat to the fate of Ukraine.    Let me expound my reasons for saying this: I believe that  the main reason is a lack of political will, courage, and a  clear plan for reforming the economy, which are required and  which for a long time now have not been found in our leadership  structures; and the fact that we are constantly throwing  ourselves from one economic program to another. For a long  time, we trailed behind Gaydar's reforms and copied them, which  led eventually to the stalling and blocking of important  decisions.    I also believe that the catastrophic state of our economy  can  be explained not only by various power structures' tactical  mistakes, but also, to a considerable extent, by a disregard for  strategic macroeconomic thinking that could develop an  acceptable model of Ukraine's national economy and determine the  optimal means of moving toward curbing the crisis. Even if we  were doing something at the microeconomic level, such as handing  out credits, granting tax concessions, distributing hard  currency, providing subsidies, and so on, almost no work was  being done at the macroeconomic level.    I think that the budgetary and financial policy that has  been  pursued by our state for quite a long time now is not only  politically, socially, and organizationally ill-considered, but  also is fundamentally flawed and has effectively led to the  collapse of the financial system. Although the emergency  measures that have been taken lately to check inflationary  processes have had some positive results, I still consider them  temporary because they are based on erroneous principles and  approaches.    Inflation today has simply been driven underground, and that  has been done artificially. To a considerable degree, it is  hidden, which was achieved by causing what I think is an equally  distressing phenomenon: the artifically created absolute  insolvency of most of our enterprises and essentially the whole  of our population. The payment thrombus that has formed in our  economy's financial arteries will ruin it utterly.    Can you tell me, please, who needed the budget without a  deficit for 1994, contrived by (?the cabinet) and approved by  the previous Supreme Council? Given the present state of our  economy, it can be achieved only on paper.    By our ill-considered actions in the sphere of taxation, we  have introduced, I will say openly, a wild system for taxing all  subjects of economic management. If 22 percent of income is  today being deducted from all enterprises, or more than 55  percent of profits, then there cannot be any talk of  entrepreneurship, particularly in the sphere of production.  Such an ill-thought-out approach only causes profits to be  concealed. It became the reason for the economic suppression of  production and almost the complete suspension of Ukraine's  investment process.    The government's shortsighted policy with regard to the  so-called fixed regulated exchange rate of the dollar and the  quite liberal manipulation of the hard currency legislation have  led to the collapse of the domestic hard currency market. The  concealment of hard-currency earning abroad is taking on an even  larger dimension. According to IMF experts, hard currency  receipts worth $1.3 billion were not returned to Ukraine in  1993. That is, despite our difficulties in obtaining hard  currency, last year we continued to invest our hard currency in  production in Russia, European countries and generally anywhere  so long as it is not here. Hard currency that remains abroad  does not work for the benefit of Ukraine's economy. Life itself  forces exporters to do this, for today it is the only way to  somehow preserve the production of goods that are exported,  because due to the high taxes and wild differences in exchange  rates, Ukraine's export potential is being reduced everyday.    According to foreign experts, we lose around $100 million  every month for these reasons. I consider that the government  and the National Bank were not able to elaborate a clear  monetary and credit doctrine, did not create a market of credit  resources that was accessible to all, and took to this important  affair in an amateurish way regardless of the fact that credits  are one of the most powerful sources for the growth in the  monetary mass. To a considerable extent, it was precisely  because of this that today our karbovanets is no longer able to  fulfill its main role as a means of accumulation and of  financially guaranteeing investment and foreign economic  activity. People do not trust, so to speak, our national  currency and in conditions of crippling inflation have stopped  saving their money in savings banks. Our money does not work  for our economy. But you know that under market relations the  most important thing is that money should work.    Esteemed colleagues, analyzing the state of affairs, one  cannot help but ask oneself: Where is the way out? What is to  be done in the first instance to rectify the situation? What  are the main processes in our socioeconomic and spiritual  revival? In the economic sphere, we must, first of all, work out  a clear program of macroeconomic transformations, define their  content, their stages, their speed and order, all of which would  accord with a socially oriented model of market relations. Only  on this basis will we be able to stop the destructive tendency  toward the collapse of the country's productive forces and its  intellectual and productive potential, and to minimize the  social casualties of our reforms.    While giving the reforms a stronger impetus, the government  must ensure state regulation of the economy, especially in  strategic industries, which is being done in every  market-oriented country. For us, these key sectors are power  engineering, the coal, metal, and chemical industries. The  state sector in this case would act as one of the players in  market relations, while the state on the whole, without losing  its administrative function, would have a greater influence on  the regulation of economic processes.    But the situation that has emerged in the national economy  today requires most radical and urgent measures of direct  action, so to speak. First of all, it is necessary to launch as  soon as possible the production of domestic goods at full  capacity. This must be done using all possible stimulative  factors that will encourage the manufacturer to produce the  necessary goods that are affordable to most people. The main  task today is not to collect enormous taxes and form an  unrealistic budget, but to revive the economy as soon as  possible by relieving the tax pressure, to allow labor  collectives to work normally and allow people to receive what  they have earned.    I would like to stress for deputies and for everybody else  --  an earned salary and not one received through speculation in  hard currency. If somebody today still has some hope that this  can be done only by artificially speeding up payments between  enterprises, by granting them more cheap credits to replenish  their circulating resources, then I can assure them that these  are illusionary expectations. The process of collapse and chaos  has gone so far that a purely monetary approach can no longer  change or rectify anything. I consider that we must now act not  with traditional methods, but with those which at first glance  seem almost paradoxical. It is necessary to change the entire  philosophy and methodology of our state's financial and  budgetary system. What is meant by this?    First of all, we must reject the pillaging principle of  taxation, of collecting as much from taxpayers as possible, and  to go over to the principle of leaving them with as much of the  earned profit as possible. The policy of liberalizing taxation  is fairly simple here: The more we leave for the taxpayer today,  in the end, the more the state will receive tomorrow. I  consider that the critical level of taxation from each  enterprise should be about 15-17 percent of income -- but this  is an issue for the future. Today, we should attempt to  increase the profit part of the budget by increasing the level  of production. At the moment, this is the main way of reducing  taxation.    Second, while the state should support individual priority  sectors of industry, we should nevertheless refuse to give  subsidies to the majority of loss-making enterprises and  organizations. As of today, they amount to about 25 percent of  the total amount. We should finally understand that a  philosophy based on supporting the weak, on enterprises that are  incapable of working profitably, leads nowhere. On the  contrary, brave, hard-working, and talented workers need every  kind of support and encouragement at the state level.    Incidentally, bankruptcy, contrary to the understanding that  is widespread in Ukraine, is, first of all, a financial and not  a social concept. It does not mean that an enterprise will be  liquidated without fail. Not at all. Simply that this factory  or plant will experience a change in ownership. A new director  will arrive and will make it profitable. In my view, already  today some of these enterprises could be sold even to foreign  investors, and not necessarily for a high price, but definitely  with one firm demand: the new owner should invest as many  resources in the production process that are required to ensure  that the enterprise makes a profit and provides people with work.    Third, we need to define more clearly the priorities in  deciding the most important economic problems. Among them, most  attention should be paid to the development of the fuel and  energy complex; power engineering, including atomic energy; and  overcoming the consequences of the Chernobyl accident. The  government is obliged to develop and implement a long-term  program of providing Ukraine with resources and critical imports  -- first of all, oil and gas.    Today this problem, in my view, is usually being decided by  the enthusiasm and personal possibilities of individual  officials who, during periodic visits to Moscow after being  warned in a threatening manner, succeed in asking for another  round of credits or extract a postponement in payments and sink  deeper into debt. They have already succeeded in selling off  our national wealth. I consider that such a short-term policy  is not only degrading for our state but is also generally  extremely dangerous for our economic and state independence.  You will agree that there is no bigger theat to us today than  the $6 billion or or so that we owe mainly to Russia.    Esteemed people's deputies, I think you will agree that the  former Supreme Council paid considerable attention to the  development of the agro-industrial complex and the food  processing industry and to solving the problems in these vital  sectors. But in my opinion, these issues were separated from  each other, there was no comprehensive approach and no strategic  course was worked out toward resolving such complex issues as  price parity between industrial and agricultural products; the  form and size of the state procurement order; payment for  farmers' products supplied to the state; as well as the tax,  financial, and credit policy in the countryside.    No decision has been made as yet on land privatization. I  believe that two approaches are possible. First, and this can  be done in the near future, we can allow a 49-year lease of land  for the construction of various social facilities. That will  also be extended to foreign investors who can build hotels and  everything else needed to develop our social sector. The second  option is to make land available for lifelong use with the right  of inheritance, but only to those who have worked in the  countryside for a certain period and who have relevant  experience and education to use the land efficiently. In this  way, we will prevent speculation and the takeover of land by  various rich dealers.    Undoubtedly, our electorate expect that the new Supreme  Council will return to these problems in order to prepare  concrete laws to boost the formation of a market economy and a  viable market environment in the countryside. Flexible  legislative work should demonopolize the food processing sector.  I believe that it is due to the stalling of this process that  food prices today are not free. I am sure that a comprehensive  approach to these issues will allow us to create a reliable and  efficient market mechanism to reduce food prices. It is  extremely urgent today.    Esteemed colleagues, in the several days that our new  Supreme  Council has been in session, we have said a lot about the social  protection of the population and the numerous complex issues  that have cropped up and require immediate solutions. This is  indeed so. In my opinion, the socioeconomic situation remains  the most acute problem on which the government must focus its  attention. The main task is to stop further decline in the  people's living standards by means of resolute measures in  pricing policy, and to search for opportunities for selective  reduction of wholesale and retail prices for vital consumer  products. I believe that the entire government policy must be  based on the principle that rich citizens make a rich country.    While I stand firmly in favor of deep economic  transformations in our society, I nevertheless emphatically  disagree with those politicians who believe that before starting  on a civilized road of development, we must wade through a  swamp: economic and political degradation and drastic  impoverishment of a considerable group of people who are denied  reliable social protection, while an isolated group of slick  dealers accumulate unseen wealth. I believe you will agree that  we did not have to make people extremely poor and promise them  that maybe some day they will become rich. It is time to  realize that millions of poverty-stricken and faithless people  will not create a rich and powerful state.    We all saw that for ourselves during numerous meetings with  voters. We all remember how difficult it was to face  reproachful questions from pensioners whose pension is not  adequate to make ends meet. I do not know about you, but I was  rather ashamed to face people who are living on pitiful minimum  wages, especially educators, doctors, veterans of labor, members  of large families, invalids, and other low-income groups of the  population. Undoubtedly, all these issues require urgent  discussion in parliament and practical actions on the part of  the government to resolve them as soon as possible.    But to be frank, as a human being, I was most amazed by the  horrible state of our humanitarian sector, first of all,  science, health care, and education, especially in rural areas  and areas affected by the Chernobyl disaster. We must do our  best to improve the environmental situation in the state. I  think, with all our differences and economic troubles, we will  have no excuse if we do not break the standstill in these areas  by means of relevant legislative acts. We are obliged to regain  lost prestige in these sectors as soon as possible and give the  people hope for an improvement in the situation, because the  health of our people, their future intellectual potential, and  our priceless possession, the nation's gene pool, in every sense  depends on our ability to resolve these problems.    I am convinced that the country's government must pay more  attention to the implementation of the program for the  conversion of the military-industrial complex, problems existing  in our army, its financial provision, and social protection of  the military. You will agree that the Army's efficiency,  reputation, and the respect it commands in society depend to a  great extent on the way we manage to remove the existing  difficulties and the way we care for our servicemen. I hope  that all of us, irrespective to which political party we belong,  will act in a like-minded fashion on these issues and will make  mutual concessions to resolve them as soon as possible.    Another problem of overall state importance which has come  to the fore and requires the Supreme Council's urgent  intervention is the fight against crime, especially organized  crime, bribery, corruption, and widespread economic criminal  activity. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the criminal  web is spreading a thick layer over our entire young, fledgling  state. What are the proposed priority measures to be taken by  the government and the Supreme Council? First of all, I believe  that we need to strive for unity and consistency in the actions  of law enforcement bodies and improve our penal legislation,  which is clearly lagging behind in the crime marathon; and this  is not least through the fault of the top legislative body,  which was very slow in passing all the additions and amendments  to the laws proposed in recent years.    Finally, I believe we need to considerably reduce budget  expenditures for the state apparatus; revise the size of staff  in our ministries, departments, and state committees; and adjust  their functions to keep up with market conditions and the  demands of the present time. We must be bolder in the  transition from the sectoral to the functional management  principle; quicker in renouncing interference in every detail of  the work of enterprises, in renouncing sheer administrative  control, authoritarianism, and pressure on production units.  The structure and mechanism of executive power must fully  accord with the deep transformations taking place in the  economy, the society, and the state.    On the basis of the results of local elections which are  soon  to be held, we must work out and pass legislation on the concept  of regional economic management and build a flexible and strong  vertical structure of executive power. We must consider and  introduce strict accountability of all these structures, from  the Cabinet of Ministers to the village council. I also believe  it very important that the key posts in state administration  should be held by highly professional, competent people, with  sufficient hands-on experience in management at the relevant  level, trained for state leadership, who will take resolute and  principled actions on the basis of their rights and the laws,  will not be afraid to take bold decisions, and will be ready to  bear responsibility for the results of their activities. If I  am elected to the post of prime minister, I will be prepared to  assist the appointment to government and other leadership  positions of young and talented specialists, reformers in  spirit, with sufficient hands-on experience in the sphere of  management, and train them to be top-level leaders, irrespective  of their political views.    Esteemed people's deputies, our internal economic policy is  tied closely with our state's external economic and diplomatic  activities and the fulfilment of its obligations to the world  business community. I believe that the future government must  continue active and balanced cooperation with international  financial organizations. Ukraine's membership in the  International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the European  Bank for Reconstruction and Development will help create  favorable conditions for the implementation of our internal  economic policy and our plans to reform the economy. Apart from  this, active membership in these reputable institutions entitles  us to participate in decision-making with regard to  international financial policies and opens access to economic  information.    I would also like to support the main principles and  guidelines for the development of Ukraine's economy in the  period of crisis set out by Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz. In  conclusion, I would like to stress once again that I have  outlined here the main essential, conceptual points of the  economic program that I will pursue, defend, and implement if I  am elected prime minister. I would like to particularly stress  that it can only be fulfilled by joint efforts of both branches  of power, with your understanding, and with the Supreme  Council's support of our state's new government, which in its  work will be guided by the Cabinet of Ministers law, which is  among the first that needs to be discussed and passed.    Thank you for your attention.</p>

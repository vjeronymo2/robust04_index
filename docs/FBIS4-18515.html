			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["H.M." report: "On the Interest Swing"] </F>   [Text] There is disquiet on the international financial  markets. On Wall Street, U.S. shares have lost about 10 percent  of their value this year; in Tokyo minicrashes alternate with  spectacular gains; the interest rates on both sides of the  Atlantic are leaping virtually like goats. All this reflects  the insecurity of money managers around the globe, who are  currently reacting a bit more sensitively than is usual in this  branch.    The reason for the nervousness is the unresolved question  whether interest trends that run counter to each other can  persist in the United States and in Europe, especially in  Germany. While overseas the lively economic development is able  to bear the careful pressure on the interest brake applied by  Reserve Board chief Alan Greenspan, the German economy still  needs declining interest rates. The Bundesbank has made good  progress in the short-term sphere with that; regarding medium-  and long-term durations, however, there has been a setback.  There the yields are almost 0.75 percentage points higher than  the lowest level last year.    One thing can already be said now: There are limits to an  opening of the interest rate gap between the United States and  Germany. These limits are reached as soon as investors begin to  turn their backs on the mark and turn toward the dollar,  because, in addition to higher interest rates, they can also  expect gains from the exchange rate. In view of the enormous  need for capital to finance German unification over the next few  years, the Bundesbank cannot go it alone. In this respect, it  is very likely that not all dreams regarding interest rates will  come true in our country.</p>

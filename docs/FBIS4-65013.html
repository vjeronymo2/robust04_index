			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said it is impossible to  establish a federation when there is such a deep gulf between  the two communities. He pointed out that the deadlock in Cyprus  results from the fact that the Greek Cypriot partner, which has  a majority, is considered the legitimate government of the  entire island. The federation we want, he said, is different  from the federation the Greek Cypriots want.    Denktas was speaking at a working breakfast given by the  Bursa Industrialists and Businessmen's Association at Celik  Palace Hotel. He stressed that the Turkish Cypriots should not  pin their hopes on the world and the United Nations and expect  them to mete out justice in Cyprus. He added that the Turkish  Cypriots must defend their own rights and must develop  economically. Otherwise, he warned, the countries of the world  will continue to pursue the policy they have been pursuing for  the past 30 years, either for their own benefit or in the  interests of others.    The president explained that if Turkey helps the Turkish  Cypriots economically and shows the world that it is on their  side, not only militarily but economically as well, then their  image in the eyes of the world will change. He added: Had the  Turkish Cypriots been strengthened economically, had Turkey  created such a picture, we would not have been seen as an  occupying force. Denktas recalled that Turkey promised to  extend political guarantees to Turkish businessmen who invest in  Cyprus, but this promise has not yet been fulfilled. He urged  Turkey to extend this guarantee so that businessmen will invest  in Cyprus.    Commenting on the proposal that the Cyprus problem be solved  through a federation, the president said: The Turkish Cypriots  want a federation in which they will not have to return the  rights they have gained, a federation based on equal rights,  while the Greek Cypriots want a federation that will establish  Greek Cypriot sovereignty on the island. Denktas stressed that  even UN officials who are familiar with the Cyprus problem admit  that the Greek Cypriots want to extend their power to the  Turkish Cypriot side.</p>

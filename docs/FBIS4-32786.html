			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 28 May (PL) -- Cali and Santa Clara,  important cities in Colombia and Cuba, signed a protocol to make  them sister cities as a contribution to the intensification of  the bilateral cooperation that is taking place between both  countries.    The information was revealed today during a modest ceremony  to bid farewell to the Cuban delegation that will leave for  Colombia tomorrow to implement the agreement to link the capital  of Valle del Cauca Department and the city located in the  central part of the island.    The Cubans will also participate in the sessions of the  world  meeting of mayors of healthy cities convened by Colombia, which  will be attended by some 100 mayors from various countries of  the world between 1 and 4 June.    The purpose of the meeting will be to exchange experiences  regarding primary health care. The invitation sent to Cuba is  based on the progress attained by the country in that field.    The Cuban delegation includes Humberto Rodriguez Gonzalez,  president of the People's Government (mayor) of Santa Clara, and  Jose Luis Garcia, rector of the Central University of Las  Villas, both deputies and members of the Central Committee of  the Cuban Communist Party (PCC). Another member of the  delegation traveling to Cali is Marcelino Rodriguez Tejeda,  director of the important mechanical industry plant in Santa  Clara and also a member of the PCC Central Committee.    Colombian ambassador to Cuba, Ricardo Santamaria, who was  present at the ceremony, said the movement to twin the cities of  both countries will contribute to the intensification of  bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, economy, and  culture.    Santamaria said one of the fundamental objectives is the  mutual learning of the productive, cultural, and social  activities of both cities. He added that, later on, a Cali  delegation will visit Santa Clara, which will facilitate the  identification of areas of cooperation.    Through this symbolism of city twinning, there are great  efforts made to strengthen bilateral relations because the  future visits of Cali officials to Cuba will include a  delegation of businessmen interested in specific projects.    The diplomat also talked about the important increase in the  balance of trade between the two countries during the last four  months as recognized in the latest report by the Colombian  foreign trade authorities. He also recognized the work done by  Jesus Martinez Beato, the Cuban ambassador in Santa Fe de Bogota.    Moreover, Rodriguez Gonzalez said this direct exchange will  facilitate the strengthening of the Latin American integration  movement. He mentioned the bilateral cooperation possibilities  to which the industrial potential that exists in Santa Clara can  also contribute.    University rector Garcia Cuevas talked about the recognized  level of the institutions of higher learning in Valle del Cauca  Department and predicted the achievement of a higher qualitative  level in the exchanges that have already taken place with El  Valle University and other institutions.    The movement to twin the cities of Cuba and Colombia began  with the twinning of Santiago de Cuba and Cartagena. It will  continue with the one between Cali and Santa Clara, and there  are plans to continue with the twinning of Barranquilla and  Matanzas.    Likewise there is an interest in twinning Cienfuegos and  Medellin, Varadero and Santa Marta, the island of San Andres  with the western Isle of Youth in Cuba.</p>

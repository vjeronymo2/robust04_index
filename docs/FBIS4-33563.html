			<p>BFN     [Text] DIDE [Information and Press Department of the Army]  spokewoman Berta Edith Vargas has said, that according to the  defense minister, gunrunning into Guatemala is a serious and  complex problem the Army intends to solve.    She has said that, despite the special efforts of several  government institutions, the Army must deal with the extensive  border across which arms and all types of goods are smuggled in;  for this reason, it is impossible to have complete control,  although civilian and military authorities do everything  possible.    Asked as to whether this problem could lead to a crisis at a  time when the URNG [National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity] is  disarmed and disbanded, she has said the Army could not predict  whether this situation would occur. She has recalled, however,  that El Salvador experienced a great deal of problems once  peace was signed due to the large number of arms that had  remained in the country.    She has said these problems are not expected to appear in  Guatemala, because a large number of arms have been seized in  Puebla, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Guatemala City. We know,  however, that they possess a considerable number of arms and  that they even sell arms illegally to the people to make a  profit. As to whether these arms will end up directly in the  hands of common criminals, she said the rebels have many of them  and do with them whatever they pleas. She again recalled the  Salvadoran case, where this did indeed occur.    Vargas has said the Army, once peace is signed, expects more  moves of common sense from the rebels regarding arms, thus  showing their willingness to live in peace by taking those arms  out of the Guatemalan market.    She has said the government's Peace Commission, where the  Army is represented, deals with aspects related to arms control,  an issue which, in addition to a military advisory role, will  surely be included on an agenda.</p>

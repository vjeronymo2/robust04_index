			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (22): Challenges ahead - Hong Kong/Taiwan AS 1993 draws to a close, China faces mounting challenges in its attempt to regain sovereignty over Hong Kong and Taiwan. Its negotiations with Britain about Hong Kong's political development have gone badly, raising the possibility that the much sought after 'smooth transition' in 1997 from British to Chinese rule will be unattainable. Across the straits on Taiwan, the island's political social development is leading it further away from reunification with the mainland, in spite of growing economic relations which are pulling the two economies closer together. One of first tasks Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, set himself on his return to power in late 1978 was to deal with these two problems which were left unresolved by the communists' assumption of power in 1949. China's revolution was strongly nationalistic in character. The British and Portuguese colonies of Hong Kong and Macao were symbols of past humiliations by foreign powers. Their existence for most of the post-war period was tolerated because of the access they afforded China to the outside world in the aftermath of its enforced isolation following the Korean War. Taiwan was a different matter. It housed the remnants of the Kuomingang (KMT, Nationalist) government which the communists had defeated in a civil war which raged in earnest from 1945 until 1949. Both issues, however, came together under the rubric of 'uniting the motherland.' Mr Deng's solution to these two different problems, 'one country, two systems,' was propounded in 1979 and first applied to Hong Kong (and later Macao). Today, Chinese government officials in charge of Hong Kong and Taiwanese affairs face very different problems, problems which reflect the relative strength in both areas. Those in charge of Hong Kong evince confidence in their ability to manage the colony in the absence of agreement on Hong Kong's political development. They draw comfort from the enmeshing of Hong Kong's economy with China's and from the colony's aversion to confrontation with Beijing. CHINA has said that if Hong Kong's political development proceeds without its consent then, come 1997, it will hold fresh elections for the 60-strong Legislative Council, the colony's law-making body. It has also threatened British economic interests in Hong Kong and on the mainland while at the same time promising to safeguard Hong Kong and Chinese economic interests. In July, China set up a 'preparatory working committee' consisting of mainland officials and a selection of Hong Kong plutocrats. Its role is to provide detailed advice to a 'preparatory committee' - which comes into being in 1996 - on all aspects of Hong Kong's political, social and economic life. Mr Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council (or cabinet), says: 'If there is no agreement, which we do not want to see, Hong Kong will still go on and continue to be prosperous and an international financial centre . . . Hong Kong will not collapse.' For officials in charge of Taiwan the situation is radically different. In spite of this year's thaw in relations, which saw an historic meeting of mainland and Taiwanese officials in Singapore in April, Beijing officials admit that Taiwan holds the cards in dictating the pace of contacts and eventual unification. Mr Zhang Ming Qing, a senior official at the Office of Taiwan Affairs in the State Council, says: 'I should not say that we have acquiesced in slowing down the talks (about reunification), but there is nothing we can do. It largely depends on them (the Taiwanese government) whether they want to sit down and talk.' Regional trade issues: the presence in Seattle of Mr Jiang Zemin, China's president, for this week's meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum is of more than just symbolic importance. It underlines China's growing role as a political and economic superpower in the region. In terms of regional trade politics China is keen to cloak itself in the banner of free trade and will resist turning Apec into an Asian version of the European Community. Mr Wu Jianmin, spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, says: 'We see Apec as an open trade bloc, rather than a closed one. We are not in favour of an exclusive, formalised trade bloc but one open to all.' A little over a decade ago China's trade with the members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) was Dollars 800m; today it stands at more than Dollars 8bn. The combination of China's open door policy and the enthusiasm of the estimated 40m overseas Chinese - most of whom live in the region - for mainland investments will help underwrite further rapid expansion of regional trade in the coming years. China has sought strenuously to build relations with other Asian countries in recent years.</p>

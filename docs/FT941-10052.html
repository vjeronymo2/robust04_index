			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Cost of training turns Wayne's world on its head Wayne Law spent years as a builder but always wanted to be a hairdresser. Last year he decided to stop waiting - so wound up his business and sold his home. That, he decided, was the quickest way to gain a qualification. Joining a government-financed training course would have meant waiting six months. If he had accepted unemployment benefit he would have have been barred from a full-time course because the unemployed are expected to be available for work. By selling his home and moving to rented accommodation Mr Law was able to finance the Pounds 4,700 cost of a nine-month course at a private training centre in London. 'I wanted to take control of my own life,' said 34-year-old Mr Law. 'I am not the sort of person to take unemployment benefit and just sit back.' He is one of a growing number of people prepared to take drastic action to secure qualifications. Keith Bulmer is still employed as a painter and decorator, but spends most of his time off in college. Every Thursday he joins a small huddle of students swapping notes at Newham Community College in east London. They are the people who might have missed the previous week's session or were only able to reach the day-long course after completing shift work. Several of the course's participants are working full-time like Mr Bulmer and paying for their training in their own time - because their employers have declined to pay, in spite of doing so in the past. Mr Bulmer and his three friends on the course all work for Newham council. Their employer paid for two years part-time study for the Ordinary National Certificate (ONC) in building studies, but declined last September to fund the higher qualification. 'The council did not give us a reason for not giving us time off,' said Mr Bulmer, 28. 'I guess they cannot afford it or else they fear we will try and get new jobs when we have better skills.' Local authorities are among many employers who have cut back on part-time further education courses. The Association of Metropolitan Authorities said: 'There has been a significant cut-back in training and development budgets in local authorities - particularly metropolitan authorities who have had to make big cuts in their budgets. Priorities are having to be set.' For those unable to finance themselves the government provides Career Development Loans. Established in 1988, the scheme, backed by three banks, provides interest-free loans of up to Pounds 5,000, which will increase to a maximum of Pounds 8,000 next year. The loan is interest free for the period of training and one subsequent month. This is to be raised shortly to six months. In 1992-93, 10,000 people took up the loans. 12,500 are forecast to do so in 1993-94 and 20,000 the following year.</p>

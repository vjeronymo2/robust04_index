			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: GEI Intl still falls short on last time GEI International achieved progress in the second half, but not enough to match the previous year's result. The pre-tax outcome for the year to March 31 came to Pounds 3.12m, compared with Pounds 5.57m, on sales little changed at Pounds 77.94m. As in the first half, when profits came to only Pounds 511,000, the special steels activities were hit by the UK recession. Steels suffered a loss of Pounds 0.98m for the year, compared with profits of Pounds 1.3m previously. Packaging machinery and processing machinery lifted their contributions to Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.84m) and Pounds 1.58m (Pounds 1.56m) respectively. Net interest paid rose to Pounds 774,000 (Pounds 123,000). Earnings declined to 6.7p (9.7p). The final dividend of 4.85p makes an unchanged 7.32p total.</p>

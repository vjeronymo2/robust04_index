			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Europe must lower rates, says OECD Continental European countries must take every opportunity to lower interest rates in order to boost their economies and combat unemployment, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development urged yesterday. Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the head of the OECD's economics and statistics department, told a press conference that insufficient growth had been fuelling a continuing rise in unemployment in Europe that is expected to result in 22m Europeans, or 11.5 per cent of the region's labour force, being unemployed next year. He acknowledged that Germany had lowered interest rates steadily since September 1992, and that other members of the European exchange rate mechanism had also been able to lower rates. 'Nevertheless short-term interest rates in these countries are high relative to inflation,' said Mr Shigehara. 'Prospects for a decline in German inflation appear favourable and any room for easing monetary conditions further without undermining the credibility of policy should be used fully.' The OECD's latest half-yearly economic outlook, published yesterday, forecasts divergent business conditions in leading industrialised countries next year. While the US, Canada and Britain are recovering from recession and expected to experience faster growth, the OECD believes Japan's economy is still very weak and that a slow recovery there is only likely to begin in the first quarter of next year. The OECD expects that Germany's economy will contract at an annual rate of 0.6 per cent in the first half of next year as weak exports hold down output, but will recover to show real growth of about 0.8 per cent next year.

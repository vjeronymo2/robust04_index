			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / US 'abusing Mexican migrants' US immigration authorities routinely beat and abuse undocumented Mexican migrants and occasionally shoot, torture and sexually abuse them, claims Americas Watch, the human rights organisation, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. When complaints are filed, the US government is as 'defensive and unyielding' as countries with poor human rights records, the group says. Its report documents the case of one officer who, during a six to seven-year period was involved in theft, two 'vehicle incidents,' one of which resulted in the death of a migrant, two serious assaults on farm workers, and the violent homicide of a Mexican minor. The agent still works for border control.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Lloyds Bank turns to US to stall rival bid for Midland LLOYDS Bank is making a last ditch attempt to delay Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's bid for Midland Bank by lodging a formal objection with the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, to Hongkong Bank's proposal to have the Fed's review of the bid put on a 'fast track'. Meanwhile, it also emerged yesterday that Midland's legal advisers will consider today whether Midland's board would fail in its duty to its shareholders if the board formally recommends the Hongkong bid. This follows Friday's decision by Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade, to refer Lloyds' proposed offer for Midland to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr Brian Pearse, Midland chief executive, said the board would like to make such a recommendation. If it were to do so, Hongkong Bank could probably count on receiving acceptances to its bid from at least 25 per cent of Midland's shareholders which would improve its chances of winning the bid contest. Although Lloyds is proposing to offer considerably more than Hongkong Bank to buy Midland, many Midland shareholders may accept Hongkong Bank's terms because of uncertainty over whether the MMC will permit a formal offer from Lloyds. Lloyds is therefore keen to prevent Hongkong Bank buying Midland shares until the MMC makes a decision on Lloyds's bid proposal in three months. It believes the Federal Reserve may be able to delay the Hongkong takeover attempt for this period. Fed approval is necessary for Hongkong Bank to acquire Midland's US assets. Hongkong Bank had hoped the Fed would give preliminary approval immediately, subject to the small risk that Hongkong Bank would later be forced to dispose of Midland's US assets after a detailed Fed review had been completed. However, Lloyds, in a document lodged with the Fed last week, is asking the Fed not to give such 'fast track' approval but to carry out a detailed investigation. If the Fed agrees, that could prevent Hongkong Bank buying Midland shares until the review is completed. In the document, Lloyds is understood to question Hongkong Bank's record in managing its main US business, Marine Midland.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  DEPUTY SHERIFF SUES AGAIN OVER SEX BIAS  </P> <P> Sgt. Susan Lynn Perez, who won a 1980 suit against the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department for discriminating against female deputies seeking  promotion to sergeant, sued the department again Thursday -- this time  contending that not enough women become lieutenants.  </P> <P> Perez, 42, of Whittier, filed her new $10-million class-action suit in U.S.  District Court on behalf of herself and all other female uniformed sheriff's  officers who want to be promoted to the rank. Perez alleged that discriminatory  examinations prevent all but a few women from reaching that level.  </P> <P> Although Perez was promoted to sergeant in 1980, she pressed her initial  lawsuit and two years ago persuaded U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi to  agree that she should have been promoted after first taking the sergeant's test  in 1975. He awarded her $106,000 in punitive damages as well as back pay plus  interest.  </P> <P> Takasugi subsequently ordered the Sheriff's Department not to promote any more  deputies to sergeant until it instituted more equitable promotion procedures.  </P></p>

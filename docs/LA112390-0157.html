			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KREMLIN SEEKS SOVIET STABILITY AMID 'CRISIS'  </P> <P> The national legislature today asked its chairman to begin talks with the 15  Soviet republics to reach temporary agreements to prevent the further breakup  of the country and stabilize the economy.  </P> <P> Acting on a package of proposals, the lawmakers also endorsed for a second time  within a week President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposed restructuring of the  government.  </P> <P> It called on the Soviet leader to act quickly to improve food supplies.  </P> <P> The lawmakers asked Gorbachev to act within two weeks to assure that there will  be enough food this winter.  </P> <P> The resolution contained a gloomy assessment of the nation's economic and  political affairs. "The situation in the country continues to worsen and is  approaching a crisis condition," it said.  </P> <P> Another resolution passed recommended that Gorbachev take all steps "authorized  by law, up to extraordinary measures" in cases where there is a threat to human  life, health or property.  </P> <P> That measure removed a requirement for the president to consult with leaders of  the republics before taking such measures and gave the KGB responsibility for  dealing with what it called "economic sabotage."  </P> <P> In a 10-minute speech, Gorbachev told the 542-member legislature that "every  day is precious" and urged them to move swiftly toward a new union treaty to  replace a 1924 accord uniting the republics.  </P></p>

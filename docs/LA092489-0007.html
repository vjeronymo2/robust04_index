			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> After sitting down for a relaxing two hours of Sunday-night television, I was  once again reminded of the horrendous quality of new shows. On Aug. 27, I  reluctantly watched the new TV movie "L.A. Takedown" on NBC. I found it not  only an insult to the entertainment industry, but to myself as a viewer as  well. The movie opened with a steamy sex scene that I found completely  unnecessary to the entire story, except maybe to capture the attention of a  shallow audience. The majority of the two hours was spent covering numerous  shootings: good guys, bad guys, innocent bystanders. As a matter of fact, the  only thing I found vaguely impressive about the movie were the seemingly  endless rounds of ammunition shot all over the open city streets. By the time  the movie finally ended, there were no arrests for our heroes, the police, to  make -- all of the criminals had been killed. What a lasting impression to  make: The best way to solve a problem is simply to kill it.  </P> <P> Lynn A. Bagge, Westchester  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As for the types of products that have been involved in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric iron poisonings, none of the 37 pediatric fatalities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was reported to be associated with a multivitamin/mineral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplement product. All of the products reported to be involved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in these fatalities were either single or double nutrient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products that were provided for use as prenatal supplements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Single or double nutrient iron-containing products generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for the potency of the products involved, all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric fatalities were reported to be associated with iron-containing products at potencies of 40 mg iron or more per dosage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit. FDA is not aware of any pediatric iron poisoning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fatalities associated with iron-containing products whose potency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was less than 40 mg iron per dosage unit. Moreover, only 1 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 37 pediatric fatalities was reported to be associated with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron-containing product that contained less than 60 mg iron per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dosage unit. Thus, FDA observed that requiring unit-dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging of products that contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit will provide about a two-fold margin of safety from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potency of products that have usually been associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric fatalities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information available to the agency shows that products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit are primarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sold to women of childbearing age for prenatal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use. Prenatal iron-containing products may be obtained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as dietary supplements or prescription drug products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA notes that all of the iron-containing products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the 37 pediatric poisoning fatalities were apparently obtained as prenatal drugs or supplements. FDA finds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that prenatal iron-containing drugs and supplements present the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greatest potential for pediatric iron poisonings and fatalities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of their iron content, and because they are likely to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available in households with young children. Prenatal iron-containing products are likely to be in households with young  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children either because they remain in the household after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> childbirth, or because young children are present in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household during pregnancy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, FDA notes that both the AG and NDMA citizen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitions recommended 30 mg iron per dosage unit as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate level to establish additional safeguards to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the incidence of pediatric iron poisonings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, FDA is proposing unit-dose packaging for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dietary supplements and drugs containing 30 mg or more iron per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dosage unit. FDA tentatively concludes that unit-dose packaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will reduce the incidence of pediatric poisonings by providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the additional safeguards necessary to limit pediatric access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a potentially fatal amount of iron.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Practical effect.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, CPSC's child-resistant packaging regulations require that any iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drug or dietary supplement packaged in a container with 250 mg or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more iron must be packaged in accordance with their child-resistant packaging regulations (16 CFR 1700.14(a)(12) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)(13)). Therefore, FDA anticipates that manufacturers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributors of drugs and dietary supplements containing 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit, and containing 250 mg or more total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron per package, under this proposed action and CPSC's current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations (16 CFR 1700.14(a)(12) and (a)(13)), a manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or packer will have the option of packaging the product in child-resistant unit-dose packaging (e.g., child-resistant blisters,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child-resistant pouches), or of exercising its right to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption to CPSC's special packaging requirements to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> access by elderly or handicapped persons. However, under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule, in the latter case, the products will have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaged in conventional unit-dose packaging and will be subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to CPSC's requirements for exempt packaged products (16 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1700.5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA tentatively concludes that, regardless of which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging option a manufacturer or packer uses, unit-dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging of all iron-containing drugs and supplements that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain 30 mg or more per dosage unit will ensure the safe use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such products by limiting unintended access to such products by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> young children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Job openings and overtime drop sharply JOB openings fell sharply in Japan last month, while overtime in the manufacturing industry contracted by a year-on-year 15.7 per cent, suggesting a continued economic slowing in spite of official suggestions that the downturn has ended, writes Robert Thomson. The labour ministry said the ratio of job offers to applicants fell from 0.81 in May to 0.74, although the official jobless figure, slow to reflect changes in the labour market, was unchanged from a month earlier at 2.5 per cent. New job offers fell in all sectors, apart from construction, which has received most of the benefits of two government spending packages over the past year. Offers in the manufacturing sector fell 26.3 per cent from a year earlier and in the service sector by 15.4 per cent. Meanwhile, the 15.7 per cent fall in manufacturing industry overtime followed a 14 per cent decrease in May. For all industries, average overtime contracted 10.8 per cent in June. The weakness in the job market is an indication of the decline in economic activity, and a sign that the seven-party coalition expected to form a government next week will face immediate challenges in economic policy. Consumer prices in Tokyo this month rose 0.4 per cent from June and were 1.7 per cent higher than a year earlier, due to an increase in vegetable prices blamed on an unsusually long rainy season, the management and co-ordination agency said yesterday. Apart from vegetables, there was a 0.5 per cent increase in housing expenses, reflecting the higher rents in desirable residential areas. Clothing and footwear prices fell 2.5 per cent, apparently because of an increase in cheaper products imported from China. Construction orders received by leading contractors fell 17.1 per cent in June, compared with a year earlier, with private sector orders down 24.7 per cent and those from manufacturers down 50 per cent.</p>

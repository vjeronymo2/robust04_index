			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> WARFARIN EASES RISK OF STROKES  </P> <P> Low doses of blood-thinning drugs are highly effective in reducing the risk of  strokes caused by abnormal heartbeats, a study confirms. Such strokes afflict  75,000 Americans annually.  </P> <P> In March, a major study found that a single daily aspirin tablet dramatically  reduced strokes triggered by atrial fibrillation, abnormally rapid beating of  the heart's upper chambers.  </P> <P> A new report, published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine, found  that the drug warfarin also worked well in people with this condition.  </P> <P> Both aspirin and warfarin interfere with the body's tendency to form blood  clots. The heart's rapidly beating chambers can produce these clots, which may  travel to the brain and clog up blood vessels, causing strokes.  </P> <P> Warfarin, the active ingredient found in some brands of rat poison, is  routinely used to prevent strokes in people with severe atrial fibrillation  caused by damaged heart valves. However, doctors have been reluctant to use  this medicine in people with milder cases because of the chance it could cause  serious bleeding.  </P> <P> The new study found that the bleeding risk is slight when the drug is carefully  controlled by physicians.  </P></p>

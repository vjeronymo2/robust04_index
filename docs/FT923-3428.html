			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Japanese economy heads firmly for the doldrums THE Bank of Japan yesterday moved quickly to dampen expectations of a cut in interest rates after the central bank's quarterly survey showed a severe deterioration in business conditions. A bank official said the Tankan, or short term economic survey, was in line with central bank expectations and would not prompt a review of monetary policy. The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which was sharply down for most of the day, fell further following publication of the report. The Nikkei average finished the day down 800.78 points at 18,107.69. The survey painted the picture of a deeply depressed economy with few signs of an immediate turnaround. The closely-watched index of business conditions in manufacturing fell from  24 in May to -37 last month. Just as important, the index for non-manufacturing plunged from 1 to -13, reflecting sharp deterioration in construction, retailing and other services. The survey was conducted after the central bank cut interest rates by half a point to 3.25 per cent in late July, but before a Y10,700bn (Pounds 44bn) emergency economic programme was announced on August 28. Excess stock levels continued to build during the quarter, with the index of inventories rising from 32 to 38. The rise points to a further steep decline in industrial output in the months ahead as companies try to reduce stocks of unsold goods at a time when consumer spending is cooling rapidly. A central bank official said that company efforts to reduce stocks would be completed by the end of the year, although the bank has been consistently over-optimistic this year about the pace of inventory adjustment. Pre-tax profits are expected to be down by 12 per cent in the current fiscal year for manufacturing companies, and 8.5 per cent for non-manufacturers. Manufacturers are expecting a 30.2 per cent decline in the first half of the year, followed by a 10.4 per cent rise in the second half. The central bank said the rise was predicated on a recovery of the economy expected to begin in the new year. Large enterprises revised capital spending plans downward by 0.6 percentage points during the quarter, with planned spending down by 2.8 per cent this fiscal year compared to last year. Manufacturing investment is expected to be down by 10.4 per cent, while non-manufacturing investment, excluding public utilities will be flat. This will be compensated for partly by a planned 7.8 per cent rise in public utility investment. Ratios of financial liquidity declined, although the central bank said these were still high by historic standards. Small enterprises planned to slash capital spending by 22.5 per cent this year, although the size of the decline is expected to be more moderate as companies finalise plans.</p>

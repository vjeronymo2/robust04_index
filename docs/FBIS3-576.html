			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sayyid Ahmad Khalifah: "Ali Mahdi: Aidid Is a </F> Figure One Should Have Dealings With"]    [Text] Jeddah -- Interim Somali President Ali Mahdi Mohamed  has stated that Somali National Alliance [SNA] Leader General  Mohamed Farah Aidid is one of the figures in Somalia and that  duty dictates that he should be involved in the efforts to solve  the country's problems. He accused Aidid of trying to impose  his leadership on others and of rejecting consensus. In an  interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, he said, however, that Aidid's  insistence on his current obstructive position did not mean that  we would stop at this point. In Mogadishu yesterday there was a  heavy exchange of fire near the airport where the Egyptian  contingent of the UN forces is deployed. The last U.S. unit  scheduled to leave Somalia boarded a ship yesterday on its way  back to the United States.    In a telephone interview from Cairo, Ali Mahdi, who is also  the leader of 12 Somali factions, said in reply to a question:  We do not know the reasons for Gen. Aidid's absence. What we  have heard is not convincing. The Cairo meeting's achievement  was that it confirmed the importance of setting up the country's  constitutional insitutions and it confirmed the unity of the 12  allied factions and enabled us to explain our views to the  Egyptian Government and leadership and to the Arab League.    [Khalifah] What is the next step regarding Gen. Aidid and  contacting him? Should we give up hope of dialogue with him?    [Mahdi] We have decided to send two delegations, one of them  to northern Somalia to meet with our brothers there and to talk  to them about a comprehensive national solution to Somalia's  problem and about rejection of obstructionist methods, division,  and secession, and the second to Mogadishu to meet and hold a  dialogue with Gen. Aidid on ways of implementing the resolutions  of the Addis Ababa conferences and the current Cairo conference.  We regard Gen. Aidid as one of the figures in Somalia and it is  our duty to have dealings with him to solve the country's  problems but that does not mean that his insistence on his  current obstructive position would stop us at the point we are  now.    [Khalifah] What has been decided regarding authority in the  country?    [Mahdi] We have decided to form a government and have a  parliament and a leadership within two months from now in  accordance with the Addis Ababa resolutions. We also decided to  hold general elections in March next year and we would, of  course, be happy if Gen. Aidid and his colleagues participated  in these constitutional developments which are the only option  open to the Somalis.    [Khalifah] What role will the United Nations play in these  future constitutional developments?    [Mahdi] We believe that the United Nations should stay to  supervise all these processes and we will submit an official  request for that to the secretary general and the big powers.    [Khalifah] Is there any interest or any positive point in  shuffling the cards and mixing the problem of the secessionist  north with the problem of the infighting south?    [Mahdi] Somalia is one country and it was the consequences  of the war which led to what happened in the north. We believe  that the solution is the same for both and we must hold  consultations with the northerners to resolve Somali issues and  move on to the stage of rebuilding the state's various  institutions which have all collapsed because of the fighting  here and there.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Private View: Why Labour's loyal baron is in revolt JOHN Edmonds is a trade union baron who counts himself a moderniser. But this week the general secretary of the GMB was beginning to look like the biggest obstacle to the modernisation of the Labour Party. The word 'modernisation' begs the question. Yet Edmonds is in a curious position. After a year-long review of the trade unions' role in the party, he finds himself at odds with John Smith, the Labour leader (and a GMB-sponsored MP). For the head of a moderate union which has traditionally provided block-vote ballast for pragmatic party leadership, he is taking an unusually aggressive, unnaturally left-wing, line. His deputy, Tom Burlison, is party treasurer and a member of the constitutional review committee which on Wednesday gave tacit assent to a plan for reform. The same day Edmonds was harangued by Labour MPs for his intransigence. The reforms go before the party's national executive on Monday and to the party conference in the autumn. The GMB is happy to see affiliated unions' monolithic voting power at party conferences reduced. It is happy to see their vote exercised in a way that more distinctly reflects the wishes of individual members who have paid the union's political levy to support Labour. It will not, however, accept the abolition of the block vote in local selection of parliamentary candidates, on the grounds that would disenfranchise levy-payers. So much for the arithmetic. But wasn't this dispute really about something much deeper? I asked Edmonds. 'Many people suspect it's about a much bigger issue. The reason why there's been such a strong reaction against the proposals from constitituency parties is the suspicion that the gurus, the party strategists, are trying to distance the party from the trade unions.' The unwritten script of the modernisers says Labour's affiiliated unions are an electoral liability and the party must disengage. 'There is just no evidence for that,' he said. 'According to recent polls, unions are more popular than they have been for a generation. And the idea of blaming them for the last election defeat is bizarre. We kept so far out of the limelight during the last election that the Scarlet Pimpernel would have been proud of us.' But if you aren't a liability, why do you keep a low profile? 'Because we are asked to do so by that element, the spin-doctors if you like, who think we're an electoral liability.' Then why did you give in to the spin-doctors? 'Because we were prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt. It was a wrong decision, actually.' Edmonds maintains that the union bogey is no longer even good propaganda for the Conservatives. Their attempts to scare the voters had failed last time, he said, and people were increasingly worried about job security and rights at work. It was the modernisers who were out of date, not the GMB. As trade union leaders have always done, Edmonds blamed the media for what he called their obsessive interest in the constitutional dispute. Perhaps that is because a lot of people think it is time, after four election defeats, for the unions and Labour to divorce - that they would live more happily in separate houses. 'I don't think that's an important political issue in Britain. Where would you rank that on the scale alongside unemployment, the security of pensions, law and order? Number 150?' So why did John Smith raise the issue of the relationship? 'Because he was encouraged to believe that the constituency party members were strong for a particular sort of reform, and he was wrongly advised. Maybe also he believed this was not as important for the trade unions as it actually is.' But if at election time you can't come out and declare yourselves, wouldn't you be better off unconstrained by this constitutional connection? 'Well, that's one avenue we can go down. The avenue I want us to go down is to be much less apologetic about our policies, about our political position, to be much more forthright about the economy, employment issues. The way people are treated in this country is terrible compared with our European neighbours.' The irony is that in 1989 Edmonds'union proposed just the kind of whittling away of the block vote that is being discussed. He said: 'What we would like to do is scale down our power in the party and therefore free ourselves to express our own, trade union views, without perhaps so much political pressure.' But if you can have influence without a dominant position, can't you have influence with no constitutional position at all? 'We could opt for what I would call a pork-barrel relationship, which is what the American unions have with the Democrats - or with Republicans in the case of the Teamsters. We don't want a relationship where you are sort of buying a policy off the candidates you support. We want to be part of a political tradition: that's our history, that's the instinct of our people.' The union has looked at party-union ties in Sweden, Denmark and Germany as well as the US. 'What we found is that in many of these countries where there is allegedly a divorce, the relationships are in practice, at the personal level, rather closer. But you still have to grapple with the same problems.' Edmonds would not concede that lower union membership and the decline of big manufacturing enterprises made the connection an anachronism. There were areas of unorganised labour but also members in new areas of employment. A constitutional relationship might not be essential, he admitted, yet he defended it, saying that without it unions could not restore their 'legal normality' nor ensure that UK workers enjoyed the same rights as others. His vehemence on the subject of MP selection may have led the GMB general secretary into a tactical trap. If the unions and constituencies defeat the reform in the autumn - as Edmonds is confident they will - John Smith will appear the powerless prisoner of reactionary trade union barons. The reform package would look like mere tinkering. Yet this is the opposite of what Edmonds says he wants. 'We have been arguing for a whole series of changes to modernise policymaking - not just to diminish, but diminish very markedly the power of union executives and the so-called power of union general secretaries. So it is individual trade union members who are moving forward into a proper place in the Labour party and it is people like me who should be moving back.' Some see in Edmonds' stance a deeper game. His union of 800,000-plus members is discussing a merger with the 1m-plus Transport and General Workers Union. If successful, it would create one of the biggest unions in the western world. Edmonds' defence of the democratic rights of the humble levy-payer could be designed to appeal to the more left-wing TGWU executive whose boss he undoubtedly would like to become. When I asked if reform had been stymied by the merger prospect, he said: 'I wouldn't accept that at all.' Edmonds is undoubtedly a strategist, an articulate union boss with the rare distinction of an Oxford University degree but with a manner which  - not just due to his height and girth - some of his peers find condescending. I suggested he was afraid he would become a much smaller figure in the political landscape if the Labour link were broken He flushed. 'That's nonsense. If that was the only matter of concern it would take us only five minutes.' But you are a trade union baron, I said. 'The picture has no reality. Everything I have said to you is about how to increase opportunities for trade union members to play their part . . . You are using the sort of stereotype that the Daily Mail and Daily Express are keen to promote. I reflect, as far as I am able, the views of GMB members and they want to be involved in the Labour Party.' He launched into another denunciation of the press for being interested, not in the constitutional issue but in the row surrounding it. Perhaps, I said, that is because politicians and trade union leaders - politicians of another sort - are themselves more interested in these debates than in the humdrum business of working life. 'That's not right. Anyone reading the papers over the last few months would assume I do nothing else but get involved in the Labour Party. Even during this period under 10 per cent of my time is spent on party affairs. Everything I have been saying about the reform programme is intended to make John Edmonds politically less important - and that's the way it should be.' Is there a danger that this will become another of those issues to damage Labour's reputation with the voters? 'There is an enormous danger that if it continues for any length of time it will be very damaging to the party, inside the party and with the public. It beams out the impression that the party is divided - and divided on an issue which the general public don't feel very strongly about at all.' I suggested the contest would inevitably be seen as one between modernisers and trade union barons clinging to constitutional power. 'That perception is entirely incorrect.' That is how it will come across. 'Not if you do your job properly,' he said.</p>

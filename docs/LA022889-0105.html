			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SENATOR FIRST IN GOP FRAY;  </P> <P> SEYMOUR RUNNING FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR  </P> <P> State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) announced Monday that he has begun a  campaign for lieutenant governor and hopes to raise $250,000 by July 1 to  establish himself as a credible statewide candidate.  </P> <P> Seymour said he has filed papers with the California secretary of state's  office to establish an "exploratory committee" for his campaign, which he said  will probably fizzle if he cannot meet his fund-raising goal by the middle of  the year.  </P> <P> The former mayor of Anaheim said he sees the chance for a  "senior-partner/junior-partner" relationship with Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.),  who intends to run for governor in 1990.  </P> <P> Seymour, who was chairman of Wilson's reelection campaign steering committee in  1988, said he believes that Wilson would grant him more authority as lieutenant  governor than past chief executives have allotted to their seconds in command.  </P> <P> "There's going to be a unique opportunity should Pete Wilson become governor,"  Seymour said. "We're somewhat philosophical soul mates. I could be a lieutenant  governor who takes on specific issues and handles them for the governor."  </P> <P> Seymour is the first candidate to enter the race for the GOP nomination for  lieutenant governor. Sens. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) and Marian  Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding have  also expressed interest in the job.  </P> <P> Bergeson said Seymour's decision "doesn't have any impact" on her plans. She  said she is not worried by Seymour's pledge to raise $250,000 by July 1.  </P> <P> "It's a little early to be involved in a statewide race," she said. "I feel  like I have an obligation to my legislative responsibilities. The potential for  fund raising is available when and if I decide I want to go."  </P> <P> Campbell, the unsuccessful Republican nominee for state controller in 1986,  also downplayed the importance of Seymour's early start.  </P> <P> "We're so far away from the election that the only people interested right now  are the political groupies," he said. "I've run for statewide office before. I  spent $2.5 million on name identification. I have better name-ID than anyone  talking about running."  </P> <P> Seymour, 51, is a millionaire former owner of a real estate business. He was  elected mayor of Anaheim in 1978 and moved to the state Senate in 1982 when he  won a special election to fill the unexpired term of Sen. John V. Briggs, who  retired.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quickly Climbed Ladder  </P> <P> Seymour quickly climbed the political ladder within the Legislature's upper  house, winning the post of chairman of the Republican Caucus after barely a  year in the Senate. In that job, Seymour was responsible for raising campaign  money and coordinating strategy in GOP races.  </P> <P> But after Republicans lost a key special election in 1987, Seymour was  pressured to resign his leadership slot. He said at the time that he welcomed  the opportunity to concentrate his energy on his own political career.  </P> <P> On state policy, Seymour has long set a moderate tone. He has been a spokesman  for more money for education and transportation. He introduced legislation to  enable toll roads to be built in Orange County.  </P> <P> On Monday, as Seymour pushed a bill through the Senate to ensure continued  money for the state's regional centers for mentally retarded, a Senate  colleague described him as a "bleeding-heart conservative."  </P> <P> Seymour said his work on behalf of the retarded, education interests and the  real estate industry will give him a natural base of support that he hopes to  build upon for his statewide race.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Raising Political Money  </P> <P> But Seymour, who is almost unknown outside Orange County, said such  "grass-roots" backing will mean little without the substantial sums of money it  takes to reach voters throughout the state.  </P> <P> The task of raising political money became more difficult last year when the  voters passed Proposition 73, which for the first time placed limits on the  amount individuals and businesses can contribute to candidates for state  office.  </P> <P> Seymour said he believes that a contested primary for lieutenant governor would  cost $1 million to $2 million. If he does not raise $250,000 by July 1, he  said, he will "have to assess the situation."  </P> <P> "If I saw the money was going to be coming in shortly, I might continue," he  said. "If I saw there was just no way, I'd probably withdraw."  </P> <P> To achieve his goal, Seymour said, he will hold perhaps eight or 10  fund-raisers between now and June 30. He said one of the first will be a major  Orange County event.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Orange County's Candidate'  </P> <P> "I think one of my strengths as a candidate is that Orange County Republican  support that has been so generous in supporting Republican candidates  statewide," he said. "I'd like to go down and have a very successful  fund-raiser there and establish that I could potentially become Orange County's  candidate."  </P> <P> Seymour acknowledged that claiming Orange County as a regional base would be  more difficult if other lawmakers in the county also run.  </P> <P> "Obviously, if Sen. Campbell or Sen. Bergeson were to become a candidate for  lieutenant governor, we would split the base down in Orange County," he said.  "That would be unfortunate."  </P></p>

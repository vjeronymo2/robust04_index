			<p>BFN     [Text] The French Humanitarian organization (?Premiere)  [word indistinct] has reported that Karadzic's Serbs have  offered to exchange 11 humanitarian workers from this  organization, whom they have held prisoner for two weeks, for 11  Serbian prisoners in Sarajevo. The association received this  proposal in a letter from Dragan Kalinic, so-called health  minister of the Bosnian Serbs. Kalinic wrote that among the 11  imprisoned Serbs are five doctors and two nurses, and added that  the French humanitarians were caught when they tried to deliver  non-humanitarian aid to the Muslims. The French Ambassador to  Bosnia-Herzegovina informed the organization that the 11  humanitarian volunteers could be tried soon.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Seoul may intervene in Hyundai labour dispute THE South Korean government said it would intervene directly in the labour dispute at Hyundai, the country's biggest conglomerate, unless a settlement is reached today, writes John Burton in Seoul. The 45 days of industrial action, mostly consisting of partial walkouts, at 10 Hyundai companies, including its main motor vehicle and shipbuilding units, have resulted in production losses of Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 930m) and threaten the government's economic recovery programme. The government could invoke emergency powers and ban any job actions for 20 days, including possibly suppression of any illegal strike activity, as it mediates in the dispute. However, there are indications that tensions are easing at Hyundai. Workers at eight of the nine companies still engaged in industrial action resumed normal production late last week in a goodwill gesture to win concessions. But they threatened to stage a second one-day general strike later this week, following one on July 7, if no progress is made in labour negotiations. The government threat of intervention is seen as an attempt to force labour and management to compromise quickly and prevent another general strike. The Hyundai trade unions are seeking pay rises above the 4.7 per cent offered by management, the right to partial pay during strike periods, union shops and a 40-hour week.</p>

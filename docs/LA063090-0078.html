			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BERMAN IS 10TH IN S &amp; L CONTRIBUTIONS;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN MONEY: A COMMON CAUSE STUDY ALSO REPORTS REP. ELTON GALLEGLY RECEIVED  $20,050 FROM THE SCANDAL-PLAGUED INDUSTRY.  </P> <P> Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) received $45,950 in campaign  contributions from the scandal-plagued savings and loan industry in the 1980s,  the 10th-highest amount among present House members, according to a Common  Cause study.  </P> <P> Among other San Fernando Valley-area representatives, Elton Gallegly (R-Simi  Valley), who was first elected in 1986, received $20,050, and Carlos J.  Moorhead (R-Glendale) received $14,635, the citizens lobby reported Thursday.  Rep. William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), whose district reaches into the  Antelope Valley, has received $11,800 since 1980, Common Cause said.  </P> <P> Common Cause said the funds helped influence legislation that eased regulation  of savings and loans. The industry cleanup approved by Congress will cost more  than $300 billion; the FBI is investigating 530 failed institutions for  possible criminal violations.  </P> <P> "S &amp; L interests provided millions of dollars in campaign contributions to  members of Congress throughout the 1980s," Common Cause President Fred  Wertheimer said. "This contributed to the worst financial scandal in American  history."  </P> <P> No Valley-area representative has been directly associated with the scandal.  None sit on the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. And Berman  and Gallegly arrived in Congress after it passed the most important legislation  deregulating the industry.  </P> <P> Many of the largest and most politically active S &amp; Ls, including the  failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., were based in California. Lincoln gave  $461,800 in contributions, Common Cause said. Six of the 10 biggest givers were  California institutions; the top six House recipients were Californians.  </P> <P> The area lawmakers' totals were relatively modest compared to the sums given to  former Democratic leaders tarnished by the scandal. Former Speaker Jim Wright  of Texas received $131,430; former House Banking chairman Fernand St. Germain  of Rhode Island received $144,400 from 1981 to 1986.  </P> <P> "I've known some of these people for a very long time and some of them  generally support things I'm doing here that had nothing to do with the S &amp;  L industry," Berman said of his contributors. "I certainly solicited  contributions, and they must have responded."  </P> <P> Berman said he opposed the industry by supporting the 1987 bailout proposal.  The Reagan Administration called for $15 billion in new borrowing authority for  the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to bail out failing S &amp; Ls.  </P> <P> The industry, which would have been required to pay interest on the borrowed  funds, succeeded in lowering the bailout amount to $5 billion on the House  floor. The final figure was $10 billion.  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and four other senators are under investigation  by the Senate Ethics Committee for intervening with federal regulators on  behalf of Lincoln. Berman said he has never been asked to go to bat for any S  &amp; L.  </P></p>

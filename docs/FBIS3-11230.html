			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today, Sergio Cerbello, Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front [FMLN] representative to Europe, accused the  Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA] of buying votes in the  20 March elections in El Salvador. Cerbello, who gave an  interview following a telephone conversation with Ruben Zamora,  candidate for the leftist coalition which also includes the  FMLN, expressed his confidence that a second round will be  necessary to elect a president because none of the candidates  have won an absolute majority.    Sergio Cerbello, who is in Madrid at the invitation of the  Spanish United Left coalition (led by the Spanish Communist  Party), expressed surprise for victory statements made by ARENA,  the official party, since the Supreme Electoral Tribunal has not  released definitive results yet.    In light of the high abstentionism rate registered during  the  elections -- approximately 47 percent -- Cerbello said "it was  the same as other elections held in the past ten years."  Therefore, both the left and the right should concede that "they  have not been able to motivate the people to vote."    Regarding leftist candidate Ruben Zamora's chances vis-a-vis  ARENA candidate Armando Calderon in a possible runoff for the  presidency, Cerbello said that "it all depends on the Christian  Democracy Party [PDC]. The PDC representative in Europe has  guaranteed me that the PDC will support Ruben Zamora, but they  cannot guarantee people will comply with the party's  instructions."    Cerbello announced that if the need for a second round is  confirmed, Julio Anguita, leader of the Spanish United Left  coalition, will travel to El Salvador to support Ruben Zamora in  his race for the presidency.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Lebedinskiy report: "It Is Harder To Receive </F> Than to Work"]    [Text] Perm Oblast -- An open-ended strike by the miners  of Kizelovskiy Coalfield in Perm Oblast was to have started  yesterday. The reason was purely economic -- the nonpayment of  wages since the beginning of the year. But if their labor is  not paid for within a week, the miners warned, demands will be  made that the government should resign and presidential  elections be held ahead of schedule.    The countdown was about to begin, but news spread of 2.7  billion rubles arriving on time; this should be enough to settle  accounts with the miners. But only for January. It was decided  to postpone the strike. Evidently, until this money runs out.</p>

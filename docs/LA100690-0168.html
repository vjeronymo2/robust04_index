			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE 'OLDER' AUDIENCE  </P> <P> If controversy of any kind repels La Habra theatergoers, maybe "West Side  Story," the next production, might be a little too much with its Puerto Ricans.  I hope the Depot Playhouse board will realize that racism and bigotry are as  destructive to community values as illegal drugs, domestic violence or  political corruption.  </P> <P> ALEX M.

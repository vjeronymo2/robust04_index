			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FACT WATCH;  </P> <P> HUNTER'S CREDIBILITY  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Tricia Hunter (R-Bonita) strains credibility with her defense of  the 13,000 letters she sent at public expense to constituents in the final days  of her primary campaign. The letters went out in batches of 199 -- the maximum  number of "substantially similar" letters allowed monthly under Proposition 73.  </P> <P> Sixty-seven groups of Hunter's constituents in the 76th District received  missives on topics such as child care and legislation on voting aids for the  disabled.  </P> <P> When her opponent complained about the May 31 letters, Hunter called the timing  a fluke, saying that she had finally won approval from the Assembly Rules  Committee to use a special computer program.  </P> <P> As the "Saturday Night Live" Church Lady might have responded: "How  conveeenient!"  </P> <P>  Hunter, an abortion-rights advocate who won a nationally publicized special  election in 1989 after the Supreme Court's Webster decision, added: "I don't  need name ID. That's the last thing in the world I need. I probably have more  name ID than any person in this Assembly, except for maybe Willie Brown."  </P> <P> Hunter's formidable name ID helped her squeak out a 51.6% to 48.4% primary  victory in the staunchly conservative district, which covers parts of San Diego  and Riverside counties.  </P> <P> Ironically, the law repealed in 1988 by the passage of Proposition 73 would  have prevented Hunter from sending any mail to constituents before Election  Day. Under the old code, there was no limit on the number of letters  legislators could send to constituents -- but no mailings were allowed after an  incumbent filed as a candidate in a general election.  </P></p>

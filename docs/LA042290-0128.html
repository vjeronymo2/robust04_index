			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER LAUDS ACTS BY 'REMARKABLE' STUDENTS  </P> <P> In a day and age when it seems popular to state how bad our teens are in  society, I have a story to show otherwise.  </P> <P> I have been a student teacher at Nogales High School in La Puente since  February in the Choral Music Department.  </P> <P> During a recent choir tour, my car was stolen from the campus. The students of  the choir were outraged and began gathering information, resulting in a list of  suspects. Some of the students went searching for my car in the surrounding  area.  </P> <P> On Wednesday following the tour, I was asked to remain in class over lunch. All  the choir students came in the room, (and) over 100 students proceeded to share  with me the impact I've had on their lives in only two months and how they were  sorry this adversity had come to me. Then they handed me a shoe box marked  "Stolen Car Fund." The students had collected over $500 in cash to help my wife  and I with any expenses we may have.  </P> <P> What I wish to say first is to teachers everywhere: You can have a profound  impact on the lives of your students, impact that will move them to action.  Secondly, I've got to say that there are still teen-agers with remarkable  character, young people who respect others, who care about others and who are  willing to give of themselves to help others.  </P> <P> We all must remember to reinforce the good in people and recognize them for who  they are inside, young and old alike. Thank you, Nogales students!  </P> <P> DON HOFER  </P> <P> Glendora  </P></p>

The IHA is expected to undertake the work set forth in the Annual Statement. However, the IHA may undertake any of the work identified in any of the other four years of the latest approved Five-Year Action Plan, current approved Annual Statement or previously approved CIAP budgets, without further HUD approval. Actual uses of the funds are to be reflected in the IHA annual Performance and Evaluation Report for each grant. See &sect;905.684. The IHA is encouraged to inform the residents of significant changes (such as changes in scope of work or whenever it moves work items within the approved Five-Year Action Plan). Documentation of that information shall be retained in IHA files. If HUD determines as a result of an audit or monitoring findings that an IHA has provided false or substantially inaccurate data in its Comprehensive Plan/Annual Submission or has circumvented the intent of the program, HUD may condition the receipt of assistance, in accordance with &sect;950.687. Moreover, in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 1001, any individual or entity who knowingly and willingly makes or uses a document or writing containing any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577&hyph;0157) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

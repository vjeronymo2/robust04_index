The output of engineering machinery, automobiles, electrical  appliances, heavy-duty mine machinery, copiers, cameras and  meters increased remarkably while that of agricultural machinery  and basic mechanical parts declined.    A lot of complete equipment was made for key national  projects last year and more technology-intensive machinery was  manufactured.    The meeting revealed that China is now making a program to  promote the development of the mechanical industry. By 2010,  the machinery industry will be the mainstay industry of the  national economy, with a total output value of 3,000 billion  yuan, one third of the total of the country's industry.    To meet the target, the program proposes several measures:  build a national unified machinery product market; aid some  highly- efficient enterprises to take the lead; readjust the  capital structure by introducing joint-stock system; encourage  the cooperation and merging among enterprises; support the large  and medium state-run enterprises to conduct scientific and  technological research.    According to the program, five enterprises with sales volume  of 10 billion yuan and 20 with five billion yuan will crop up in  the country by the end of this century; the qualities of some  mechanical products will reach the world advanced levels.</p>

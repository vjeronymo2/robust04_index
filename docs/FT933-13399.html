			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / LDP leaders'election row goes public LEADERS of Japan's Liberal Democratic party argued openly yesterday over who should resign to take the blame for the party's loss of power, as opposition parties huddled together in the hope of forming a coalition government. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, was under pressure to quit from other LDP faction heads, who suggested that he make way for a leader acceptable to a potential coalition partner and, preferably, one of their own faction members. But Mr Miyazawa said a decision on his future would come after 'consulting' his party, though he will 'try again' to reform the electoral system, indicating that he wants to remain as leader in spite of the unsubtle hints from other senior officials. The first day of post-election jockeying saw each of the opposition parties staking out territory, and hinting at a coalition without making firm commitments to partnerships with other opposition parties or with the LDP. It is expected that an extraordinary sesssion of parliament, which must be held within 30 days of the election, will be convened on August 2, when a new prime minister is to be chosen. In the meantime, the LDP hopes to find a partner to ensure that its candidate is chosen. The most pressing questions to be resolved in the meantime are the identity of the LDP candidate and the partner party. Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the former prime minister, yesterday suggested that Mr Miyazawa should resign, presumably to make way for Mr Kaifu himself. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former finance minister, is another potential candidate, though he is thought arrogant by fellow party members. Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, wants to be prime minister, but he is in ill health and is opposed to reform of the political system. A LDP prime ministerial candidate must have pro-reform credentials to satisfy a potential partner such as the Japan New party, which campaigned on the need to overhaul Japanese politics and would need the resignation of Mr Miyazawa to keep its supporters happy. Mr Miyazawa, an accomplished performer in the company of the Group of Seven leaders earlier this month, again finds himself repeatedly humiliated by LDP factions. An indiscreet conversation, picked up by television microphones, had two officials plotting the demise of Mr Miyazawa, who spent the day denying that he had already resigned. The poor performance of the Social Democratic party, still the largest opposition party, but which lost almost half of its seats, prompted calls for the resignation of its chairman, Mr Sadao Yamahana. He suggested that the first priority is to form a coalition government, not for him to resign. Mr Tsutomu Hata, leader of the Japan Renewal party, was also publicly confident about opposition parties mustering the numbers to force the LDP out of office. However, his powerbroker colleague, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, was rumoured to be negotiating with LDP officials about a Hata-led LDP coalition governmnent.</p>

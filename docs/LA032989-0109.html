			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOUGLAS EXPECTS DELIVERY DELAYS TO WORSEN  </P> <P> Douglas Aircraft has notified its commercial aircraft customers that delivery  delays, which have plagued the McDonnell Douglas subsidiary for the past year,  are expected to grow somewhat worse during 1989.  </P> <P> The firm announced Tuesday that because of a record backlog of orders, problems  with rapid employment growth and various management changes, deliveries of some  MD-80 jetliners from its Long Beach complex will be delayed about five to 30  days this year.  </P> <P> Robert H. Hood Jr., the recently named president of Douglas, said only three  weeks ago that the delays had not grown any worse, but a new assessment has  indicated that more aircraft than earlier thought will be delayed, company  spokesman Don Hanson said.  </P> <P> "It doesn't mean that every airplane will be affected," Hanson said. "A lot of  the aircraft going out of here have been delivered on time."  </P> <P> Hanson did not have figures on how many additional airplanes will be late, and  he declined to identify the affected airlines.  </P> <P> Last year, Douglas delivered 121 MD-80s. The company builds 2 1/2 of the  airplanes per week, which amounts to about 120 aircraft per year after  deducting for holiday shutdowns. To make up for delays, however, the company  must increase production above 2 1/2 per week. That means stepping up not only  Douglas assembly but deliveries from thousands of suppliers all over the world.  </P> <P> The delays are being exacerbated by a top-to-bottom management restructuring by  Hood.  </P> <P> "There is no way you can go through major structural changes in your  manufacturing process without some disruption," Hanson said. "We knew we were  going to have to bite that bullet."  </P> <P> Douglas said it expects "significant long-term improvements" from the  organizational changes. It added, "The new emphasis on quality . . . is  expected to yield significant improvements for next year and beyond."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius by </F> RESPUBLIKA under the "Opinions" rubric: "I Am Not So Bad..."]    [Excerpts] "All governments are bad, only to a different  extent," said Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius, occupying the  chair of RESPUBLIKA's editor for an hour on Friday [17  December]. The prime minister replied to reporters' questions,  taught them to be constructive, grieved over his poor  pedagogical skills, bored everyone to death with his lengthy  replies, and censored himself.    [RESPUBLIKA] With which newspaper do you begin your  day?    [Slezevicius] I regret that V. Baublys, chief of the  government press service, surveys only exceptional issues. I  myself have very few opportunities for reading, although I used  to read all newspapers earlier.    [RESPUBLIKA] After the events in the woods near Kaunas  [reference to volunteer mutiny], you signed a resolution sending  J. Gecas, chief of staff at the Volunteer National Defense  Service [SKAT], and commander E. Nazelskis for training to the  Czech Republic. This is a promotion rather than a  punishment.    [Slezevicius] It is very good that people seek education. I  do not think that J. Gecas played a great negative role in this  story. Can all SKAT leaders be doomed to infinite remorse for  something that occurred in one unit? J. Gecas has resigned his  position. We will decide separately how to utilize his skills.    [RESPUBLIKA] J. Gecas is the current acting deputy  defense minister, and a few days ago he was appointed chairman  of the SKAT officers' certification commission....    [Slezevicius] I am not familiar with this situation.    [RESPUBLIKA] What is the fate of V. Zedelis, chief of  the department for the protection of government secrets?  RESPUBLIKA has already reported about his repeated visits to  the prosecutor's office in Vilnius concerning the possibilities  of B. Dekanidze's [suspected of journalist Lingys' murder]  release.    [Slezevicius] His services will be declined.    [RESPUBLIKA] You lead not only the government but also  the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP]. What influence  may the developing collapse in the LDDP faction have on your  position in the government?    [Slezevicius] What is the basis for your talks about a  collapse? Only three people out of 70 have left the LDDP  faction. There have been many complicated discussions over the  last nine months. My agrarian policy not always meets with  support from my party colleagues. Sometimes the latter maintain  that I am too liberal, or that I lack social democracy. My  reply to all critics inside and outside the party is as follows:  The formation of a free market alone can ensure economic  stability, while the latter allows the implementation of social  democratic ideas through distribution. We are enacting this very  consistently. Social tensions have eased slightly, because we  have managed to achieve a real, although insignificant, increase  in real incomes.    [RESPUBLIKA] Do you believe that the law on the  stability of the litas will be adopted? The draft law alone  forced the Lithuanian Bank to defend itself. A future  confrontation between the government and the bank is  inevitable.    [Slezevicius] If I did not believe in the adoption of this  law, I would not present it. One thing is obvious: Lithuania's  economy cannot be a hostage of banks, primarily commercial ones.  Last July and August, the economy received a painful blow due  to the ruining effect of the unstable litas. Now the Central  Bank has exhausted all possibilities for ensuring its stable  exchange rate. The negative effect of our proposal is that the  government is losing the possibility of replenishing the budget  or removing its deficit from the Central Bank reserves.    Mr. Visokavicius [former central bank chairman] has taught  the government the art of banking. We realized the negative  effect of the Central Bank on the economy too late. This is my  great mistake. It is no accident that R. Visokavicius was the  most honorable guest at the conservatives' congress....    [RESPUBLIKA] Who left the bugging equipment in his  office?    [Slezevicius] Mr. R. Visokavicius' reaction was strange. His  statements were as though based on rumor. Maybe, he left the  equipment there himself.... But this is not for the press. I  am saying this by taking advantage of the right of the chief  editor position.    [RESPUBLIKA] You have submitted a draft law to the  Seimas [parliament] which establishes a 35-percent income tax  alongside a 30-percent social insurance tax. Are you trying to  cover the hole in the budget with this terrible patch in  advance?    [Slezevicius] This law has been drafted by the social  democrats, and we do not coordinate our policies with them. We  are not as bad as the social democrats. We are more socially  oriented. Taxes should be collected in a better way rather than  increased now. By the way, taxes and crime are very much linked  together.    [RESPUBLIKA] Why is the LDDP opposing the adoption of  the law on income declaration so strongly then?    [Slezevicius] I am not well informed about the Seimas'  current debates on this issue. It is difficult to follow  everything.    [RESPUBLIKA] The Seimas proposed the resignation of  your appointed minister while discussing the agrarian issue.  Despite your disapproval, the Seimas adopted a law on the  improvement of the difficult situation in agriculture. If the  opinions of the government and the Seimas were really different,  how will things be with agriculture?    [Slezevicius] It will survive. The situation was better  three years ago, but we will not return to it. It is obvious  that agriculture requires assistance. It is also evident that  the new laws do not resolve anything.    [RESPUBLIKA] Will you not implement this law?    [Slezevicius] There is nothing to implement, and the law is  good because of this, while the government is obedient.  [passage omitted]    [RESPUBLIKA] It seems that the current security policy  can be called that of "Bobelis-Jurgelis" [chiefs of the Seimas  Foreign Affairs Committee and the security service]. However,  no one knows what it is like. Do you have your own idea about  this issue?    [Slezevicius] One thing is clear: We can try to protect  ourselves, but we are not able to accomplish this. Therefore,  our national security concept should be our integration with  European defense structures. During the meeting of the Baltic  prime ministers, we discussed the necessity of a better defense  of our eastern borders and the easing of border regime between  the Baltic countries.    [RESPUBLIKA] Don't you think that the national security  concept should advocate an increased birthrate?    [Slezevicius] I am not educated enough to grasp the link  between the birthrate and national security. I think that the  birthrate is associated more with our possibilities of supplying  heat and electric energy. This is what we are doing to expand  our reproduction.</p>

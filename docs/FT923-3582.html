			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Management: Why diversity is a dirty word in some circles - A look at the pros and cons of one of the most powerful corporate concepts The principle that a diverse portfolio of investments is the best hedge against bad times, for companies as well as for individuals, is as old as the hills. But so, at least in the corporate world, should be the recognition that diversity can be dangerous. It is now more than a decade since a string of research studies, at the Harvard Business School and elsewhere, began to demonstrate conclusively that most diversifications fail  -especially those which are not related (or only distantly so) to the company's 'core' activities and skills. Hence, in part, the drastic purge of past diversifications which most companies have carried out in the past few years. For the majority of them, diversity is now out of fashion. Focus is the new watchword. So it was quite a surprise late last month to read a statement supposedly made by the chairman of WH Smith, the British retailing group which, in the face of deep recession, has just produced a remarkable 27 per cent rise in annual profits. 'Chairman attributes result to wide diversity of group activities,' it read. What the man said was rather different. But more of that later. The reality is that diversity has come close to being a dirty word within WH Smith. This is not surprising, since it has spent much of the past year reducing its diversity by the sale of several peripheral but problem businesses which it built up in the 1980s. The most peripheral one which still remains, its do-it-yourself joint venture with Boots (called 'Do It All'), is causing considerable problems. The 'd-word' has cropped up several other times in the past week, notably in commentary on the results of Williams Holdings, the UK engineering-to-building products combine, and IMI, the engineering group. To confuse matters further after the WH Smith misunderstanding, the word was used positively to explain why their 1992 profits are running better than some people expected. With BTR, one of Britain's longest-surviving exponents of apparent diversity, reporting yesterday, the time is ripe for clarification of what people mean by diversity these days - or, rather, what they should mean. Back in the expansive 1960s, the word was used more or less synonymously with the term 'unrelated'. But then the business school boffins got to work and divided diversity into two types: that which is 'related' to one's 'core' business (another piece of decidedly elastic jargon), and that which is 'unrelated'. WH Smith's diversification into recorded music retailing was related to its core book, newspaper and magazine retailing business, whereas its moves into TV and travel were more or less unrelated. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was considerable progress towards understanding what, if it was to have any meaning, 'relatedness' involved. It was applied to three facets of a diversification: product, technology, and geography. Studies aplenty during the 1980s showed that if a company's diversification was unrelated to its existing businesses on more than one of these three counts, it was dangerously risky. Though most conglomerates crashed or unwound themselves in the 1980s, a handful continued to thrive, notably Hanson and BTR. The reason for this puzzled the boffins until a couple of them (plus some bright consultants) came up with the answer. It was that though the products, industries and technologies of many of the businesses owned by such conglomerates were unrelated, there was a close relatedness (or 'focus') in the type of managerial 'parenting' which the businesses required from group HQ. Thus Hanson has been less diverse than it looks. It has concentrated on mature, low-technology, short-cycle businesses which are not very capital-intensive. These are most suited to its natural hands-off parenting style - which the academics call 'financial control', as opposed to the 'strategic control' or 'strategic planning' styles of more interventionist head offices. BTR has operated a somewhat similar approach, though for 'low-technology' read 'lowish'. In the last 13 months, however, both BTR and Hanson have confused their proven roles as focused corporate parents. BTR has announced the intention of encouraging what it calls 'the cross-flow of knowledge' between businesses - an approach which needs more head office intervention, as well as more inter-business communication, than BTR is used to providing. In other words, it requires a pretty unrelated type of parenting. BTR has also said it intends to trade businesses more readily than in the past - which, on several grounds, may interfere with its 'business cross-flow' objective. It also means behaving more like Hanson. Meanwhile the latter is moving in the opposite direction by declaring an intent (at least in the US) to become less of a trader, and instead expand its 'core businesses' - a role at which the famous Hanson skills are, at best, unproven. By contrast with this confusion, WH Smith has become crystal clear about the role its head office should play and the type of businesses to which it really can add maximum value. What its chairman actually said a fortnight ago was three things: that the group had become more focused in the past year or two; that it had drawn strength from the relative 'breadth' of its retailing portfolio; and that there were still plenty of scale benefits to come from sharing distribution and other systems between its businesses. In such a context, 'breadth' means something quite different from 'diversity'. To coin a risky pun, WH Smith may have a thing or two to teach BTR and Hanson about the dangers of trying to 'do it all'.</p>

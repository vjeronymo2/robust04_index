			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / 'Barefoot doctors' wage war on Brazil's other child killers: Christina Lamb joins a health army on foot, donkey, canoe or bicycle in poor north-east THE brutal killing of eight street children in Rio recently thrust Brazil into the headlines, but the lives of many more children are being claimed by a lower-profile killer. Victims of a woeful lack of basic sanitation and inadequate food, 30,000 infants die each year in the country's impoverished north-east for want of minimum health care. While for the most part Brazilian authorities have failed dismally to provide basic services, one of the country's poorest states is showing that with the political will it is possible to improve the situation. In just three years the north-eastern state of Ceara has slashed infant mortality by a third through a cheap and simple project of door-to-door basic health assistance. Its efforts were recognised in May with Unicef's Maurice Pate prize - the first time the award has gone to a state rather than an institution. Mr Agop Kayayan, Unicef representative in Brazil, describes the Ceara project as 'a model not just for Brazil but for the world'. Every day throughout Ceara an army of health agents sets out by foot, donkey, canoe or bicycle, wearing white shirts marked with blue crosses and carrying rucksacks containing scissors, soap and portable scales. Most are young women, many are semi-literate, but they criss-crossthousands of miles of scrubland like latter-day missionaries bringing healthcare to people who have never seen a doctor in their lives. In the small town of Manguarape, 24-year-old Mariluce Oliveira da Silva is doing her rounds. Entering a wattle and daub shack where a family of seven live amid squalor, she reminds the mother to wash the children's hands and keep their hair and nails clean. Using a sling scale she weighs the seven-month baby and marks his progress on a chart. Noticing that it is dangerously near the red warning line for severe malnutrition, she stresses the need for breast-feeding and explains how to mix re-hydration salts to cure diarrhoea - the biggest killer of young children. The scheme was created in 1988 by Mr Tasso Jereissati, a businessman elected state governor. Horrified by the infant mortality rate, which was among the highest in the world at about 100 per 1,000, he ordered a survey which found 48 per cent of the deaths of young children were caused by de-hydration from diarrhoea. Although the real cause was lack of sanitation, which requires heavy investment, its effects can be easily cured through oral re-hydration therapy - a packet of salts costing 10 cents. Helped by Unicef and under the direction of Mr Carlil Lavor, a hygienist familiar with the barefoot doctors scheme in China, a programme was set up to train 3,000 health agents in hygiene, prenatal care, re-hydration therapy, vaccination and breast-feeding. Each agent attends about 150 families for a monthly salary of Dollars 60 (Pounds 40), reporting every month to a trained nurse in a municipal centre. In the first three years infant mortality was reduced by 32 per cent from 95 per 1,000 live births to 65 and Ceara has gone from last place among Brazilian states in terms of percentage of children vaccinated to first. Moreover, the scheme provides work in a state where 40 per cent of the working population are unemployed or under-employed. The most remarkable thing is that this was carried out in Brazil's third poorest state and one which was completely bankrupt when Mr Jereissati took office as well as suffering the harshest drought this century. More than half the 6.6m population have no sewers or running water and two thirds live below the poverty line. But Mr Jereissati points out that the real problem in Brazil is not money. 'Our achievements were far less to do with resources and far more to do with changing the posture of the administration and involving the community. When I took office we found vaccines rotting in stores.' Mr Kayayan says that the Ceara government is probably saving money: 'There is no comparison between the 30 cents needed to cure an attack of diarrhoea or Dollars 5-Dollars 10 for a complete set of vaccines and the cost of a child occupying a hospital bed.' Although the health agents are paid by the state government, they are chosen by the communities, a revolutionary idea in a still feudal state. Such a break with convention made the scheme difficult to implement, Mr Jereissati says. 'We met lots of resistance from politicians who resented the loss of patronage and thus control over the electorate.' One mayor even greeted the co-ordinators with a revolver. To give the idea credibility, they involved the church, university and paediatric society on the basis that if the priest and the doctor say it is good, it must be. Even so, some of the local population were unhappy at intruders coming into their houses and health workers felt uncomfortable lecturing about hygiene when families obviously had no food in the house. But Nurse Madalena Pinhedo, who co-ordinates a team of 80 agents in Manguarape, says: 'It's possible even when people are on very low income to do a lot because they have very little knowledge about such basic things as brushing teeth, keeping hair clean, not leaving faeces on the ground and which foods are most nutritious.' Success has bred acceptance and the new governor, Mr Ciro Gomes, a political ally of Mr Jereissati, has expanded the scheme to 7,300 agents attending 4m people. Describing them as 'Ceara's guardian angels', he says their value became clear during the recent cholera epidemic as they were able to catch cases early and stop the disease spreading. The greatest accolade, perhaps, is that governors from three other north-eastern states have asked Unicef to help them set up the same scheme.</p>

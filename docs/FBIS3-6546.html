The English-Japanese, Japanese-English translator is the  first embodiment of the example-based machine translation (EBMT)  theory in Japan, the officials said.    Under EBMT, machines first memorize example sentences, then  translate sentences given, using the stock of memories and the  machines ability to make analogies, they said.    Conventional translation machines use the so-called transfer  system, under which the machines, with a stock of memorized  grammar and syntax, first break down the sentences given into  parts, translate each, and recompose the sentences in the second  language.    Toppan officials said the conventional translation method  often produces unnatural sentences.    To make such translations more natural requires an  additional  input of new rules, which often confuses the machines, the  officials said.    The officials also said machines with the new translation  system, called Toptran, have the ability to learn the more  frequently they are used because of the increased storage of  memories.    The system, a fruit of four years of research and  development  and 200 million yen in investments, will be used only within the  company and will not be put on the market for the time being,  they said.</p>

DPR&hyph;53 and DPR&hyph;69, issued to Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (the licensee) for operation of the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, located at the licensee's site in Calvert County, Maryland. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendments would revise Figure 5.1&hyph;1, Site Boundary Map, and Figure 5.1&hyph;2, Low Population Zone Map, in the Technical Specifications (TSs). The revisions are needed to correct the discrepancy between the current site property lines and the property lines as shown on TS Figure 5.1&hyph;1 and Figure 5.1&hyph;2. This discrepancy resulted from the purchase of land subsequent to issuance of the plant operating licenses and the failure to update the TSs to reflect the change in site property lines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated September 29, 1992, as supplemented by letters dated October 22, 1993, and November 11, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed changes to the TSs are required to correct the discrepancy between the current site property lines and the property lines as shown on Figure 5.1&hyph;1 and Figure 5.1&hyph;2 in the TSs. This discrepancy resulted from the purchase of six parcels of land subsequent to issuance of the plant operating licenses and the failure to update the TSs to reflect the change in property lines. The original site covered 1135 acres. With the addition of the six new parcels of land, the site now covers 2108 acres. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 2108 acre Calvert Cliffs site includes forest and farmland which surround the plant. The land's primary purpose is to serve as a natural buffer between the plant and the local community. Over 1500 acres of the site are covered with woodlands. The remaining acreage is made up of various open areas, a 50-acre recreational facility, and a working farm of about 100 acres. The six parcels of land that were acquired by the licensee subsequent to issuance of the plant operating licenses are comprised of shoreline property, woodlands, and farmland. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revisions to TS Figure 5.1&hyph;1 and Figure 5.1&hyph;2 are administrative in nature in that they will update the TSs to accurately reflect the current site boundary. The proposed amendments will not change plant equipment, operation or procedures, and do not adversely affect the probability or the consequences of any accident at this facility. The proposed amendments also do not affect radiological effluents from the facility or the radiation levels at the facility. Although the exclusion area as defined in 10 CFR part 100 has been increased, the property addition does not change the licensee's offsite dose calculations. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological impacts associated with the proposed amendments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are no persons who reside on any of the new parcels and the acquired property does not contain sites of historical, archaeological or scenic significance. The licensee's Land Management Program implements certain forestry and farming practices that are intended to preserve the site's land resources and natural habitats. There are three focal areas of the program; fire prevention, significant laws and regulations, and wildlife considerations. Salient aspects of these focal areas are summarized below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the area of fire prevention, the licensee has implemented a program to replace large stands of Virginia Pine trees with better quality trees to reduce the potential for fire. A system of fire roads has also been developed throughout the property and firefighting equipment has been strategically placed along these roads to assist personnel in the event of a fire. A property grid system has been established to determine the location and extent of a fire once discovered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to significant laws and regulations, environmental laws in the State of Maryland are focused on promoting good soil conservation practices, improving the quality of the Chesapeake Bay, and preserving endangered species and other animals unique to the area. To avoid erosion and keep land productive, the licensee uses practices such as contour plowing, applying pesticides and fertilizer properly, rotating crops, minimizing tilling, and growing a cover crop during the winter for all farming operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Chesapeake Bay Critical Areas Law strictly governs the use of land within 100 feet of, and all tributaries leading into, the Chesapeake Bay. The law was enacted to prevent the continued deterioration of the Bay by controlling future development and water runoff containing harmful quantities of sediment, fertilizers, pesticides, and toxic metals from agricultural fields and other developed land adjacent to the Bay. The licensee complies with Calvert County's Critical Area Plan. Four of the new parcels of land have land which falls in the critical area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Calvert Cliffs site is regulated by the Federal ``Endangered Species Act,'' 16 U.S.C. 1531. This act requires landowners to preserve those areas inhabited by species protected by this act. At Calvert Cliffs, the Tiger Beetle and Bald Eagle are protected. Two species of the Tiger Beetle are found along the beach area at Calvert Cliffs; the Northeastern Beach Tiger Beetle and the Puritan Tiger Beetle. A family of Bald Eagles is located in the southern portion of the Calvert Cliffs site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Calvert Cliffs site is home for a wide variety of wildlife, including two animal species considered endangered. Their habitat is largely preserved on more than three-fourths of the 2108 acres at Calvert Cliffs. By implementing sound forestry practices the licensee endeavors to ensure that the necessary food, nesting areas, and cover are provided to support the animals that live at Calvert Cliffs. The licensee has several plans in place to ensure that the habitats of the various wildlife species are preserved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revisions to the TSs will merely update the TSs to reflect the current site boundary and will not affect the utilization of the six new parcels of land or implementation of the licensee's Land Management Program. The proposed amendments will also not affect nonradiological plant effluents and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

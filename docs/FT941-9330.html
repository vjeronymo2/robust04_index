			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: JGBs stage rally as European sectors fail to settle While Europe's bond markets resumed their erratic and volatile trading patterns of recent days, Japanese government bonds rallied smartly after their recent declines. Encouraged by a firmer yen, the weak stock market and renewed speculation of a cut in the official discount rate, JGBs rallied in Tokyo and continued to rise in London. The March JGB future rose 0.77 point to 115.30 in Tokyo and rose further to 115.55 in London trading on Liffe. The rally was triggered by the failure of last week's US-Japanese trade talks which fuelled fears of a higher yen, said Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International. Currency strength will also boost Japan's already positive inflation outlook, underpinning bonds and encouraging speculation of more rate cuts, he said. While supply concerns remain, they were not enough to damp bullish sentiment. Moreover, the long end was helped by the fact that today's government auction is in the six-year sector - the first time since 1981 the government is selling six-year notes, one trader said. UK gilts had another volatile day, briefly supported in the morning by bullish producer price data but slipping back after the US opened. 'There was more US selling in the futures market,' reported a trader at a large London bank. Price action is expected to remain directionless and investors sidelined until Wednesday's release of January inflation numbers. The market consensus is for a headline rate of 2.6 per cent and an ex-mortgage rate of 3 per cent. Traders also are awaiting today's announcement by the Bank of England of the terms of the latest gilt auction. Traders are divided, with some calling for the 7 per cent gilts due 2001 to be tapped while others expect another tranche of the 6 3/4 per cent gilts due 2004. The latter would be targeted more at foreign investors, who favour 10-year bonds, while a shorter maturity would primarily attract domestic investors, traders said. German bonds wiped out early gains to close little changed in technical trading. The Bundesbank's announcement of another round of fixed-rate repos at 6 per cent had little market impact, although it was seen to reduce the likelihood of a cut in interest rates at Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank central bank council. Meanwhile, the Dutch government accepted Fl 5.3bn of bids for its new tranche of 5.75 per cent 10-year bonds. The paper was initially offered at 99.35 but the price was increased to end the session at 99.80. The tap will remain open today, with the finance ministry seen wanting to raise a total of Fl 10bn. Italian bonds fell nearly  1/2 point, pressured by new 3- and 5-year supply and the prospect of a 10-year auction today. The March BTP contract on Liffe fell 0.41 point to 117.24. French bonds also slipped on disappointment that the Bank of France left rates unchanged at its latest repo operation. The March notional bond future fell 0.12 point to 128.86. Longer-dated US government bonds retreated yesterday afternoon on fears that the dollar's sharp drop against the yen would trigger heavy selling by Japanese investors. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 lower at 97 15/32 , with the yield rising to 6.438 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 7/32 , to yield 4.403 per cent. In early trading, prices sagged as the market waited to see how the break-down of Friday's US-Japanese trade talks in Washington would influence sentiment. When heavy selling by Japanese bond holders failed to materialise, bonds stabilised in buying driven by technical factors. By late afternoon, however, concern over movements in the currency markets caught up with bonds. Near the end of the session, the dollar was trading in New York at around Y102.70, against Y107.20 late Friday. Earlier it touched a low of Y101 before rebounding somewhat. The news of the dollar's weakness brought a swift drop to longer-dated bonds, but the short-end held steady. The market virtually ignored the day's economic news. The Commerce Department reported that December business inventories were unchanged, as expected. Reuters, the financial information and news group, has signed a deal with Liberty Brokerage Investment Company, the New York-based inter-dealer broker, allowing it to quote data on US Treasuries. Reuters said its customers would be provided with Liberty Brokerage's data free of charge later this year. Liberty Brokerage is a significant inter-dealer broker of US Treasury securities and - through its affiliates - of US mortgage-backed securities, non-US government securities and derivatives in Europe.</p>

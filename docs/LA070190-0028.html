			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER NOTEBOOK: IS NOW THE TIME TO REFINANCE YOUR MORTGAGE?;  </P> <P> FINANCES: IF YOU CAN REDUCE THE INTEREST ON YOUR LOAN AT LEAST 2% AND REPAY  LOST COSTS FROM REDUCED PAYMENTS WITHIN THREE YEARS, IT MAKES SENSE TO  REFINANCE NOW.  </P> <P> In case you haven't been paying attention, home mortgage interest rates have  dropped recently. Many lenders also have cut or eliminated their loan fees  because the home mortgage business is very slow. But lenders are not rushing to  slash their interest rates, although some economists are forecasting continued  gradual declines in them.  </P> <P> As a result of the decrease in home loan interest rates, many homeowners are  wondering if now is a good time to refinance. The reasons for refinancing  include (1) lowering the interest rate, (2) taking out equity in the form of  tax-free cash, (3) converting from an adjustable to a fixed rate loan, (4)  paying off a balloon payment, and (5) cutting the monthly mortgage payment.  </P> <P> If you are considering a mortgage refinance to cut your interest rate and lower  your monthly loan payment, the general rule is that it pays to refinance if you  can reduce the interest rate at least 2% and if you can repay lost costs from  reduced payments within three years. This is sometimes called the 2-3 rule.  </P> <P> But even if your situation doesn't meet these criteria, you may want to  refinance anyway. For example, if your adjustable rate mortgage is over 11% and  you can get a new fixed rate mortgage at 10%, you will probably sleep much  better knowing your fixed interest rate cannot be raised.  </P> <P> Or if you have a balloon payment coming due in a few months, today may be the  right time to refinance. Still another good reason to refinance would be to  take out tax-free cash, so you can buy sound, well-located investment property.  </P> <P> The only valid way to evaluate fixed and adjustable rate mortgages is to  compare their APR (annual percentage rate). Don't be lured by abnormally low  initial teaser or sucker interest rates on adjustable loans.  </P> <P> For example, in my town several lenders currently offer ARMs at teaser interest  rates as low as 6.9% for the first six months. However, those loans will have  APRs of 10.51% after the loan adjusts to the market interest rate in seven  months.  </P> <P> Currently, the APR for fixed and adjustable rate mortgages is around 10.5%. The  APR includes the loan interest rate and amortized loan fees. In the past, to  compensate for the borrower's risk of rising interest rates, the APR for  adjustable loans was much lower than for fixed rate loans.  </P> <P> Because there is virtually no difference between the APR for fixed and  adjustable rate mortgages, today most borrowers opt for the fixed rate.  However, borrowers who think rates might decline or who can't qualify for fixed  rate loans will choose an adjustable rate mortgage.  </P> <P> Homeowners should realize when they have a good mortgage and leave it alone. A  prime example is a homeowner with a large, low fixed interest rate loan. If  this is your situation, but you want to take out some tax-free cash, your best  bet is to leave the first mortgage alone and take out a home equity second  mortgage loan. Today most banks and S&amp;Ls are extremely eager to make more  profitable home equity loans.  </P> <P> Another situation in which refinancing usually is not advised occurs if you  bought your home within the last few years and obtained a 90% or 95% mortgage.  Since you will probably have to pay refinance fees out of your pocket because  the loan-to-value ratio is so high, refinancing is not a profitable alternative  until you have built up more equity in your home.  </P> <P> If you decide to go ahead with refinancing, be aware of the typical refinancing  costs you will encounter. However, these fees vary widely, so be sure to shop  among at least a half-dozen lenders:  </P> <P> 1 -- The loan fee. Although a loan fee paid to obtain an acquisition home  mortgage was fully deductible in the year of home purchase, when you refinance  a home mortgage, the loan fee is not immediately deductible in full. However,  it can be deducted over the life of the mortgage.  </P> <P> Although many lenders offer home loans without fees, most charge loan fees in  "points." One point equals 1% of the amount borrowed. To illustrate, a 2-point  loan fee on a $100,000 mortgage is $2,000.  </P> <P> 2 -- Mortgage insurance. If you obtain a FHA loan or a 90% or 95% PMI (private  mortgage insurance) mortgage, you will be charged for mortgage insurance. These  fees vary widely. Some can be added to the loan amount, whereas others must be  paid monthly.  </P> <P> If you obtain a PMI mortgage, be sure to ask the lender for a written promise  when the PMI premium can be dropped, usually after a few years when the  loan-to-value ratio drops below 80%.  </P> <P> 3 -- Appraisal fee. Most lenders charge borrowers for appraisal of the  property. If you are asked to pay the fee, perhaps around $250, be sure the  lender agrees to give you a written copy of the appraisal. Be wary of any  lender who refuses to give you a copy of the appraisal because the lender may  be "low balling" you by under-estimating your home's market value.  </P> <P> When you get a copy of the appraisal, check to see if you agree with the list  of sales prices of comparable nearby homes on which your home's appraised value  was based.  </P> <P> 4 -- Title insurance. Most mortgage lenders require a new lender's title  insurance policy. However, be sure to ask if you can get a discount by going  back to the same title insurer who insured your home at the time of purchase.  </P> <P> 5 -- Escrow or attorney fee. There will usually be a charge made by the escrow  firm, S&amp;L, bank, or attorney who handles the loan closing. However, these  fees vary widely, so don't hesitate to shop around.  </P> <P> 6 -- Watch out for miscellaneous "garbage" fees. Lenders have become notorious  for charging miscellaneous "garbage" fees. Legitimate fees include credit  report, notary and recording fees. But some lenders charge outrageous fees,  such as a $100 "document drawing fee" for typing up the loan papers, which  takes about 10 minutes of a $10-per-hour clerk's time. If you question the  lender's garbage fees and threaten to take your business elsewhere, you will be  amazed how quickly the lender will waive the nuisance fees.  </P> <P> Refinancing your home loan can be a profitable experience. But don't be  intimidated by the lender. Shop carefully among many lenders to get the right  loan terms for your situation. After all, you are the customer, and the  customer is always right.  </P></p>

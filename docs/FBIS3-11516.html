			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Joaquin Villalobos, leader of the </F> Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, with unidentified  reporters on 22 March at the Presidente Hotel in San Salvador --  live or recorded]    [Text] [Villalobos] As time goes by we are receiving  detailed reports -- 48 hours after the elections -- on how the  elections were conducted. These reports led us to conclusions  beyond those that we reached on 20 March as the results were  released. We had an informal agreement that as preliminary  results were being released we could analyze the elections. Our  plan was to make an assessment before the results were released.  In our assessment, we reported that some citizens were unable  to vote. No one can estimate the number of people who could not  vote. We have an indication, though. For instance, we have a  list of people who approached an ONG [expansion unknown] and  were unable to vote despite having their voter registration  cards. The list was prepared over a few hours and describes  incidents at a polling station in La Union Department. This list  includes about 200 people who had their voter registration cards  but could not vote. The exclusion of voters is the first  anomaly we reported in the elections.    As time goes by, we are receiving other reports. For  example, a critical case involves the Jucuapa Municipality,  Usulutan Department. Two Arena [Nationalist Republican  Alliance] members, whose names I know, were caught red-handed.  One of them had poll watcher credentials, and the other was a  member of a voting table board. They were caught with a large  number of Arena ballots that were in the box. This incident  prompted... [pauses] in the Jucuapa case, there are ballot boxes  that had more votes than the number of votes that each box was  supposed to have, that is, there are boxes that had more than  400 votes. This also happened in other communities.    The Jucuapa incident prompted the raid on the town's mayoral  office at a time when all ballot boxes inside. [sentence as  heard] Members of all opposing parties, including the CD  [Democratic Convergence], the National Solidarity Movement, the  Unity Movement, the Christian Democratic Party, and the FMLN,  staged a protest together, because we were worried that the  ballot boxes could be taken away and tampered with.    There are also a large number of reports on minors who had  voter registration cards. There are also reports on people who  came to vote and realized that someone else had voted for them.  We are receiving a number of votes... [pauses] in other  communities, we found ballots marked on the front that were  supposedly lost. We found them and are using them as proof.    The most serious report consists of Arena ballots already  marked that were placed in the boxes. The other serious report  consists of FMLN ballots that were lost. Everything indicates  that more ballots were printed than were needed. There was a  plan to print ballots twice. However, at the moment we cannot  determine how large this operation was. We know that the  ballots were printed by the Laser Printing Company, whose owner  is General Alejandro Vides Casanova, former defense minister and  former National Guard chief. We must emphasize that we reported  this earlier. We opposed printing the ballots there. Our  position called for the ballots to be printed abroad.    [Reporter] What are you denouncing?    [Villalobos] We are denouncing a fraud whose extent we have  not yet been able to determine. This afternoon, we filed  protests to contest results in various places. In the  department of... [pauses] in San Miguel Municipality, Mr. Garcia  Prieto took 15 ballot boxes home with him. We are contesting  those 15 ballot boxes.    [Reporter] Where are those boxes from?    [Villalobos] From San Miguel Municipality, from the city of  San Miguel.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] number of anomalies, in other  words...    [Villalobos, interrupting] We are proceeding through legal  means. This afternoon we filed protests in various places. The  problem is that this kind of fraud, depending on how extensive  it truly is -- and granted, it is true that it may not affect  the final outcome of the presidential election, and we cannot  determine this anyway -- nevertheless, it did indeed affect  mayoral and deputy elections, because these elections can be  decided by 10 votes, six votes, 20 votes, or 50 votes. This is  a very complex situation.    More important is that we are extremely worried because  Arena  has claimed to have won 42 deputy seats. This claim conflicts  with our vote count. According to our count, Arena has won 37  deputy seats so far, while the FMLN has won 23 deputy seats.    It worries us that on the very night of the elections the  PCN  [National Conciliation Party] claimed to have won up to 14  deputy seats. At this time, we think all of these anomalies are  designed to establish a majority between the PCN and Arena in  the Legislative Assembly. This would constitute very serious  and substantial fraud.</p>

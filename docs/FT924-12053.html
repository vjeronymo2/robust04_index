			<p>921022 FT  22 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices in the main primary markets are only just holding steady, after tending easier for most of the week. The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator has fallen to another new low point for this season, at 506 cents a kg. The trade has noted that some woolgrowers withdrew thier wool from the sale before it started yesterday, in addition to some large percentages passed in at growers' reserves during the sale. On some previous occasions a weak market has led to this approach, as dissatisfaction with selling prices develops.</p>

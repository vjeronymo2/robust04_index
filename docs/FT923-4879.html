			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Britain could recover EFA outlay - Production set to yield Pounds 11bn to UK treasury THE UK government is likely to recover the full value of its investment in the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) if it goes ahead with the programme, Mr John Weston, a senior British Aerospace official claimed yesterday. Mr John Weston, chairman of BAe Defence, told a Financial Times conference that EFA production could yield over Pounds 11bn to the UK Treasury in taxes and revenues, including from exports. A world market existed for up to 3,000 aircraft of this category up to the year 2015. At the same time, he hinted at an imminent deal with Saudi Arabia for additional Tornado aircraft, predicting Tornado production would continue to 1996. BAe production work on existing UK and Saudi orders for the Anglo-German-Italian aircraft has already virtually ended. Rejecting suggestions that the EFA was a 'gold-plated super-bird,' he said significant scope existed for cutting the cost of the project but the aircraft was already designed to be as small and light as possible. Reports by the Eurofighter consortium and partner companies on prospects for making a cheaper aircraft would be available next month. These studies coincide with a review of requirements by defence chiefs of the four nations involved, including Germany, which has said it will not go ahead with production. Mr Weston argued that industrial offsets associated with purchase of an alternative aircraft would 'in no way' compensate for loss of technology or export business. He echoed complaints voiced at the conference by a senior executive of the US manufacturer McDonnell Douglas about what was seen as excessive government interference in management of defence contracts. Mr Thomas Culligan, vice-president in charge of programme development and marketing, said US defence contractors had been subjected to 'increasing government oversight and regulation' in the last decade. He urged 'constructive change' in the procurement system to remove obstacles to performance. Mr Weston said similar problems existed in the way many UK contracts were managed, with companies having to cope with 'armies of accountants'.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Liquidity Sir, I was most interested to read that Armenia had joined the Hebrides in adopting the dram as its unit of currency ('Armenia introduces own currency', November 22). Does this move herald a pan-European alliance to rival the Ecu, or will it be backed by commodities to form the Whisky Standard?

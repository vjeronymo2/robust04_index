			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slip as market suffers from auction jitters NERVOUSNESS ahead of this week's big Treasury auctions left US bond prices weaker yesterday at both ends of the market. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/16 at 102 3/8 , yielding 7.781 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged, however, at 99 29/32 , yielding 4.908 per cent. The approaching injection of supply was the dominant influence on sentiment as the market opened for the week. The Treasury is scheduled this week to auction Dollars 36bn in three-year notes, 10-year notes, and 30-year bonds, and investors as well as dealers were reluctant to trade actively before the fresh supply hits the market. The short end was initially firmer, due primarily to hopes that the Federal Reserve, in the wake of last week's bad unemployment numbers, would cut the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points. The two-year note fell back, however, after the Fed intervened to drain reserves from the banking system - a sign that it had not eased policy. RENEWED hopes of a base rate cut pushed UK government bond prices higher across the range of maturities. The Liffe gilt futures contract rose from 97.16 to 97.27 by late afternoon on a modest volume of about 18,500 contracts. Gilts traders reported interest from both domestic and international buyers, with short-dated gilts gaining over a quarter of a point. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent due 2003/07 rose from 116 1/32 to 116 7/32 . GERMAN bunds drifted lower in dull trading as participants awaited news on the wage front. The Liffe bund futures contract traded down to 88.09 from Friday's close of 88.16. Elsewhere in Europe, Dutch government bonds rallied after favourable January inflation figures, released on Friday. Dutch year-on-year inflation was 4.1 per cent in January compared with 4.9 per cent in December. JAPANESE government bond prices fell back yesterday, mainly as a result of dealers liquidating long positions ahead of today's holiday. The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB, which opened at 5.385 per cent, closed at 5.445 per cent.</p>

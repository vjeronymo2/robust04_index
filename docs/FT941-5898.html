			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Tories cede Ulster committee control The government is unlikely to have a majority on the new Commons Northern Ireland select committee, which is expected to start work shortly after Easter. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, announced yesterday that MPs will vote on whether to set up the committee on Wednesday - the same day as the annual debate on whether to renew the prevention of terrorism act. The establishment of the committee has been widely interpreted as a bid to placate the Ulster Unionists, the province's largest political party. Under Tory proposals six of the committee's 13 members would be Conservatives. There would be four unionists, two Labour MPs and one from the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. If this is adopted, the Conservatives would apparently be setting great store by the support of Sir James Kilfedder, the Ulster Popular Unionist MP for North Down. There is a Tory majority on all other Commons select committees. Sir James was last night widely tipped as the likely chairman of the committee. Two of the other unionist members are expected to be UUP MPs, with one from the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party. It is unclear whether the SDLP will agree to sit on the committee. Mr Seamus Mallon, the party's deputy leader, told MPs it had been 'imposed against the wishes of a very substantial number of people in this House' and the proposed membership was 'unfair to one section of us represented in this House'. Labour is expected to vote against establishment of the committee. It is also expected to oppose the renewal of the prevention of terrorism act while calling for a bipartisan approach to anti-terrorism in the province. Lord Fitt, the former SDLP leader, last night warned that the Anglo-Irish peace initiative in Northern Ireland had failed, and called for a security clampdown on both sides of the border. He also claimed during a debate on Northern Ireland that Mr John Hume, the present SDLP leader, had helped Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA, to gain undeserved credibility as a party of peace.</p>

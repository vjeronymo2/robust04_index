			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SKIER BOUVIER RULED WINNER OF WORLD CUP  </P> <P> Nathalie Bouvier of France captured today's women's World Cup giant slalom  after a jury overruled a protest on her first run.  </P> <P> Bouvier, who was not declared the leader until well after the opening run  because there was a question about whether she had missed a gate, did not  appear upset for the second run.  </P> <P> Following the opening run, a jury talked with the gatekeeper and reviewed the  videotape, then declared her the leader over Diann Roffe of the United States  with a time of 1:08.37.  </P> <P> Bouvier turned in an even better time of 1:07.60 on her second run for a  two-run unofficial total of 2:15.97.  </P> <P> Roffe, a giant slalom specialist who won the world championship in 1985,  finished the first run on the artificial surface in 1:09.06 as light snow fell.  Her 1:08.14 on the second run gave her a two-run total of 2:17.20 and placed  her ahead of Austria's Anita Wachter, who finished 1.54 seconds off Bouvier's  pace at 2:17.51.  </P> <P> Katjusa Pusnik of Yugoslavia finished fourth at 2:17.65 and Zoe Haas of  Switzerland was fifth at 2:17.86. West Germans Michaela Gerg and Christine  Meier were next at 2:17.93 and 2:18.26.  </P> <P> Switzerland's Vreni Schneider, coming off the best season in the history of the  sport, fell on her first run, but she said she'll be ready to go for Saturday's  slalom run.  </P> <P> "Tomorrow is another day, and I hope to do better," she said, following her  first run of the new season. "It is just one race. The snow was no problem. I  had trouble with my inside ski."  </P></p>

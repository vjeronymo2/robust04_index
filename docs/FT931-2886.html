			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: US cruise ship operator in European move CARNIVAL Cruise Lines, the Miami-based company which claims to be the world's largest cruise ship operator in terms of passengers carried, said yesterday that it was considering a 'strategic alliance' with Epirotiki Lines and Dolphin Cruise Line. Epirotiki operates 11 ships, primarily in the Mediterranean and around the Aegean. Dolphin is a smaller, Florida-based operator, with three vessels. The three businesses have already agreed to form a new company, in which each will hold a one-third interest. Carnival will sell its Mardi Gras cruise ship to the venture. The ship, renamed the Olympic, will be deployed in the eastern Mediterranean and operated by Epirotiki. Carnival, quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, operates 19 ships, and is biased towards the Caribbean, although it also offers packages to Alaska and other parts of the world. It has been a leading force in the trend towards 'mega-ships,' capable of carrying more than 2,000 passengers.</p>

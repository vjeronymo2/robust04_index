			<p>BFN     [Text] Claims that Russia is concealing information about  chemical weapons are "totally groundless". Such a statement was  made in an interview with INTERFAX on Tuesday by the Foreign  Ministry's Spokesman Grigoriy Karasin following accusations made  in the course of congressional hearings in the U.S. recently.    He reported that in keeping with an intergovernmental  memorandum on chemical agents, Russia and U.S. had exchanged  data on their military and chemical potentials in May.    "This data is being studied and analyzed in Russia and the  U.S. after which, in accordance with the memorandum, each  country will carry out five inspections of the other country's  facilities. This will enable them to make sure that the data is  correct," Karasin said.    He said Russian experts note that the information received  from the American side needs to be clarified.    "We believe that the proper channels of interaction should  be  used if these doubts are to be removed."</p>

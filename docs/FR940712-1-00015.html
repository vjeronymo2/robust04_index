			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has determined that reliance on critical repetitive inspections on aging commuter-class airplanes carries an unnecessary safety risk when a design change exists that could eliminate or, in certain instances, reduce the number of those critical inspections. In determining what inspections are critical, the FAA considers (1) the safety consequences of the airplane if the known problem is not detected by the inspection; (2) the reliability of the inspection such as the probability of not detecting the known problem; (3) whether the inspection area is difficult to access; and (4) the possibility of damage to an adjacent structure as a result of the problem. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These factors have led the FAA to establish an aging commuter-class aircraft policy that requires incorporating a known design change when it could eliminate, or, in certain instances, reduce the number of critical repetitive inspections. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1991, the FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) with an airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to BAe, Regional Aircraft Limited, HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes. This NPRM (56 FR 11976, March 21, 1991) proposed inspecting the flap torque shaft to identify all Type ``F'' universal joints, and replacing these universal joints with Type ``M'' or part number A16123 universal joints. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since issuance of the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), Jetstream Aircraft Limited has introduced an improved flap torque shaft assembly that includes universal joints that are not life limited, and that incorporates the actions proposed in the referenced NPRM and required by the following AD's: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;5529, which requires limiting the in-service life of the torque tube shaft assembly on BAe HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02, Amendment 39&hyph;6273, which requires repetitively inspecting the universal joints and universal joint rivets on BAe HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes, and replacing any damaged part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jetstream Aircraft Limited has issued Service Bulletin (SB) No. 27&hyph;JA 920340, which incorporates the following pages: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,xs36,xs60 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Pages  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Revision level  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Date <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> 1 through 6 and 9 through 16 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Dec. 21, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7, 8, and 17 through 28 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Original issue <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Sept. 2, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This service information specifies procedures for installing the improved flap torque shaft assembly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on its aging commuter-class aircraft policy and after reviewing all available information, the FAA has determined that (1) installing the new improved flap torque shaft assemblies incorporates the actions proposed in the previously referenced NPRM and AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02, and replaces critical repetitive inspections with a design modification; and (2) AD action should be taken to prevent failure of the flap torque shaft assembly, which could result in asymmetric flap deployment and loss of control of the airplane. With this in mind, the FAA issued a document, withdrawing the previously referenced NPRM, on February 14, 1994 (59 FR 8878, February 24, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other BAe, Regional Aircraft Limited, HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would supersede both AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02 with a new AD that would require installing this improved flap torque shaft assembly in place of the repetitive inspection and life limit requirements of the two existing AD's. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with Jetstream Aircraft Limited SB No. 27&hyph;JA 920340. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The subsequent final rule action (if promulgated) would have an effective date of 12 months after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and a compliance time of 50 hours time-in-service after the effective date. This would allow operators time to schedule the flap torque shaft assembly replacement. The requirements of AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02 would remain in effect until this date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 245 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 31 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $1010 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $665,175. This figure is based on the assumption that none of the affected airplane operators have accomplished the proposed actions. In addition, this action would eliminate the repetitive inspections required by AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02. The FAA has no way of determining the operation levels of each individual operator of the affected airplanes, and subsequently cannot determine the repetitive inspections costs that would be eliminated by the proposed action. The FAA estimates these costs to be substantial over the long-term. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

			<p>King'   <F P=102>   BK1206101094 Karachi DAWN in English 6 Jun 94 p 3 </F> <F P=103> BK1206101094 </F> <F P=104>  Karachi DAWN </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] Karachi, June 5 -- Mumtaz Ahmed Burney, the senior  superintendent of police [SSP], Crime Investigation Agency  [CIA], voluntarily tendered his resignation after a controversy  in which he was accused of helping the release of a suspect  popularly known as "heroin king."    Mr Burney presented his resignation to the provincial chief  secretary saying that he is resigning from the government job  owing to some unavoidable circumstances, says a spokesman for  the police.    The heroin king Showrang, an Afghan national, was arrested  on  May 17 by the CIA but on May 24, he was released on bail by ADM  [expansion unknown]/CIA.    The sudden release of Showrang created an uproar in the  recently set up Anti-Narcotics Task Force [ANTF] headed by some  senior army officers.    On a protest by ANTF, the Interior Ministry ordered an  enquiry into the matter.    Senior army officials accused the CIA chief of helping  Showrang to go free without taking the military authorities into  confidence.    Refuting the claims of the army, the CIA officials claimed  that the ANTF and the Narcotics Control Board and others  interrogated Showrang, but they did not have any past record of  the accused.    CIA claimed that the accused is 70 years old with weak  physique and is a heart patient. "During the course of  interrogation he became senseless. As no further recoveries  were expected from him, he was released on bail under section  497 of Cr PC," the agency said.    CIA claimed that his wrist watch worth Rs [rupees] 400,000  is  still lying with CIA Karachi as personal search and if CIA  officials have any sympathy with the accused then this valuable  wrist-watch would have been returned back to him." [no  beginning quote as received]    Police officials claimed that the Mr Burney has also  requested the government for permission to approach higher  courts to take action against the newspapers which have  published incorrect news against him.    Later, in the night, it was learnt that the SSP CIA withdrew  his resignation on a request by a senior Sindh minister.</p>

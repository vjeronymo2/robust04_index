			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Red-hot success for Indian foods: The small Wigan company that has beaten the multinationals with 92% product growth last year 'Pukka People Pick a Pot of Patak's,' runs the television advertising for Patak's Indian foods, which range from pickles and pastes to ready-to-eat mini-pappadums. So many pots of Patak's are now picked from supermarket shelves that the small Wigan-based family business was the UK's fastest-growing consumer goods brand last year. It achieved a red-hot 92 per cent growth in retail sales, the market intelligence company Nielsen found. The annual biggest brands survey published in Marketing, the trade magazine, says: 'So used are we to seeing the Procter &amp; Gambles and Unilevers dominating biggest brands that it comes as something of a shock to discover that our fastest-growing brand this year is owned not by a multinational with an advertising budget to match but by a family-owned foods company with a TV presence you'd need tracker dogs to find.' Procter had to be content with second place on the list of fastest-growing brands, with 77 per cent growth for Always, its sanitary towels with 'wings'. Third, with 45 per cent growth, was Eternity, the Calvin Klein fragrance for men. Compared with the big boys, Patak's sales are tiny: trade estimates put the company's annual turnover at between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m, with about a third in overseas business. This compares with the number one retail brand, Coca-Cola, which had sales of more than Pounds 411m in the UK last year and an estimated Pounds 9.1m advertising spend, compared with Patak's Pounds 500,000. While some of the largest food brand names strive to inject a homemade, family feel into their mass-produced products, Patak's can justly claim to be the real thing. The company was founded in the 1950s by the father of the present chairman, Mr Kirit Pathak, and is still entirely family-owned. Mr LG Pathak began by selling samosas from home to raise money to buy his first shop and the business expanded to take orders for pickles and chutneys. Although it has now risen to the number two Indian foods brand and has about 200 employees - Sharwood's, owned by conglomerate Tomkins, is the leader - Kirit Pathak's wife, Meena, still directs the development of all recipes. The company estimates it supplies about 90 per cent of the UK's Indian restaurants with its products, as well as becoming an increasingly familiar name on the shelves of the largest retailers. Patak's surge in growth came a year or so after the company took on its first non-family director, Mr David Page, in 1991. Mr Page, who formerly ran Campbell's grocery products in the UK, met Mr Kirit Pathak at a dinner party and ended up as managing director. Deciding initially to spend money on TV advertising was, Mr Page said, 'the big pill for us to swallow in terms of costs'. But it gave the company the boost it needed. In the future Mr Page is planning more helpings of the same. He said: 'We're big believers in 'if it ain't broke don't fix it'. We intend to continue with exactly the same strategy.'</p>

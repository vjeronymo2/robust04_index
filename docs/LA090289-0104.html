			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The enforcement director of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn., David  Berst, said he doubts that the association will take any action against  Nebraska because of allegations made about the school's football program in the  book, "The Big Red Confidential: Inside Nebraska Football" by former Sports  Illustrated writer Armen Keteyian.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen it, and anything is possible," said Berst. "But we looked into  everything when we were investigating Nebraska in 1986. And those matters --  the ticket-selling by players and the question of car ownership by Doug DuBose  -- are closed and will stay that way."  </P></p>

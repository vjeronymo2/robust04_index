			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Secure Trust to acquire Pounds 4.8m Peoples Bank Secure Trust, the financial services group, has conditionally agreed to buy Peoples Bank from Provident Financial for Pounds 4.8m cash. Secure said that Bradford-based Peoples served a similar customer base to its own, would give it a presence in Yorkshire, and broaden its range of products and services. Peoples provides personal banking services to 6,000 customers in the UK and has a loan book of more than Pounds 4m. At December 31 it had audited net assets of Pounds 14m, though since then a court approved capital reduction reduced this to Pounds 5m. 1992 pre-tax profits were Pounds 318,000.</p>

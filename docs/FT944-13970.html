			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Amex aims to win back market share - The US exchange's new chairman is seeking a turnround The American Stock Exchange, once the US's second stock exchange, is seeking to reverse its flagging fortunes, according to its new chairman and chief executive, Mr Richard Syron. 'We are changing the direction of the exchange,' he says. The Amex badly needs such a change. It has slipped in the past 10 to 15 years and now seriously lags Nasdaq, a rival market which also specialises in listing shares of smaller, growth-oriented companies, and which has been so successful that it is now the world's second largest stock market. In 1980, both Nasdaq and the Amex had average daily turnover of under Dollars 50m. By 1993, the value of daily turnover on the Amex had risen less than five-fold to Dollars 225m, while turnover on Nasdaq had soared to Dollars 1.2bn, 24 times its 1980 total. The disappointing growth in turnover has forced the Amex to turn to non-traditional equity products, such as stock and currency options and other derivative products. These now account for about half of all products listed on the exchange, and while trades in these are less profitable for the Amex itself, they are more profitable for the exchange's member firms who trade them. Mr Syron hopes to promote the Amex first through the virtues of its trading system, which is more transparent and less expensive for investors than Nasdaq - a decentralised system of dealers trading via computers. The US Justice Department's investigation into alleged price fixing on Nasdaq should help to underscore the merits of alternative trading systems, he says. The Amex, like the much larger New York Stock Exchange, operates an auction market in which investors' buy and sell orders are matched in a central market place where prices are determined by supply and demand. In most cases, trades are completed without the intervention of an intermediary, but where one side of a order remains unmatched, Amex specialists, or marketmakers, stand ready to complete every trade. The Amex says the auction system ensures spreads between the best price bid and offered for a given stock are as narrow as possible - in the exchange's case, they average 22 cents per bargain. In contrast, it says the average spread for a Nasdaq stock is 56 cents per bargain. Mr Syron claims that had Nasdaq stocks traded at the same spreads available in Amex-listed stocks, it would have saved investors some Dollars 4bn last year. The Amex argues that its trading system is also better for companies because it reduces volatility in prices. The exchange is also trying to revamp its image by flexing its regulatory muscles - an exercise it has practised infrequently over the past decade. Just two weeks ago, it delisted two companies for regulatory reasons, the first time it has done so since 1971. Beta Wells Inc and Conversion Industries, had allegedly failed to comply with the Amex's disclosure rules, which require companies to make timely and accurate statements about trading conditions. For the Amex voluntarily to surrender two companies when it is fighting desperately to attract new business from its far more successful competitors may seem counter-productive. But Mr Syron, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, says the move is a sign of the direction the exchange must take to preserve its future. 'We are and we want to be perceived more as a quality exchange which is fair to investors,' Mr Syron said, adding: 'That is completely compatible with our commercial interests.' He says investors will increasingly expect exchanges to protect them and their assets from abuse. The fact that individuals will have to make greater provision for retirement means US investors will want to achieve higher returns for their savings, he says. That will require shifting out of the low-yielding fixed income securities for pension investment into higher-yielding, but potentially riskier, equities. 'The whole issue of investor protection is going to be very important from a political perspective,' Mr Syron says. An exchange which is perceived as a tough regulator will have a competitive edge over one that is not, he argues. To that end, the Amex has appointed a committee of its non-executive board members to examine the rigour with which the exchange applies its own listing standards. 'There are pressures for us to obtain listings,' he concedes. Also, the exchange is reviewing its listing requirements to consider whether they should be made more, or less, tough. Other measures aimed at encouraging companies to list their shares include the creation of an investor relations department to help develop communication strategies - seen as particularly important for non-US companies listing American Depositary Shares. In seeking niche businesses for itself, the Amex has targeted the ADS market of foreign companies. The UK conglomerate BAT, for instance, has listed its American Depositary Shares on the Amex. Meanwhile, the exchange is also planning its first print media advertising campaign and has hired its first marketing professional to put in place a formal strategy. The Amex is also examining the potential for new products, including one aimed at retail investors who wish to buy odd-lots of older US government bonds. Mr Syron concedes that the Amex, whose slogan is 'fair trade, fair practice, fair play', has some way to go to win back some of the market share it lost to Nasdaq since 1980, but he believes it is making a start. 'You have to deal with image from the inside out,' he says.</p>

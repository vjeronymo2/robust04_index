			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Slender success in attacking barriers - Services One of the great breakthroughs of the Uruguay Round was intended to be its assault on barriers to trade in services. In the end, achievements have been modest. Unbreachable disagreements between the US and the European Union over financial services, audiovisual services and shipping have left the lion's share of the agreement unresolved. Along with telecommunications, the promise is to negotiate deals on these sectors over the coming two years. Air transport was excluded from the outset. The residual activity is far from insignificant, covering tourism, construction, professional services, consultancies, and a limited easing on movement of workers - but this is small by comparison with the sectors blighted by dispute. Only in recent years have governments come to appreciate the importance of services in international trade. Last year, cross-border services business was valued at Dollars 900bn, with the foreign operations of services companies amounting to more than Dollars 3 trillion. This knowledge led powerful business lobbies, in the US in particular, to campaign hard in the early days of the Round for ambitious market-opening in banking, securities, and insurance. But later, it became clear that countries targeted for liberalisation - like Japan, Korea, the six Asean states of Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei, and a number of Latin American countries - were not willing or able to open their markets as wide as American companies hoped, US negotiators slammed the brakes on their own market-opening commitments. Haggling over Europe's efforts to protect its film and television sectors on the grounds of protecting local culture erupted over a year ago. US audiovisual exports to Europe earned over Dollars 3.5bn last year, and the US industry did not take kindly to EU plans to cap their access to the market. More recently, in financial services, the US decision to offer full most-favoured-nation rights to just 20-odd industrial economies, following disappointment over the offers coming from target countries, triggered uproar among Gatt negotiators. The US has finally backed away from its threat, but only to allow a further two years of negotiation aimed at improving access. Mr Larry Summers, US assistant treasury secretary, reflected the frustrations of US services industries when he said this week: 'We have not achieved what the US financial services industry was hoping to achieve in 1986.' But other negotiators bring a different perspective. 'At Punta del Este (where the Round was launched), we were talking only of a framework of rules for services,' one said. 'It was only in 1990 that countries raised their sights to the idea of getting commitments to liberalise. it is true that most offers today give no more than standstills, but at least that is a start. They provide a foundation for us to work from in future rounds.'</p>

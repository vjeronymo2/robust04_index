			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Strike to end at GEC offshoot MORE THAN 400 workers at a plant owned by GEC-Alsthom, the switchgear company, will today end a six-week strike after management said they would otherwise lose their jobs, Michael Smith writes. Some 430 employees at the plant in Openshaw, near Manchester, voted yesterday to end the stoppage even though they had failed to persuade the company to reinstate 12 colleagues made compulsorily redundant, the issue on which they were striking. Strikes have been rare during the recession, and government figures last week showed that fewer working days were lost last year through stoppages than in any year since records began 100 years ago. The outcome of the GEC-Alsthom dispute is likely to deter others from striking over redundancies or other issues. It was watched by workers at other GEC plants where unions are fighting job losses and what they consider to be poor severance schemes. Since the strike began, the plant, which employs 650 people, has said it wants a further 157 job cuts in a second round of redundancies. National officials of unions including the AEU engineering workers and MSF general workers advised members to return to work after weekend talks with managers. Mr Larry Brooke, MSF national officer, said continuation of the strike would inevitably have led to the plant's closure. He said the strike had shown that GEC workers were disgusted with the way the company handled redundancies. Mr Brooke and other union officials will be pressing the company to provide the 12 employees made compulsorily redundant with the enhanced severance terms they would have been entitled to had they accepted the loss of their jobs voluntarily. They also wanted the 157 planned job losses to be reduced. GEC-Alsthom, which is owned jointly by GEC and Alcatel of France, said it regretted the need for compulsory redundancies, but welcomed yesterday's decision.</p>

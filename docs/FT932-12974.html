			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Management: Are two heads better than one? Are we in danger of going overboard on corporate governance? No one challenges the concept or the objectives - but who is counting the cost? Ultimately, are shareholders getting added value? For example, splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive can be expensive, particularly at executive level. Two salaries for what was previously one job is the starting point. And how often is the chief executive reimbursed at a lower level than his predecessor, who had been handling the dual role? Even a part-time chairman will, almost inevitably, bring an additional burden to the payroll. The hidden costs are more difficult to identify and justify. Decision making with one ultimate arbitrator should be straightforward. A decision with split roles can be time-consuming but the outcome is unlikely to be materially different or more profound from two minds than from one. Another issue arises over communicating with the City, a process that the chairman is duty-bound to lead. Yet it is the chief executive who really knows the business, and it is he who fund managers wish to hear. I suspect that this will not be easy for many chairmen to accept. Many senior executives are frustrated with the challenge of working for two masters, particularly if they worked closely with someone combining efficiently the two roles. If a company has in place a well qualified, independent set of non-executive directors, are further safeguards necessary? If arm's-length committees covering audit, renumeration and so on are in place and working efficiently, will the horrors of the past be repeated? When too much power lies in one person's grasp, then the likelihood of fraud, dishonesty and variations on those themes is always a danger. But executives and companies of the highest integrity will always outnumber those with the propensity to go off the rails. It should not be necessary, as a matter of course, for every company to split the chairman and chief executive. In providing such safeguards companies are often wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds. It is time to think again, to analyse the practical implementations and to consider carefully whether we really are creating a better, safer corporate world.

			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: BEIJING;  </P> <P> ASIAN DIPLOMACY  </P> <P> North Korea and Japan are to hold a second round of preliminary talks Saturday  aimed at ultimately establishing diplomatic relations between them.  </P> <P> The discussions, which occur against a backdrop of political change throughout  Northeast Asia, will take place in the Chinese capital, where both countries  have embassies. An earlier round of talks in Beijing had left unsettled key  questions of where, when and at what level formal talks on diplomatic ties  should begin.  </P> <P> Among other outstanding issues: North Korea's demand that Japan pay  compensation both for the period of its colonial rule in 1910-45 and for its  postwar "political hostility." Tokyo is balking at any compensation related to  the postwar period.  </P></p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Moscow applies for full membership of the IMF RUSSIA yesterday applied for full membership of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the first step towards winning financial support for its transition from a centralised to a free-market economy, writes Lionel Barber in Washington. The request follows President Boris Yeltsin's scrapping of price controls in the former Soviet republic last week. The US and other western allies have said they will support Fund and Bank membership for Russia and other reformist Soviet republics, allowing them access to development loans once they adopt an IMF reform programme. Until recently, western countries had vigorously opposed full IMF membership on the grounds that the Soviet leadership was not prepared to embrace serious economic reform. The Bush administration now recognises that the IMF is best placed to assume the burden of direct financial aid and offering expert advice. Russia's application came amid US preparations for an international conference in Washington this month to co-ordinate food and medical aid for the former Soviet republics. Up to 60 countries could attend the conference on January 22 and 23, the State Department said. The meeting will be held at foreign ministers level and will involve international financial institutions, including the IMF, World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Ms Margaret Tutwiler, State Department chief spokeswoman, said the aim was to organise a division of labour to meet 'drastically increasing humanitarian needs'. Russia is likely to have to wait at least six months for its request to be processed, along with an earlier one from Ukraine and Azerbaijan's yesterday. One reason is the lack of adequate economic data. The United Nations Security Council looks set to meet on January 30 to discuss the break-up of the Soviet Union and the role of the UN in the post-Cold War era. The meeting is partly intended to allay western concerns about command and control of nuclear weapons and proliferation risks. A broader aim, however, is to reinforce the authority of Mr Boutros Ghali, the new secretary-general.</p>

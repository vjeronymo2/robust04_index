			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Vithun: "It Is Time for the Government To </F> Firm Up Its Legitimate Authority"]    [Text] In light of the latest developments, it is  apparently time for the royal government to firm up its  legitimate authority to stimulate the people's confidence;  otherwise, it will face scores of complicated problems and even  difficulties in its existence.    Everyone knows that so far, there has been a tendency  seemingly to tie up the government's limbs, preventing it from  doing anything while the Khmer Rouge continues its violation and  destruction against innocent people.    Analysts of the Cambodian situation say that the government  has suffered a serious defeat in its psychological warfare.  When it counterattacks the Khmer Rouge in the wake of the  latter's onslaught, the government instead has been accused of  being a warmonger. It is certain that defeat in the  psychological war can lead the government to other failures. It  is also certain that only after the government suffers a real  defeat will the people realize that they, themselves, are the  real losers; however, it then will be too late. This being the  case, it is a must for the government to change this situation  urgently by making the people clearly understand that the  government's victory is also the victory of each of them.    It is ironic that the Khmer Rouge and its supporters, who  oppose the government, are able to live in government-controlled  regions throughout the country. Nevertheless, the Khmer  Rouge-held areas are completely safe -- there are neither Khmer  Rouge opponents nor demonstrations calling for an end to the  nonsensical Khmer Rouge war. In view of this, the government is  facing two problems, namely the problem of the Khmer Rouge  outside and the problem of the Khmer Rouge inside.    It is expected that in "the step toward reinforcing its  legitimate authority," the government will begin to crack down  on corruption which is most abhorrent to the people in general.  Along with this, it should restrengthen its police, army,  guards, and state authorities in order to effectively ensure  security, order, and safety in society and to circumvent the  Khmer Rouge's sabotage activities. This is part of the earnest  request of the people.    Another issue of life and death is that if it does not want  to dissolve itself, the government, with the massive strength of  the two major political parties, should review the alliance  between the two parties by taking into consideration the  nation's interests above all.    It is perfectly rational that the government should firm up  its legitimate authority at a time when the Khmer Rouge is  consolidating its clout against the law. Somehow, what is most  important is that the government should be in a quest for the  people's support as well.</p>

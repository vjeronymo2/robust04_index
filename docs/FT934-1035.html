			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (6): Pension system is a time bomb - Welfare Sweden's huge welfare state - built up during the booming years of the 1950s and 1960s - is under enormous strain. The demands of people on the social security system based on universalist principles of provision have grown dramatically in recent years while economic growth has stagnated. More than 60 per cent of Sweden's gross domestic product is accounted for by the needs of the public sector,the highest proportion of any country in the world and a substantial part of it is accounted for by social expenditure after debt repayments. Swedes have been talking about the cost 'crisis' of their welfare state for nearly 10 years. It was in 1986 that the LO blue-collar union federation pronounced at its congress that public expenditure should not grow any higher as a percentage of gross domestic product in order to meet the needs of the citizen. The ruling Social Democrats at the time said they were determined to improve the productive efficiency of the existing welfare system. There was a new emphasis on consumer choice to break down the rigidities of state services that were over-bureaucratic. Some market-oriented Social Democrats began to argue that society and the state were no longer synonymous and people should be encouraged to take more responsibility for their own well-being. But their commitment to reform was still tempered by a desire to uphold the principle of equality of access for all to the welfare state through universalistic programmes. However, the twin pressures of rising consumer demands on increasingly limited resources and accelerating costs in a stagnant economy forced more radical discussion across the political spectrum by the early 1990s. An attack by Sweden's vociferous band of neo-liberals has made little progress among the policy makers. Even inside the ruling Moderate party, social conservatives seem to be much more influential than their economic liberally minded colleagues when it comes to discussions on the welfare state. Mr Bengt Westerberg, minister of social affairs and leader of the Liberal party, remains an eloquent champion of the verities of the Swedish system and it is hard to see any frontal assault against the welfare state succeeding with him in the cabinet. The two other parties in the coalition government - the Centre and the Christian Democrats - are strong believers in the Swedish way of social provision. Security and caring remain key words in the language of contemporary Swedish politics. Any political leader who campaigned to tear down the existing system in the name of individual freedom would suffer severe defeat at the polls. But this does not mean that a drastic shake-up will not come in the very near future to public services that used to be the envy of the world. The return of mass unemployment to Sweden has brought a new and added cost burden to the welfare state that seems likely to grow over the next few years adding to the size of the public sector deficit. Over the past three years successive governments have been forced by the demands of the global economy to trim around the edges of welfare spending. There have been cuts in sickness benefit entitlements, for example, despite often stiff domestic resistance from the powerful public sector interest groups. More fundamental reforms are also being planned, especially for the provision of health care. In September last year, agreement was reached in principle between all the main political parties in a crisis package designed to defend the fixed exchange rate of the krona to take both sickness and work injury insurance out of the state budget and put its funding and administration in the hands of the social partners-employers and unions. It was suggested this move could come from the mid-1990s but the implications of such a radical change remain unclear. Many conservatives believe this would pave the way for the rapid growth of private insurance schemes to replace the state system. Social Democrats see the move as a sensible way of providing a new and enhanced role for the trade unions. The future of the pension system is a time bomb ticking away at the heart of the Swedish welfare state as Swedes grow older and the existing means of financing pensions becomes increasingly difficult to sustain. The scope for more private and occupational pension schemes seems likely to grow as the state provision fails to ensure the country's pensioners maintain a reasonable standard of living.</p>

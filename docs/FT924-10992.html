			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Army contract goes to Saab A Pounds 40M CONTRACT to provide the British Army with laser equipment to simulate firing has been awarded to the Saab group of Sweden. Saab was chosen in preference to Loral Solartron, a subsidiary of the US Loral group, which provides similar equipment for US forces. Royal Ordnance, the British Aerospace subsidiary, and GEC-Marconi, offering a French system, were both eliminated at an earlier stage of the competition. However, Royal Ordnance is expected to supply small-arms training equipment under the Saab contract. The equipment is designed to reduce the amount of live firing carried out by troops in training. The Ministry of Defence said it would bring 'cost savings and benefits for the environment'. The project involves laser projectors attached to a range of weapons including tanks, anti-tank missiles and guns. Each 'hit' is recorded by receivers carried by individual troops or vehicles. Options for extra realism include sound effects and puffs of smoke. Battlefield exchanges during exercises can subsequently be replayed and performance analysed.</p>

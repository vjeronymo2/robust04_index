			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Hurd doubts on Hong Kong talks The depth of official concern over Hong Kong was underlined yesterday when Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, admitted that existing machinery for discussing with Beijing the colony's reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 was inadequate. Mr Hurd, at the end of a two-day visit to Hong Kong, said Britain and China needed to be 'imaginative' in finding ways to accelerate the work of the Joint Liaison Group, a body established in 1984 to oversee the detail of Hong Kong's reversion to China. 'If present procedures need adaptation, if work can be done in a different way in order to accelerate it, in order that purely technical matters can be dealt with without a political overtone - well, this is something the two sides can discuss,' he said. It was not readily apparent what imaginative steps the two sides could take to accelerate work in the JLG. Mr Hurd met the British and Chinese representatives to the JLG yesterday. After the meeting, Mr Hugh Davies, Britain's senior representative to the body, said both sides would look at ways to speed progress at next week's plenary session of the JLG in Beijing. There is, however, deepening concern among British and Hong Kong officials that the JLG will not be able to complete its work by 1997. Next week's meeting is taking place against a background of diminishing expectations; on present trends the colony runs the risk that many statutes will be invalid after China takes over because they have not been 'localised'. Mr Allen Lee, a conservative politician, said Mr Hurd during a meeting with legislators had spoken of 'an imperfect transition' because of the lack of progress in the JLG. The foreign secretary also told legislators that 1997 marked the end of British Empire and that Britain did not want to see it end in a 'shabby way'. Mr Hurd will meet Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, in New York the week after next. The Chinese government has already sought to play down the significance of the meeting. The foreign secretary said he would tell Mr Qian Britain was serious about co-operating with China on Hong Kong matters. Both sides had a legal commitment to do so and had a shared interest in seeing the colony enjoyed a smooth transition to Chinese sovereignty. Hong Kong will force 82 Vietnamese asylum seekers to return home next week, it said yesterday, resuming a controversial policy suspended after police tear-gassed protesting Vietnamese in April, AP reports from Hong Kong. Human rights groups condemned the announcement, as Vietnamese in detention continued a hunger strike in protest at forced repatriations.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] In Morelos State on 10 April, Mexican President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari presided over the 75th anniversary  commemorating the death of southern caudillo Emiliano Zapata.    Thousands of peasants attended the commemoration. Salinas  pledged to do more justice to the Mexican peasant sector and  vowed to reverse the peasants' isolation and poverty. He said  the ejido will be reinforced as the fundamental expression of  social property in the country.    [Begin Salinas recording] We will do it, because Zapata's  struggle is alive. Zapata lives and keeps fighting and demanding  more justice, more respect, and more consideration for Mexican  peasants. [end recording]    In Morelos, Zapata's birthplace, Salinas said changes to  constitutional Article 27 meet the peasants' demand for legal  ownership of their lands and freedom to work them.    [Begin Salinas recording] Large land owners will not  reappear. They have already disappeared from our homeland's  history. [end recording]    Salinas delivered checks for direct aid to peasants for the  1993 to 1994 fall-winter crop cycle. Financial aid was  delivered to 35,000 peasants throughout the country. Under the  Prorural Areas Program, more than 100 million pesos have been  doled out so far to assist 82,000 peasants. Salinas handed over  ejido rights certificates and spoke about the agricultural  sector's due loans, 70 percent of which will be refinanced with  commercial banks. The president stressed the importance of  these measures but admitted they are not enough.    [Begin Salinas recording] We must reverse the isolation and  poverty we are still confronting in many rural areas. [end  recording]</p>

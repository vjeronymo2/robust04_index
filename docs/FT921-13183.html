			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Survey of Cheshire (1): A tussle over growth - Though the county outperforms much of the rest of the north in productivity levels, both of the major parties in the area, in spite of government opposition, favour new developments within the green belt near Chester to ensure economic growth THE GOVERNMENT is trying to stop market forces doing quite as well as they should in Cheshire, a small corner of England next door to North Wales. The county is falling victim to its own success. A row is boiling up about 800 acres of green belt near Chester, which both the Conservative and Labour parties on the county council want for economic development. The Liberal Democrats are against. So is the government at present, on the grounds that denying Chester will force investment into Merseyside, Cheshire's underperforming neighbour. Majority local opinion is that the government has failed to understand the precarious nature of Cheshire's success and its patchiness. In any event, can you make Merseyside richer by making Cheshire poorer? Part of the problem is the county's image. Much of it is bucolic, dotted with ancient halls, old black-and-white timber-framed houses, the remnants of two royal forests, country pubs, villages with upmarket boutiques and antique shops, gourmet restaurants, country house hotels, BMWs, Mercedes estate cars, Range Rovers, Land Rover Discoveries and Mitsubishi Shoguns. This is the Surrey-of-the-north, where house prices in villages near Macclesfield rival those of the south-east and have held up better in the recession. It is also a county that outperforms much of the rest of north in productivity levels and value added in manufacturing - but mainly because it has a large concentration of capital-intensive chemical industry. It is a place where many people in Greater Manchester and Merseyside want to live. The population grew nearly 3 per cent in the 1980s. Though much was the forced growth of Warrington New Town in the former no-man's-land between Liverpool and Manchester, there was a steady gain of up to 2 per cent in five of Cheshire's other seven districts. Numbers will probably pass the 1m mark by the end of the century. In Chester's case, the workforce is forecast to grow by more than 7 per cent in the next 10 years, so the city and district will need more jobs. Cheshire's most recent success is Vauxhall Motors at Ellesmere Port. This once had the hallmarks of a branch factory forced into place by government regional policy. An underskilled workforce and poor equipment confined its goods to the less critical domestic market. Now, Pounds 150m in new investment - plus Pounds 200m over three years for an engine plant - has given General Motors one of its best plants in Europe. Vauxhall is at present building up production of the new Astra, 35 per cent of which will be exported. This year's output of 138,000 cars is assured, rising to 145,000 next year. 'People have made all the difference,' says Mr Nick Reilly, the man in charge. 'We have better training. There is more awareness of quality. We run in teams, with team leaders responsible for quality.' However, the factory also runs with only 4,700 people, compared with 11,000 in 1980. It is this sort of fall-out that has to be absorbed elsewhere - and in a county where people are arriving all the time. Another success is the Manchester Ship Canal. Although Manchester's dockland has been transformed into a village called Salford Quays, Cheshire's is still a string of working wharves, terminals and docks along the canal between Ellesmere Port and Warrington. The abolition of the national dock labour scheme in 1989 transformed productivity and profitability. Bulk traffic includes containers, chemicals, timber, foodstuffs and even draught Guinness. In the south of the county, Foden was the first UK truck manufacturer to reach the BS5750 quality standard and is producing a series of new, award-winning 17-tonners at Sandbach. Paccar, its US owner, has just spent Pounds 4.5m on a new headquarters and engineering centre there, relocating its European office from Brussels in the process. In the east, Siemens has burst at the seams in Congleton and has opened another centre just over the county boundary near Manchester Airport, an economic engine that does not recognise boundaries and drives growth in Cheshire's Macclesfield district as much as in southern half of Greater Manchester. Warrington, only 20 minutes away from the airport by motorway, has also benefited. Its two science parks are full. The headquarters of British Nuclear Fuels - a major buyer of technologically-based design and engineering services - is the most notable presence. Motorways have made the centre of Cheshire into the centre of Britain from a time-to-travel standpoint. About 95 per cent of the population is within a half-day's travel, so distribution and warehousing companies have mushroomed at Warrington, creating thousands of jobs. Office rents in Wilmslow, next door to the airport but in Cheshire, are the north-west's highest. The move there from Manchester city centre of Refuge Assurance four years ago confirmed the area's prestige. However, all this has caused an east-west divide, for Cheshire has generally done better where it borders Greater Manchester than where it borders Merseyside. Widnes and Runcorn comprise Halton district, which borders Liverpool and Knowsley, and have enough urban problems to qualify for City Challenge regeneration funding from the government. The district of Ellesmere Port and Neston - sandwiched between Chester and Wirral, another Merseyside borough - is depopulating faster than anywhere else in Cheshire. The staple industry of these two districts is chemicals, with ICI, Shell and Associated Octel contributing to a forest of columns, chimneys and plant along the southern bank of the ship canal from Ellesmere Port to Runcorn. Shell's investment in its Stanlow refinery alone is more than Pounds 1bn. Politicised environmentalism is taking its toll, with tougher legislation and enforcement leading to fines for pollution, including Pounds 1m on Shell for a broken pipeline. Public confidence in the industry has not been reassured by a series of alerts and mishaps, including leaks of toxic gases and chemicals and an explosion and fire, in the last two years. Uncertainty therefore clouds the industry's future and no one is predicting growth in jobs. Meanwhile, Mr Michael Pitt, Cheshire's chief executive, points to growing worries about the recession's effect on Crewe, where Rolls-Royce Motors and Brel, the rail locomotive engineers, are large employers. He says Cheshire is going to need all the new development it can get. 'There is a good case for more incursion into the green belt. Both the Conservatives and the Labour party believe the government is getting it wrong,' he says. The land involved is within the new ring road which by- passes Chester to the south. This road not only links with the M56 and M53 to the north and east, but with a new dual carriageway to Wrexham - only 10 miles from Chester to the south - and with the upgraded road to the North Wales coast to the west. Welsh local authorities support Chester's expansion because it will help its re-emergence as a sub-regional centre. Indeed, the economic and social forces involved take no account of the English-Welsh border, however wide the gulf between the Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office. A new tunnel at Conwy puts Anglesey only 90 minutes from Chester, while much of north-east Wales is now within easy commuting distance of Manchester. The local view is that if Cheshire cannot be looked at in isolation from Merseyside, why should it be isolated from Wales, now a more important long-term neighbour, especially with the Toyota plant on Chester's boundary with Shotton? Manweb, the electricity supplier, sees the Chester-Wrexham-Deeside area as part of a steady long-term development, in which its commercial sales to offices will grow at 4 per cent a year, compared with 2 per cent for industrial usage and 1 per cent on the domestic front, with Cheshire and North Wales continuing to compensate for Merseyside decline. Mr Les Rogerson, the county council's group director of environmental services, sums up the majority local feeling: 'We question whether the government understands what kind of county Cheshire is. 'The image is rural, with black-and-white houses and black-and-white cows, but 60 per cent of people live in towns and 20 per cent live in smaller places like Knutsford. We are trying to ensure economic growth in parts of Cheshire that need it. Stopping development here will not push it into Merseyside. It will probably go to Germany.'</p>

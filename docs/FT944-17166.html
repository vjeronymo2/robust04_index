			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Trouble ahead for the CAP It is one of the European Union's quainter superstitions that the Common Agricultural Policy has quasi-magical staying power. Squeezed by budgetary stringency, bombarded in transatlantic trade wars, riven with internal contradictions of all kinds, the policy cruises on regardless. Its powerful defenders - in the European Commission's agricultural directorate and in Europe's farm lobbies - speak as if its existence, and its virtues, were synonymous with those of the Union itself. If the warnings emanating from some authoritative quarters in recent weeks are any guide, however, such confidence in Europe's farm policy is in for a shaking. On the one hand, the Union is still struggling to absorb the reforms introduced in the early 1990s by farm commissioner Ray MacSharry. On the other, it faces new pressures resulting from its commitment to take in members from central Europe. An independent report published by the Commission late last month recommended wholesale CAP reform to prepare the EU for further enlargement. Last week, the UK National Farmers Union warned that without fundamental change in the CAP, enlargement could stretch it to breaking point and even cause the demise of the EU. Biting reforms Warnings of this kind may sound odd only two years into a major CAP reform. But in truth the MacSharry changes - under which farmers are paid to 'set aside' a given proportion of their arable land from production, and EU prices are reduced - have only bought time for the EU and curbed the excesses that threatened a trade war with the US. The reforms are biting, to the perverse extent that grain shortages have recently forced internal EU prices up; the Commission was moved last week to propose a minor relaxation of the set-aside regime. But the MacSharry changes are no answer to the problems which will be posed by enlargement. Unless it carefully prepares for this challenge now, the EU could face a serious crisis over agriculture in 1996, when the MacSharry reforms run out, as the desire for further enlargement collides with an inability to manage or finance it. Such a crisis would complicate the fraught constitutional debate due to take place in the inter-governmental conference set for that year. At worst it could derail what is arguably the EU's most important strategic task: stabilising the countries to its east, and spreading its own prosperity. Price supports The problem lies in the CAP's price support measures, under which EU farmers are paid more than world market levels for their produce. Extending such price supports to farmers in, say, Poland would almost certainly cause a production explosion, growth of unsaleable surpluses and consequent trade conflicts, and the collapse of the EU budget. On the other hand, excluding Poland and the other Visegrad countries from as central an EU policy as the CAP - either altogether or for a protracted transition period - is unlikely to be politically feasible. Hence the urgent need to consider more radical CAP reform. One option, suggested in a paper produced for the Commission by independent experts in June, would be to lower EU support prices to a level that covers only core production costs, establish a standard level of support prices in the eastern European countries and bridge the gap between the two by means of export refunds and import duties. Another would be to scrap or phase out all EU price support and replace it with some other form of social aid, decoupled from production. These are not arcane or remote questions. Such adjustment will be necessary even without full EU membership on the part of the central European countries. For if the Union's promises to dismantle trade barriers with these states are to mean anything, it will have to let in more of their farm produce, creating greater competition for the farmers of western Europe. That in turn is why some EU governments are seriously mistaken if they think these issues will go away. Germany, for one, will be forced to address them as a result of its own strong commitment to bringing its central European neighbours into the Union. If the price of doing so is CAP reform, it will have to be paid.</p>

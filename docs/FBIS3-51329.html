			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] After expressing his sympathies to relatives of the  victims of the helicopter crash, President Fujimori said no  possibilities can be rejected in cases of this sort and would  not rule out sabotage as the cause of the accident. Fujimori  added that his government will not reconsider the sanctions  imposed on Chilean MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]  members.    [Begin recording] [Fujimori] I reject the report saying that  the helicopter crash was caused by a fuel shortage or poor  maintenance. Accidents of this sort happen by chance and are  regrettable. They must be investigated in a strictly technical  manner. The Air Force has appointed an investigative commission  to investigate the accident. The reasons for the crash  helicopter must be clearly outlined, because according to the  control tower, the helicopter was landing as usual with no  problems.    [Unidentified reporter] Is it possible to investigate the  reasons for a possible sabotage of this helicopter?    [Fujimori] No possibilities can or should be ruled out. I  had even planned to fly to Cuzco before going to Arequipa. I  flew with the crew of that helicopter a week ago and everything  was normal. I think this was a rather unexpected event. The  investigations must be thorough to eliminate all possibilities  other than technical or circumstantial reasons.    Regarding the Chilean MRTA members, they did not perpetrate  these hideous crimes in Chile but in Peru, and they have been  sentenced to life imprisonment. I reiterate: I will not  reverse my position. They have been tried according to  antiterrorist laws. The Peruvian position on this is clear:  Peru has a right to peace.    [Reporter] Will the sentences be reconsidered?    [Fujimori] Not at all. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] has received  an invitation from the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] to begin  coalition negotiations. The SZDSZ leaders may receive  authorization at tomorrow's party convention to begin  negotiations. Judit Laszlo reports on today's National Council  session.    [Laszlo] The SZDSZ National Council has accepted the  executive's proposal that tomorrow's convention should give  authorization to begin coalition negotiations, said SZDSZ  Chairman Ivan Petoe. However, the delegation--that consists of  Ivan Petoe, Gabor Kuncze, Peter Hack, and Balint Magyar--can  only sign a coalition agreement if it receives guarantees that  on the one hand, the SZDSZ can substantively influence the  government's policies, which are to be worked out jointly, and  on the other, it can implement its 25-point coalition guidelines  to an appropriate degree.    In line with previous plans, a subsequent convention will  decide on the draft of the coalition pact--on its acceptance or  refusal. The SZDSZ's Executive and National Council request  authorization from tomorrow's extraordinary convention to begin  the coalition talks because the trust that the voters put in the  party obliges the party to do so, said Ivan Petoe, giving a  reason for the decision. He also said that in accordance with  the liberal parties cooperation agreement, the SZDSZ will inform  the Federation of Young Democrats about beginning coalition  talks with the MSZP.    It transpires from MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn's letter to Ivan  Petoe that the political and legal guarantees of the coalition  will also be discussed at the negotiations. The SZDSZ chairman  said in connection with this that all this was in line with the  SZDSZ's condition that the SZDSZ wishes to effectively influence  the policy of the coalition government.</p>

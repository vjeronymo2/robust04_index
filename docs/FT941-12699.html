			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: CDollars 532m loss at BCE reflects one-off charges BCE, the Canadian telecommunications group, suffered a fourth-quarter loss of CDollars 532m (USDollars 405m), or CDollars 1.73 per common share. This compared with profit of CDollars 505m, or CDollars 1.65, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 5.6bn, little changed. The loss, which had been expected, reflected heavy one-off charges, including BCE's share of write-downs at its Northern Telecom subsidiary. For the full year, BCE recorded a loss of CDollars 750m, or CDollars 2.44, against a profit of CDollars 1.29bn, or CDollars 4.21, a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 19.8bn, up slightly. For the year, BCE also took heavy losses on discontinued operations, including two property units and the sale of Montreal Trustco. The contribution of BCE's main business unit, 100 per cent-owned Bell Canada, was lower for the year because of the recession. Profits at Shell Canada dropped to CDollars 5m, or 5 cents a share, after special items in the fourth quarter of 1993, from CDollars 92m or 83 cents a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 1.23bn, little changed. For the full year, final profit was CDollars 18m, or 16 cents a share, against CDollars 80m, or 72 cents, on revenues of CDollars 4.7bn, against CDollars 4.5bn. The company has brought its Caroline natural gas field into production in Alberta, and paid CDollars 240m for two downstream acquisitions.</p>

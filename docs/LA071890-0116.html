			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TWILIGHT ZONE': A WORD FROM THE PRODUCER;  </P> <P> DEATHS: FRANK MARSHALL, WHO NEVER TESTIFIED ABOUT THE TRAGEDY THAT KILLED  THREE, SAYS, 'IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.'  </P> <P> Frank Marshall, who is making his directing debut with "Arachnophobia," was one  of those present on the set of "Twilight Zone -- The Movie" the night in 1982  when a camera helicopter crashed and killed actor Vic Morrow and two immigrant  Asian children that Marshall knew were illegally employed by the film company.  </P> <P> A longtime associate of Steven Spielberg, Marshall was the executive producer  of "Twilight Zone" and in the years leading up to the 1987 criminal trial of  director John Landis and four associates, Marshall was repeatedly sought by the  Los Angeles district attorney's office to testify.  </P> <P> While Marshall himself was not indicted in the case, deputy district attorney  Gilbert Garcetti told reporters after the trial that his office made "every  effort possible to subpoena Frank Marshall but he was able to get out of our  hands."  </P> <P> Marshall, who signed the petty cash checks paid to the parents of the two Asian  children before their deaths, never did testify and until now has never  responded to questions about his knowledge of "Twilight Zone" events or his  refusal to testify. Asked to comment on those matters during an interview for  "Arachnophobia," Marshall called the stories about his alleged evasion of  subpoenas "all hype. There's no truth to it at all."  </P> <P> Marshall said he was busy throughout the pre-trial investigations on "The  Twilight Zone" case, and blamed investigators for not reaching him in the  beginning.  </P> <P> "Actually I was here (Los Angeles) a long time, two years, and nobody ever  talked to me," Marshall said. "Then we went off to England and made 'Empire of  the Sun,' 'Roger Rabbit' and 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.' So I lived  in London, and the time most of the trial was going on, we were in China  (filming 'Empire of the Sun').  </P> <P> "So, I was inaccessible. And I didn't really feel that I had anything to add  that wasn't already out there, than what had already been revealed."  </P> <P> Marshall said the accident itself was a terrible tragedy that "was terrible and  horrible for everybody. But it was an accident. Which is eventually what the  jury decided." SEAN MITCHELL  </P></p>

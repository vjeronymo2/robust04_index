			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAUL JASPERSON, FIRST TO TEST LAW IN W. HOLLYWOOD BARRING AIDS BIAS  </P> <P> Paul Jasperson, an AIDS victim who two years ago sued a West Hollywood nail  salon that refused him a pedicure, died last week, his attorney said Monday.  </P> <P> Gloria Allred said her client was 37 and died May 15 in Los Angeles after  battling acquired immune deficiency syndrome for several years.  </P> <P> Jasperson had filed suit against Jessica's Nail Salon in January, 1987,  charging violation of a West Hollywood ordinance that prohibits discrimination  against AIDS victims. Jasperson's case, Allred said, was the first legal test  of the ordinance in a civil case. Although a court found that the nail salon  did refuse the pedicure, it refused to issue an injunction barring the business  from discriminating.  </P> <P> The civil action, which has drawn support from the cities of West Hollywood,  Los Angeles, Santa Monica and the American Civil Liberties Union, is being  appealed. A settlement in a separate discrimination action filed by West  Hollywood was reached in March.  </P> <P> Allred called Jasperson "one of the most courageous people I have ever known"  who proceeded with the lawsuit "at great risk to his own health . . . in order  to help to win rights for others." She vowed to pursue the appeal despite his  death.  </P> <P> Jasperson was a native of Minneapolis who came to West Hollywood in 1975, where  he became a hair stylist and activist for gay causes.  </P> <P> Survivors include his parents and two brothers.  </P> <P> A memorial service will be held Saturday at 1:30 at the Old North Church,  Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills.  </P></p>

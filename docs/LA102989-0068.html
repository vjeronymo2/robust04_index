			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> LANDMARK CASE IS A GIANT STEP BACKWARD;  </P> <P> EPILEPSY: MANY PEOPLE STILL LINK THE DISEASE TO INSANITY, VIOLENCE, LACK OF  INTELLIGENCE, EVEN POSSESSION BY DEMONS.  </P> <P> In a so-called landmark case, jurors recently held a local neurologist  responsible -- to the tune of $3.14 million -- for his epileptic patient's auto  accident. What may be considered landmark by some, especially the plaintiff's  attorney, actually represents a giant step backward for my son and the other 2  million or more Americans (23,000 in San Diego County alone) who have epilepsy.  </P> <P> As a group, people with epilepsy (please do not categorize them as epileptics)  have had to fight and claw their way out of the dark ages of public  misinformation and superstition. This verdict, which is full of flaws anyway,  promises to set them back considerably in this county, state, even nation.  </P> <P> And the timing couldn't be worse for my son Matt, who looks forward to applying  for his driver's license on his 16th birthday next month. Before this case  reached the courts and the media, we assumed the license was practically in his  wallet.  </P> <P> After two nightmare years of trying five different anticonvulsants, Matt now  takes a medication that has controlled his seizures for 26 months -- a good 20  months longer than the standard generally applied by the California Department  of Motor Vehicles.  </P> <P> We understood the licensing process might take a little longer for Matt because  the DMV would contact his neurologist and possibly require an interview before  granting a license. Now, thanks to the chilling effect that this case is bound  to have on everyone involved, the process might take a lot longer or stall  completely.  </P> <P> As parents, we add this new concern about a driver's license to all our other  fears about his future. In this so-called Age of Information, many people still  link epilepsy to insanity, violence, lack of intelligence, even possession by  demons.  </P> <P> We are not alone in our concern about the right to drive, says Margaret Holt,  executive director of the Epilepsy Society of San Diego. She reports a dramatic  increase in phone calls from people in a panic over their own driving future in  this transportation wasteland.  </P> <P> "The natural fallout from this verdict will be that everyone involved will  exercise extreme caution," Holt says.  </P> <P> Holt fears that this verdict may even lead us back to a time when there was a  mandatory three-year waiting period in California for anyone with a seizure  disorder. Such a lengthy waiting period makes no sense at a time when the vast  majority of people with epilepsy can expect to have their seizures controlled  completely by modern medication.  </P> <P> We can only hope that the DMV will continue to look at the individual rather  than the category, while also taking into account the relevant accident  statistics. According to a survey of traffic accidents in the United States and  Western Europe, conducted by Dr. James A. Trostle of UC Berkeley, people with  epilepsy have no greater risk of being involved in auto accidents than people  with heart disease, stroke, diabetes and alcoholism. The only reason Trostle  can find for stricter regulations for people with epilepsy is lingering social  discrimination.  </P> <P> One of his most interesting findings is that only 27% of the auto accidents  involving people with epilepsy were actually caused by seizures. In this local  case, there is serious doubt about whether 18-year-old Trudy Stevenson's  epilepsy had anything to do with her accident.  </P> <P> Although her attorney spent an inordinate amount of trial time trying to prove  a seizure caused the accident, the jury remained unconvinced. How, then, can  they possibly hold her neurologist accountable for the accident? Have we gone  so far beyond the notion of personal responsibility that a doctor can be held  liable for every action his patient takes?  </P> <P> Take that "logic" a little further, and the optometrist is responsible for his  patient who fails to wear prescription eyeglasses while at the wheel, the  cellular telephone manufacturer for the driver who fails to pay attention while  dialing, the cosmetic company for the woman putting on her mascara in the  rear-view mirror.  </P> <P> The logical lapses in this "landmark" verdict should be exposed in the planned  appeal, but that will not be in time for Matt's birthday. So far, he's faced  seizures, medication changes, regular blood drawings, hospital stays and one  diagnostic test after another with surprising equanimity. We hope this verdict  won't make him face being one of the only 16-year-olds in Southern California  who can't drive.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Andjelko Perincic] </F>   [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and  foreign minister, and Charles Redman, U.S. President Bill  Clinton's special envoy, held talks in Zagreb this afternoon.  The talks focused on the implementation of the principles  governing the constitutional set-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina and a  possible confederation with Croatia.    After the talks the U.S. official declared: To my mind we  made an enormous amount of progress compared to what had been  achieved in Washington. Many things still remain to be done.  This awaits both the U.S. Administration and the Croatian  Government but I must point out that we are not alone in  fulfilling this task -- we have the backing of the European  Union or, more precisely, most of that region, and the other  peoples in Bosnia. In view of all this we can optimistically  believe that we are on the right track. However, we are facing  hard work if we are to work to the benefit of Croatia and  Bosnia, to the benefit of Europe and the United States. As for  my talks in Belgrade, this was only a preliminary meeting  because right now we are focusing on the issue of the Bosnian  Croats and the Bosnian government. Nevertheless we are studying  possibilities that would be acceptable to all three sides in  Bosnia and to the entire region. It is certain that we will  first have to resolve the existing territorial differences by  political means, Redman concluded.    Croatian Minister Mate Granic also made a brief assessment:    [Begin Granic recording] The Vienna negotiations are  proceeding well and I believe that we will round off the next  stage on time. Likewise, we can see the first tangible results  in the field. We are closely collaborating with the European  Union and, as you know, I will be leaving for Moscow tomorrow,  where I will have the opportunity to exchange views with my  colleague, Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.  [end recording]    [Perincic] Charles Redman will be received by the President  of the Republic of Croatia, Franjo Tudjman, this evening.</p>

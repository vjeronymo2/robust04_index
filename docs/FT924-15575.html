			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Pension for a widow MY HUSBAND worked in London from 1957 to 1973. He then moved back to Ireland and died there in 1989. Am I entitled to the English widow's pension? Your husband would have been required by law to contribute to the UK state social security system during his period of employment in the UK. To find out what widow's state pension rights are available, you should write to the Department of Social Security, Central Pensions Branch, Newcastle upon Tyne NE98 lYX. You should quote your husband's UK National Insurance number if you know this. If not, you should ask the Irish social security authorities if they can provide any information that will help to trace his UK social security record. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the CDU/CSU </F> Bundestag group, by Dieter Schroeder and Stefan Kornelius; place  and date not given: "`It Would Be Mistake To Do Without Kohl's  Leadership Power'"]    [Text] Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian  Democratic Union /Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag  group, opened the new year with warnings: In the Bundestag  group and in other bodies of the party, he repeatedly pointed to  surveys that showed disastrous results for the CDU. The party  was giving the outward impression of lacking solidarity, and it  appears to be lacking initiative and optimism at the beginning  of a series of elections. Schaeuble urged for a rapid change.  Instead of internal disputes, the CDU should concentrate on the  opposition and reemphasize its authority in the spheres of  economic and labor policy, internal and external security, and  the family. Dieter Schroeder and Stefan Kornelius conducted the  following interview with Schaeuble:    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] At the weekend, the CDU Federal  Executive Committee will hold a meeting behind closed doors to  discuss election strategies, among other issues. Do you have an  idea of how to lead the CDU out of its current low?    [Schaeuble] In this super election year, the CDU is facing  the question of what strategy to meet the challenges. In the  meeting, the CDU will, of course, also nominate its candidate to  succeed Richard von Weizsaecker. As far as the political  situation is concerned, one must not forget that the government  and the coalition have made enormous achievements following the  profound changes in Germany and Europe. Yet, these changes have  also created insecurity, and those who bear political  responsibility must now concentrate on those political spheres  of action that are really of priority in order to eliminate any  unclear points in the public debate and the apparent or actual  controversies within our own camp.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] How would you describe these spheres  of action?    [Schaeuble] We must effectively strengthen economic growth  and create more jobs; we must take care of external security.  The people clearly feel dangers that are emanating from Bosnia  to Russia. They feel that peace has not been absolutely ensured  for either the present or the future.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Would you like to endorse yourself as  the party that is taking care of Germany's security?    [Schaeuble] We will definitely increasingly emphasize our  responsibility regarding foreign and security policy. After  all, that is also the decisive reason that, despite certain  understandable criticism of many details of European  developments, we quite rightly maintain the conviction that the  path toward integration in the European Union and the Atlantic  Alliance must remain irreversible, for, in the center of Europe,  it will only be through stronger integration that the united  Germany will be able to gain a safe future in peace and freedom.  The sphere of internal security is of equal importance. The  fourth area, the family, that is to say the voluntary solidarity  between the generations, is also a central issue for the  stability of our liberal and social system.    We will not only be judged by the diversity of the proposals  and concepts, but the people expect decisions and action from  us. This is why a controversy or the appearance of controversy  within the coalition is a particular nuisance, which, if in  doubt, will be to the disadvantage of all coalition partners,  but most certainly to the disadvantage of the senior partner.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Are you referring to the controversy  with the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] over the bugging  of suspected criminals' private homes?    [Schaeuble] With the 1994 anticrime law, which the  government  and the coalition are now bringing along, we agreed with the FDP  on a whole series of measures -- agreement that was considered  impossible in the coalition only a year ago. There is growing  understanding that freedom at home might crumble. What is true  is that we do remain at odds on one issue, and that is the issue  of the electronic monitoring of private homes. We regard this  as imperative, while our FDP colleagues -- they are bound by an  opposing party congress resolution -- are not yet prepared to  change their position. Nevertheless, I am very optimistic that,  in the medium-term, the FDP will change its position, because it  must. Just think of the long debate on the asylum law, where we  can see today that we were right to insist on our position.  Nevertheless, as long as there is no agreement, there is a  danger that disagreement on one point, one that is actually not  crucial, forces everything else into the background. After all,  disagreement makes better news and as long as we are in the  law-making process, the things that are changing are incredibly  difficult to get across to others. Let us take the debate on  the amendment of the asylum law: Until last summer this was an  issue where one side said that it meant the end of freedom. The  others said that such an amendment would not change anything.  Half a year later, and after it was implemented, one can see  that, first, a sufficient number of persecuted and suffering  persons still find shelter in Germany. One cannot say that the  doors have been closed. On the other hand, the amendment did  have its effect, with numbers clearly dropping, and procedures  having been speeded up. The most important effect was that the  relationship between German and foreign citizens has once again  become more relaxed and less strained.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The CSU seems to be thinking  differently and intends to bring up the issue again.    [Schaeuble] If you will permit me to say so, I understood  the  CSU differently. I think that there are many persons in the CSU  who say -- which is undeniable -- that the new asylum law  regulation has produced a significant decrease in the number of  asylum-seekers, faster procedures, and more cases of  deportation. Thus, it has been useful. Of course, one cannot  say now that the problem has been completely solved. After all,  there can be developments outside our borders that might once  again lead to dramatic developments. Therefore, the continued  concern for the stability of our liberal law-governed state, the  citizens' trust in the ability of the state to protect them  remains an important issue also for the elections, whether in  the campaign to the Bavarian Landtag, the European election, or  the Bundestag election -- there is no difference between the CDU  and CSU here.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Does this not mean that you are  fanning fears?    [Schaeuble] No. The question of how we deal with the fact  that there is such a huge -- economical, political, and social  -- gap in Europe today, which might escalate to violence and  enormous conflicts in no time, has to be foremost in our  thoughts. This issue is not only part of the public discussion  in Germany because it does worry people. I have said that the  way in which the world is developing, the borders between  internal and external security will get increasingly blurred.  One has to take these concerns seriously. However, these  concerns also include our ambition to maintain and improve  peaceful, relaxed, and friendly coexistence between Germans and  foreign fellow citizens in Germany.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] By constantly referring to internal  security, one gets the impression that, despite the failed first  attempt, you intend to stick to the issue of using the  Bundeswehr for tasks at home.    [Schaeuble] I predict that the issue will remain high on the  agenda until it is solved in the way I proposed. It will take  some time, because it requires a Basic Law amendment, which, due  to the refusal of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD],  cannot be achieved overnight. However, this does not change the  fact that the issue has to be discussed. What is it all about?  Well, the point is not to create new tasks for the Bundeswehr.  Actually, the expression: Bundeswehr missions at home is also  quite misleading. The real point is that situations may occur in  which the federal and laender police forces reach the limits of  their capacity. There is a simple example these days, which did  not upset anybody and nobody even compared it with Franco's  Spain: As the floodwaters were rising dangerously, our  neighbor, Holland, used military forces to close parts of cities  and to protect them against looters. I gave a different example  from my prior personal experience: During preparations for the  1985 world economic summit, for which I was responsible in my  capacity as head of the Chancellor's Office, I had to deal with  the question of how we could defend ourselves against a  terrorist attack from the air. Such a threat existed at the  time, and only the Bundeswehr could have offered such  protection. However, our Basic Law ruled out such a mission. I  saw that as an absolutely absurd situation. Besides, what do  you mean when you say that my first attempt failed? The first  opinion poll with which I am familiar proves that, although the  published opinion is widely negative, my view is supported by a  majority of those asked.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, you cannot even count on  support from your own party!    [Schaeuble] Yes, I can; I do now know of any dissenting  opinion from within my party, apart from a statement by Volker  Ruehe, who said the Bundeswehr does not need any new tasks. He  does not need any new tasks for the Bundeswehr -- that is  absolutely true.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Do you have the feeling that the SPD  is beginning to get dangerous for you?    [Schaeuble] It is true that Mr. Scharping and the SPD are  pursuing quite a clever strategy or tactics. However, they are  not solving a single problem. The issue of Bundeswehr missions  within the framework of the United Nations has not been solved;  on the contrary, the SPD is obstructing it. The issue of  nursing care insurance remains unsolved for the same reasons.  Internal security is not solved, either.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, your problems with the FDP are  even greater.    [Schaeuble] No, only the SPD is obstructing these issues.  Regarding the use of electronic listening devices, there has  been no SPD initiative, neither in the Bundestag nor in the  Bundesrat. Mr. Scharping's tactic is to keep a very low profile  for the SPD -- basically to refuse confrontation or debate  alternatives, and, instead, say that insecurity and ill feelings  really do exist, and there is a lot of criticism of necessary  austerity measures, and that the government alone is to be  blamed for everything. Therefore, I say that in the upcoming  debates we must more clearly work out the opposition's  alternatives or force them to present their alternatives, or say  that they do not have any. It is true that the current  situation is too comfortable for the SPD.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, you will hardly be able to  reduce unemployment before election day, and you still have to  agree on considerable cuts to finance it.    [Schaeuble] What is correct is that we will not be able to  do without cuts. What is also true is that, to achieve  sustained strengthening of the forces for economic recovery, we  have to examine certain well-acquired rights -- such as in the  sphere of deregulation, for example whether we extend the  employment promotion law with the possibility of restricted  protection against dismissal for the initial phase of  employment, or whether we should authorize private labor  exchanges.    What is also true is that the difficult situation on the  labor market cannot be dramatically changed for the better in  the short term. The people have to be told so with great  frankness. I think what is also true, however, is that most  people basically know and understand that and are ready to put  up with the necessary changes. Looking at the wage agreement in  the chemical industry, I have to say with respect that his wide  public debate on what is possible and necessary has not remained  without an effect. This has made me optimistic also regarding  the upcoming elections.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Nevertheless, you will have to cope  with the problem of the lacking social balance of the austerity  measures.    [Schaeuble] I'll tell you something: The social democrats  and socialists of all shades have always known how to make envy  the driving force of their policy. It is true that envy is a  strong human motivation. On the other hand, sheer reason is not  so hopelessly inferior either, because, otherwise, one would  have to become pessimistic regarding the prospects for the  development of man and society.... Therefore, I say that any  person who has a basic knowledge of economics knows that,  considering the current difficult economic situation and in  addition to the significant increase in taxes and rates that  came into force on 1 January, we were unable to introduce  further massive tax increases in 1994 unless we incurred further  dangers for economic development and, consequently, for jobs.    Since this is the case, we have said that we would not be  able to reintroduce the solidarity tax before 1995. We have to  reintroduce it because, after 40 years of socialism and German  division, the financial burden cannot be funded otherwise. As  for the struggle between economic reason -- as represented by  the CDU -- and the socialist feeling of envy, I am optimistic  that we will be the winner. I do admit that we have not yet won  it. After all, the election year has only just begun.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Regardless of any confrontation  strategy, does your party not first have to regain lost  authority in this sphere?    [Schaeuble] We must quickly make clear how, in the long  term, we will achieve more growth and more jobs. This cannot  always be attained by increasing taxes and rates but only by  cutting public spending. At almost 52 percent, the state and  tax rate is now almost as high as in the early 80's when Helmut  Kohl first became chancellor. We brought it down to 46 percent  in the 80's, which was an enormous success and the real reason  for sustained economic upswing and stability in that decade. As  a result of German unity, we have now fallen back to the level  of the early 80's. By the end of the decade we have to reduce  it again. This is possible through tough decisions and  disputes. If we manage to achieve it, we will have more growth,  more jobs, and more social security in the long run.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Why is family policy such a priority  for you?    [Schaeuble] It is a question not only of money but also of  priorities. In connection with Basic Law amendments, some  people have requested that all possible forms of human  coexistence -- which I do not want to valuate -- be regarded as  equal with marriage and family, which boils down to a  devaluation of the institutionalized precedence given to  marriage and family. The decisive question is: What about the  solidarity between the generations? How can we preserve social  stability in the long term when an ever-shrinking number of  people have to bear responsibility for new generations? In human  history, or what we know of it, no better community of  solidarity than the family has been found yet. The family has  been greatly debilitated and must now be strengthened again.  One element for it is the nursing care insurance. This is why  we will not give up our struggle to overcome the SPD's  obstructionist position.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Has the nursing care insurance still  a chance in this legislative term?    [Schaeuble] I hope so, because everything else would be  irresponsible. What the SPD majority is doing in the Bundesrat  is an abuse of constitutional policy. Therefore, we will not  give up. In the talks between party and Bundestag group chairmen  in the Chancellor's Office, we basically reached complete  agreement. Since, in connection with the law on continued  remuneration, which does not require the SPD's support, the SPD  wants to achieve something that cannot be achieved without a  majority in the Bundestag, it is now trying to press for changes  of the law on continued remuneration by refusing to support the  nursing care insurance in the Bundesrat. This is an abuse of  constitutional policy. We will not tolerate that. I do not  think that, in the long term, the SPD will be able to thwart the  agreement on nursing care insurance because of that. Therefore,  the issue is neither dead nor over.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Has this government not become  tired after so many years in power, is it not a "lame duck" nine  months before the election?    [Schaeuble] No, even though the SPD will try to take  advantage of such feelings -- such an election campaign is also  an exciting competition, after all -- and say: "oh well, he has  been federal chancellor for so long, he is a great man with  great historical merit, he is the chancellor of German unity,  and he has done more for European unification than any other  person since Konrad Adenauer, but at the end of 1994 he will  have been in office for 12 years." My simple response will be:  When there are so many changes; when there is so much  insecurity; when the risks in terms of foreign policy have  become greater, less predictable, and more difficult to  calculate than they may have been in the past, it is an immense  resource and an enormous advantage for Germany to have a federal  chancellor with such an unparalleled degree of experience and  international reputation and influence. Just take the GATT  negotiations. The only one who was able to dissolve the dispute  between the Americans and French was Helmut Kohl. He could do  it. That the NATO summit concluded with the result that NATO  once again assumed responsibility for the eastern European  reform states has a lot to do with Helmut Kohl. Therefore, I am  saying that Helmut Kohl must remain federal chancellor after  this year, too.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, this feeling is not shared by  everybody in your own party....    [Schaeuble] ... not yet!    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] ... but people seem to get a certain  pleasure from talking about repeatedly spreading rumors of a  coup....    [Schaeuble] ... no.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Yes, even you are familiar with this  scenario: After a defeat in the Lower Saxon election in March,  the question of whether we can still win the Bundestag election  with Helmut Kohl will be raised. Would we not have to replace  him, would we not have to present a new candidate? Then there  would be only one, namely Wolfgang Schaeuble.    [Schaeuble] No, such scenarios do not exist in the CDU -- or  at least I am not familiar with them. Moreover, I would tell  anybody wanting to conduct such a discussion with me what I have  just told you, namely that we would be making a terrible mistake  to do without the power to assert authority, the leadership  power, the confidence, that Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl  displays at home and abroad.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You have always acted like somebody  who called for unity within the CDU/CSU. Does that mean that  you want to bury the domestic-policy controversy over the way in  which Roman Herzog was suddenly nominated by the CSU in Kreuth?    [Schaeuble] I have said in the Bundestag that it is actually  somewhat regrettable that in a question over which there is  actually no controversy -- after all, we are in full agreement  that Roman Herzog is to be the CDU/CSU's candidate for federal  president -- for a few days we did give the impression that we  were of a differing opinion here. I have, therefore, appealed  to everyone to frustrate such an impression. It is good that  this controversy will not continue. We must now, for God's  sake, frustrate the impression that we are of a differing  opinion on this issue, when, in reality, we are not.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Will there be any further attempts to  win the FDP's support for a joint candidate, or is that  impossible?    [Schaeuble] I think that we should not continue this  discussion. The FDP has dutifully proposed Hildegard  Hamm-Bruecher and made the necessary declarations. I think that  in the Federal Assembly we will see the election of the CDU/CSU  candidate.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Are you not bound to face permanent  controversy with the CSU in the next few months? The CSU is  fighting for survival, you are fighting for your survival, and  the CSU is constantly trying to acquire a strong image. The  issue of "grand coalition" also created controversy in Kreuth.  If the CDU were to agree on such a coalition, the CSU plans to  disassociate itself from the CDU.    [Schaeuble] One cannot speak of disassociation; after all,  from whom did Theo Waigel disassociate himself? We are in  absolute agreement, and we have talked about it this morning  (Wednesday) at the level of party and Bundestag group chairmen  of the coalition that we are not seeking a grand coalition but  will do everything to achieve a majority in order to continue  the coalition between the CDU/CSU and the FDP. There is no  difference of opinion between Theo Waigel, Helmut Kohl, and  Wolfgang Schaeuble.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But there is a difference between  what you are trying to achieve and the current speculation in  case one has no other choice. Even you have not completely  ruled out a grand coalition, because you cannot, really. It  will all depend on the election result, over which we have no  influence.    [Schaeuble] We do have a certain influence. Nevertheless,  it would be stupid to indulge in too much speculation. As a  politician with a certain assignment to lead and to bear  responsibility, I have to say what I want, what I am aiming at,  and what I am struggling for. Of course, as a democrat I have  to respect any election result. Still, as long as the polling  stations are not yet closed and have not even opened, for that  matter, I do not have to indulge in any speculation as to what  might be, but I have to concentrate on what I can offer the  voters. And this is what we are concentrating on; then the  voters will decide, and those who get elected have the duty to  respect the election result and draw their conclusions.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, you would be a bad politician  if you did not also include the possibility of a grand coalition  in your calculations.    [Schaeuble] I would be a fool or idiot if I were to indulge  in such public speculation.</p>

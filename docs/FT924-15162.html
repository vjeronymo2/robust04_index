			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Nightmare on the high street for UK retailers - Tenants and landlords in battle over terms of occupation AT A CBI conference held yesterday to discuss the future of commercial leases, Mr David Stathers, director of estates at Boots the Chemist, flashed up a slide to illustrate the relationship between landlord and tenant. It showed two rams charging headlong at each other. 'I take the view that the current arrangements that govern the terms of occupation between landlord and tenant create conflict,' he said. That conflict has become all too apparent in recent months as the severity of the recession has exposed the severe stresses and strains in the commercial property sector. Retailers have staged rent strikes against what they regard as 'excessive' increases and have begun to lobby vigorously for reform of the 25 year lease, with upwards-only rent reviews every five years, which is almost unknown outside the UK. The debate was further fuelled by a recent inflammatory study by Professor John Burton, an economist from Birmingham University, which claimed the structural rigidities of the rental market had created a situation of 'nightmarish crisis in many components of UK retailing'. He argued that commercial leases represented an 'institutionalised, legally induced form of cost inflation that is very impervious to market forces' and should be reformed by government statute. This proposal has prompted a furious response from the property industry, which promises to fight any changes to existing leases tooth and nail. For one thing, the property industry believes the changes suggested by Mr Burton would severely damage property values by destroying the security of investors' income. 'It would be devastating. It would send the market into turmoil,' says Mr Richard Lay, chairman of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, the property adviser. For another, landlords argue that contracts freely entered into should be upheld. The Prudential, one of the country's largest property investors, says it would appeal to the European Court to overturn any moves to the contrary, which it claims would amount to confiscation. Landlords do not even agree with the proposition that the existing system is inflationary and unfair on tenants. Mr Christopher Edwards, director of Property Portfolio Management at the Prudential, maintains that five yearly review patterns cushion tenants against annual rent rises. He estimates that on average UK tenants were paying just 60-70 per cent of market rents at the end of last year. Moreover, landlords point out that tenants benefited from the existing system in the 1980s, by assigning their unwanted leases to other traders in return for large premiums. They also maintain that retailers are suffering from the consequences of their own actions, by bidding up rents to unsustainable levels in the late 1980s But their overriding argument is that ultimately tenants' interests coincide with their landlords. If leases became more flexible, institutions would invest less in property, the supply of new buildings would dry up and rents would rise. 'The simple truth is that any increase in the investor's risk will have to be paid for,' says Mr Edwards. Tenants identify their most pressing concerns as: An end to 25-year leases. Although tenants like a degree of security they dislike the financial responsibility and inflexibility associated with such long leases. An end to upwards-only clauses in rent reviews. The upwards-only ratchet is seen as unfair and inflationary, at a time when rents on new leases are falling. An end to 'privity of contract', which allows landlords in England and Wales to claim unpaid rent from previous tenants if the existing tenant defaults. The Conservative party manifesto at the last election promised to consider changes, after an outcry from companies which were faced with crippling demands for rent under leases they passed on years ago. In its latest set of accounts, for example, Boots took a Pounds 5.8m provision against the anticipated costs relating to transferred leases where the assignees had defaulted. Changes to the method of determining rent reviews to reflect the quantity of vacant property on the market, the state of the economy, the ability of tenants to pay and concessions granted to new tenants, such as rent-free periods. An end to confidentiality clauses, which critics claim obscure and often inflate market rents by deliberately limiting the information essential for an efficient market. Despite the rhetoric of many property investors, the structure of new leases is already changing. Investment companies, which do not need to sell their properties to institutions, are already granting flexible leases. MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, recently gave Chemical Bank the right to break its lease on Alban Gate, its City flagship, after one, five and fifteen years. Property owners are making a virtue out of the need to grant shorter leases, which forces them to work their property more energetically. 'For too long landlords have been passive, absent rent collectors but they have to become more involved in actively managing their property assets,' says Mr Roger Carey, managing director of Slough Estates. There is also a growing acceptance that the rent review process should be improved. Confidentiality clauses have few defenders and arbitrators are taking more account of the state of the economy when deciding rent reviews. Some concessions on privity of contract would also be accepted by landlords. The CBI, for instance, has support for its proposal that tenants get an automatic right to reoccupy premises for which they have become liable. Modest amendments like these have a good chance of being adopted. But while some practices are gradually evolving in the light of new market conditions, there is little prospect of root and branch reform to the underlying structure. The conflict between the immediate pressures of the recession and the long term investment horizons of institutions is unlikely to be resolved.</p>

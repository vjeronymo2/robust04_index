			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Norwegian power link to UK studied A CONSORTIUM of European power and engineering companies are studying a new undersea link between Britain and Scandinavia which would allow Norway to export cheap hydro-electric supplies. National Grid, the privatised UK electricity distributor, is taking part in the study scheme along with Eastern Electric, the largest of the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales. Kvaerner A/S, one of Scandinavia's largest industrial groups and a leading member of the consortium, said the 456-mile link between Lista, in Norway and Walpole, eastern England, could cost pounds 380m. Other partners in the study include Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss power engineering group; Siemens of Germany; and Alcatel Cable of France. National Grid said that it joined the study-team following an invitation from the Norwegian-led consortium. But it warned that it would be several months before initial studies are completed. The proposed link, which could be operational by the late 1990s, would have just under half the capacity of the existing cross-Channel Anglo-French electricity inter-connector. Although a National Grid spokesman said that the planned cable 'would have a capacity for a two-way flow', Norwegian power officials regard its main importance as an export line. National Grid said a decision on whether to proceed with a full-scale feasibility appraisal will be taken 'once we have fully assessed the present study'. The threat of future supplies of Norwegian hydro-power will put further pressure on domestic deep-mined coal as a viable means of electricity generation.</p>

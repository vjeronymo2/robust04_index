			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> JAPAN PARTY CHIEF QUITS IN SCANDAL  </P> <P> Japan's stock-profiteering scandal claimed yet another prominent casualty today  as the chief of an opposition party resigned over his lucrative dealings with  the company at the heart of the affair.  </P> <P> Saburo Tsukamoto, 61, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, stepped down  amid pressure from party members who want to distance the party from the  scandal involving the Recruit group of companies. He said he was not guilty of  any wrongdoing but was quitting for the party's sake. Three Cabinet members  have resigned because of links to the affair, as have more than a dozen other  government officials, business leaders and media executives.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: DEVO: A LITTLE LESS THAN IT ONCE WAS, BUT STILL SOME  ROLLICKING GOOD FUN  </P> <P> When Devo emerged in 1978, it was a rock band aspiring to be a multimedia  performance concept, tied together by the group's jaundiced theory that the  human race is a downhill event.  </P> <P> True to its own theory of devolution, Devo has mutated into something less than  it once was. Instead of band-as-high-concept, Devo, which has slid in  popularity since its peak around 1980-81, is now band-as-cozy-club: snide  Mouseketeers who roll their eyes at innocence; cynical Boy Scouts who laugh at  the idea that anything on two feet can be honest and true.  </P> <P> The Devo club has its own uniform and insignia, its own hand signs, totems and  mottoes. Most of them were reliably displayed Tuesday night at the Coach House  in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> Over the years, co-founders Mark Mothersbaugh and Gerald Casale have tried, in  interviews, to make some serious claims that this combination of half-baked  theory and highly developed iconography adds up to Devo's own special brand of  social commentary.  </P> <P> In fact, Devo's social commentary carries about as much weight as Mad  Magazine's. It's hard to see what's so insightful about depicting the human  enterprise as an exercise in idiocy. Of course mankind is a mockery of itself.  Any species in which masses of individuals could follow a Hitler, a Stalin, a  Pol Pot (still alive and raring to give us "The Killing Fields, Part II") is  almost beneath contempt.  </P> <P> But good satire derives its bite from the idea that mankind could and should do  better. A strong pop satirist like Randy Newman manages to convey a moral  vision of humanity's potential for better things, and a sorrow for its  shortcomings, even as he savages his satiric targets.  </P> <P> Lacking the resources of story, character and dialogue that the likes of  Newman, Warren Zevon and Ray Davies of the Kinks bring to their satiric songs,  Devo never has elevated its mocking concept into a body of pop-satiric work  that deserves to be taken seriously. But the nice thing about Devo's show at  the Coach House was that, unlike those interviews, it didn't ask to be taken  seriously.  </P> <P> Devo didn't try to preach its theory, or to draw ponderous links to current  events that bear out the march of devolution. Instead, it ran through familiar  songs and rituals in an energetic spirit of fun that had the Devo club members  in the full house pogoing and roaring their approval. (Unlike the gloomy  British school of pop pessimists, Devo never lets humanity's dismal condition  spoil a good time.) Devo also took care of a bit of new business, debuting two  numbers from an album-in-progress.  </P> <P> As surely as a Shriners parade features fezzes and little scooters, a Devo show  trots out an array of symbols and icons that define the experience.  </P> <P> There was the screening of Devo videos, in homage to the band's position as an  early exploiter of rock video.  </P> <P> There were the matching technicians' uniforms worn by all five band members, an  ironic commentary on the idea that technology will be our savior.  </P> <P> There was Mothersbaugh, always a visually captivating front man, miming the  lyrics with antic, herky-jerky movements.  </P> <P> There were the absurdist slogans and catchwords, and the red flower pot hats  worn during the encore.  </P> <P> Devo was canny enough not to turn the show into a replay of its highly  successful previous run of nine performances at the Coach House last December  and January. The band also avoided duplicating its recent live album, "Now It  Can Be Told," which largely reproduces the set Devo played here the last time  through.  </P> <P> In addition to faithful renditions of such favorites as "Gates of Steel," "Girl  U Want," "Whip It" and "Satisfaction," all available on the live album, Devo  dipped deeper into its repertoire and came up with such strong numbers as "Mr.  DNA," "Mongoloid" and "Come Back Jonee."  </P> <P> Devo also abandoned the flawed acoustic ballad reading of "Jocko Homo" that  opens the live album. Instead, it delivered its keynote song as a metallic,  synthesized hard-pounder. Mothersbaugh roamed the room with his wireless  microphone, turning the song into a Devo Club bonding ritual as he screamed the  song's question, "Are we not men?" and let fan after fan provide the  article-of-faith answer, "We are Devo!" Devo was in hard-rocking form  throughout, de-emphasizing the techno-dance music of its tepid 1988 studio  album, "Total Devo," in favor of songs with heavy but catchy rock riffs.  </P> <P> The new songs, paired together at mid-set, reflected a revived interest in rock  and an unchanged conviction that humanity is absurd. "Post Post-Modern Man"  appropriated the rhythmic spine of Wilson Pickett's "Funky Broadway" for a wry  portrayal of a fellow trying to get by without any modern conveniences,  apparently in a post-Armageddon world. "A Change Is Gonna Come" (not the Sam  Cooke classic) sounded, on first hearing, like a bannering of future headlines  from the National Enquirer.  </P> <P> "Scientists prove we were never here" sounded like the most quintessentially  Devo of them all.  </P> <P> Devo plays again at the Coach House on Monday, and at Bogart's in Long Beach on  Tuesday. For information, call the Coach House at (714) 496-8930, or Bogart's  at (213) 594-8975.  </P> <P> </P></p>

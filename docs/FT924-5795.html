			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Sex discrimination reported at Bar WOMEN barristers face substantial discrimination affecting their chances of becoming a Queen's counsel or a judge, according to an independent survey of sex equality in the profession. The survey, commissioned jointly by the Bar Council and the Lord Chancellor's Department, is the first large-scale study of sex discrimination in an important profession in this country. It found 'substantial evidence of early and continuing unequal treatment between the sexes'; 'a discrepancy between male and female perceptions of equality issues'; and 'a marked tendency of failure to recognise this as a problem by those who occupy the higher levels - heads of chambers (barristers' offices) and judges.' Sixty per cent of women respondents reported disadvantage on the ground of their sex. More than 70 per cent felt under pressure to perform better than men and that their performance was watched more closely. Women felt sex discrimination was the second-most prevalent source of discrimination and men ranked it fifth. Race discrimination was ranked first by both groups. Women face particular obstacles in being selected for traineeships. The report recommends action by both the Bar and the Lord Chancellor's Department, which has overall responsibility for the appointment of QCs and judges. Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, welcomed the study yesterday. Without Prejudice?

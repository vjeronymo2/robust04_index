			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (12): A vision of the future  -Multimedia systems While the excitement surrounding multimedia computing makes it hard to ignore, many find it equally hard to see how it can be used by business beyond applications such as training and presentation. Early attempts to bring graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to personal computers in the mid-1980s faced similar resistance. While the potential of graphics was exploited quickly in computer games, it took several years for GUIs to achieve credibility in business applications. Initially, senior executives dismissed GUIs - and graphics in general - as a distraction and worried about the effect the technology would have on worker productivity. Ten years on, the idea of a PC without Microsoft's Windows or a comparable GUI is unthinkable. Thus it seems likely that by 2004 a computer without multimedia features will be as dated as the original IBM PC with its 'glass typewriter' interface is now. There is some way to go, however. A survey by Touche Ross earlier this year showed that, in spite of much interest in multimedia technology, more than two-thirds of UK companies had no plans to use it - mainly because of the lack of useful applications at present. Robert Baldock, a partner at Andersen Consulting, says that the finance sector could take the lead in using multimedia technology - 'there are changes evident in the way that retail financial services are structured which will make multimedia important,' he suggests. 'People are using bank branches less and less and a trend towards telephone banking is emerging. Midland Bank, for example, set up First Direct because of this and others have followed. Consumers are saying that they want convenience and faster response to their needs. Multimedia technology offers a way forward.' Mr Baldock is putting these thoughts into practice on a pilot project with the Nationwide Building Society aimed at creating what he calls a 'virtual bank.' 'The idea is to create an environment on the screen which allows customers to browse through the banking services at their leisure,' he says. 'We have done this by building a prototype 'kiosk' which recreates a real bank. The opening screen is a picture of a bank in the High Street. You can 'walk' in through the door and move around in a three-dimensional graphics environment  -pointing at things and seeing how they react.' Mr Baldock says to develop an element of fun in the virtual bank every item on the screen reacts to the user. 'There is a pot plant in the lobby which, when pointed at, will bloom. There is also an infra-red remote control to activate videos on various banking services. If you go up to a counter, you can activate a video-conferencing system which lets you speak directly to an adviser and so on.' The system is only at the concept stage but a production version is planned and, ultimately, the virtual bank will be available across a network for home use. The convergence of multimedia and networking will serve as a stimulus to both technologies. Recent advances in networking will soon make it possible to offer a wide range of multimedia services in the home - and virtual banking promises to be one of first. Home banking is one of the leading applications of multimedia and networking technology, according to Anne Perlman, vice-president of multimedia at US computer manufacturer Tandem. 'We are finding our customers are moving toward multimedia in financial services, although it is still early in the cycle. The networking technology will let us take this into the home and the multimedia technology will make it attractive to consumers,' she says. But Ms Perlman notes that home banking alone is not unlikely to cause a breakthrough. She sees it as part of a range of networked services - 'our research shows that people like a range of services: video on demand, video-conferencing, home shopping and, of course, home banking. It is when all these are brought together that people start to get interested.' Tandem is also looking at combining multimedia technology with existing data processing technology - especially in the area of processing financial transactions. Ms Perlman says that multimedia provides an ideal way to present multi-dimensional information based on traditional data processing. 'We can see multimedia giving us ways to put lots of different variables together on a screen and show things like company performance. If you wanted to look at P/E ratios, risk exposure and stock variations over a period of time, you need to present the data in three dimensions. Multimedia technology lets you do this.' Tandem has also looked closely at the system management problems associated with the convergence of multimedia, networking and traditional data processing. Transaction billing, mail order and royalty collection present special difficulties, says Ms Perlman. 'There are so many different billing and payment methods involved in multimedia networks and we have not, as yet, been able to find suitable software to do this.' Tandem is working with 32 of the world's top telecom companies on telephone billing systems and expects significant growth in transaction billing as the number of multimedia 'content' providers increases. This is likely to change the way people buy and sell products. Mr Baldock of Andersen Consulting sees the changes beginning to have an effect on banking: electronic transactions as a percentage of the whole rose from 20 per cent in 1985 to 37 per cent in 1992. He expects this to rise to 40 per cent by the year 2000.</p>

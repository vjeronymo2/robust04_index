			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Bank chief quits in poll row MR Edgardo Espiritu, president and vice-chairman of the state-controlled Philippine National Bank (PNB), the country's largest commercial bank, yesterday resigned after a pre-election row over encashment of government cheques issued to local government officials around the country. The resignation was immediately accepted by President Corazon Aquino who was expected to announce the appointment of Mr Federico Pascual, the present PNB vice-president, as officer-in-charge until early next month. Mr Espiritu was caught in the political flak last week when he told PNB branch managers not to encash cheques totalling some 980m pesos (Pounds 21m) that the government had given to 42,000 officials. The timing of the cheques' release was widely interpreted as a move to influence last Monday's general election, although the government had argued that these were regular allotments from tax collections. Mr Espiritu is a known supporter of Mr Ramon Mitra, presidential candidate of the the Democratic Filipino Struggle party while Mrs Aquino backs Mr Fidel Ramos, the former defence secretary.</p>

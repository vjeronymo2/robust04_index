			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pavel Podlesnyy, candidate of historical </F> sciences, RAN (Russian Academy of Sciences) Institute of Europe:  "Washington Searches for a New Formula for Relations with  Russia--The Idea of `Pragmatic Partnership' Is Moving to the  Fore"]    [Text] The question of the foundations on which  relations with the present Russian state can and should be  constructed occupies virtually the central place in the  unusually sharp debate that has developed in U.S. political and  academic circles, the American Congress, and in press material  concerned with foreign policy. The essence of the issues was  stated with exceptional precision in a recent article, entitled  "Premature Partnership," by well-known American political expert  Zbigniew Brzezinski: "If Russia is no longer our enemy, then  what is it--an ally already, or a client, or simply a defeated  enemy? What should be the objectives and content of major U.S.  strategy after the `cold war" in relation to the country which,  one way or another, is destined to be a force in all world  affairs regardless of its present sickened condition?" At the  same time rightist conservative figures, above all those closely  tied to the Republican Party, reproach the Clinton  administration because its proclaimed policy of "partnership  with democratic Russia" errs in its exaggerated assessments of  Russian reforms, focuses excessive attention on Russia to the  detriment of developing U.S. relations with other post-Soviet  republics, and prevents the immediate admission of a number of  countries of Central and Eastern Europe into NATO. This leads  them to demand a rethinking of the whole set of relations with  Russia.    The causes of such attitudes are obvious. In the first  place,  there is the anxiety of a significant part of the American  establishment over the future pace and direction of the Russian  reforms, the continuing danger of major social upheavals, and  the unprecedented growth of crime in the country. It is  noteworthy that during the recent Senate hearings CIA director  James Woolsey expressed alarm at the scale of organized crime in  Russia, emphasizing that this not only threatens the reforms and  undermines the authority of the Russian leadership, but is even  beginning to make it more difficult to fight international crime  and creates a danger that nuclear materials will be exported  from the former USSR. The administration too has begun to show a  more restrained view of the future Russian reforms. And while  some of its representatives (Talbot) call for recognition of the  first positive results of the transformations despite all the  difficulties, others (W. Perry) do not preclude the possibility  that reforms will break down and an authoritarian regime hostile  to the West will appear in Russia, with the resulting return to  some form of "cold war."    In the second place, the United States is carefully  observing  the unending struggle in Russia over foreign policy issues,  including relations with the West. An example of this was the  debate about the wisdom of Russian participation in the  well-known NATO program, Partners for Peace. And special  attention is being focused on Russia's relations with the  countries of the near abroad. It is perfectly clear that the  United States and the West as a whole fear the restoration (in  one form or another) of a significant part of the USSR (or  Russian Empire) and the elimination of the geopolitical  counterweights to Russia, above all Ukraine.    In the third place, the real scale of Russian-American  cooperation in a number of areas, above all economic, is still  very modest. For example, of the 3.2 billion dollars  appropriated by the U.S. Congress since 1992 for assistance to  CIS countries, as of March of this year (according to American  figures) 282 million had been spent, and 141 million of this  went to Russia. One of the reasons for this is bureaucratic and  other delays in the action of the American state apparatus. In  this connection Congressman L. Hamilton said, "The Russians have  a right to complain. Congress is appropriating large amounts of  money, which are not being used."    At the present time the main struggle is unfolding between  advocates of so-called "consolidation of geopolitical pluralism"  in the territory of the former USSR (Z. Brzezinski, H.  Kissinger, R. Zelik, and others) and supporters of the idea of  "pragmatic partnership," which has recently been stated by U.S.  Secretary of Defense W. Perry and represents a modification of  Clinton administration policy in relation to Russia.    As for the idea of "consolidation of geopolitical pluralism"  in post-Soviet space, it aims at a new isolation of Russia by  creating a kind of "buffer zone" of states along Russia's  borders. "Only then" argues Mr. Brzezinski, "when an appropriate  milieu has been firmly established for Russia so that it can  define itself as Russia, will the foundation be laid for strong,  true American-Russian partnership."    But even with a quick glance at this idea it is obvious that  its realization, or more accurately attempts to realize it,  would lead Russian-American relations in exactly the opposite  direction and would undermine the foundations of stability on  the European continent.    Least convincing of all are the attempts to reduce all  Russia's actions toward the other CIS countries to  manifestations of, if not openly imperial, then "protoimperial"  policy. Russia has more than enough vitally important interests  in the territory of the former USSR, and it cannot be said that  its new neighbors always given them proper consideration. This  is not to mention the fact that the Western states are not  showing real willingness to share even a part of the burden of  maintaining stability in the territory of the former USSR, with  the exception of actions to eliminate nuclear weapons in  Kazakhstan, Belorussia, and Ukraine. And finally, the  initiatives relating to various forms of reintegration of some  of the former Union republics do not originate solely or even  mainly from Russian politicians.    The idea of "consolidation of geopolitical pluralism" within  the boundaries of the former USSR assigns Ukraine the role of  primary counterweight to Russia's neoimperial aspirations. For  this purpose it is proposed to greatly increase economic aid to  Ukraine, step up pressure on its leaders to push them toward  economic reforms, and offer American political guarantees of  Ukrainian independence and territorial integrity. It is true  that they do not answer the question: Where will the United  States and the West get the tens of billions of dollars needed  to save the ruined Ukrainian economy, which is barely staying  afloat--and that is largely thanks to the Russian reforms. And  finally, the main thing--what does the West intend to do if the  Ukrainian state disintegrates and what actions does it expect  from Russia in such an extremely dangerous turn of events?    An important role in assuring "geopolitical pluralism" is  assigned also to "broadening the scale and perimeter of European  security," or more precisely, admitting a number of Central  European countries to NATO, which could be done concurrently  with conclusion of a treaty on alliance and cooperation between  NATO and Russia. The question immediately arises: Why not  conclude such a treaty or some kind of major agreement without  enlarging NATO? Is such an enlargement really the only option to  ensure stability and security in Europe?    The above permits us to draw the conclusion that  "consolidation of geopolitical pluralism" is nothing more than  an attempt to pursue the policy of "containing" Russia, ignoring  the changes taking place in it and in the whole world,  especially in European space.    We also must not overlook the fact that although the views  described above do not exert a determining influence on  Washington's actual policy at the present time, they make their  mark in public consciousness and are one of the factors that is  forcing the administration to modify its policy somewhat in  relation to the Russian state. This found expression in  advancement of the idea of a "pragmatic partnership" with  Russia, which presupposes the existence of contradictions and  differences in the national interests of the two countries, but  also recognized the need for cooperation in many spheres, above  all elimination of nuclear weapons, nonproliferation of nuclear  weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, settlement of  international crises, and development of contacts between the  military establishments. Such cooperation, important in itself,  is less subject to domestic changes in any particular country  and serves as an important instrument of the stability of  Russian-American relations.</p>

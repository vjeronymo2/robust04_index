"We have  to map out a plan to prevent this from happening. Law enforcement cannot do it  alone."  </P> <P> The Rev. Luther Keith, pastor of the Central Baptist Church, planned a  candlelight vigil next month "to reclaim our community from the gangs. . . .  It's getting pretty rough. If we don't stand up and do something, it will get  out of hand."  </P> <P> School board member Joseph Rouzan, a former Inglewood police chief, added:  "Unfortunately, I think this gang stuff is out of control. It's just  unmanageable."  </P> <P> Rouzan called for a meeting of city and school officials to coordinate strategy  against the violence.  </P> <P> On Sunday the teen-agers were standing in the 10200 block of Crenshaw Boulevard  about 11 p.m. when a car with its lights out pulled slowly past before parking  across the street, according to witnesses and police. As many as 20 shots were  then fired at the group by the two occupants of the car.  </P> <P> "This was a deliberate ambush of these men by persons unknown," Police Sgt.  Harold Moret said Tuesday. "It was a concerted effort meant to kill all of  them. These shooters meant to kill them all."  </P> <P> Moret declined to label the incident gang-related, pending completion of the  police investigation. But friends of the victims and area gang members said the  teen-agers were associated with the Crenshaw Mafia, an Inglewood gang connected  to the Bloods. They said the word on the street was that an unknown set of  rival Crips was responsible for the shooting.  </P> <P> "It was Crips, and if we find out who did it we can't help but get our  revenge," said a gang member who knew the teen-agers. "These guys were kids  that hung out with us, innocent bystanders."  </P> <P> Eric Malone, 16, a student at Morningside High School, died at the scene. Edgar  Cole, 16, a former Morningside student, died Sunday night at an area hospital.  School officials said a counselor had been working with both victims to steer  them away from gangs.  </P> <P> Two other victims remained hospitalized in stable condition, and another  sustained a minor wound.  </P> <P> "I looked out the window and I saw two boys laying right there," said area  resident LaRonda Sims, 15. "One was moaning and the other was just laid out."  </P> <P> She said her classmates at Morningside High were all talking about the  shooting, which took place a few blocks from campus, on Monday. "Everybody knew  about it," she said. "Everybody was crying and stuff."  </P> <P> LaRonda said the group often hung out on the street "giving their little (gang)  signs" to passing motorists.  </P> <P> In the earlier incident, Norman Smith was riding home from a school dance in  the back of a pickup truck on Oct. 13 when an unknown assailant fired at the  truck with a shotgun after asking about the passengers' gang affiliation.  </P> <P> Norman had broken off ties with the Inglewood Trece Demon Locos earlier this  year, his family said.  </P></p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Water regulator pledges to halt price escalation MR IAN BYATT, the water industry regulator, promised yesterday to 'get customers off the endless price escalator' as he laid out plans for next year's review of water prices. His pledge, in a long-awaited consultation document, was welcomed by consumer bodies which have complained about rising water bills and salary increases among water company executives since privatisation. But it drew a guarded response from the water industry and hit share prices. Mr Byatt indicated that he planned to cut the rate of return water companies have been allowed to earn since their privatisation in 1989. This had been set at a deliberately high level to attract new investors, he said. Now, he added, the risks were lower, and companies should fund future improvements through greater efficiency or higher borrowing, rather than higher prices. The only excuse for price rises after the new formula came into effect in 1995, he said, would be investments needed to meet higher water quality standards, mainly from the European Community. But there would be some flexibility based on each company's circumstances. Mr Byatt pointed out that he did not have to agree the new 10-year price formula with the water companies, but if they objected they could appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The details will be announced next July. 'For customers, the most important message is that the rapid increase in water prices above the rate of inflation can be moderated. I believe that it was necessary to have had an in-crease in water prices. But customers have become increasingly concerned at continuing in-creases above the rate of inflation,' he said. He expected water companies in the next 10 years to provide existing service standards at prices 'below today's level in real terms'. Stock market reaction was mixed. Analysts said tougher rates of return could hit companies with large investment plans, but they drew comfort from the fact that Mr Byatt also said he wanted to avoid disruptions. Most water shares fell. The Water Services Association said it shared Mr Byatt's concern about unnecessary real rises in water bills, but added: 'It is particularly important new investment which has to be undertaken is properly remunerated.' Mr Jim Gardner, chairman of the Ofwat National Customer Council, said: 'We fully support the director-general's wish to 'stop the escalator'.'

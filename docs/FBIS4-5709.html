			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- An intra-governmental  meeting is scheduled for Friday to discuss Seoul's options in  handling North Korean loggers in Siberia.    Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong is to lead the meeting  that will most likely confirm the general principle of helping  escaped loggers settle either in Russia or in South Korea.    Over 100 North Koreans at the logging camps want to come to  South Korea but the Seoul government has been extremely careful  not to agitate Pyongyang.    Officials said the initial goal will be to safely settle  them  in Russia by having them recognized as refugees by the U.N. High  Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR).    Friday's meeting will discuss these measures along with  action necessary in settling some of the North Korean loggers in  South Korea, such as job training, the officials said.</p>

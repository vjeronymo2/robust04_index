			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Letter: The subtleties of networking Sir, Andrew Campbell's letter (April 9) seems to polarise a position on networking in organisations where more subtle thinking is needed. There are no clear definitions of 'official' and 'unofficial' networks in any organisation in which I have worked. Neither was seen as right or wrong but both were seen as necessary and sufficient. There is a need for the discipline and measurement of processes like total quality management to be integrated with the 'soft' skills of judgment, sensing, ingenuity and the creation of organisational vision and purpose. These are explained in the new book Conceptual Tools by Jerry Rhodes. The present interest in learning organisations is because they seem to offer a way of integrating the rational and emotional aspects of working life by tapping the learning of all groups in the organisation and thereby continuously transforming it. The desire to break out of exclusive analytical/logic cycles of learning and tap into the emotional drive and enthusiasm found in the soft learning cycles of unofficial networks explains, I think, the current trend to 'culture change' programmes in such businesses as BP, BA, Rover, and ICI. All of this is a great challenge for many directors who still seem stuck in Bourbon mode - learning nothing and forgetting nothing. Bob Garrett, 3, Beresford Terrace, N5</p>

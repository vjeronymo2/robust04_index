			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Mexico frees its central bank Mexico's Congress has approved legislation that will formally give the central bank independence from the government, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. The bank's fundamental objective will be to maintain the purchasing power of the currency. The new law gives the central bank control over monetary policy, and severely limits the credit it can extend to the federal government. This is intended to ensure that government budget deficits do not lead to an expansion in the monetary base, and a rise in inflation. However, exchange rate policy will be determined by a commission made up of the central bank and the Finance Ministry, in which the ministry has the power of veto.</p>

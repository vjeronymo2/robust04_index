			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RISKY BUSINESS  </P> <P> I read with interest the Looks column "Risky Business," by Paddy Calistro (Aug.  13), about in-office surgery. As an anesthesia provider in Beverly Hills and  West Los Angeles for a number of plastic surgeons, I am in full agreement that  some less-than-optimal office surgi-centers exist.  </P> <P> Although many procedures can be performed using only local anesthetics, longer  and more involved procedures require heavy sedation or general anesthesia. Only  a trained anesthesia provider can do this safely. Your article ignored the fact  that a number of these procedures are now performed, using potent sedatives  and/or anesthetic drugs, by untrained hands.  </P> <P> DAVID J.

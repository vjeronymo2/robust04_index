The movie follows the publication of the third volume of Mr.  Deng's collected works, the first volume of the biography  written by his daughter, Deng Rong, and numerous semi-official  books and magazine articles about his life and works.    Posters and badges featuring the face of the "chief  architect" have also started to make their appearance in the  shops, evoking memories of the personality cult which surrounded  Chairman Mao Zedong towards the end of his life.    Analysts said the mass of publicity surrounding Mr. Deng was  designed to establish a definitive place for the patriarch in  the annals of Communist Party history before he finally dies. A  Western diplomat said: "Deng is obviously in a very poor state  of health and I get the feeling there is an increased sense of  urgency about getting the Deng cult in place before he goes to  meet Marx."    The new film is to be directed by Ding Yinnan, who has  previously made feature films about the lives of the founder of  the Chinese Republic, Sun Yat-sen and the late premier of the  People's Republic, Zhou Enlai.    Film industry sources say that Ding was chosen largely  because of his sycophantic and sanitised depiction of Zhou in  the 1991 movie. Although the director and the screenplay have  been finalised, the film studio has still not found an actor for  the lead role. Such roles have traditionally gone to actors a  close resemblance to the lead character.    "I heard the main problem was finding someone the same  height," a Beijing based film producer said Mr. Deng is just  over 1.5 metres tall.</p>

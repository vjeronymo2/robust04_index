Kim, at the  midpoint of his three-day visit to Japan, told Japanese business  leaders at a luncheon, "though we are greatly concerned about  the bilateral trade imbalance, we will endeavor to resolve it  through the positive approach of expanding our exports, rather  than through the passive approach of restricting imports."    Kim is on a weeklong tour of Japan and China to encourage  east Asian economic cooperation as well as a coordinated effort  to persuade North Korea to desist with its nuclear brinkmanship.  The South Korean president sees the hard-line communist  government of Kim Il-song as not only a military and political  threat but also "a major impediment to regional exchanges and  cooperation."    Kim sees Asia as "the most dynamic economic region of the  world" which is "expected to emerge as the main axis for the  global economy" in future. "We must strive to eliminate any  obstacle to free trade and economic cooperation so as to promote  coexistence, shared prosperity and balanced development  throughout Asia," he said.    Expanding upon his November summit with Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, Kim was optimistic about the two young  administrations in Seoul and Tokyo.    "We have been able to diminish differences between Seoul and  Tokyo over how to redress our trade imbalance and how to promote  technological cooperation," Kim said. With regard to the trade  imbalance that reached 8.45 billion dollars in Japan's favor in  1993, Kim vowed, "we will work harder to improve product quality  and reliability and meticulously fulfill delivery and other  contract terms."    Kim was also optimistic that the new initiative for an  economic partnership, scheduled to hold its first meeting in  Seoul next month, would serve as "a major vehicle for bilateral  dialogue and cooperation.    Calling his visit to Tokyo a "new catalyst for consolidating  our forward looking bilateral ties and economic cooperation,"  Kim urged the Japanese business leaders to "actively take  advantage of the improving investment climate in (South) Korea."</p>

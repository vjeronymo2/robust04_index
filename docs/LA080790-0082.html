			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: JAKARTA;  </P> <P> TWO RECONCILIATIONS  </P> <P> Chinese Premier Li Peng is in the Indonesian capital for the formal resumption  on Wednesday of diplomatic relations between the two Asian nations, estranged  since an abortive, 1967 pro-Communist coup attempt.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the Chinese official begins a three-day visit to Singapore, which  is also expected to establish formal ties with Beijing by the end of the year.  </P> <P> Both Indonesia and Singapore cite the promise of improved trade relations with  Asia's most populous potential market as one reason for rapprochement, while  China seeks to enhance its standing in the region to counterbalance U.S. and  Japanese influence. Beijing's decision to stop supporting most Communist rebels  in the region has helped open the way for better ties.  </P></p>

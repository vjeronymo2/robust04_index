			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Market hopes rise for interest rates cut BOURSES were mixed yesterday ahead of today's Buba meeting, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT eased in spite of a cut in the repo rate which may herald an easing in interest rates today. The market is looking for a cut in the range of 25-50 basis points. However, Nikko Europe, expressing a widely held view, suggested that a cut today would not be justified by monetary guidelines and could 'thus only be in response to political pressures; and such a scenario would be found prurient to many members of the policy-making council as an infringement of a long-standing tradition of political independence'. The DAX index lost 11.32 to 1,833.91 in turnover of DM7bn. The car sector continued to feature after Volkswagen forecast earnings recovery later in the year and the shares put on DM11.70 to DM359.70. Elsewhere, Porsche gained DM9.20 to DM579 but Daimler fell back DM7.50 to DM682.50. PARIS drifted lower as the market marked time ahead of today's Buba meeting. The CAC-40 index lost 8.58 to 1,989.53 in turnover of FFr2.8bn. The market is also awaiting tomorrow's June unemployment figures which are expected to show another rise, perhaps to 3.5m. Futures and options also expire on Friday. Elf Aquitaine attracted investor interest yesterday, the shares going against the trend with a gain of FFr6.90 to FFr415.90, while Eurotunnel built on Tuesday's gains, adding a further 70 centimes or 1.8 per cent to FFr39.30. AMSTERDAM gathered a little ground, the CBS Tendency index up 0.4 to 119.6. Hoogovens gained Fl 1.70 to Fl 40.40 after a US steel ruling on anti-dumping excluded hot-rolled steel. MILAN quickly overcame some early nervousness in the wake of the overnight bombing as the prospects for lower interest rates seemed more persuasive. The Comit index edged 1.50 higher to 558.18. Ferruzzi remained volatile in speculative trading, rising L32.5 or 7.7 per cent to L454. ZURICH was led higher by a strong banking sector, on expectations of strong profits growth this year and the SMI index rose 10.3 to 2,408.8. UBS bearers, the day's most active issue, gained SFr20 to SFr1,198 while SBC bearers gained SFr15 to SFr487, helped by a warrant issue. BRUSSELS was cautious ahead of the Bundesbank meeting and the Bel-20 index edged 0.18 higher to 1,301.67. Cockerill Sambre, the steelmaker, rose BFr7 or 5.9 per cent to BFr125 in heavy trade as it caught up with gains elsewhere in the sector. VIENNA recovered some of its early losses and the ATX index closed down 6.65 at 969.47 after touching an early low of 955.56. MADRID slipped off the day's highs after the emergence of profit-taking but the general index posted a 1.52 rise to 263.87. STOCKHOLM finished at a year's high with the Affarsvarlden index up 12.40 to 1,185.60 and the building and property sector some 4.3 per cent firmer. HELSINKI's Hex index improved 2 per cent to 1,227.8 with interest mainly concentrated on banks. ISTANBUL corrected recent falls in technically inspired trading as the composite index gained some 7 per cent to 9,714.90. Carnegie International cautions against forecasts that the index will surge back to the 11-12,000 level since economic/politcal factors do not support a sustained rally.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- July 28                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1239.20     1239.64     1239.79     1238.66 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1298.50     1299.36     1300.62     1296.73  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1238.02     1237.31     1238.43     1238.35 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1297.32     1298.25     1297.74     1297.56  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jul 27    Jul 26    Jul 23    Jul 22    Jul 21  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1238.95   1240.21   1224.42   1217.14   1212.75 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1297.42   1294.91   1279.96   1275.93   1266.97  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1240.80; 200 - 1300.62 Low/day: 100 - 1236.88 200 - 1295.25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

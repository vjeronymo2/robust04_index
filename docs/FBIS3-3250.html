The mayors from these  cities expressed their opinions on price rises in their cities.    Mayor of Hainan [as received], Mr. Zeng Harorong, said that  Haikou, capital of Hainan Province, saw a 25.8 percent rise in  retail prices last year while the price index for residential  consumer goods increased by 30 percent last January, ranking the  city first in terms of price rises among on the 35 medium- and  large-sized cities in the country. According to Mr. Zeng, the  overall opening of grain prices and the rising adjustment of  fares and charges for energy and transportation last year  resulted in the prices of fine and coarse food grain increasing  by 37 percent and 44 percent respectively and the prices of  pork, eggs and chicken which were related to the grain prices  increasing by 29 percent, 40 percent and 44 percent  respectively. Residents' wages income was, however, also raised  by an average 30 percent last year and its suburbs' farmers'  income from their production by 40 percent.    NPC [National People's Congress] deputies from Guangdong  criticized the province in its talking about agriculture while  not carrying their talk into practice, resulting in a reduction  of grain output in three consecutive years. Guangzhou, as the  capital of the province, saw retail prices and prices for  people's daily expenses respectively rising to the second  highest and the fourth highest in the country. Mayor of the  city, Mr. Li Ziliu, said in his explanation of this problem that  the rapid price growth in some commodities such as steel  products could not be kept under control by localities.    Nanning, capital of Guangxi, suffered 25.1 percent increase  of prices for residents' daily expenses and 24.1 percent growth  in retail prices last year, respectively ranking the city second  and third in the country. According to analysis by the mayor of  the city, Mr. Xie Ruxuan, there were three reasons for the price  rise. First, the absolute value of prices in the city had been  low for a long time in the past since the city was listed as a  coastal opening city until the year before last year because of  military reasons; second, the economy in the city started its  rapid development last year with investment in fixed assets  reaching RMB 1.9 billion, 90 percent up over the previous year;  and third, residents' daily expenses in the city last year  increased by 47 percent.

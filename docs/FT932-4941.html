			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: Plymouth university development The University of Plymouth has awarded a Pounds 10.4m contract to AMEC BUILDING for new student accommodation and lecture theatre complex (shown above in an architect's impression). The project, which will provide the university with accommodation for an extra 430 students, is due for completion next year. As well as student accommodation, there are two-50 seater seminar rooms, a 250-seat lecture theatre, refectory and an underground car park. The architects for the largely six-storey project in Gibbon Street, Plymouth, are Eaton Manning Wilson and Associates. In addition to this development, the university has spent over Pounds 400,000 extensively refurbishing a terrace of late Victorian houses, also in Gibbon Street, opposite the new complex. These are providing 48 additional student residential places. Dr Michael Gillett, the university's deputy vice-chancellor (Resources), said: 'Our upgrading of these houses, plus our recent refurbishment of the Pitts Memorial Hall as a 180-seat lecture hall, means the university will have spent a further half-million pounds on improvements to this area of Plymouth. 'This is in addition to the Pounds 10.4 million cost of building what we believe will be an attractive asset to the city.'</p>

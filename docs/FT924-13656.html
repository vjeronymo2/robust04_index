			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Litigation threat to auditors outlined LEGAL action against auditors is the most serious threat facing the accounting profession, the World Congress of Accountants in Washington heard yesterday. Mr David Smithers, president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, said: 'Unless we solve the problem of liability there will not be another World Congress.' Mr Smithers was discussing the recent ADollars 1.1bn claim against KPMG Peat Marwick as auditors to Tricontinental, the merchant banking arm of the State Bank of Australia. Total outstanding claims in the country now exceed ADollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.1bn). That case was overshadowed this month by the Pounds 8bn claim against Ernst &amp; Whinney and Price Waterhouse in London for their role as auditors to Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which collapsed last year. Speakers said an important role in controlling litigation could be played by auditors using more sophisticated risk management in chosing clients. Mr Smithers said nearly half of litigation was driven by poor risk management. Mr Richard Murray, chairman of Minet Global Professional Services, the indemnity insurer, stressed that auditors did not cause financial losses, but were finding themselves held responsible for them when a collapse took place. He said insurers were at the point of refusing to provide professional indemnity cover for accountants, and that there might be a need for governments to step in.</p>

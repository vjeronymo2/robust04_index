			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (6): Low costs, ready resources - Frank McGurty explains why the region is a magnet for biotechnology Greater Philadelphia is to biotechnology what the San Francisco Bay area is to computer science. With its rich stock of trained scientists, plentiful sources of venture capital and a deep base of medical schools and research laboratories, the area is a hothouse for budding life science companies. Over the past decade, more than 100 start-up biotech companies have sprouted and flourished in the region. Cephalon, located in suburban West Chester, is typical. Set up in 1987 by a research team from DuPont, the company is engaged in developing new drugs to treat neuro-degenerative disorders. Initial capital came from local funds set up to help young biotech businesses get on their feet. 'We really are in the centre of a diverse biotechnical community here,' says Jason Rubin, vice-president of corporate communications. Dozens of established enterprises - big and small, foreign and domestic - have been lured to the region by the concentration of resources, the low cost of doing business and the attractive lifestyle it offers. Last year, Camus-Landanger, a tiny French medical devices supplier, set up shop in Newtown Square, about five miles south-east of Philadelphia. It was no coincidence that Boiron-Borneman, a leading French supplier of homeopathic medicines, had decided to expand across town. 'The managerial pool is available. Taken together with the science, and the venture capital, we have all the ingredients for entrepreneurship,' says Peter Sears, head of SR One, an investment arm of SmithKline Beecham. His company is the fifth largest venture capital fund serving Philadelphia. All told, there is nearly Dollars 2bn available for financing local biotech projects. The enterprising heart of the industry lies just west of the city limits on US Route 202, where some 30 small research companies have clustered along 'Medical Mile'. Dozens more are scattered around the area. But a stalwart base of multinational pharmaceutical companies has powered the industry's growth engine as well. Merck, DuPont, Wyeth Labs, McNeil, SmithKline Beecham and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer all have strong presences in the area. With so much activity, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals are the fastest growing sector of the regional economy. Their strength has helped offset a painful contraction in a manufacturing base which has lost 66,000 jobs since 1988. The story is not entirely positive. The wave of restructuring sweeping US businesses has not spared the drug sector, which is bracing itself for lean times after national healthcare reform is enacted later this year. In Philadelphia, however, the two-tier structure of the industry has softened the blow. 'In the pharmaceutical business, there has been a lot of down-sizing, and some of these people are very good managers and researchers. Many of them have been snapped up by the small companies,' says Mr Sears. Indeed, the two sides enjoy a symbiotic relationship. The big companies offer a rich pool of talent from which startups can draw. The small biotechs, meanwhile, represent promising sources of new products for drug giants willing to enter into joint ventures and marketing deals. The area's five medical schools and a clutch of research institutes, such as the Fox Chase Cancer Center, provide biotech companies with ready access to clinical testing facilities. Despite its wealth of resources, Philadelphia would be less fertile ground for biotechs without some careful nurturing by groups such as The Ben Franklin Partnership, a private, non-profit organisation funded by the state and federal governments. 'The mission of our organisation is to build economic competitiveness through technology and innovations,' says Philip Singermann, head of the Ben Franklin Technology Center, which administers the programme in the area. One of the ways it does this is by helping fledgling companies stay on aloft while they are in the early stages of developing viable commercial products. Often the lead time is lengthy. Symphony Pharmaceuticals, located in Malvern, Pennsylvania, needed five years to develop an innovative drug to protect the brain after injuries. The partnership has provided Dollars 85,000 over two years to help the company over the hump. The centre is also involved in assisting scientists to bring their research from the laboratory to the marketplace. Together with British Technology Group USA, a leading technology transfer organisation, it sponsors a consortium of universities, research institutions and venture capital firms known as the Start Technology Partnership. Start's mission begins further upstream, by identifying a promising technology before the university which invented it signs up with a corporate sponsor. The idea is to add value to the innovation beforehand, through further refinements or by seeking wider applications. That allows the institution to realise a better return on its work. 'We try to push as much back to the technology source as possible, and build off the resources of the member organisation,' says Andrew Neighbor, the director. 'We are very much the hub of a big wheel.'</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / People: Valerie Strachan promoted at Excise board Valerie Strachan, one of two deputy chairmen at Customs and Excise, has been promoted to the chairmanship of the board, in succession to Sir Brian Unwin (see above). The appointment is at permanent secretary level, making her the third woman currently - alongside Stella Rimington, boss of MI5, and Barbara Mills, director of public prosecutions - to attain the highest grade within the civil service. For the past three years, Strachan, 52, has been director general responsible for the internal taxation and customs group, which has put her very much in the spotlight during the run-up to 1993; during the UK presidency she chaired the group of member state officials in Brussels charged with the indirect tax and customs arrangements to come into effect from the beginning of this year. Speaking on the fourth day of the operation of the single market, she admits it is 'too soon to be totally confident about everything. But so far as the immediate effects are concerned - what happened to travellers - it seems to have gone well, and people are generally satisfied we have done what we said we would. As for the impact on business, it is too soon to say. I expect it will be a little rough round the edges before everything settles down.' Consequently, she signals that 'making sure the single market works' will be one of her principal tasks in the next year or two. She is keen to stress that, while there have been a number of headline successes in combating drug-smuggling, some 'very big challenges remain'. And, despite its essentially regulatory role, the department has various standards to meet as regards the citizen's charter. Recently, the top job at Customs &amp; Excise has appeared to alternate between an internal appointee - as Strachan is - and an outside candidate - as was Sir Brian. Strachan herself joined the department from university in 1961, but she has worked elsewhere within Whitehall, including the Home Office, the Treasury and the Cabinet Office. Her contribution to the European cause was last year recognised when she won the UK Woman of Europe award. ***** Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group, has appointed John Cheffins (above) as the company's new director for civil engines following the departure last month of Frank Turner to take over as the new managing director of Lucas Aerospace. Cheffins, who is 45, has spent all his working life with Rolls-Royce. After joining the company's Derby operations as an undergraduate apprentice, Cheffins was transferred to Rolls-Royce's Canadian operations in 1975. He became president of Rolls-Royce Industries Canada in 1989. Cheffins will be replaced by Barry Eccleston as president and chief executive of the Canadian operations. Like Cheffins, Eccleston is also 45 and joined Rolls-Royce as an undergraduate apprentice. He has worked for the company in Japan as well as holding several marketing posts, including four years with International Aero Engines (IAE), the US-based aero-engine consortium of which Rolls-Royce is a leading partner. ***** Thorntons, the chocolate manufacturer and retailer, has strengthened its board with the internal appointment of five new directors. John Coyle, John Culverhouse, Nigel Etchelss, Peter Heaps, and David Mitchell were all divisional directors of the company before their appointment to the board. John Thornton, chairman, said all five would 'bring with them considerable experience of the business, skill and expertise'. Since the group's listing in 1988, its main board - comprising himself, Michael Thornton, deputy chairman, Alan Goodwin, finance director, and two non-executive directors - and the divisional directors had in practice worked together as one board. The new appointments simply formalised this position. Thorntons, 48 per cent owned by the Thornton family which founded the business in 1911, is currently expanding its UK and European operations. It plans to increase the number of UK shops from 395 to 650 in the next five years.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Blue Arrow leaves SFO reputation in tatters: Failure comes as Maxwell and Polly Peck cases await trial City regulators wait in wings to be enforcers THE ROUT of the Serious Fraud Office in the Blue Arrow fraud trial yesterday left the reputation of the prosecutors in tatters and again cast doubt on the high-profile pursuit of financial fraud adopted by the authorities in the UK in recent years. The latest failure comes at a sensitive time. With two other big prosecution cases being assembled - over the Maxwell affair and the collapse of Polly Peck International - the Blue Arrow fiasco strikes at the heart of the way such cases are prepared and staged. 'It looks like another nail in the coffin of the SFO,' said one senior City regulator, who refused to be named. A partner of one of the biggest City law firms, who also declined to be named, said: 'They aren't of the calibre of the people they are trying to prosecute. They don't pay enough. They aren't a top-flight team.' Memories of other failures are still fresh in the City's mind: the banks and individuals who were acquitted during the course of the Blue Arrow trial; the abandonment of the second Guinness trial and the decision not even to begin the third; the dismissal of the planned prosecution of former directors of Alexander Howden, the Lloyd's of London insurance broking group. Anguish about the way these trials have been mounted, and the personal pressure put on the defendants in each case has intensified - aided by the widely publicised illnesses of Mr Ernest Saunders, former chairman of Guinness, and Mr Roger Seelig, a director of Morgan Grenfell, Guinness's advisers. After nearly five years and a trial that cost more than Pounds 35m, the acquittal of the only four defendants convicted in the Blue Arrow trial added to that anguish in the City. In spite of joy in some quarters - 'Isn't it wonderful]' was the spontaneous reaction of a personal assistant who had worked with Jonathan Cohen - there was widespread disquiet about the futility of the prosecu-tion. Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, summed up the prevailing mood. Bemoaning the 'appalling waste of money and resources', he said: 'We must be able to find better ways of doing things.' According to some City lawyers, the SFO has been the victim of its own prosecution policy. Set up four years ago to pursue big and complex frauds, it decided from the outset to generate voluminous lists of charges against defendants, apparently with the view that it was better to get part of its case to stick than to focus on only one aspect of a fraud and risk failure. 'They brought more charges than they needed to and made the cases more complex as a result,' said Mr Mark Dawkins, a partner at City law firm Simmons &amp; Simmons. Blue Arrow may be a throw-back to those early days. However, the rejection of a raft of offences against Mr Asil Nadir, who was charged more recently in the Polly Peck case, suggests that the SFO's prosecution policy has not changed entirely. With the SFO stumbling again, City regulators were yesterday dusting down their credentials, preparing to put themselves forward as the best enforcers of the complex rules and regulations that govern financial markets. However, the need to work closely with the SFO, and concern about raising political hackles in Whitehall, left the regulators reluctant to go public with their views. 'When this case was started, there was no other way to go,' said the head of one regulatory body. He suggested that the Financial Services Act, which came into force after the events that led to the Blue Arrow trial, provides an alternative mechanism without involving the criminal justice system. However, while there is a widespread feeling that the City could deal with such complex cases more quickly than the judicial system, by exercising its traditional sanction of blackballing miscreants, few believe that that would be a politically acceptable way forward. 'You could make quite a strong argument for saying that the City could sort its own messes out better,' said Sir Andrew. 'But is society going to accept that that is a good idea?' One fear that persists outside the City is whether the regulatory bodies - which are still made up largely of market practitioners rather than independent regulators - deal sufficiently severely with wrongdoers. A test of the regulators' resolve may come now with the Blue Arrow acquittals. At least one of those prosecuted is already thought to have made an attempt to gain recognition from the Securities and Futures Authority. The SFA, while saying it will look at each case individually, has hinted that it may take a favourable attitude to any applications by suggesting that it would not try to reopen questions about indi-viduals raised during court cases. 'We will most certainly not try to second-guess the court,' said Mr Geoffrey Turner, SFA membership secretary.</p>

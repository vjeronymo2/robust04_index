			<p>BFN     [Text] According to information from the eastern sector of  the south, the Israeli occupation forces have deployed troop  reinforcements and armored vehicles in their Kawkaba and Suq  al-Khan positions. They also strafed the surrounding hills and  woods and shelled the hills and woods in Mashgharah and 'Ayn  al-Tinah.    Enemy aircraft meanwhile continued their psychological  warfare against the citizens of the south. Helicopters overflew  Iqlim al- Tuffah and al-Nabatiyah this afternoon.    This morning Kafr Rumman's eastern hills were the target of  sporadic bombardment with incendiary shells from the enemy's  positions on the al-Tuhrah Hills.    In another development, the citizen Jum'ah Shihadah  al-Khalid  died this morning when a fragmentation bomb detonated inside a  grove in the al-Shawakir areas south of Tyre where he was  tilling the land. His body was transferred to Tyre's Jabal  'Amil Hospital. It is noteworthy that the al-Shawakir area is  close to al-Rashidiyah camp, which was formerly the target of  repeated Israeli artillery attacks. The citizens appealed to  the concerned officials to comb the area to make sure there are  no more unexploded shells.    Timor Goksel, the official spokesman for the UN Interim  Force  in Lebanon, announced that a soldier serving with the Fijian  contingent died today of injuries sustained during a clash with  Hizballah last Friday.</p>

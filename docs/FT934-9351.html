			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Lib Dems in fresh racism charge THE LIBERAL Democrat party was embroiled in a racism row last night after party officials condemned a leaflet issued by its activists in east London, but said they had no power to discipline the authors. Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, was said to be 'ballistic' about the leaflet, in which an article about violence against old people is illustrated with a picture of a black boxer. The leaflet was distributed to residents of Tower Hamlets, a Liberal Democrat-controlled borough where Mr Derek Beackon, of the far-right British National Party, won a council by-election last month. Leaflets issued by Liberal Democrat activists in Tower Hamlets have been vetted by party headquarters since Mr Ashdown set up an inquiry into the publication of another allegedly racist leaflet during the by-election campaign. Party officials said the latest leaflet was allowed to go ahead because a copy sent to Mr Graham Elson, the party's general secretary, was blurred. Mr Elson said the party was 'determined to stamp this out as soon as possible'. However, he said officials had no power to ban the publication of future leaflets, or to suspend or expel the authors until the inquiry reports. Mr Jack Straw, shadow local government minister, said he planned to refer the latest leaflet to Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general, for a ruling on a possible prosecution for incitement to racial hatred.</p>

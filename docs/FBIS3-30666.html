It is rather difficult to understand how someone could  invite  Zhirinovskiy, who a week ago spoke in an inappropriate manner  about the Czech Republic and its political life, Zieleniec said.    Miroslav Sladek's SPR-RSC today invited Zhirinovskiy to  visit  the Czech Republic with the goal of "obtaining objective  information about the programme and objectives of Zhirinovskiy's  party." Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), which emerged victorious in the recent Russian  parliamentary elections, told REUTER that "the Czech Republic  will lose Moravia soon and only Prague and a few breweries in  which the beer will turn sour will be left of it."    Zieleniec voiced the view that what is important in the  world  from the international point of view is also important for the  Czech Republic. He said he firmly believed that the  developments in Russia were important not only for the Czech  Republic but for Europe and the whole world. "It is a matter of  dire significance for all of us whether or not democracy will be  installed in Russia and whether or not a market economy will be  stabilised there," Zieleniec said.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Reed lifts profits by 4% to Pounds 232m REED International, the publishing and information group, warned yesterday it expected the pace of recovery from recession in its most important markets to be slower than in previous cyclical upturns. The warning came from Mr Peter Davis, the Reed chairman, as he announced a 4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 232m for the year to the end of March. The half-year to September had seen a 22 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 85.3m. The Reed chairman confessed that a note of optimism expressed with the interim results had turned out to be premature, though there were now some signs 'which could turn out to be positive'. Reed's operating profit rose 9 per cent to Pounds 271m, earnings per share were 4 per cent higher at 29.3p, and operating cash-flow was up 32 per cent at Pounds 293m - 108 per cent of operating profit. Reed said its dividend for the year would increase by 7 per cent to 16p. Reed's share price rose 6p to 580p on the London Stock Exchange in response to the news. Mr Davis said the results achieved during the recession were 'further evidence of the benefits of the strategy to concentrate on publishing and information businesses'. In spite of advertising-based businesses being severely hit, the profit margin on sales was 16.6 per cent. Five years ago Reed took a strategic decision to get out of manufacturing businesses such as paint, pulp and packaging and concentrate on publishing. The results of that decision are being assessed as part of a review of strategy. Further consolidation is likely, although acquisitions will probably outweigh disposals. One acquisition, if it became available and if the financial terms were right, might be the Official Airline Guides, bought by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Among the main Reed businesses, consumer publishing suffered a 22.9 per cent drop in operating profit to Pounds 52.4m, business-to-business publishing saw a modest improvement of 9.6 per cent to Pounds 36.4m, exhibitions rose 26 per cent to Pounds 30.5m, and reference publishing soared 64 per cent to Pounds 31.8m.

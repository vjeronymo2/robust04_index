			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> BOYS' ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SADDLEBACK HOLDS BACK TUSTIN, 56-48  </P> <P> Saddleback High School, the top-ranked boys' basketball team in the county, had  its second scare in a week Tuesday, holding off Tustin in the final minute to  secure a 56-48 victory in a Sea View League game at Tustin.  </P> <P> Last Friday, the Roadrunners pulled out a victory over Corona del Mar in the  final quarter.  </P> <P> Against Tustin, Saddleback (23-1 overall, 9-0 in league play) had its lead cut  to two points in the final minute before sinking six consecutive free throws.  </P> <P> "We have been suffering from a loss of intensity lately," Saddleback Coach Pat  Quinn said. "This time of the year there's no real goal. We've got to get back  in line.  </P> <P> "Give them credit. They played real well and hustled a lot. They were after  every loose ball."  </P> <P> Tustin (12-11, 3-6) moved within one point of the Roadrunners twice in the  fourth quarter, the second time with 3:10 left when Jason Moore hit two free  throws to make the score 46-45.  </P> <P> But then Saddleback went on a 10-2 run, including eight free throws by center  Malru Dottin, to put away the victory.  </P> <P> Tustin had one more chance after Dylan Stieler's three-point play brought the  Tillers within two, 50-48, with 47 seconds left.  </P> <P> But Sean Simon made both ends of a one-and-one and Dottin sank four free throws  within the final 11 seconds to close out the scoring.  </P> <P> Dottin led all scorers with 27 points, including 13 of 14 free throws.  Saddleback made 19 of 25 from the line.  </P> <P> Tustin, behind three three-pointers by Cheavly Ly, built a six-point  second-quarter lead before Saddleback ran off 10 straight points on the way to  a 27-24 halftime lead.  </P> <P> The Tillers rallied to tie the score, 35-35, with 2:20 left in the third  quarter and then moved to within 44-43 with 4:48 left in the game.

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Japanese group pays Pounds 7m for Pilkington offshoot PILKINGTON, the UK glassmaker, is selling Pilkington Reinforcements, a wholly-owned subsidiary, to Nippon Sheet Glass Group of Japan for a cash consideration of Pounds 7.4m. The disposal takes Pilkington a step forward in its reorganisation strategy that was outlined at the end of last year after the group saw pre-tax profits fall 30 per cent in the six months to September to Pounds 103.2m. Also at the end of last year Pilkington again became the subject of takeover rumours as BTR, which had bid for the company back in 1986, raised its stake from 3.75 per cent to 4.04 per cent. Mr Andrew Robb, finance director of Pilkington, stressed that the disposals were motivated purely by strategic considerations and were not related to any bid specul-ation. However, after the disappointing results, and after BTR had increased its stake, Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, admitted that the group needed to consider divesting itself of non-core businesses and eliminating loss-making operations in order to focus more closely on its major flat and safety glass activities. Since the beginning of this year the group has already sold two companies in the insulation business, closed its sheet glass plant in New Zealand and its Australian high rise curtain walling business. It also sold part of its 6.8 per cent shareholding in Taiwan Glass Industry Corporation to Nippon Sheet Glass and is in the process of selling a 50 per cent stake of Pilkington Optronics to Thomson CSF, the French defence electronics group. Pilkington Reinforcements, which processes glass fibre filaments and yarns into reinforcement cords for use mainly in vehicle engines and industrial machinery, did make a profit last year and the sale price to Nippon Sheet Glass is at a premium to net asset value. But it is not central to Pilkington's operations, particularly as Pilkington does not make the raw material fibre that goes into the reinforcement cords, it said. Nippon Sheet Glass, which makes flat and safety glass, mainly for the Japanese market, is involved in the reinforcement business through its Nippon Glass Fiber subsidiary. The Japanese group has been increasing its exposure to international markets. Apart from acquiring part of Pilkington's stake in Taiwan Glass Industry Corporation, last year it bought a 20 per cent stake in Libbey-Owens-Ford, Pilkington's US subsidiary, where it is represented on the board. It also has a joint interest with Pilkington in a company in Taiwan that makes glass for the auto industry and a Korean glass company.</p>

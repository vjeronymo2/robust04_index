			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Defining the fiscal deficit THE DEBATE over the UK budget deficit is taking place in a fog of spurious assertions about how much of it is 'cyclical' and how much is 'structural'. It is a crucial question, but the truth is that no-one will know the answer for a number of years, if ever. In the meantime, the government should focus more on reducing the deficit and rather less on defining it. At a meeting of European Community finance ministers Kenneth Clarke will today be defending the British government's economic plans against the charge that they betray undue optimism about the Pounds 50bn budget deficit. The criticism is partly based on John Major's claim that 70 per cent of the gap is cyclical, and will therefore fall as the economy picks up. EC officials consider this dangerously complacent, citing OECD estimates that less than half of the deficit, now 8 per cent of GDP, can be so summarily dismissed. The rest, they say, is a structural increase in spending that requires further attention. Which is right? The sheer size of the gap between deficit 'cyclists' and 'structuralists' is a good clue that the desire for precision is misplaced. Both sides could make things clearer, however, if they bothered to separate two distinct issues. First, what part of the rise in public borrowing has occurred as a result of the recession? And second, how much of that will go away as the economy picks up again? The first question can be answered relatively easily. Unfortunately, it is not the one upon which the sustainability of the British public finances depends. Lower tax revenues The automatic effects on the budget of the recent decline in UK output are quite well understood. If, in 1990, the British economy had continued to grow at a steady pace, output would now be around 7 per cent higher. Losing that output to the recession led to higher public spending and lower tax revenues which between them left the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement 4.75 per cent higher as a percentage of GDP than it would otherwise have been. Where Britain is headed depends on how much of that lost 7 per cent of total output is still on offer, and how fast the economy can make it up. On the first, most accept that the length of the recession has taken its toll on industrial capacity and skill levels. Reasonable estimates suggest that the amount of usable spare capacity - or 'output gap' - is closer to 3 per cent. In theory, the economy could safely grow faster than its trend growth rate of 2.25-2.50 per cent per annum, until at least this degree of slack was used up. But whether the UK is soon in a position to achieve faster than trend growth may depend less on the output gap than on the speed of world recovery, domestic consumption patterns and the state of the labour market, all of which consistently defy forecasters' predictions. Accelerating debt The size of the UK Public Sector Borrowing Requirement sets a clock ticking on Britain's uncertain growth prospects, because of the cumulative effect on the national debt. If British GDP were to grow 3 per cent on average over the next three years, the PSBR should fall to around 4 per cent of GDP in 1997. By then, consistently high levels of public borrowing would have increased the national debt to 55 percent of GDP compared with 42 per cent in 1992. If, however, yearly growth averaged only 1.5 per cent, the PSBR would be almost unchanged and the debt ratio would be rising towards 75 percent. This kind of accelerating debt would have too many of the traits of the 1976 crisis. Mr Clarke may be unable to control either the degree of spare capacity in the economy or the rate at which it grows over the next few years. He can, however, determine how much any given rate of growth goes towards reducing the PSBR. Considering the stakes involved, he should commit himself to tightening fiscal policy further, as a hedge against disappointing growth. If this turns out to be over-cautious, he could always compensate by lowering interest rates. Better that he lose the prize for labelling the deficit correctly than risk the horrors of an old-fashioned public debt crisis.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Recruitment: HRM: big hat but no cattle? Human resource management (HRM) has been the buzz-phrase in personnel in the past decade. All the management journals are awash with words such as 'commitment', 'employee involvement', 'profit sharing', and 'merit pay'. Unfortunately, virtually no HRM professionals, and few outsiders, have stood back and asked what all this activity has achieved. Our research shows that the description of personnel specialists as having 'big hat, no cattle' - lots of pretensions but few results - is absolutely right. Fortunately a survey covering over 2,000 workplaces has recently become available for analysis. This nationally representative survey - the Workplace Industrial Relations Survey - contains detailed information on companies using the new and the old style industrial relations. We have used the survey to see whether or not HRM practices and new industrial relations deliver better management-employee relations than their more traditional counterparts. Managers responsible for personnel matters were asked to rate management-employee relations on a seven-point scale, ranging from very good to very poor. Six different aspects of HRM were analysed - the role of the personnel manager, industrial relations procedures, payment systems, work flexibility, employee involvement and the status of the workforce. The results will be bitterly disappointing to HRM enthusiasts. Almost none of their techniques appear to improve management-employee relations. Perhaps the most stunning findings concern the role of the personnel specialists and directors themselves. One-fifth of workplaces have a personnel specialist. Those workplaces have much worse relations between management and labour than those without. One objection to this finding is that the arrow of causation goes the other way: that workplaces with a poor climate might need the specialist personnel managers. We investigated this possible explanation but it was not supported by the evidence. Systems which link pay to performance of either the individual worker or the individual company have grown in leaps and bounds in the past few years. These pay systems are an integral part of HRM - promoting the individual interest over the collective. Now a quarter of all workplaces have job evaluation schemes and merit pay. And half have some form of profit sharing or employee share ownership scheme. Yet not a single one of these systems appears to improve the climate of employee-management relations. HRM also emphasises the importance of a multi-skilled, flexible labour force. Yet where management has attempted to reduce demarcation and promote new work patterns the climate is worse than where no such attempts were made. This hardly suggests high quality personnel management. Employee involvement and commitment are supposed to be improved by providing workers with a voice. Yet neither the existence of joint consultative committees nor performance appraisals, which should provide a good feedback between management and workers, improves the climate. Climate is improved where work teams meet at least once a month to discuss their performance in problem-solving groups such as 'quality circles'. By contrast, mere team briefing meetings or simply cascading information down the hierarchy results in a worse climate. It is clear that proper communication has to be a two-way process. HRM workplaces are more likely to treat their manual and non-manual employees in a similar fashion - the 'single status' policy. We studied seven different aspects of such policies covering, for example, pay, clocking-on, the availability of free or subsidised meals and pensions. On all but one of these indicators of single status companies which practised them had a worse climate of industrial relations than those that did not. We also studied how union strength and structure influences relations between management and labour. A weak union is the worst of all worlds. Workplaces with strong unions and those without unions both have better relations than workplaces where management simply recognises the union for collective bargaining. The results of our research suggest that it is time for the HRM professionals to evaluate what they have achieved. The question needs to be asked why employee involvement, 'single status' policies, new systems linking pay to individual performance and - in particular - the specialisation of the personnel function have failed to deliver better management-employee relations.

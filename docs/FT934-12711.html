			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Warning against early EC reform PORTUGAL and Spain said yesterday they opposed any changes to European Community institutions before four new members are admitted by 1996, Reuter reports from Brussels. The Portuguese foreign minister, Mr Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, said after talks with his Spanish counterpart, Mr Javier Solana: 'The Community can't function in the same way with 16 as it did with 12. But we don't think this is a convenient time for great institutional changes,' he said. Mr Solana said he agreed. Mr Durao Barroso earlier expressed his opposition to immediate changes in the EC's administrative structures in an article published on Monday in the Lisbon newspaper Publico. Some member states, including Britain, want changes in the way the EC functions before it welcomes in Finland, Norway, Austria and Sweden. Britain has argued that the rotation of the presidency of the EC should be changed to ensure that the troika of present, previous and succeeding presidents should not be dominated by a series of small countries or by countries from the same geographical area.</p>

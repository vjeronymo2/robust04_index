			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: The empire cooks back - The revival of a cuisine fit for sultans in the kitchens of Istanbul. Old cookery books are being scoured in search of lost kebabs and forgotten pilaffs. Restaurants are opening dedicated to the cuisine of the palace and the pashas rather than the food of the bazaar. Even for the most jaded palate, Ottoman food is an adventure. Among its delights are sour dried plum, tripe soup with garlic vinegar and chicken pudding. In a domed and arcaded courtyard beside the Suleymaniye Mosque, built by Suleyman the Magnificent in the 1550s, the Sultan established a soup-kitchen where the poor and the pious were fed at his expense. Last year a superb Ottoman restaurant, called Daruzziyafe, opened in the courtyard and the adjacent halls. Among the best dishes in the long and elaborate menu are red lentil soup (Suleymaniye Corbasi), artichokes stuffed with minced meat, a special kofte (minced meat) of lamb, chicken and pistachios wrapped in wafer-pastry (Yufkali Daruzziyafe koftesi) and asure, a Ramadan pudding made of nuts and fruit. Since the restaurant site is still part of the Suleymaniye Mosque complex, alcohol is not served. Who needs wine, when sherbet of grapes, strawberries or the hips of wild roses are automatically brought to your table? In a traditional part of Istanbul, south of the Golden Horn, the Daruzziyafe has a faintly austere atmosphere: it is especially popular during Ramadan, with the congregation of the Suleymaniye mosque. The Tugra restaurant, on the other hand, is in a different world: a 19th century sultan's palace on the banks of the Bosphorus, which has been transformed, in the last two years, into the Ciragan Palace Hotel, the most sumptuous in Istanbul. Vedat Basaran, the restaurant manager, trained in London, and spent two years researching Ottoman food, teaching himself Ottoman script in order to read old cookery books. The son of a palace chef, Karamehmet Zennegolu, provided him with another link with the lost world of Ottoman food. Ottoman cuisine, a mixture of Central Asian, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean influences, has always been sophisticated, some dishes requiring days of preparation. In every self-respecting pasha's household two sets of vegetables were served at meals: cold vegetables in oil and hot vegetables cooked in butter. In the Tugra restaurant, lavishly redecorated in the style called 'Saudi Hollywood', the food is prepared with a devotion to detail worthy of the palace kitchens. Fish is grilled on wood cut from a fresh bay tree, so that the heat blends the flavours. Quails are cooked inside giant aubergines, and lamb is grilled with peeled root of aubergine, in order to absorb the flavour of what Ottoman cooks considered the 'king of vegetables'. Among the puddings Hunkar muhallebi, milk pudding with wild strawberries and pistachios, is delicious. I hope the famous Ottoman pudding called tavuk gogsu, available in many local shops, will soon appear on the menu. Made of chicken meat beaten to a smooth pulp and then cooked with milk, sugar and cinnamon, it was frequently served to foreign guests: In the late 19th century the deposed Sultan Murat V was immured in Ciragan Palace for 28 years, by his brother Sultan Abdulhamit II. The best French brandy and champagne helped console him for the loss of his throne and his freedom. Guests in the Tugra restaurant can follow the Sultan's example, but they should try some Turkish wine. The Kavaklidere company produces good products. In spite of the grandeur of these two restaurants, and the excellent service, on some evenings, overwhelmed by crowds, the food can be bland. Just as enjoyable was the Asithane Restaurant, in a simple district of Istanbul beside the Byzantine splendour of the Kariye Camii. The chef Rasit Ozdemir is from Bolu, a province famed for its cooks. His fava (broad bean paste) and Visneli Ekmek Tatlisi, bread soaked in sour cherry syrup - a distant Turkish cousin of summer pudding - were especially good. Pilaff or pilav is a speciality of Turkish cooking: the crack troops of the Ottoman army, the Janissaries, loved it so much that they used rice cauldrons on regimental banners. In all three restaurants the pilaff was excellent and the Asithane restaurant served a variety new to me and my Turkish hosts: Kadirga Pilav (rice with almonds, pistachios and herbs served au gratin). All three restaurants provide a reinterpretation, rather than a revival, of Ottoman cuisine. The energetic young manager of Daruzziyafe, Alper Okutan, admits: 'Sometimes you have to modernise something. You don't have the exact material.' Vedat Basaran is determined to introduce what he calls 'a new concept of Ottoman cuisine', adapted to the demands of the modern restaurant, and the need for attractive presentation on the plate. He says: 'We are trying to bring out the old recipes according to new methods.' Instead of whole chickens, stuffed with pistachios, oriental rice and spinach, visitors to the Tugra restaurant are served stuffed breast of chicken, which used to be served to Ottoman dignitaries. The deadening influence of nouvelle cuisine is apparent: a few mixed vegetables on the side of a plate often replace the traditional platefuls of the same vegetable. The iceberg lettuce has ousted local varieties. Some members of the Turkish Food Lovers' Association say that they are happiest in the simple restaurants behind the fish market in Beyoglu. The revival of Ottoman cuisine is part of the wider reappraisal of their position in the world, being undertaken by a minority among the new generation of educated Turks. They combine knowledge of the latest management techniques with a desire to rediscover traditions which they have lostsince Kemal Ataturk replaced the Ottoman Empire with the Turkish Republic in 1923. All three restaurants had musicians singing or playing soothing traditional Turkish music. Since the Ottoman Empire was a multinational state, this new interest in the past is far from nationalistic. Dishes with Azeri, Albanian and even Greek names are on the menu. Vedat Basaran, originally from Yugoslavia, says: 'Ottoman was not only Turkish, it was part of a huge food culture.' Older generations, brought up in veneration of the Ataturkist republic, are bewildered. Information: Daruzziyafe, Sifahane Cad. 6, 34440 Suleymaniye. Tel: 5118414. Fax 5261891.

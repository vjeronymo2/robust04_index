			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the impact the second and third possible FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control strategies (listed above) would have on military  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readiness, and the already scheduled decrease in military  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft operations, EPA proposes that military aircraft be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempt from the FIP. EPA requests comments on excluding military  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft from the FIP control strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed FIP program will control mobile source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from other base operations under the control of DOD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These sources include APUs, GSE, captive vehicle fleets,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> privately-owned vehicles, and any other mobile sources operated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within an air base's boundaries. The military bubble also will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include DOD-controlled non-aircraft emissions sources that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operate at locations other than military bases, such as ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment based at civilian airports. The bubble will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basin-wide rather than air base-specific, given the variability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduced by base closure and realignment activities, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the need for operational flexibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes to impose a declining cap on total emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for controlling these other base operations emissions from all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air bases within each FIP area. This avoids the difficulty of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having to allocate baseline emissions among multiple entities (e.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g., perhaps down to individual air bases). This approach also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> takes advantage of the military's centralized command structure;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOD (or each branch of the armed forces) can mandate air base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance at a certain emissions level (excluding aircraft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions) commensurate with environmental objectives while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintaining the flexibility to stage specific missions and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions among various bases inside or outside of the basin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This control strategy provides individual base commanders with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the flexibility to implement specific operational and procedural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures necessary to achieve the specified emissions goal, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoids having EPA attempt to implement specific control measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for military operations. The centralized command structure means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a single entity is the focus of the control strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An absolute emissions cap approach does not require a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projection of activity in future years, one of the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumptions for a program based on allowable emissions per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity unit. Finally, a control strategy that fundamentally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relies upon the environmental efficiency of operations, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emission rate-based program proposed for commercial aircraft,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appears less desirable for military air bases given the inherent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unpredictability of military operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also seeks comments on the second alternative approach,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to establish a declining cap for an emissions bubble which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes military aircraft emissions and therefore requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions in aircraft emissions also. Further, comments are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested on the desirability of the third possible control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach, an approach that includes aircraft emissions but is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on a target average emission rate per aircraft operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a fee for emissions above the target. This third approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be similar to that being proposed today for commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aviation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

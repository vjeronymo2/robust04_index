			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Hedge funds wield their clout - Capital &amp; Credit Few dealers and investors can have been left in any doubt about the enormous muscle-power of the hedge funds as they stampeded through the European government bond markets last week. Heavy selling of government bond futures - and to a lesser extent of the cash bonds - by hedge funds led to sharp falls in the markets and left traditional pension and insurance fund managers standing on the sidelines wondering when the bloodbath was going to finish. 'It was like a juggernaut - you just wanted to get out of the way to avoid being crushed,' said one fund manager. Hedge funds are private investment pools which borrow large sums of money to trade securities and currencies in the financial markets. They are often managed very aggressively and can be highly geared. While the amount of money they manage is not known, the clout they exert in the financial markets is enormous. In the futures markets, trading volumes soared last week as the hedge and futures funds dominated activity. On the Paris-based Matif exchange, the Notional Bond futures contract - the most heavily traded futures contract in Europe - jumped to a daily volume of 404,422 lots last Thursday. The average daily volume for the contract in 1993 was 164,633 lots. The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, reported record volumes last Thursday, with 1.38m futures and options contracts traded, representing a nominal value of Pounds 270bn. Liffe's bund futures contract topped the 300,000 level to reach a record 317,595 contracts, while the long gilt futures contract hit a record 235,759 contracts. Not only was the volume staggering - dealers were reporting very large individual transactions, for example of 30,000 contracts in the bund futures market, corresponding to a nominal value of DM7.5bn. 'These are enormous positions: if you sell that kind of amount you are bound to move the market,' said one fund manager. Hedge funds vary considerably in size. The big players are those like George Soros's Quantum Fund, which took a hit on the unexpected rise of the yen against the dollar in the middle of February. Others are much smaller operations: 'Sometimes they just consist of a couple of guys trading out of their spare bedroom someplace in Bermuda or California - they get up in the middle of the night to catch the European bond markets,' says one dealer. So why have they been selling so heavily? Some made heavy losses on the yen/dollar exchange rate move and have had to cover them by liquidating other positions, for example in European government bonds. As these markets fell, some hedge funds were forced to close their positions in order to limit the size of their losses. In other cases, they had to put up more money to meet margin calls as the futures markets moved against them - and in order to meet these margin calls they may have had to liquidate other positions. While some market participants appear dazed by the whole tumultuous experience, others have been shaken into examining their relationships with the hedge funds rather more carefully. Preliminary figures suggest that hedge and futures funds made losses of up to 25 per cent in February, but lurking in the back of many people's minds is the fear of what would happen if a few of the hedge funds were to be wiped out completely - even though in many cases, the funds have a maximum draw-down in order to prevent losses beyond a certain cut-off point. 'The big funds are well-controlled and even though some of them have taken big hits, these probably are not life-threatening: if you have a fund with Dollars 40bn under management, it will be pursuing a variety of trading strategies. 'It might take a hit on three of them, but 10 of them are probably doing OK,' says one risk analyst. More worrying, however, is the position with smaller hedge funds: these might have a net asset value of between Dollars 10m and Dollars 50m and could be very highly geared: they are less likely to have widely diversified trading strategies so could be more vulnerable. The other area of concern regards the way in which positions are financed. The fund may borrow money from an investment bank using the fund's bond portfolio as collateral. As one investment bank put it: 'Say they give us bonds worth Dollars 100, we lend them Dollars 95 against the collateral, and that difference is to cover us in case the bond price goes down. 'But because there has been such a big push to do business with the hedge funds, the margins have gone down to zero.' This means that if the hedge fund went bust, the investment bank would be left holding the bonds, but it could find that after such a sharp market fall the bonds are worth much less than the money originally lent.</p>

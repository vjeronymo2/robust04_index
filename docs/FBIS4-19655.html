			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Durao Barroso has called on the  different sides in the Bosnian conflict to negotiate. Portugal  backs a diplomatic, not military, solution in Bosnia. Maria Rui  reports:    [Rui] Bosnia-Herzegovina was an inevitable topic for the  talks between the Portuguese foreign minister and his Slovene  counterpart. Durao Barroso received his Slovene counterpart this  morning and they signed a protocol providing for the lifting of  visa requirements. Slovenia is the only republic of former  Yugoslavia which has managed to establish a democracy, said  Durao Barroso. On the subject of Bosnia, he told Renascenca  that Portugal advocated the search for a political agreement.    [Begin Barroso recording] We continue to believe that the  main thing is to search for a political accord, via political  means. We said it very clearly two days ago at the General  Affairs [European Union ministerial] meeting in Luxembourg.  For us it is clear that responsibility for the situation lies  mainly with the Serbs. The Serbs have in fact surpassed certain  limits. It is important for NATO, in supporting the UN  resolutions and within the framework of the legitimacy of the  UN, to show the Serbs clearly that this type of behavior cannot  be tolerated. [end recording]    [Rui] As for the Bosnian prime minister's statement today  that the international community has condemned the Muslims to  death, Durao Barroso said:    [Begin Barroso recording] The international community has  condemned no one to death. The international community is doing  what it can. The UN has been doing what it can. In one or two  cases, perhaps there may have been a failure in communications,  a mistake in implementation. But it is totally wrong, when  there is a conflict in a certain region, to say it is the fault  of the rest of the world. [end recording]    [Rui] As for the situation in South Africa and the recent  accord between Inkatha, the ANC, and President de Klerk, Durao  Barroso is pleased.    [Begin Barroso recording] It is good; I am pleased. It is  good news. When I was in South Africa recently I met everyone,  I also spoke to Mr Buthelezi and, at the time, I urged him to  participate in the elections. We believe that it is always a  mistake not to be involved when it is a matter of the foundation  of a regime or the transition to a new regime. Those who remain  outside always lose, because in some way they exclude themselves  from the legitimacy of the new regime. [end recording]    [Rui] Durao Barroso also said that the Portuguese want to  stay in South Africa and that journalists have speculated much  about their return.</p>

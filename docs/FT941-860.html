			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: Ameritech to cut staff by 6,000 Ameritech, one of the US's seven regional telephone companies, announced that it would take a Dollars 335m charge in the first quarter to cover a planned cut of 6,000 from its non-management workforce by the end of 1994. The charge, equivalent to 60 cents a share, echoes similar one-off charges announced by other 'Baby Bells' in the past three months, among them Bell South, which set aside Dollars 1.2bn, Nynex (Dollars 1.6bn) and Pacific Telesis (Dollars 576m.) The job cuts at Ameritech, from 48,000 non-management workers, reflect pressure on local telephone companies from low growth and reductions in revenues from providing local access to long-distance companies. Ameritech's announcement on Friday came the day after accounting regulators had failed to agree on tighter rules concerning restructuring charges. The Securities and Exchange Commission has argued that many companies are including in restructuring charges costs which should be attributed to their normal course of business.</p>

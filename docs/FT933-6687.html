			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pay laws a barrier to equality Sir, Your report that the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Trades Union Congress are making representations to the European Commission about the UK's equality pay protection highlights the fact that UK law fails to guarantee fair and decent wages for women ('Brussels asked to rule on Britain's equal pay laws', August 24). Throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s the government has tried to deregulate pay and employment conditions with policies that have disproportionately affected and discriminated against women, who make up the majority of people working in undervalued, low-paid and low-status jobs. Over the same period European equality legislation has enabled women to challenge deregulation and gain important new rights that have helped them on the road to being treated equally in the workplace - equal pay for work of equal value, equality in retirement and redundancy ages and, most recently, the right to decent compensation in cases of sex discrimination. The government argues that it is creating opportunities for women. But each time it is forced to take action by Europe there has been no discernible direct effect on the levels of women's employment. Indeed following the introduction of the Equal Pay Act, women's employment actually rose. The government's arguments are designed to disguise its opposition to policies that attack the widespread undervaluing of women's skills and contribution to the workplace. As wise employers know and understand, those are the policies of yesteryears. Kathy Sutton, Pay Equity Project, c/o Liberty, 21 Tabard Street, London</p>

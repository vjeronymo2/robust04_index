			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Morgan Stanley to advise GPA Group on debt refinancing Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, has been awarded the mandate to advise GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company, on further refinancing options ahead of significant debt repayments due in 1996 and 1998. Both GPA and Morgan Stanley were keen to point out that no decision had been taken as to what form the refinancing would take. 'This is part of a long-term planning exercise. GPA is now in a position to consider well in advance its refinancing payments in 1996 and 1998,' GPA said. GPA is due to repay Dollars 1.3bn of its Dollars 5.4bn debt in September 1996. In August, it launched a Dollars 1bn securitisation of its aircraft lease portfolio, the second of its kind by GPA, in a deal arranged by Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers continues to manage the securitisation programme and Schroder, the UK bank, will continue in its current role as an independent adviser to the GPA board. Last year, GPA completed a restructuring with the sale of a number of its aircraft to General Electric. The company also benefited from the emergence of America West airline from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US. As a result of these developments and the general improvement in operating conditions, Standard &amp; Poor's last month upgraded its rating on GPA's secured debt to B and on its senior unsecured debt to CCC+ from CCC.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBANIANS FREE TO RUN FOR OFFICE -- WITH COMMUNISTS' OK  </P> <P> Voters in Albania will be given some freedom of choice, but the ruling  Communists will maintain tight control over the election process, that  country's leader says.  </P> <P> In comments made available Saturday, Communist Party leader Ramiz Alia also  hinted that wide-ranging changes may be necessary to accelerate economic  programs.  </P> <P> "Without combating red tape, without being freed from the old management  complexes . . . the hindrances we are coming across cannot be eliminated," Alia  said in a speech to legislators and officials of organizations supervised by  the ruling Communist Party.  </P> <P> Albania in recent months has sought to usher in modest reforms and shed its  image as a hermit country and Europe's last bastion of hard-line Stalinism.  </P> <P> Outlining planned election legislation, Alia said it would give all citizens  the right to stand for office except those "expressly deprived of this right by  law." He did not indicate who would be prohibited.  </P> <P> Balloting would be secret and there would be two nominees for each precinct.  The right to nominate candidates would be granted to the party, trade unions  and other groups, Alia said.  </P> <P> But the party controls all public organizations in Albania, and it is unlikely  the elections could pose a political threat to current rulers.  </P></p>

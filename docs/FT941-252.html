			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Honda, Mazda to buy more US car parts: Japanese carmakers relent after sustained pressure from US Honda and Mazda, the Japanese motor groups, yesterday followed the example of their three main competitors and announced plans to increase use of locally made components at their American factories. The companies also promised to increase imports into Japan. Separately, the ministry of international trade and industry announced it was ending its voluntary cap on car exports to the US because it had been made redundant by local manufacture of Japanese cars in the US. The cap was introduced in 1981 to protect the US motor industry. About 1.54m vehicles will be built by Japanese manufacturers in the US in 1994, the first year they will exceed exports to the US of cars produced in Japan. These are expected to reach nearly 1.4m units. Japanese exports have been under the ceilings set by the voluntary agreement since 1987. The announcements come as the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association revealed that Japan's motor exports in February had fallen 23.5 per cent in unit terms compared with the same month last year. The figure was down 2.6 per cent on the preceding month. In dollar terms, exports, including parts, dropped 7.9 per cent to Dollars 6.85bn. Japanese car, bus and truck makers have been struggling with the high value of the yen which has made their products increasingly uncompetitive. The car makers' undertakings on parts follow sustained pressure from Washington for Japan to increase use of US vehicle components to reduce Japan's trade surplus. Only 2 per cent of motor parts are imported. The Japanese government insists it is unable to interfere in private business. Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi have already revealed similar programmes. Combined, the five groups have committed themselves to increasing US parts purchases by more than Dollars 5.3bn by the financial year ending March 1998. Honda said it planned to increase the use of US parts at its Marysville, Ohio plant from Dollars 3.21bn in the 1992 financial year to Dollars 4.65bn during the 1995 financial year. It would also raise imports of vehicles and parts from Dollars 1.07bn to Dollars 1.27bn between 1992 and 1995. However, the group said that while it would make every effort to achieve such goals, it was not an enforceable commitment. 'Successful achievement of the goal depends on maintaining strong sales in the US and continued improvements in US suppliers' competitiveness,' it said. Mazda announced it would increase imports of components into Japan from Dollars 560m last financial year to Dollars 870m by the year ending March 1998. Over the same period local procurement of parts at its American factory would increase from Dollars 1.65bn to Dollars 1.9bn.</p>

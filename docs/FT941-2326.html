			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Caution on labour rights sanctions Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, yesterday warned industrialised countries not to use trade sanctions to enforce environmental or labour standards. 'Simplistic demands for drastic trade remedies against so-called eco-dumping or social-dumping' sometimes bore a striking similarity to more conventional protectionist rhetoric, he said. In some ways they were more dangerous because of their popular emotional appeal. Mr Sutherland's remarks, in a speech for delivery to the Canadian Club in Toronto, can be interpreted as a caution to the US and some European nations which are keen to see environmental objectives and worker rights put on the agenda for future trade talks. Gatt members are currently trying to draw up a work programme on trade and the environment. However, developing countries are fiercely resisting any suggestion that this should include discussion of 'levelling the competitive playing field' by harmonising national environmental standards. Worker rights is an even more sensitive issue. Mr Sutherland said increased pressures for industrial adjustment as a result of the globalisation of trade and production threatened to overload the rich world's economic and political circuits. Differing approaches by newcomers to environmental protection or social welfare were proving a touchstone for claims that these countries wielded unfair trade advantages which must be met by trade restrictions. 'Resisting adjustment on the grounds of discredited theories of the threat of 'pauper labour' will impoverish our societies all the faster, not lay the grounds for rejuvenation of our economies and the creation of well paid new jobs,' he said.</p>

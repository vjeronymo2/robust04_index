			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> There's going to be a soft touch connected to picking up a copy of the 50th  anniversary edition of "The Wizard of Oz" videocassette when it's released in  August. Through a sponsorship agreement between MGM/UA Home Video and Downy  Fabric Softner, customers can get a $5 rebate coupon that will drop the  suggested price of "Oz" from $24.95 to $19.95. The limited release of the video  will be accompanied by an $8.5-million promotional campaign, including a  30-second TV spot showing a girl entering "Oz" where the citizens sing about  Downy to the tune of "Merry Old Land of Oz." There also will be a 90-second  Downy message at the beginning of the cassette, where a girl rounds up  neighborhood friends for a back-yard production of "The Wizard of Oz" and  gathers the costumes from her family's "Downy-fresh" laundry basket. Promotions  aside, the 50th anniversary edition of "The Wizard of Oz" will contain 17  minutes of footage not seen in the film or in the previously released "Wizard  of Oz" videocassette. The extra footage includes Ray Bolger's scarecrow dance  and a "jitterbug" dance rehearsal, both cut from the film, Buddy Ebsen  performing "If I Only Had a Heart," Judy Garland receiving her Oscar and the  film's original theatrical promotional trailer.

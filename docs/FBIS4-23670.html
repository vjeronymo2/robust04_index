			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Sola Odunfa has been talking to  one of Abiola's leading supporters, the radical lawyer Chief  Gani Fewehinmi, and he put it to him that this was the beginning  of the end for Chief Abiola:    [Begin recording] [Fawehinmi] Well, I don't think, I don't  think so. I don't think the end of Abiola has come. I think a  new chapter has been opened by his declaration that he is the  president of the country. Now the situation in the country is  so politically confused that the government itself is jittery,  is in panic. The government cannot see the surf for the woods.  The government is in quandary and you can see clearly the way  the president spoke, I mean the head of state spoke on the  television yesterday. He looked a shell of himself. He was  dumb. He was drab. He was inconsistent. He wasn't looking  very happy and that means, really, that since they could not  even identify the place where Abiola had declared himself, I  mean they were surprised that he beat the entire security  network of this country. He declared himself before a crowd of  more than 3,000 people and he was not caught by the security  forces. Up till today, they couldn't find him and they made a  laughingstock of themselves by saying that there was a price of  50,000 on the head of a man like that, and that means in  ordinary times they converted it and it is $950. And that is a  ridiculous thing. Really, it shows clearly that the government  is in panic. It is not in control, and I think this is a  government that is tottering.    [Odunfa] Where is Chief Abiola now?    [Fawehinmi] Honestly, I don't know. I only know that he has  declared himself president and many Nigerians are happy that  that has been done, at least to confront a government that has  no legitimacy.    [Odunfa] Why should he go into hiding?    [Fawehinmi] I don't know. Really, I cannot proffer an answer  to that. All I know is that Nigerians are relieved that somehow  he has shown courage. For the first time, he has shown a lot of  courage and he has redeemed his image and he has put this  government on the run. The government now is in quandary. The  government is in chaos.    [Odunfa] What will happen now?    [Fawehinmi] Anything can happen in Nigeria now. Just  anything can happen because there is no stability. [end  recording]    Now, today was supposed to mark the start of protests by the  prodemocracy groups in Nigeria, who are calling for the military  government to step down. On the line to Lagos, Robin White  asked Sola Odunfa what sort of response there had been to the  call for a stay away:    [Begin recording] [Odunfa] There wasn't much response on the  island. Most people went to work. All government offices were  conducting normal business. All business houses on Lagos Island  operated normally. The only problem was on the mainland where  many markets and several shops did not open. All along Agege  motor road which is a very long stretch of road, about 5 km, not  a single shop opened when I went there at about 2 P.M. this  afternoon.    [White] What about elsewhere in the country?    [Odunfa] The reports I have got so far are that in the north  everybody went to work normally; the same thing in the east. In  the west, there was some demonstration, people staying away from  work, especially in Ogun State, the home state of Chief Abiola.  But on the whole, it has not been a successful thing as was  done last year.    [White] So it has been a bit of a damp squib, everything?    [Odunfa] It looks like that so far.    [White] And what about Abiola declaring himself as  president?  Has that been a damp squib too?    [Odunfa] No, it was definitely not! Although people went to  work, you find that at least in Lagos about 90 percent of the  residents still support Abiola.    [White] There have been suggestions, I think coming from the  police force, that there was no swearing-in ceremony at all;  that it was all a makeup by his supporters.    [Odunfa] I read the statement by the deputy inspector  general  of police in charge of operations. The statement would be  correct insofar as he said that there was no swearing in. There  was, in fact, no swearing in. What took place was that Abiola  addressed the people and proclaimed himself president of the  Federal Republic of Nigeria. And it took place, the event took  place about 100 meters behind my office here. I can still see  the sports hall which was used. It is a modern sports center  owned by the Lagos Island local government and Abiola came there  at about half past seven in the evening, went into the club  house on the premises, and by eight his supporters had informed  people around that Abiola was around and that they should come  and see him. And it was a huge crowd here. The entire street  was blocked by people.    [White] [words indistinct] absolutely clear, you have spoken  to a lot of people who saw him declare himself.    [Odunfa] Yes, everybody, in fact people in my building here  and people on the street, everybody was there. [end recording]</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Lloyd serves a profits ace - The week ahead THURSDAY: David Lloyd Leisure, the tennis and health club company, is expected to report pre-tax profits for the year to end-September of Pounds 7.5m, ahead by more than 30 per cent. A total dividend of 3.6p is forecast, compared with a notional 3.25p previously. Although only one new club was opened during the year - in Glasgow - the group has benefited from growing membership and the good weather last summer. Glasgow, which was opened in October 1993, has also made a good initial contribution. The group acquired two clubs in Hampshire last July and expects that centres now being built in Birmingham and Bristol will open in 1995. It has a policy of introducing two new clubs each year. THURSDAY: Boots, which includes Britain's biggest chain of chemists among its retailing interests, is expected to become the first of the large retailers to reveal how it has performed during the all-important Christmas trading period. After a late surge, analysts are looking for a total sales increase in the chemist shops of at least 5 per cent in the second half so far. Full-year group profit forecasts are about Pounds 520m-Pounds 540m, but could change depending on when the group completes the sale of its pharmaceuticals division to Germany's BASF. THURSDAY: Reg Vardy, the multi-franchise motor retail group, is expected to announce interim pre-tax profits of between Pounds 4.6m and Pounds 5m. The substantial increase on last year's Pounds 3.51m is helped by acquisitions but also proves the value of the company's specialist retailing strategy. The interim dividend is forecast to rise from 1.4p to about 1.5p. FRIDAY: Bid speculation surrounding Scantronic Holdings is likely to re-surface when the debt-burdened security components manufacturer and distributor announces widely-expected losses. Following a profits warning, the company is expected to confirm hefty re-organisation and debt servicing costs led to pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.4m in the six months to September 30, against profits of Pounds 1.4m last time.</p>

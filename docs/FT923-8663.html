			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Building societies' performance praised CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester, the sixth-largest building society by asset size, kept its place last year as the industry's star performer in the UBS Phillips &amp; Drew building society league table. The report by the securities house says that in spite of wide variations in their profitability last year, the top 20 UK building societies are still performing well in the worst housing market recession since the Second World War. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester easily outperformed the rest of the industry on 10 out of 12 financial indicators selected for the report. They included an extremely low cost base, with management expenses running at only 26 per cent of its total income; a much higher than average return on assets; and a rapid growth in its asset size. The only two indicators on which the society was below the industry average were measures of capital strength. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's main rival for the top place in the industry was Leeds Permanent, the fifth-largest society, but Abbey National, the retail bank that shed building society status three years ago, would rank in second place if it were still a society. Halifax, the industry giant, came fifth, an improvement of four places on 1990. At the other end of the league table, Birmingham Midshires, the 13th-largest society, and Town &amp; Country, the 19th-largest, which made a Pounds 43m pre-tax loss last year before merging with Woolwich, got low marks for almost everything except capital strength. Other societies that performed badly in the league table this year were Skipton, which dropped from second position to 17th, and Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth-largest society, down by 11 places to 14th position. Mr John Wriglesworth, of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said he believed that in spite of its low place in the league table, Birmingham Midshires was in excellent shape for the future. He ruled out any prospect at the moment of a top-20 building society getting into such financial trouble as Town &amp; Country and needing to be rescued by a larger society. Mr Wriglesworth singled out National &amp; Provincial, the seventh-largest society which two years ago was forced to abort its plans for a stock market flotation, as the most improved society. There are considerable differences in the degree to which large societies have been affected by bad debt. Derbyshire, the 20th society by size, emerged as the one with the fewest bad debts. Chelsea, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Portman, Birmingham Midshires, Skipton, and Nationwide have the worst bad-debt experience. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester has much better than average bad debt and arrears experience, although it has absorbed several smaller societies with high levels of bad debt in their loan books. Most top-20 societies shed estate agency branches last year. Halifax, the largest society, cut its estate agency network by 50 branches and Nationwide dropped 35 branches. Only one society, Alliance &amp; Leicester, says it is still considering following Abbey National with a stock market flotation. Four other societies, Halifax, Nationwide, Leeds Permanent and National &amp; Provincial, still retain merchant banks to advise them on whether to convert to plc status.  ---------------------------------------------------------- TOP PERFORMING BUILDING SOCIETIES  ----------------------------------------------------------                            Position   Position   Ranking                            in 1991    in 1990   by assets  ---------------------------------------------------------- Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester       1          1          6 Leeds Permanent               2          8          5 Northern Rock                 3          5=        11 Yorkshire                     4          5=        12 Halifax                       5          9          1 Derbyshire                    6         13=        20 Bradford &amp; Bingley            7          7          7 National &amp; Provincial         8         19          8 Coventry                      9          3=        16 Bristol &amp; West               10         16         10 Britannia                    11         13=         9 Woolwich                     12=        12          4 Nationwide                   12=        11          2 Alliance &amp; Leicester         14          3=         3 Portman                      15         17         15 Leeds &amp; Holbeck              16         10         18 Skipton                      17          2         14 Chelsea                      18         13=        17 Birmingham Midshires         19         20         13 Town &amp; Country               20         18         19  ---------------------------------------------------------- Source: UBS Phillips &amp; Drew  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

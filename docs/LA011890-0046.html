			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSING CRUNCH HEADS OFFICIALS' LIST OF PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Squeezed by spiraling real estate prices and low-paying jobs, Ventura County  families are facing tougher times finding an affordable place to live,  according to a study issued Wednesday by two agencies.  </P> <P> Local politicians, educators and business leaders polled by the United Way of  Ventura County and the Ventura County Community Foundation said affordable  housing is the most pressing need for area residents today, outranking crime,  gang prevention and the need for AIDS care.  </P> <P> "It was interesting to me that so many respondents identified affordable  housing as such a leading concern," United Way President Laura McAvoy said.  </P> <P> The survey was designed as a gauge of community concerns, and not a  recommendation for specific programs, but may be used by officials in planning  programs when results are released in a 46-page report to agencies and business  leaders around the county.  </P> <P> "We seriously searched to find out these are the issues to prioritize that  community leaders think are serious issues," said Alan Teague, president of the  community foundation. "We have no cure for delinquency and gangs, but we now  know that each town has problems with them. We're not trying to cough up all  the answers, but we're hoping to define them."  </P> <P> Those polled were asked to rank 47 concerns. In addition to affordable housing,  those who responded targeted four other serious needs: prevention of  delinquency, gangs, drug abuse and crime, as well as more programs for the  mentally ill and the homeless.  </P> <P> Many of the issues defined by community leaders were problems felt primarily by  the poor. As the poverty gap widens in the next 10 years, the report noted,  senior citizens and minority groups will feel the lack of programs most keenly,  particularly the Latino community, which makes up about 25% of the county's  residents and is projected to grow.  </P> <P> Some of the information has already been useful, officials said. When the  Ventura County Community Foundation decided to grant $35,500, some of it was  earmarked for Latino youths, said Cathy Edge, executive director of the  foundation.  </P> <P> Many of the issues cited in the current survey reflect the same trends and data  released in October, 1986, when the United Way issued its first report on  needed programs in the county. Affordable housing was also considered one of  the most serious concerns in that report.  </P> <P> "The shortage of housing that low- and moderate-income people can afford to  rent or buy is Ventura County's most widespread social problem," according to  the 1986 report.  </P> <P> But by last year, when the newest survey was conducted, little had changed. The  predominance of low-paying jobs and booming real estate prices made it  difficult for the poor to buy or to rent homes, the report found.  </P> <P> Ventura was considered the second least affordable area for single-family  housing in the state last year. As average prices of homes increased in 1989,  according to the report, only 19% of the people living in the county could  afford to buy them.  </P> <P> The ranks of the homeless have also grown since the last report was issued. In  1985, a United Way task force studying the homeless estimated that about 2,000  people were living on the streets. Today, according to the report, the figure  has more than doubled to about 4,500 homeless in the county.  </P> <P> One city councilman said the survey results only confirm what he has already  observed in his own community.  </P> <P> Bernardo Perez, a councilman in Moorpark, where more than a third of the  population is Latino, said many of his constituents are working poor, those who  have jobs but cannot afford the mortgage payments.  </P> <P> "The private sector really isn't addressing that sector of the housing market.  It's really the upperscale home purchaser that has a lot to choose from. Land  costs too much," Perez said.  </P></p>

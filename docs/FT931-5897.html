			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / More held in Italian probe A STRING of road building contracts throughout Italy were yesterday brought within the scope of corruption investigations, leading to the arrest of businessmen, officials of Anas, the state roads authority, and Mr Gerardo Pelosi, director-general at the Ministry of Public Works. As the scope of corruption investigations continued to broaden, parliament delayed a decision on waiving immunity on Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader. The delay was caused by new evidence which parliament wished to study. This centred on allegations made by Mr Claudio Martelli, the former justice minister and one-time political associate of Mr Craxi, that the latter had been involved in collecting illicit contributions for the party. Magistrates in Rome and several other cities have been investigating for at least two months the activities of Anas during the 1980s. Road building accounts for 10 per cent of the annual L30,000bn (Pounds 13.6bn) budget for public works contracts. Some arrests had already been made, but yesterday's arrests underscored the extent of the investigation. They involved six Anas officials and seven businessmen, two of whom have already been caught up in other public works corruption investigations. In addition, a further eight Anas officials and three contractors were warned they were under investigation. The Milan department of Anas was the most affected but others included Naples, Palermo and Reggio Calabria. The action taken in the three southern cities is of particular significance because they cover areas regarded as infiltrated by organised crime and barely touched by the current wave of corruption investigations. The Anas board and its officials have been traditionally controlled by the main ruling parties. The latest arrests took place against a growing debate among political parties on the merits of introducing legislation to provide a 'political' solution to the crisis caused by the corruption scandals. The government has said it hopes to have legislation ready by tomorrow. But a growing number of politicians doubt the feasibility of framing legislation that does not appear to be letting the guilty off the hook. Last night the Socialist party was still undecided whether to endorse the waiving of parliamentary immunity in respect of Mr Craxi to face charges of alleged corruption, extortion and illicit funding. Matters were complicated by the arrival of new material with potentially serious allegations made by Mr Martelli, who has been warned he is under investigation over the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano.</p>

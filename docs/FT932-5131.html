			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Late-night deal fails to save most BA flights A PEACE deal between British Airways and the TGWU transport union was agreed too late to avert a 24-hour strike which yesterday disrupted most of BA's 420 daily flights from London's Gatwick and Heathrow airports, the two busiest in Britain. The deal was reached late on Thursday night. But as normal services resume today, two other disputes at BA remain unresolved. One involves the airline's 3,000 pilots who have voted 5-1 to strike in pursuit of a claim for common contracts for all the group's pilots, although the British Airline Pilots' Association said it was 'optimistic of getting back into talks with BA'. A second dispute involves 300 cabin and ground staff at Gatwick airport who have rejected the offer of a 3 per cent pay rise. The staff, who are employed by the BA subsidiary British Airways European Operations Out of Gatwick (BA EOG), have voted for strike action. BA said it was difficult to estimate the cost of disruption to yesterday's services. It carried only about half its normal daily load of passengers - about 35,000 instead of 70,000. BA normally has 420 flights from Heathrow and Gatwick on weekdays. All flights from Gatwick save one were cancelled yesterday, but 18 long-haul flights left Heathrow, ensuring that these aircraft were in position for return flights tomorrow. Eleven European flights took off, but all domestic flights were cancelled. Passengers unable to travel were offered either re-bookings, refunds or flights with other airlines. The company insisted there was no question of dropping BA EOG, the low-cost operation which has been the catalyst for the dispute. BA EOG was set up to operate flights to European destinations after BA took over Dan-Air's lossmaking operations last year - rates of pay reflect the generally lower pay scales which operated in Dan-Air. The TGWU said widespread staff fears over job security were at the heart of the dispute. The deal agreed by BA and the TGWU had four main elements: BA agreed it had no plans to create any new subsidiaries other than those already announced - and, if it did consider such a move, it would consult with the national joint council which represents management and staff. BA agreed to consult unions over any further sub-contracting of services. Agreement was reached on the number of overseas cabin crews on flights. The deadline for staff who wished to transfer to BA EOG at Gatwick - an option, for example, for workers who live nearer Gatwick than Heathrow - was extended to November. Staff transferring will not suffer pay cuts and basic rates of pay will be frozen until those of existing BA EOG staff catch up. The deal was presented by BA as a 'staff charter' which it said reaffirmed assurances over the airline's business development and job security. Talks will take place next week on the other disputes. BA said a dispute involving clerical workers who are members of the GMB general union at Gatwick should now be resolved quickly. Mr Chris Darke, general secretary of the pilots' association, said the key to resolving the pilots' dispute was a common contract of employment for staff employed by BA and BA EOG. Pilots at BA EOG earn about 30 per cent less, but Mr Darke said money was not the main problem - the BA EOG pilots want assurances that they can move between BA EOG and the main company.</p>

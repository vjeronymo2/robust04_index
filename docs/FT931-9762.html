			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Preussag advances to DM425m PRE-TAX profits at Preussag, the German steel, trading, energy and metals group, rose by DM15m to DM425m (Dollars 257m) in the year to the end of September. This was despite a 4 per cent drop in turnover from DM29.7bn to DM28.5bn. Mr Ernst Pieper, chief executive, said that, in the first quarter of the current year, pre-tax profits were less than the DM130m in the comparable period of the previous year. He said that the current year would be difficult for the group in the light of the general economic downturn. But he was confident that the group would 'come through' relatively well because of its mixture of businesses. Some analysts' predictions of a 10 per cent drop in profits for the year were speculation, he added. 'Catastrophic' conditions in the steel industry and a difficult metals market would be balanced by a strong performance from other parts of the group, including energy, transport, ship-building and plant construction, Mr Pieper said. As a measure of his confidence, he pointed to a 4 per cent increase in the order intake to DM6.2bn in the period from October to December 1992. Sales dropped 5 per cent to DM6bn, mainly because of falling steel and base metals prices. As previously announced, the dividend for 1991-92 is to be held at DM10 per share, the same level as in the previous year. Mr Pieper, 64, appointed chief executive of Preussag in 1990 following the company's acquisition of the Salzgitter steel and engineering group from the west German government, will step down as chief executive at the beginning of next year. His successor is to be Mr Michael Frenzel, 45, who was appointed deputy chief executive in March last year. MAN, the engineering and truck group, said yesterday that orders improved by 25 per cent in the second quarter of the current financial year, compared to the first quarter, when they dropped sharply. In the six months to December, total order intake was 14 per cent down at DM7.4bn. Sales for the six months were DM8.2bn, the same level as in the first half of the previous year.</p>

[Signed] Chairman of the Government of the Russian  Federation  V. Chernomyrdin.  <H5>  Attachment No. 1: System of Criteria for Determining That </H5> the Structure of the Balance Sheet of Insolvent Enterprises Is  Unsatisfactory    1. The following indicators shall be used to evaluate the  satisfactoriness of the structure of the balance sheet of an  enterprise:    the current liquidity ratio;    the internal liquidity ratio;    the solvency recovery (loss) ratio.    2. The current liquidity ratio shall characterize the  overall  availability of working capital to the enterprise for economic  activity and for timely repayment of the enterprise's accrued  liabilities.    The current liquidity ratio shall be defined as the ratio of  the actual value of working capital in the possession of the  enterprise in the form of production reserves, finished  products, monetary resources, accounts receivable, and other  working assets (the sum of the totals of sections II and III of  balance sheet assets), to the shortest-term liabilities of the  enterprise, taking the form of short-term bank credit,  short-term loans, and various accounts payable (the total of  section II of balance sheet liabilities, less lines 500, 510,  730, 735, 740).    3. The internal liquidity ratio shall characterize presence  of the enterprise's own working capital necessary for its  financial stability.    The internal liquidity ratio shall be defined as the ratio  of  the difference between the volumes of working capital sources  (the total of section I of balance sheet liabilities) and the  actual value of fixed capital and other fixed assets (the total  of section I of balance sheet assets), to the actual value of  fixed capital in the enterprise's possession in the form of  production reserves, unfinished products, finished products,  monetary resources, accounts receivable, and other working  assets (the sum of the totals of sections II and III of balance  sheet assets).    4. The solvency recovery (loss) ratio shall characterize the  presence of a real possibility for the enterprise to recover or  lose its solvency over the course of a certain period of time.    The solvency recovery (loss) ratio shall be defined as the  ratio of the calculated current liquidity ratio to its  ascertained value. The calculated current liquidity ratio shall  be defined as the sum of the actual value of the current  liquidity ratio at the end of the reporting period, and change  in the value of this ratio between the end and the beginning of  the reporting period, expressed in terms of the established  period of solvency recovery (loss).    5. Fulfillment of one of the following conditions shall be  grounds for recognizing the structure of the balance sheet of an  enterprise to be unsatisfactory, and the enterprise to be  insolvent:    the current liquidity ratio at the end of the reporting  period is less than 2;    the internal liquidity ratio at the end of the reporting  period is less than 0.1.    6. When grounds established in item 5 of this attachment for  recognizing the structure of the balance sheet to be  unsatisfactory exist, and if the solvency recovery (loss) ratio,  determined on the basis of a solvency recovery period equal to  six months and an ascertained current liquidity ratio equal to  2, is a value greater than unity, the decision that a real  possibility for the enterprise to recover its solvency exists  may be made.    When grounds established in item 5 of this attachment for  recognizing the structure of the balance sheet to be  unsatisfactory are absent, and if the solvency recovery (loss)  ratio, determined on the basis of a solvency loss period equal  to three months and an ascertained current liquidity ratio equal  to 2, is a value less than unity, the decision that the  enterprise will not be able to meet its obligations to creditors  (a decision that the enterprise has lost its solvency) may be  made.    7. A decision recognizing the structure of the balance sheet  to be unsatisfactory based on grounds established by item 5 of  this attachment may be postponed for a time determined by the  Federal Administration for Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Affairs under  the Russian State Committee for the Administration of State  Property, if presence of a real possibility for the enterprise  to recover its solvency has been established by the procedure  determined by paragraph 1, item 6 of this attachment.    8. The balance sheet of an enterprise shall be analyzed on  the basis of:    the balance sheet for the last reporting period, and the  balance sheet as of the first of the current month (if the date  on which this balance sheet is filled out does not coincide with  the last day of the last accounting period), submitted by the  enterprise management and notarized according to the established  procedure;    the enterprise's balance sheet for the last reporting  period,  submitted to tax authorities in the case of failure of the  enterprise management to submit the corresponding documents by  the deadline.    Information contained in documents received according to the  indicated procedure shall be sufficient to make a decision  regarding determination of the unsatisfactoriness of the  structure of an enterprise's balance sheet.  <H5>  Attachment No 2: Statute on the Procedure for Granting </H5> State Financial Support to Insolvent Enterprises and for Using  Resources of the Federal Budget and of Sector and Intersector  Nonbudgetary Funds for the Purposes of Reorganizing or  Liquidating Insolvent Enterprises    1. This Statute determines the procedure for granting state  financial support to insolvent enterprises and using resources  of the federal budget and of sector and intersector nonbudgetary  funds for the purposes of reorganizing or liquidating insolvent  enterprises.    2. State financing shall be effected according to the  procedure determined by this Statute, on a reimbursable or  nonreimbursable basis, out of budgets at different levels and  out of sector and intersector nonbudgetary funds, for the  purposes of:    recovering the solvency or maintaining effective economic  activity of enterprises;    financing reorganization or liquidation measures, including  measures having the purpose of preventing the negative social  consequences of bankruptcies.    Henceforth in the text, financing of rehabilitation measures  shall be defined as allocating state funds for any of the  purposes indicated above.    3. Nonreimbursable state funds shall be granted exclusively  in order to:    finance nonproductive activity associated with maintaining  social, cultural, municipal, and personal facilities;    compensate for the losses of particular enterprises, if  currently effective legislation establishes economic conditions  for them under which compensation of outlays on production of  goods (work, services) is not provided for, as a result of which  they may go into bankruptcy;    finance the costs of recovering the solvency of enterprises  accepted for full financing by the budget with status  established by currently effective legislation;    finance liquidation proceedings when resources from the sale  of the property of debtors are insufficient.    In all other cases state financial support shall be provided  exclusively on a reimbursable basis.    Nonreimbursable allocations of state funds shall be  reflected  on the liability side of the enterprise's balance sheet as  specific-purpose financial receipts, and they may not incur  changes in the share of the state, as well as its intermediaries  (agent organizations), in the enterprise's authorized capital.    4. Measures indicated in item 2 of this Statute shall be  financed in accordance with an agreement signed between the body  of executive government providing the financing and the Federal  Administration for Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Affairs under the  Russian State Committee for the Administration of State Property  (henceforth the Federal Administration), which shall ensure that  the resources are used for their intended purpose and that these  resources are repayable (in the event that financing is on a  credit basis), on one hand, and an authorized organization  (agent) of the Government of the Russian Federation (of a  subject of the Russian Federation) on the other.    5.

The following may act as a body (as bodies) financing  rehabilitation measures in the name of the state, depending on  the sources of financing:    the Russian Federation Ministry of Finance or an authorized  financial agency of a subject of the Russian Federation, if the  federal budget or the budget of a subject of the Russian  Federation is the source of financing of rehabilitation measures;    a federal body (bodies) of executive government, a body  (bodies) of a subject of the Russian Federation, and bodies of  local self-management authorized to dispose of resources of  sector and intersector nonbudgetary funds, if the indicated  funds are the indicated funds are the financing source.    Banking institutions, investment companies, and funds that  have signed the agreement foreseen in item 4 of this Statute may  serve as authorized organizations (agents) of the Government of  the Russian Federation (of subjects of the Russian Federation)  through which state financing of rehabilitation measures is to  be effected.    8. Resources intended for state financial support shall be  transferred in accordance with the agreed financing schedule,  and they may be used solely to finance measures foreseen by the  approved financial rehabilitation plan (business plan).    In cases when state financial support is rendered to an  insolvent enterprise as part of reorganization proceedings  conducted while the question of recognizing it to be insolvent  (bankrupt) is being resolved, the initial payments foreseen by  the financing schedule must be transferred no later than five  days prior to expiration of the period for filing a petition to  conduct reorganization proceedings with an arbitration court.    9.

If it is established that state resources allocated for  financial measures indicated in item 2 of this Statute are not  being used for their intended purpose, or are being used  ineffectively, or that the schedule of receipt of resources is  not being met, and if it is impossible to attain the planned  goals, the Federal Administration shall be obligated to  terminate implementation (file a petition of early termination  with the arbitration court) of the indicated measures.  <H5>  Attachment No 3: Statute on the Procedure for Making </H5> Decisions on Voluntary Liquidation of Debtor Enterprises    1. Voluntary liquidation of debtor enterprises shall proceed  out of court on the basis of a mutual agreement between the  debtor enterprise and creditors for the purposes of satisfying  the demands of creditors and preventing the negative social  consequences connected with insolvency (bankruptcy) of the  enterprise.    A decision of the Federal Administration for Insolvency  (Bankruptcy) Affairs under the Russian State Committee for the  Administration of State Property (henceforth the Federal  Administration) recognizing the structure of the balance sheet  of an enterprise to be unsatisfactory, and its decision  regarding the absence of a real possibility for recovering its  solvency, adopted on the basis of the results of analyzing the  economic condition of the enterprise as determined by the system  of criteria for determining unsatisfactoriness of the structure  of the balance sheet of insolvent enterprises, shall be grounds  for making preparations to implement voluntary liquidation  proceedings against federal state enterprises, as well as  enterprises possessing capital of which the Russian Federation's  share (contribution) is over 25 percent.    If preparations for initiating proceedings of voluntary  liquidation of a federal state enterprise or an enterprise with  capital composed in part of a share (contribution) of the  Russian Federation are made on the basis of other grounds, the  chief executive of the enterprise shall be obligated to notify  the Federal Administration of this no later than 15 days prior  to the meeting of creditors, and submit documents and  information specified by items 2 and 3, Article 5 of the Law of  the Russian Federation "On Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of  Enterprises."    2.

The meeting of creditors shall be conducted no later that 15  days from the moment of receipt of the instructions of the  Federal Administration.    The date of the general meeting (conference) of the labor  collective shall be scheduled no later than three days prior to  the meeting of creditors. Failure to conduct the general meeting  (conference) of the labor collective shall not constitute an  obstacle to conducting the meeting of creditors.    4. Creditors holding unsecured obligations of the enterprise  that had become due prior to the meeting of creditors, convened  according to the procedure set forth in item 3 of this Statute,  shall participate in this meeting with the right to vote.    The Federal Administration shall represent the interests of  the state at the meeting of creditors to the extent of the total  obligations of the enterprise to the federal budget and to  nonbudgetary funds, and in resolving the issue of the  enterprise's voluntary liquidation it shall vote with mandatory  consideration of the opinion of the corresponding sector  ministry (department) and body of executive government of a  subject of the Russian Federation.    The chief executive of the enterprise and the authorized  representative of the labor collective shall participate in the  meeting of creditors.

The procedure of a creditor's meeting shall be determined by  the Suggested Rules of a Meeting of Creditors, approved by the  Federal Administration, if some other procedures are not  approved by agreement of the creditors.    If as a result of analyzing the economic condition of the  enterprise, the Federal Administration establishes the presence  of evidence of deliberate or fictitious bankruptcy of the  enterprise, the Federal Administration shall be obligated to  notify the creditor's meeting of this. In this case, if evidence  of deliberate bankruptcy is discovered, the Federal  Administration shall present demands, according to procedure  established by legislation, to recognize as invalid any  transactions consummated with the purpose of pushing the  enterprise into a state of bankruptcy, and when evidence of  violation of the law exist, it shall forward the materials to  investigatory agencies.    In the event that the meeting of creditors decides upon  voluntary liquidation of the enterprise, the indicated decision  shall be considered to have been adopted jointly by the chief  executive of the enterprise and the creditors. Concurrently with  adoption of the decision of voluntary liquidation of the  enterprise, the meeting of creditors shall have the right to  nominate candidates for the position of trustee.

Within three days from the moment of receipt of the  decision of voluntary liquidation of a federal state enterprise,  the Federal Administration shall confirm the indicated decision,  and appoint a trustee with regard for nominations by the  enterprise's chief executive. If the meeting of creditors has  nominated its own candidates for trustee, the Federal  Administration shall be obligated to appoint the person  nominated by the meeting of creditors to be the trustee.    In the event of adoption of a decision of voluntary  liquidation of an enterprise with capital composed in part of a  share (contribution) of the state, in order to permit  confirmation of the indicated decision the Federal  Administration shall instruct the enterprise's chief executive  to organize a meeting of the enterprise's supreme body  authorized by the enterprise's charter to make decisions  regarding its liquidation (henceforth the authorized body). The  authorized body shall meet no later than 30 days from the moment  of adoption of the joint decision of voluntary liquidation of  the enterprise, by procedure set forth in the enterprise's  charter.    At the meeting of the authorized body the Federal  Administration shall represent the interests of the state to the  extent of the state's share (contribution, block of shares) in  authorized capital; in this case the powers of any other persons  representing the interests of the state at this meeting shall be  invalid. The Federal Administration shall not have the right to  vote against confirmation of the decision of voluntary  liquidation of the enterprise, except in the case when as a  result of analyzing the economic condition of the enterprise the  latter is actually revealed to be solvent or a real possibility  is revealed for its recovery, as well as in the presence of  circumstances indicated in the fifth paragraph of item 4 of this  Statute.    The joint decision of the enterprise's chief executive and  creditors regarding voluntary liquidation of the enterprise in  connection with absence of the possibility for recovering its  solvency shall be confirmed by a simple majority of the total  number of votes. In this case if the authorized body does not  confirm the decision of voluntary liquidation of the enterprise,  it shall have the right to adopt a decision requiring the  enterprise to file notice of its recognition as being insolvent  with an arbitration court, and obligating the enterprise's chief  executive to file the indicated notice.    In the event of confirmation of the decision of voluntary  liquidation of the enterprise, the authorized body shall appoint  a trustee with regard for nominations by the chief executive of  the enterprise. If the meeting of creditors had nominated its  own candidate for trustee, the authorized body shall appoint the  person nominated by the meeting of creditors to be the trustee.    6. If the chief executive of a federal state enterprise  fails  to fulfill instructions of the Federal Administration regarding  voluntary liquidation of the enterprise within a set period, or  if such liquidation is rejected by a meeting of creditors, the  Federal Administration shall publish instructions containing  prescriptions, binding upon the chief executive of the  enterprise, to file, with the arbitration court, notice of  institution of insolvency (bankruptcy) proceedings against the  enterprise.    Within two weeks of receiving the indicated instructions,  the  chief executive of this enterprise shall be obligated to present  to the Federal Administration a copy of the notice filed with  the arbitration court regarding recognition of the enterprise to  be insolvent (bankrupt), and a document confirming receipt of  the indicated notice by the arbitration court. In the event that  the indicated documents are not presented within the set time,  the Federal Administration shall independently file, with the  arbitration court, a notice of recognition of this enterprise to  be insolvent (bankrupt).    7. The enterprise shall be considered to be undergoing  liquidation from the moment of confirmation of the joint  decision of the chief executive of the enterprise and the  creditors regarding voluntary liquidation of the enterprise. An  announcement of the enterprise's voluntary liquidation must be  submitted for publication according to the established procedure  no later than three days from the moment of this decision's  confirmation.

A creditor who disagrees with an approved decision of  voluntary liquidation of the enterprise may declare his  disagreement with the indicated decision by submitting the  corresponding notice to the trustee.    If in the course of 20 days from the moment of publication  of  the announcement of voluntary liquidation of the enterprise the  trustee does not receive a single notice of a creditor's  disagreement with the decision of voluntary liquidation, the  decision regarding voluntary liquidation shall be considered to  be agreed upon by all creditors.    If in the indicated period the trustee receives at least one  creditor's notice of disagreement with the decision of voluntary  liquidation of the enterprise, implementation of liquidation  measures shall cease. In this case the Federal Administration  shall be obligated to take steps, in accordance with the powers  granted to it, to file, with the arbitration court, notice of  institution of insolvency (bankruptcy) proceedings against the  enterprise.    9. The trustee shall form a liquidation commission, which  shall submit to the Federal Administration no later than 15 days  from the moment of commencement of liquidation measures a plan  for the enterprise's liquidation drawn up in accordance with the  Standard Plan for Liquidation of an Enterprise approved by the  Federal Administration. In the event that the liquidation  commission fails to submit the enterprise liquidation plan  within the indicated time, the Federal Administration shall have  the right to draft the liquidation plan independently.    Upon being coordinated with the Federal Administration, as  well as with the corresponding antimonopoly agency if the  enterprise occupies a dominant position in the federal or local  market, the enterprise liquidation plan shall be presented to  the trustee for approval by a meeting of creditors convened  according procedure foreseen by item 4, Article 51 of the Law of  the Russian Federation "On Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of  Enterprises."    10.

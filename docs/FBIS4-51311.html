			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, May 24 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Communist  Party delegation headed by Wei Jianxing held talks here today  with a delegation of the Syrian Arab Ba'th Socialist Party  headed by 'Abdallah al-Ahmar on cooperation and links between  the two parties.    Wei Jianxing is member of the Political Bureau of the CPC  Central Committee and 'Abdallah al-Ahmar is assistant  secretary-general of the Syrian ruling party.    During the talks, the two sides reviewed the development of  relations between the two parties in light of an agreement  signed between the two sides in 1991 and highlighted the  necessity of bolstering their relations.    Wei briefed the host on the major achievements China has  registered since it adopted the policy of reforms and opening to  the outside world in 1978.    He also expounded the Chinese stance toward the Middle East  issue, stressing a political solution to the issue based on U.N.  Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of  land for peace.    He underlined the necessity of restoring all the occupied  territories including the Syrian Golan Heights, the necessity of  restoring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and  ensuring the security and territorial integrity of all the  states in the region.    He voiced China's unswerving support for the Palestinian  people and the Arab people in their struggle for winning  independence and reclaiming the occupied land.    On his part, 'Abdallah al-Ahmar stressed Syria's principles  for the establishment of a new society and its stand toward the  Middle East peace process.    He pointed out that the cause behind the stumbling Middle  East peace process is Israel's stubbornness and refusal to  comply with the U.N. Security Council Resolutions, especially  242, 338 and 425, which stipulate its withdrawal from all the  Arab lands.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Japan resigned to rice liberalisation: Even once-vociferous farmers are now ready to swallow Uruguay Round reforms The Japanese government is expected soon to submit legislation to implement the Uruguay Round trade treaty to an extraordinary session of the Diet, paving the way for ratification of the trade agreements by the beginning of next year. Having just manoeuvred through one round of contentious trade talks with the US, Japanese officials are relieved that their task of implementing the Uruguay Round agreements has not been as difficult as in either the US or the EU. Japan made substantial offers in the Uruguay Round negotiations to reduce tariffs by a weighted average of 61 per cent on industrial and mining goods and, more controversially, to open up the country's long-protected rice market to imports from 1995. Tariffs on eight sectors from pharmaceuticals and construction equipment to distilled spirits are set to be eliminated, while import restrictions will be lifted on agricultural products ranging from silk-worm cocoons to dairy products. After years of jealously guarding its inefficient rice market, the government also agreed to allow imports from 1995. But in spite of the initial hullabaloo over opening the country's rice market, government officials are confident that the revision of domestic laws necessary to implement the Uruguay Round accord will pass the Diet without incident. 'Things are proceeding as scheduled,' confirmed an official at the Ministry of Trade and Industry, which has authority over many of the industrial sectors which will be affected by the new legislation. Even Zenchu, the Central Union of Agricultural Co-operatives, which has been vociferous in its opposition to opening the country's rice market, is resigned to the prospect of liberalisation. 'We are against the contents of the Uruguay Round agreement, but we are not planning to stand in the way of ratification,' says one Zenchu official. 'Ratification will aggravate the critical situation facing Japanese farmers but we expect the government to keep to its promise to ensure that farmers do not suffer as a result of the agreement.' As in other issues, the Japanese aversion to discord and fear of appearing to be out of line is apparently helping rally support for passage of Uruguay Round legislation. The bills, which cover 15 areas, are expected to be presented to the Diet as a package to facilitate passage, and nobody, not even angry farmers, wants to be blamed for preventing Japan from living up to its international commitment. The government agreed to liberalise many markets and 'the agricultural sector alone cannot expect to receive special treatment,' the Zenchu official said. Although some diehard politicians from farming communities may still find liberalisation of the rice market hard to swallow, the standard line from the leading political parties is that this step cannot be avoided. The opposition includes many members of the then ruling coalition which was responsible for endorsing the Uruguay Round agreement in the first place. There is, however, one possible hitch. While there is general agreement that liberalisation of the rice market is inevitable, discord over the revision of Japan's Staple Food Control Act could become an obstacle to smooth passage of the entire Uruguay Round legislature package. In order to live up to its Gatt promise on rice, Japan will have to revise parts of the Food Control Act. Recent changes in the rice market, meanwhile, have triggered a long-needed move to revamp this 1942 law aimed at keeping the rice market under government control, which has created severe anomalies in the market. A full revision of the Food Control Act is far more controversial than the limited steps that are required to fulfil Japan's Gatt obligations. Inability to reach agreement on the first issue could in turn, stymie the government's Uruguay Round effort. 'If that happens,' says an official at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 'it might become difficult to implement necessary legislation before January 1. That is a major concern for the ministry.' So far, such dangers are limited. An advisory committee to the prime minister has already pronounced on the need to reform the Food Control Act. The three parties in the ruling coalition have been locked in lengthy discussions on the issue and even went through an all-night session late last month to co-ordinate their views. Japan needs to open its telecommunications market to international competition and remove the barrier between domestic and international businesses if it is to meet the changing telecommunications needs of users, Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of BT, said in Tokyo yesterday, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. As a result of tight regulation of its telecoms market, it was a struggle for international telecommunications operators such as BT to provide end-to-end services for customers in the region. The British telecommunications company has been seeking to provide voice telephony to corporate customers in Japan but has been hindered by regulations, Sir Iain said. At the same time, NTT, the Japanese domestic telecoms operator, is not allowed to provide international services, preventing a direct link-up with BT. Instead, BT had linked up with an NTT subsidiary to provide global communications services. The high degree of regulation was also denying Japanese users the full benefits of new services and competitive pricing, Sir Iain warned. The Japanese government may decide next year whether to break up NTT and encourage competition.</p>

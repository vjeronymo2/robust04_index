			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the heading "Panorama": "Oil </F> Output Level Drops"]    [Text] The volume of oil production at the oil fields  worked in the Republic has dropped annually by approximately 1  million tonnes. A correspondent of the KHABAR-SERVICE agency  learned this from sources in the State Oil Company of  Azerbaijan. At present annual output stands at the level of 10  million tonnes a year. This is largely due to the absence of  necessary production technologies, because those available allow  for extracting only 65 percent of producible oil. Lack of funds  for repairs and the technical servicing of drilling rigs is  another reason. In conjunction with this, about 2,000 wells both  on land and at sea are completely idle at present.</p>

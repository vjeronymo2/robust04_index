Iran's Foreign Ministry "invited" the Thai ambassador to  Tehran for a meeting "to let him know" it wanted Iranian  diplomats stationed in Bangkok granted access to visit the  suspects, said Mr. Surin.

The three suspects -- Hossein Shahriarifar, Babak Taheri,  and  Basr Kazemi are being held at the police training school in Bang  Khen District, northern Bangkok. [passage omitted]</p>

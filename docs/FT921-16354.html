			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Drummond makes Pounds 0.7m buy DRUMMOND GROUP, the worsted and wool textile company, is acquiring the business and certain assets of Courtaulds Woollens from Courtaulds Textiles for an expected Pounds 695,000 cash. The acquisition is in line with Drummond's policy of diversification in order to lessen its dependence on its traditional worsted business. Courtaulds Woollens incurred an operating loss of Pounds 240,000 on turnover of Pounds 3.1m for the 11 months to November 30. At that date the estimated realisable value of assets being acquired amounted to Pounds 1m. Consideration is payable as to Pounds 200,000 on completion with the balance deferred until April 2. In addition Drummond has an option, exercisable before the end of October, to acquire the premises of the business at a price of Pounds 600,000 until end-June and at market value thereafter.</p>

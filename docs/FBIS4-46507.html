			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by General of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy, minister </F> of defense of Ukraine: "Military Councils: An Important Body in  the Administration of the Organizational Development of the  Armed Forces of Ukraine"]    [Text] Military Councils as collegial advisory bodies in  the Armed Forces of Ukraine have deep historical roots. There  have always been military councils. The tradition of a collegial  approach to deciding the most important questions and those  having a bearing on the future emerged at the same time that a  Ukrainian military force first began to form. The Zaporozhian  Cossacks invested such councils with a special ritual.    The Zaporozhian Cossacks usually held their general councils  on 1 January, on the feast of the Intercession of the Blessed  Virgin Mary [Pokrova] (the feast of the patron of the  Zaporozhian church), on the second or third day of Easter, as  well as at any other time that the Cossacks troops requested the  convocation of a council.    The councils dealt with the most important matters affecting  the life of the army: making peace and declaring war, organizing  military campaigns, punishing criminals, and distributing lands  and property among the kurins [barracks in which  Cossacks lived in a permanent fortified camp or Sich, and, by  extension, to the military unit that lived in them; also  translated as a "platoon"]. The distribution of lands and  elections were held every year without fail.    A few days before the council was to be held, the entire  Cossack army gathered at the Sich. The Cossacks made special  preparations for the council -- they put on their best clothes  and weapons and attended church, first matins and later Mass,  which were celebrated with great ceremony on these days. These  services were followed by communal noonday meals in the  kurins.    After the meal, a cannon shot was fired to signal that the  council was about to begin. A kettle-drum was brought out of the  church, and the drummer sounded the preparatory signal. He was  followed by the Osavul [Adjutant-General], who  carried a large military banner into the main square. A second  roll of the kettle-drum signaled the actual "assembly." The  rank-and-file Cossacks were followed into the square by the  Starshyna [Cossack Officer Corps] wearing the  insignia of their rank. They were greeted by a drum roll. When  they reached their assigned place, the officers bowed to the  whole assembled company, which stood in a circle around the  square.    After the lands had been distributed by lot, the  Koshovyy [Sich Camp Commander] asked the assembled  company if it wanted to change the entire Officer Corps in  keeping with tradition at the start of a new year. In response,  the Cossacks either supported his leadership, or they demanded  that he lay down his mace [bulava]. In the event that the latter  happened, the whole officer corps resigned, except for those  whom the Cossacks asked to stay on in their posts. Genuinely  democratic elections were then held to elect candidates from all  the kurins.    The election was also regulated by custom: each elected  officer twice refused the post for which he had been chosen,  while the ritual of smearing his head with dirt was to remind  him not to think of himself as better than the rest of the  Cossack brotherhood. If a foreign ambassador was present at the  Council in order to make some request of the Cossacks, he set  forth the terms he was offering before the entire company, after  which the matter was decided in his absence. If there was  disagreement between the officers and the rank and file, 20  representatives were elected, who conducted detailed talks with  the ambassador and concluded an agreement.    There was no formal vote: the matter was decided by  acclamation, that is, by a decisive numerical majority voicing  support for a decision.    In addition to general councils, if the Starshyna  did not want to convoke such a council, there were smaller  councils "in the kurins," called skhodky: the otamans  [leaders] of the kurins gathered in the Camp  Commander's kurin [kurin koshovoho]. These meetings  were held to discuss minor campaigns and secret and urgent  matters.    Small councils [skhodky] in the palankas [the  eight military districts outside the Sich in the so-called "Free  Lands of the Zaporozhian Forces"] dealt with insignificant  matters and were held by married Cossacks who lived outside the  Sich.    By the end of the 17th century, a General Council was called  only to elect the Hetman or ratify treaty articles with Moscow;  other matters were decided by a council of officers. This  council met at Christmas or the feast of the Epiphany and at  Easter. It dealt with planning campaigns, the construction of  forts, and the maintenance of subunits. It was this council that  came to resemble a real military council.    The things that are useful and warranted at each historical  stage assume a new content to suit the needs of subsequent  periods.    Today, when Ukraine is building her Armed Forces in  difficult  economic and sociopolitical conditions, military councils play a  unique role. In accordance with the directive issued by the  President of Ukraine on 24 March 1993, which ratifies the  Statute on the Military Collegium of the Ministry of Defense of  Ukraine and the Statute on Military Councils in the Armed Forces  of Ukraine, they have the status of permanent collegial advisory  bodies.    One of the main tasks of today's military councils is to  work  out recommendations on such issues as maintaining the combat and  mobilizational readiness of forces, strengthening military  discipline and the social and legal protection of military  personnel, improving the effectiveness of the exercise of  command over the troops, conferring military ranks and awards,  receiving reports from commanders of subunits within the  different combat arms and formations of the Armed Forces of  Ukraine and from the military districts on their activity, and  submitting their conclusions to be included in drafts of  normative acts to be sent to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.    What is new in the work of the military councils?    Today's military councils play an important role as a  collegial organ in implementing cadre policy. This procedure for  appointing generals and officers to responsible posts and for  conferring military ranks precludes the kind of protectionism  that we often saw in the past. The military council deals with  the issue of training reserve cadres.    In their work, the military councils are guided by the  constitution and laws of Ukraine, the decrees of the Supreme  Council of Ukraine, the edicts and directives of the president  of Ukraine, the decrees and directives of the Cabinet of  Ministers of Ukraine, the decisions of the Defense Council of  Ukraine, and the orders and directives of the minister of  defense of Ukraine.    To guarantee that the military council performs its tasks  effectively, its chairman must ensure that the discussion of  issues at the council meetings is unconstrained, principled, and  comprehensive and that the views of all participants are taken  into account when decisions are made. He also sees to it that  the council's decisions are implemented.    It has become customary for members of the council to make  regular reports about their personal role in carrying out the  council's decisions and on questions pertaining to preventing  accidents and traumatism among military personnel, the guards,  etc. There is now greater oversight of implementation of the  council's decisions, translated into orders issued by  commanders: the commanders report on the execution of these  orders.    After analyzing the positive results of the work of the  Military Council of the Odessa Military District, it is clear  that this council has introduced a fine tradition of conducting  visiting sessions.    Such sessions are held directly in the combined formations,  formations, and military units. At the same time, practical  instruction on questions put on the agenda for discussion are  held with commanders and chiefs of services. Urgent measures are  applied on the spot to make the necessary provisions for combat  instruction and other vital activities of the troops.    In my opinion, another positive fact is that participation  in  the meetings of the military councils and field exercises are  not confined solely to the Chairman of the Oblast Council of  People's Deputies, who is a member of the Military Council, but  that representatives of the local state executive organs, of  local and regional self-government organs, and of enterprises,  institutions, and organizations are also invited. This gives  them an opportunity to acquaint themselves with the kind of  socioeconomic and purely military problems that the Armed Forces  of Ukraine face today, as well as with the military equipment at  the army's disposal.    In addition, this gives military personnel an opportunity to  work more closely with the representatives of local government.  As we know, every military formation is stationed on the  administrative territory of an oblast or a rayon, and  fulfillment of the laws of Ukraine on the social protection of  military personnel depends in large measure on how well the  military councils work with the leadership of local government  organs. Neither the local authorities, nor the military units  can carry out such measures as organizing the defense and  communications of a region, mobilization, conscription into  military service, and military recruitment on their own. And  what about purely everyday matters?! The oblasts and rayons rely  on assistance from the military to bring in the harvest, while  the latter, in turn, ask for help with housing.    It has become customary for the military councils to seek  the  help of the local authorities in preventing desertion and  avoiding the draft.    One can make a long list of the issues that need to be  solved  jointly, but the key question facing both the military and local  authorities is how to solve anything at all in the present state  of overall economic decline.    Clearly, matters are not confined solely to economic and  everyday social problems. Providing care for invalids and war  and labor veterans, establishing patronage relations between  enterprises and military units, and the military and patriotic  education of youth -- these are issues that have to be dealt  with on a national scale.    Unquestionably, the military councils, like the Armed Forces  of Ukraine, are still young, but in the short time that they  have existed, a certain amount of positive experience has been  accumulated which should be made public.    As Defense Minister of Ukraine, I do my best to ensure that  the military councils of the Armed Forces of Ukraine not  continue the worst traditions of the military councils of the  former Soviet Army, in which these bodies performed punitive  functions (deciding whom to dismiss from his post, whom to  demote in rank, etc.). An officer left such military councils  demoralized. Crudity, boorishness, and conduct humiliating to  officers and generals were the hallmarks of these councils. As a  rule, these were not gatherings at which colleagues met to  exchange views, but rather a place where punishments were meted  out.    Historical experience testifies that military councils  should  serve as assemblies of military personnel for consultation --  that is, serve the very purpose they were meant to serve when  they were first formed. As such, they will enhance the authority  of the commander, provide him with an opportunity to reveal his  personality, and strengthen the principle of unity of command  [yedynonachalstvo]. This will allow him to put forward vitally  important recommendations in all fields, ranging from the  practical implementation of military policies in the Armed  Forces of Ukraine to the things that pertain to the ordinary  concerns of everyday life.</p>

In Japan, Kim and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa noted the  importance of internationally coordinated efforts to solve the  nuclear problem, especially among South Korea, Japan, China and  the United States.    While the two leaders did not rule out the possibility of UN  sanctions, they agreed that the channel for dialogue should be  left open.    In China, President Jiang Zemin's downright opposition to  sanctions turned the process completely around in the direction  of negotiations.    The crisis over North Korea was reaching a new peak and the  voices of hard-liners in South Korea and its allies were getting  louder before Kim embarked on his trip, especially after  Pyongyang threatened war by turning Seoul into a "sea of fire."    The UN Security Council hastily convened to discuss adopting  a resolution, setting a deadline for North Korea to accept  nuclear inspections.    But after Kim's trip, the emphasis is on giving Pyongyang  one  more chance. Developments here coincide with a turnaround at  the Security Council, which now plans to issue a statement in  the council president's name instead of adopting a resolution.    Officials in Seoul indicated they are willing to go along  with the Chinese proposal to ensure Beijing takes part in  international action.    The participation of China, about the only remaining North  Korean ally, is the single most important element in persuading  Pyongyang that it can no longer count on Beijing's support and  in guaranteeing the effectiveness of sanctions.    Japanese and Chinese concerns became clear during Kim's  visit  -- their fear of armed conflict on the Korean peninsula which  would put their own national security and economies at stake.  Jiang went as far as saying that peace in the region is a  prerequisite to China's continued economic growth.    Seoul's and Washington's choice is now to wait a little  longer rather than risk China's opposition in case a resolution  is put to a council vote.    Behind this choice is the calculation that if North Korea  continues to refuse inspections, Beijing will then lose all  justification in demanding further negotiations.    South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu leaves for  Washington directly from Beijing to brief U.S. officials on the  results of the Japan and China summits.    He will apparently convey China's insistence on additional  diplomatic efforts and discuss how to get North Korea to come  back to the negotiating table.    Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), said his inspection team has to re-enter  North Korea within six weeks.    Seoul and Washington, in their attempts at dialogue with  Pyongyang, are expected to withhold a decision on staging their  joint military maneuvers "Team Spirit" until after the six weeks  is up.    Now that the international mood is tipping toward further  dialogue with North Korea, it is Pyongyang's turn to respond.</p>

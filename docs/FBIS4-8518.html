			<p>BFN     [Text] Doboj, April 13 (TANJUG) -- Moslem forces on  Wednesday continued attacks on Serb defence positions and  settlements on all parts of the front in the region of Doboj in  the north of the Serb republic (S.R.) in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Bosnian Serb army sources said.    The command of the first Krajina corps of the S.R. army said  on Wednesday evening that Serb defenders in the area of Teslic  some 20 kilometres south-west of Doboj had repulsed an attack  there and forced the enemy troops to return to their earlier  positions.    The Moslems continued to bring in fresh troops from the  direction of Zenica and deploy them close to Serb positions in  the southern and south-eastern part of the Teslic front, the  command said.    After daily defeats and major losses in manpower and  weaponry  along all lines of contact in the area of Ozren and Vozuca,  Moslem fighters vented their anger by opening infantry and  artillery fire on Serb civilian settlements.    Apart from major damage, there were no civilian casualties,  the S.R. army command said.</p>

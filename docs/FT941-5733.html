			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Metall Mining suffers sharp fall Metall Mining, the Toronto-based international mining arm of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, suffered a sharp drop in fourth-quarter earnings as a result of weak copper and zinc prices. Net income fell to CDollars 4.3m (USDollars 3.2m) or six cents a share, from CDollars 9.8m, or 18 cents, a year earlier. Figures for the latest period include a CDollars 19m gain from the sale of an investment, compared with a similar gain of CDollars 6.5m last year. Revenues climbed to CDollars 140.3m from CDollars 104.4m, reflecting Metall's recent purchase of its parent company's copper smelting and refining interests. Metallgesellschaft has indicated that it planned to sell its 50.1 per cent stake in Metall as part of its financial restructuring. However, the disposal is complicated by arrangements between Metallgesellschaft and its partners in various joint ventures in which the parent's stake has been bundled into Metall. Some partners also hold a right of first refusal on Metall's stake in their ventures. Metall said that prices received by Copper Range, an integrated producer in Michigan, fell to an average of 90 US cents per pound last year from USDollars 1.03 in 1992. This was partly offset by a drop in cash costs for cathode produced from Copper Range ore to 79 cents from 82 cents. Feasibility studies are continuing at the Izok Lake property in Canada's Northwest Territories, the largest undeveloped copper and zinc deposit in North America. But Metall cautioned that transportation of concentrates from the remote site 'remains a major issue'.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATWATCH;  </P> <P> THOMAS CRAMS A SEASON INTO SINGLE GAME  </P> <P> Quartz Hill High tailback Erik Thomas, a 5-foot-10, 180-pound sophomore who had  rushed for 152 yards in eight games, surpassed that total with a 190-yard  performance against Ridgecrest Burroughs on Friday.  </P> <P> Burbank (1-7-1) has passed for 1,262 yards, fifth among Valley teams. Bryan  Miclette (36 catches, 522 yards, two touchdowns) and Patrick Blazon (33  catches, 431 yards, one touchdown) are fourth and fifth among Valley receivers.  </P> <P> Montclair Prep ran just 14 offensive plays in its 54-0 win over Maranatha,  seven of which resulted in touchdowns. Derek Sparks ran for four scores, giving  him 29 touchdowns this season.  </P> <P> Notre Dame ran just 32 offensive plays in its 55-6 victory over St. Genevieve.  The Knights' first team scored on five of six possessions, and the second team  scored on each of its three possessions.  </P> <P> Streaks: Antelope Valley (2-7, 1-3 in Golden League play) will miss the  playoffs for the first time since 1979. The Antelopes' seven-game losing  streak, which was snapped last week, is their longest in the 1980s.  </P> <P> Scoring: Monroe kicker Rachel Gagliano is six of six in point-after kicks but  has yet to attempt a field goal. The state record for scoring by a girl is 11  points. Gagliano has two games in which to eclipse that mark.  </P> <P> Rushing: It is a red-hot race that is likely to resume next season. After  gaining 176 yards in Granada Hills' 17-0 defeat of Kennedy last Friday,  Highlander fullback Brett Washington has moved to within 15 yards of Ontiwaun  Carter in the run for the Northwest Valley Conference rushing title. Carter, a  junior tailback who was held to 55 yards against Granada Hills, has 932 yards.  Washington, also a junior, has 917. Although Carter has played in one less  game, he has carried the ball 32 times more than Washington, who is averaging  8.3 yards a carry.  </P> <P> Passing: After seven games, three teams in the Northwest Valley Conference have  yet to pass for a touchdown -- El Camino Real, Chatsworth and Taft. The teams'  starting quarterbacks have combined for 618 yards (an average per team of 29.4  yards a game) and 18 interceptions.  </P> <P> Defense: In its 34-13 rout of Warren, Thousand Oaks gave up 216 yards rushing,  more than the Lancers had allowed all season. Through their first eight games,  the Lancers yielded 187 yards -- 23.4 yards a game.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OPEN TENNIS;  </P> <P> LENDL ELIMINATES AGASSI, WILL FACE BECKER IN FINAL  </P> <P> Perennial finalist Ivan Lendl joined Boris Becker in the championship round of  the U.S. Open Saturday, defeating Andre Agassi, 7-6 (7-4), 6-1, 3-6, 6-1, and  tying a tournament record held by the Bill Tilden.  </P> <P> Today, Lendl plays in his eighth consecutive Open final, matching the mark  Tilden established from 1918-25. He goes for his fourth crown against Becker,  the first German in more than half a century to play for the U.S. men's  championship.  </P> <P> The top-seeded Lendl struggled early against Agassi, trailing in the first set  and battling back to force a tiebreaker, which he won, 7-4. The set took 1 hour  15 minutes as both players stayed at the baseline.  </P> <P> Agassi went quickly in the second set, but won the third before Lendl put him  away in the fourth, setting up the match with Becker for the title.  </P> <P> Lendl has a 7-6 career edge over Becker, but has lost their last three  meetings, including the semifinals at Wimbledon in July when the German was on  the way to his third All-England title.  </P> <P> Becker reached the final by beating Aaron Krickstein, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4, and then  decided that he has finally figured out the puzzle of the Open, where his  grass-court success at Wimbledon has never counted for much on the punishing  hard courts of Flushing Meadow.  </P> <P> "I've learned my lesson here," Becker said after advancing to the final. "You  almost have to love it here. You have to forget the distractions here: the  planes, the heat, the noise of the spectators. It's difficult to play, but you  just have to go out and have fun, like (Jimmy) Connors has done for the past 18  years."  </P> <P> Fun for Becker was becoming the first German since 1937 to reach the men's  final here. The only other time that happened, Baron Gottfried von Cramm lost  the U.S. National championship to Don Budge. The Nationals changed to the Open  in 1968.  </P> <P> Despite his success at Wimbledon, Becker had never made it to the final of any  other Grand Slam event until Saturday. "This is definitely a big moment for  me," he said. "I guess that's why the match was difficult."  </P> <P> Becker seemed headed out of this tournament early when he twice faced match  points against unseeded Derrick Rostagno in the second round. But he survived  that crisis and has cruised since then, winning each of his last two matches in  straight sets.  </P> <P> Krickstein came in with a reputation for doing well in longer matches. He had a  17-7 career record in five-set matches, including a 7-1 log for them at the  Open. So his strategy was to stretch Becker out.  </P> <P> "I didn't feel I hit the ball badly," Krickstein said. "I feel I missed some  key shots. If I had won one of those early sets, we could have had a 3 1/2-  (or) four-hour match and anything can happen."  </P> <P> With courtside temperatures near 100 degrees, Becker was hardly in the comfort  zone.  </P> <P> "The heat was the most difficult thing," he said. "It was probably the hottest  I've ever played in. That's why I didn't attack as much. It's easier from the  baseline. To rush all the time can be exhausting."  </P> <P> So he stayed back and eventually won the battle of attrition, maintaining his  record of never having dropped a set in four career meetings with Krickstein.  </P></p>

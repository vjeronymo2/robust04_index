			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XLV_Preference for Local and Small Business <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS section 219.504 was revised and subpart 226.71 was added as an interim rule by departmental letter 94&hyph;004, effective March 8, 1994, to implement section 2912 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;160). Section 2912 requires DoD, when entering into contracts as part of the closure or realignment of a military installation under a base closure law, to give preference, to the greatest extent practicable, to qualified businesses located in the vicinity of the installation and to small business and small disadvantaged business concerns. This includes contracts awarded to carry out activities for the environmental restoration and mitigation at military installations to be closed or realigned. The guidance in subpart 226.71 is to be used when entering into contracts as part of the closure or realignment of a military installation. If there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be received from responsible business concerns located in the vicinity of the military installation that is being closed or realigned, do not set aside the acquisition for small or small disadvantaged businesses unless an offer can be expected from a small or small disadvantage business located in the vicinity of the installation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XLVI_Lifeboat Survival Systems <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS Sections 225.7022, 225.7022&hyph;1, 225.70222&hyph;2, and 252,225&hyph;7039 were added as an interim rule by departmental letter 94&hyph;005, effective April 13, 1994, to implement section 8124 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act, Public Law 103&hyph;139. Section 8124 prohibits the purchase of totally enclosed lifeboat survival systems, which consist of the lifeboat and associated davits and winches, if less than 50 percent of the entire system's components are manufactured in the United States, and if less than 50 percent of the labor in the manufacture and assembly of the entire system is performed in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XLVII_Small Disadvantaged Business, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority Institutions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS sections 219.301, 226,7005, 252,219&hyph;7000, 252,219&hyph;7003, 252.219&hyph;7006, 252.226&hyph;7000, and 252.226&hyph;7001 were revised by departmental letter 94&hyph;006, effective April 21, 1994, to implement subsections 811(a), (b), and (c) of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;160). Subsections 811 (a) and (b) revise the definitions for historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) and minority institutions (MI). Subsection 811(c) deletes the requirement for an offeror, that represents itself on a DoD solicitation as small disadvantaged business, HBCU, or MI, to maintain its status as such at the time of award. Under this interim rule, the offeror must qualify as an ADB, HBCU, or MI only at time of submission of the offer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XLVIII_Economy Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> By memorandum of February 8, 1994, the Secretary of Defense established requirements for approval of a written determination before an Economy Act order may be released outside of DoD for contracting action. DFARS subpart 217.5 was revised by departmental letter 94&hyph;007, effective April 25, 1994, to define the role of the contracting officer in the approval process for Economy Act orders. Contracting officers should provide advice, if requested, to assist requirements personnel in the preparation of written determinations to support Economy Act orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XLXIX_Petroleum Products <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS sections 225.401, 225,403, and 225.403&hyph;70 were revised by departmental letter 94&hyph;008, effective April 26, 1994, to implement section 8094 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;139). Section 8094 requires the Department of Defense to treat offers of petroleum products from eligible countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act the same as offers from designated countries under the Trade Agreements Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Trade Agreements Act, designated country end products and Caribbean Basin country end products are evaluated without regard to the Buy American Act or Balance of Payments Program. However, petroleum products were previously excluded from the definition of Caribbean Basin country end products. The revisions of DFARS sections 225.401, 225.403, and 225.403&hyph;70 remove the exclusion of petroleum products from the definition of ``Caribbean Basin country end product.'' This will result in treating offers of petroleum from Caribbean Basin countries as if they were offers from designated countries under the Trade Agreements Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item L_Editorial Revisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The asterisked items are revisions being made only in the looseleaf edition of DFARS.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

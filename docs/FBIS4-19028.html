			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 13 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  announced here Wednesday [13 April] that it was taking Greece to  the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in an attempt to overturn a  Greek trade embargo of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  [FYROM].    The announcement by the European Commission followed  Greece's  failure to lift the blockade, imposed on February 16, after the  EU executive decided on April 6 to go to court unless the  embargo was ended within a week.    It was the first time that the European Union has taken a  member country to court over an action which a member claimed  was a response to a security threat.    On February 16 Greece blocked all Macedonian trade through  the northern Greek port of Salonika, which handles most of the  Macedonia's imports and exports.    Athens maintains that Macedonia robbed its name from the  neighbouring northern Greece province of Macedonia.    It says this, plus the use of an ancient Greek sun symbol in  the Macedonian flag and a reference in its constitution to  liberating enslaved Macedonia, implies territorial ambitions on  the northern Greek province.    The Commission objected because it said the embargo blocked  trade of other EU countries with Macedonia, and could not be  justified on the grounds that Macedonian actions had created  international tension and the threat of war.    The Commission is hoping that the ECJ will quickly issue a  temporary order that Greece should lift the embargo pending the  court's decision on its legality.</p>

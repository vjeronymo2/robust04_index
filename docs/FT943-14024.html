			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Kazakhs celebrate gold rush in style Even by the demanding standards of the international mining industry, this has been a great party. Not one, but two public holidays were brought forward so that everyone in Auezov, a frontier town of 6,000 people, could celebrate in style the first gold 'pour' from the new treatment plant at the Bakyrchik mine. Out on Kazakhstan's north eastern steppes, 1,000 kms from the capital Almaty, in yurts - the felt tents used by central Asian nomads - about 200 Kazakh VIP's including several ministers, dined on local delicacies such as boiled sheep heads and fermented mares' milk. And looking slightly incongruous in this setting were about 50 visitors from the City of London, watching the Kazakh horse racing, wrestling and other more exotic entertainments lasting through the night. The London-based investors and analysts are here to reassure themselves about the Bakyrchik gold mine. In the past year Pounds 11.5m has been provided towards the first joint venture in the gold business between a western company and this newly independent former part of the Soviet Union. The money was raised by Bakyrchik Gold, a company listed in London which has 40 per cent of the joint venture. Some of the proceeds have been used to raise annual gold output from the mine to 45,000 ounces but also for a feasibility study to see if modern mining and processing methods could boost Bakyrchik's production to 275,000 ounces. Although it promises much - it is on one of the world's biggest gold deposits with resources of 8.5m ounces - conditions underground at the mine are extremely difficult. The ore is hard to process and contains arsenic. The feasibility study shows the problems can be overcome. Before the year end Bakyrchik Gold is to go ahead with plans to lift production at a cost of Dollars 125m (Pounds 82.2m). Mr David Hooker, the chairman, says most of the money will be raised from shareholders because debt offered by banks would be expensive and the terms onerous. Mr Nursultan Nazerbayev, president of Kazakhstan, was expected to host a conference for the London investors last night to stress his personal interest in the project. He wants it to succeed as Kazakhstan needs to increase gold production to provide backing for its fledgling currency, the tenge. He also wants more foreign investment in Kazakhstan, a country as vast as western Europe, stretching between Russia and China and richly endowed with natural resources.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / The LDP's stand-in refuses to lie down: Former premier Toshiki Kaifu is refusing to toe the party line by opposing reforms The fondest memories of Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the former Japanese prime minister, are hanging in his office: a photograph of a shared joke with then President George Bush; an apparently attentive Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher taking in the thoughts of Toshiki; and an audience in Beijing's Great Hall of the People. For a man dubbed the 'relief pitcher' by his colleagues in the Liberal Democratic party, who saw him as a very temporary stand-in from a weak faction, Mr Kaifu's influence has lingered in the Japanese parliament, soon to reconsider electoral reform bills that echo proposals he made in 1991. Mr Kaifu, 63, was also expected to disappear quickly into the relative obscurity from which he had been plucked when the LDP needed a 'clean politician' to lead the party after a spate of scandals and a miserable election in 1989. Instead, he remains in the spotlight, having crossed the party line by refusing to vote against the reform bills, which he said 'must be passed this month or they may never be passed'. After apologising repeatedly for returning late to his office, Mr Kaifu explained that he had come from a meeting of LDP faction heads and former prime ministers which agreed that the party should restart debate on electoral reforms. Since falling into opposition last year, the LDP has repeatedly refused to discuss procedure with government, customary in Japanese consensus politics, and boycotted a sitting to extend the present session of parliament. 'I told my colleagues that this sort of behaviour is not good for our public image. We have to get involved in the debate. We should be setting the agenda, but at present, we are always on the defensive and it does not look good,' Mr Kaifu said. Defections from the LDP over the past year have changed the character of the party. Many reformers with whom Mr Kaifu feels most comfortable have joined new parties, leaving a conservative core yet to appreciate the depth of change in Japanese politics and determined to preserve a system of factional patronage that is prone to corruption. The party appointed a reformer, Mr Yohei Kono, as leader in an attempt to improve its image, but faction leaders have undermined his authority. Mr Kono is forced to give embarrassingly vague answers in public because his script is jointly written by about four powerful figures in the backroom who are often unable to agree on the wording. Mr Kaifu hints that the introduction of reforms and another general election could set the scene for him to leave the LDP, of which he is proud for its 'commitment to free markets and democracy'. He foresees continuing instability that will test old loyalties and provide new opportunities for a proven leader. His own sudden exit from the leadership, which came when he ignored the advice of the backroom and pushed ahead with reform, contributed to public contempt for the LDP. Unless the party is more open, he says, it will face continuing unpopularity and defections of MPs to newer parties. 'I understand how the influence of the backroom works. My administration was brought down that way. They moved against me. I understand the pressures on Mr Kono,' he said. 'I keep telling people to be more open, but I guess that they regard me as a bit of nuisance.' His influence is limited by his membership of the smallest faction, though his good scores in opinion polls and the general recognition that he tried to reform Japanese politics mean that younger LDP members like to associate with him, hopeful that his prestige will rub off on them. Before a general election last July, he chaired a 184-member political reform committee, which LDP parliamentarians rushed to join, keen to convince voters that they, too, were 'reformers'. However, the party lost office for the first time in 38 years and a seven-party coalition government was formed by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. Mr Kaifu suggests that Japanese prime ministerial style is changing, as his term as leader showed the public preference for straight answers, rather than the bewildering sentence structures employed by his predecessors. He has an affinity with Mr Hosokawa, who also scores well in opinion polls and is a straight talker, but has a fragile power base. 'There are serious problems in the coalition government, but they haven't changed policies. The socialists (Social Democratic party) have always had a strange foreign policy. They said North Korea was good and South Korea was wrong. But the foreign policy hasn't been altered since the coalition arrived. It's still the LDP policy.'</p>

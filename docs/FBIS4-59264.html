			<p>BFN     [Text] All opposition Knesset members [MK's] left the  plenum prior to the vote held in conclusion of the debate at  which Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin presented the Gaza and  Jericho agreements. In the opposition's absence, the prime  minister's speech was endorsed by a majority of 52 versus zero  opponents. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht notes that some  opposition MK's, including Dan Meridor, Beni Begin, Yitzhaq  Shamir, and David Levi, were sharply opposed to abandoning the  plenum. They maintained that the step is a violation of  parliamentary rules.    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who closed the debate, said  that in the Likud era, 120,000 Palestinians were locked up in  prisons, which were schools for nationalism and the reason for  the emergence of a Palestinian nation and a Palestinian entity  in Gaza.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with ANC President Nelson Mandela by announcer </F> Jon Snow in Johannesburg on 28 April--recorded]    [Text] [Snow] I asked him [Mandela] to detail his  allegations.    [Mandela] There is a view that there has been massive  sabotage, not by the independent election commission, but in the  process of distribution. Because the striking feature is that  in all white, (?Indian), and colored areas there has been no  problems. But the failure to deliver the ballot papers only  took place in the [word indistinct) to African areas. Some of  the ballot papers were found locked up in certain townships, in  warehouses in certain townships. And the briefing I'm getting is  that there has been some massive sabotage. Nevertheless we are  now dealing with that question. Our command center, acting in  collaboration with the independent elections commission, is  addressing this matter. I am confident that we are going to  resolve them. I have been in touch with President De Klerk  yesterday and by telephone, and at half past two we met and  discussed this matter. I'm convinced that we are going to  resolve this matter.    [Snow] He has apparently been putting planes and helicopters  at your disposal, or at the disposal of the election commission  to try and get the ballots out, and they've printed another 10  million, but you called it massive sabotage. By whom?    [Mandela] No, he is responding to what we have discovered.  At the present moment the matter is under investigation, and it  would be improper for us to attach blame to any particular  individual organization without a proper investigation. What is  clear is that ballot papers have reached the areas where whites,  coloreds, and Indians are to vote. And the problem has happened  almost exclusively at the African areas.    [Snow] Are we in time then to have a free and fair election  in which everybody in the country has equal chance to vote?    [Mandela] Well, the way in which these problems have been  addressed will ensure that the end of the day, free and fair  elections have been conducted. I am not alarmed by the problems  which have arisen. And the point is that when these problems  arise, there are men and women from both sides of the color  line, who are prepared to address them honestly, frankly, and  effectively. And that is the machinery that we've now put into  operation.    [Snow] Could I then look beyond the electoral process, to  the  building of a government of national unity, which is after all  what all this is about. Can you have a full government of  national unity which does not include Chief Buthelezi and  Inkatha -- whether they get five percent or not?    [Mandela] We are not thinking in terms of individuals. We  think in terms of the process. We would like an inclusive  process where all parties, political parties are involved. But  whether we are going to have a government of national unity or  not, depends on whether a political party gets five percent or  more of the total votes cast in an election. If it does he [as  heard] will be in the government of national unity. If he does  not, he does not, he will not be. What is important is that we  have made astounding progress in his absence already, we have  had the political organizations [word indistinct], the state of  emergency which had lasted for several years -- lifted, an  environment of free political activity introduced, hundreds of  political prisoners, some of whom were serving long sentences,  were released, and more than 15,000 political exiles have  returned to the country. But on top of that, we have had a  breakthrough which have been sensational: We have established  the Transitional Executive Council, which has assumed certain  powers of government. We have adopted a constitution, which  although it is fraught, because it is a compromise constitution,  meeting the demands and expectations of no less than 26  different political parties, and pulling in different  directions, we have been able nevertheless, to agree on a  constitution which does mirror the hopes and aspirations of the  majority of the people of South Africa. And what is more, we  have now this day, yesterday, and the day before yesterday.  [sentence as heard] That's a terrific achievement. And as many  of these achievements have been made in spite of the  obstructionist attitude of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. And  therefore I have not the slightest hesitation that the  government of national unity will be established. It will work  very effectively and the plans to better the life of our people  that were developed will be put into practice.    [Snow] Now a lot of this achievement has been dependent upon  the relationship between you and Mr. De Klerk. When we spoke to  him the other day he said: Well, I have a very good formal  relationship with Mr. Mandela. I call him Mr. Mandela, and he  calls me Mr. State President. If you're going to go forward  from that point, will that relationship have to sustain -- and  if anything, even get closer -- or do you see the work already  done?    [Mandela] Well, my relations firstly. I don't think it is  correct to think of the future in terms of the contribution of  just two individuals. Although individuals are important, the  changes in this country have not been brought by a single  individual. It is the men and women of South Africa, from all  population groups, who have exerted tremendous pressure, who  came out into the streets, held strikes, boycotts, who were  harassed and persecuted by the racist police of the apartheid  regime, who were thrown into jail, who were shot and killed --  with the support of the international community, which has been  absolutely massive, and tremendous. It is that pressure that  has made the apostles of apartheid to collapse, to go down on  their knees, and to bring about changes. But within that  background, individuals have played a role. You must put,  therefore, the contribution of any individual against that  background.    [Snow] That's what I wanted to pick you up on, this question  of the pressure that everybody has exerted, but also the fact  that apartheid committed so many crimes, or so many crimes were  committed in the name of apartheid. What should happen to  people who committed those crimes?    [Mandela] I have been saying throughout: Let bygones by  bygones. Let what has happened pass as something unfortunate  but which we must forget. Insofar as people who committed  political and related offenses before the 8th of October 1990,  we are saying that each and everyone of them should make a full  disclosure of the crime that he committed -- not because we want  to put them on trial, but because an indemnity should be an  individual act. We wanted to indemnify a particular individual  for a specific offense that he has committed. This is what was  done to the opponents of apartheid. We now feel this should be  done to those people who committed those offenses in defense of  apartheid. Where there will certainly be no indemnity is in  regard to people who are committing offenses now. Those will not  be covered by indemnity. We are taking this line because these  offenses were committed mainly by the security forces. We depend  on the loyalty of the security forces in this transformation,  and in the government of national unity. It is therefore  necessary that we move to this new dispensation. The South  African Defense Force, and the South African police, the civil  service must be free to serve the new government. They cannot  do so if there is a spirit of insecurity, if their morale is  low, and it is for this reason that I have repeatedly said let  bygones be bygones. And if, during this election, I have warned  both my own members of the organization, as well as other  political organizations, I've said: You must remember that your  opponents now are going to be your partners in future. We are  going to work together, let us not open now wounds which will be  difficult to heal, when we now try to work together in the  government of national unity.    [Snow] Now, when you were young, you led the ANC Youth  League. And you were to some extent frustrated by the lack of  punch at the top -- you didn't feel that the leadership of the  ANC was radical enough. Do you think there's a danger that the  young generation now is more impatient for more radical change  than you can deliver. Do you feel almost, perhaps, things are  being repeated?    [Mandela] No. I have great confidence in our youth. If you  consider that they are living at a stage, at an age, in an  (?era) where they see their white counterparts enjoying rights,  opportunities, privileges, which are denied to them, and when  they see their counterparts, black counterparts in the  neighboring states enjoying the same rights that are enjoyed by  whites here, their impatience is perfectly understandable. But  when we feel that they're too radical as to frighten the  minorities in this country, we speak to them. And in every case  they have been loyal, they have followed orders. That is the  most encouraging issue. This is the striking characteristics of  the loyalty of our youth.    [Snow] One last question: When you were in prison, did you  know you would become president? Did you believe you would  become president? And did you, in a way, plot out within your  mind many of the thoughts you would want to express given that  chance?    [Mandela] No. I never thought so. Not that I excluded the  possibility, but I never thought in terms of the role of an  individual. We had a very capable leadership and [word  indistinct] Oliver Tambo, who was my colleague at the  university, when we formed the youth league together. We then  formed a league of partnership together and then when we were  forced to dissolve our league of partnership he went abroad. He  brought the organization into a level which it had never  occupied before, and he earned the respect of the entire world.  Now I thought of a leadership like that, not from the point of  view of an individual, and least of all of myself. I thought  that we would fight, would continue the struggle for liberation  under his leadership and acting as part of a collective, as part  of a team, and that is what we focus upon. The team is more  important than the individual. Therefore, there was little room  for thinking of the role that an individual could play. And I  had complete confidence in Oliver Tambo that he would be able to  lead the country and the organization to liberation.</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Heavy turnout reported for Sunday trading Customers queued outside shops before they opened yesterday, the first Sunday on which stores were allowed, under the Sunday Trading Act, to sell a full range of goods. Marks and Spencer, which yesterday opened 10 stores in England and Wales for the first time on a Sunday, said people had been knocking on the doors of its shop in Camberley, Surrey, an hour before it had opened. Queues formed outside the Lakeside Centre at Thurrock, Essex, long before it opened. Mr Michael Belt, general manager at Lakeside, said: 'It's been as busy as an average Saturday, with around 120,000 people shopping here.' The Marble Arch Retailers' Association, which represents 366 traders in Edgware Road, west London, reported a 40 per cent increase in sales compared with weekdays. Mr James Lindsay, managing director of the Meadowhall retail complex in Sheffield, said trading there was as busy as on an average Saturday. About 2,000 people were waiting outside before the centre opened. More than 270 stores in the complex opened yesterday compared with 120 on previous Sundays. Many customers would find it difficult to notice the difference because some of the supermarkets, DIY stores and out-of-town retailers have been opening on Sundays for some time. Only two big retail chains as well as M&amp;S were open for the first time: House of Fraser and Waitrose, the supermarket arm of the John Lewis Partnership. For many people it was a Bank holiday family day out, particularly at shopping centres where free entertainment and shows were laid on. Mr Paul Keenan, a spokesman for Gateshead's MetroCentre in Tyne and Wear, which has spent about Pounds 50,000 on publicity, said: 'It's been very, very busy and we reckon it could well turn out to be the second-busiest day of the week after Saturday.' Trade union concerns about Sunday trading appear to have eased. The chief fear was that employees might be forced to work on Sunday against their will, or face the sack. But all shopworkers, including part-timers and those with less than two years' service, are protected under the Sunday Trading Act from enforced Sunday work. The only exceptions are those who contract to work exclusively on Sundays. Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, is happy with the act but is advising shopworkers not to sign agreements to work on Sundays unless satisfied with the terms and conditions. But the Keep Sunday Special Campaign said many staff were under pressure to agree to work on Sundays. 'There are no obligations under the act for employers to inform their employees of their rights.'</p>

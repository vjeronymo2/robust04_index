			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Counties attacked over spending on publicity Ministers have fuelled the row over the English local government review by attacking Essex and Surrey county councils for spending too much on literature publicising their case. Both counties responded that their spending was necessary to meet requirements set by the Local Government Commission. They said district councils, which Department of the Environment ministers excluded from criticism, had spent far more. Most district councils favour creating small, all-purpose unitary authorities while counties prefer either the existing two-tier system of counties and districts or the creation of large unitary authorities. All councils are expected to make submissions to the commission by the end of May. Essex said it 'absolutely refuted' the charge. It said the county had still not decided on a new structure to recommend to the commission, and had so far spent only Pounds 10,000 on a consultation leaflet, of which 25,000 copies had been printed. Surrey estimated its expenditure - incurred producing two leaflets and commissioning a Harris poll of residents - at Pounds 20,000. Mr Michael Jennings, deputy chief executive, said this had been incurred under guidance from the commission. He estimated that the 11 Surrey district councils had spent 'at least Pounds 100,000' on the review. Each of them paid Pounds 7,500 to CSL, the managed services division of accountants Touche Ross, to prepare financial estimates for their submission, which calls for five or six unitary councils.</p>

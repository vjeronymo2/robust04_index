			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: Barlow Rand treads break-up path  -The South African industrial group's plan THE writing had long been on the wall for Barlow Rand, South Africa's largest industrial group, which announced this week it will be breaking into four separate companies. Spurred by years of flat growth, under-performance of the share, and highly publicised bad investments, especially in the mining area, analysts had been asking some hard questions about Barlows' performance. To that extent, this week's announcement, which follows indications in June the group may be going along the break-up path, was no surprise. Barlows will be split into four main divisions: Barlow Rand, with activities ranging from domestic appliances to capital equipment; CG Smith, focusing on consumer spending; Reunert, on electronics and engineering; and Rand Mines/Rand Mines Properties, with Randcoal the main asset. The share prices of Barlow Rand, CG Smith and Reunert have hardly moved since the announcement, suggesting the full import of the deal has yet to be properly digested. The outlook for the various groups is difficult to predict as the deal will only be finalised in September, to take effect in February, and only then will the new managements be able to start discussing their plans. All will start with seasoned managements and little debt. Much also depends on the strength and shape of an economic upturn of which there are now signs. CG Smith, with such powerful companies as Tiger Oats, Nampak and Adcock Ingram, and Reunert look like doing well while the rest of Barlow Rand will lag. This might, however, be proved wrong, especially if a new government spends heavily on a national reconstruction programme. What came as a surprise in the whole process was the speed at which executives acted. Just 10 days before the June announcement, senior executives were strenuously contesting that unbundling was the correct path to take. The speed with which Barlows embraced unbundling did not only surprise observers. When a three-man committee (comprising managing director Derek Cooper, Robbie Williams of Tiger Oats and non-executive director Dick Goss) recommended to the board in June that Barlows should unbundle, it came as news to many, including some of the executive directors. The driving force behind the process was the chairman, Mr Warren Clewlow. Although the investment community is lukewarm about Mr Clewlow, he is the man they must thank for promoting a course most of them favour. What prompted his decision? As one observer notes wryly: 'The road to Damascus runs all over the place.' Mr Clewlow said he started thinking about unbundling about a year ago when he relinquished his chief executive role to Mr Derek Cooper, who became managing director in January 1992. The main concern was how to arrest the flat earnings performance of the past four years (attributable profit fell to R849m (Dollars 252.6m) in 1992 from R1bn in 1989). Other issues were how to take the group into the 'new South Africa,' and how to expand it beyond South Africa's borders. Mr Clewlow contends the existing structure - the product of diversification, especially in the 1980s - could not feasibly have been extended further. 'There was no point in taking the group even further and further like this (horizontal diversification).' He believes the next stage is to deepen - rather than broaden - group activities. Amid reports that many directors are unhappy about the break-up, Mr Clewlow does not pretend his proposals met with universal acclaim. He does claim that 'most' of the board supported the proposal 'strongly,' but admits that 'a lot' said they didn't like it, but were unable to suggest better ways of facing the future. Mr Clewlow argues that 'in the past 20 years the way the group has grown was right,' but it is by no means a universal view. One school of thought holds that Barlow Rand, in its current form, was conceptually flawed. That view maintains it was not possible for it to be committed both to developing brands, as the consumer activities require, and to a cost-cutting culture in a commodity style business, with the aim of being the lowest cost producer The group has also suffered some grievous body blows in the recent past. The assembled calamities on the mining side did grievous damage to its prestige and credibility. The catastrophic venture into platinum, through Barmines; the lossmaking gold mines; the closures of the Vansa vanadium plant and the Barbrook gold mine; the sale of Middelburg Steel - none of these redounds to Barlows' credit. Soon after acquiring control in 1971 of Rand Mines, the then chairman, 'Punch' Barlow, wrote: 'Our acquisition of Rand Mines brought us many more problems than we anticipated.' He didn't know the half of it.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: EC to raise Ecu490m to fund E European loans THE European Community is planning to raise Ecu490m in the international bond market, probably next week, to fund a series of loans to eastern European countries. Mr Antoine Bloch, director of the Commission's funding arm, said in Luxembourg yesterday that the money will be on-lent to cover balance of payments deficits in several countries. The bond issues will be fully fungible (interchangeable) with an outstanding Ecu250m six-year issue made in December. This fits in with the EC's policy of adding to existing deals wherever possible to create large, liquid issues. The Ecu490m is needed to fund loans agreed in recent weeks, Mr Bloch said. These include a Ecu150m credit for Romania, agreed in mid-January, and second tranches of loans already made to Czechoslovakia, Hungary and other EC states. The EC's credits and investments division is forbidden under EC treaties from raising money until loan agreements are actually signed. However, the EC is not ready to advance the second tranche of a Ecu400m loan agreed with Algeria last year, Mr Bloch said. The first tranche was funded by a Ecu250m bond issue in December. The balance of the loan will only be disbursed to Algeria if a refinancing agreement is reached between the country and its commercial bank creditors. The deadline for the Dollars 1.5bn refinancing package, lead managed by Credit Lyonnais, has been extended and now expires on February 14. The EC expects to increase its Ecu borrowing substantially this year. Last year it raised around Ecu2bn to fund balance of payments loans, rising to Ecu3.25bn this year. Around Ecu2bn of this will be raised in public bond markets, Mr Bloch said. The remaining Ecu1.25bn, to fund food purchases by former Soviet republics, will be met by bank borrowings, he said. In addition, the EC expects to increase its lending under the European Coal and Steel Community to Ecu1.9bn, up from Ecu1.4bn last year and Ecu1bn in 1990. Much of this will be financed in the international bond market.</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OBSERVATIONS ON 'THE CIVIL WAR'  </P> <P> Bernstein's article indicated that the miniseries lessened some people's  opinion of Lincoln vis-a-vis slavery. I was saddened to hear this.  </P> <P> In 1854, Lincoln largely abandoned a prosperous law practice and -- at much  financial and personal loss -- spent 10 years doing everything practical and  possible on behalf of the slaves.  </P> <P> He stopped working only when all slaves were liberated by constitutional  amendment, actual ratification of the amendment occurring toward the end of the  year in which he was killed.  </P> <P> Lincoln has been criticized for not working sooner to free the slaves in the  Old South. Had he done so, he would not have been elected President and the  slaves would have remained in bondage for God knows how many decades. Had he  taken a stronger anti-slavery position sooner, he would have been just one more  ineffective abolitionist.  </P> <P> Lincoln accomplished the miracle of the freeing all slaves and saving the  Union. No person ever accomplished so much.  </P> <P> RICHARD L. GAUSEWITZ  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

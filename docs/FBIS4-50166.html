			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 15 May (XINHUA) -- In connection with some  problems that have emerged in some localities with regard to  trading in property rights of state-owned enterprises, the State  Council General Office recently issued a circular on  strengthening the management of property rights trading of  state-owned enterprises.    The circular stresses: Property rights trading activities  organized by provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal  governments must be submitted to the State Council for  examination and approval. Trading activities must cease  immediately, and formalities for examination and approval must  be carried out if such formalities have not been carried out.  City governments below the prefectural level are not permitted  to organize property rights trading activities of state-owned  enterprises.    Property rights of state-owned enterprises belong to the  state. The transfer of property rights of locally managed  state-owned enterprises is subject to the examination and  approval of people's governments of cities above the prefectural  level. The transfer of property rights of state-owned  enterprises managed by central authorities is subject to the  examination and approval of relevant State Council departments.  The transfer of property rights of all exceptionally large, and  large state-owned enterprises (including those locally managed),  should be submitted to the State Council for examination and  approval.    The circular points out: Before transferring their property  rights, state-owned enterprises must, in accordance with the  stipulations of the "Procedures for Managing the Appraisal of  State Property," earnestly evaluate their assets, including  land-use rights, and complete formalities concerning changes in  property rights and the cancellation of registration in  accordance with relevant state stipulations. Proceeds from the  transfer of property rights of state-owned enterprises must be  used, first of all, to repay bank debts and make proper  arrangements for employees' maintenance. The balance of  proceeds can then be specially used by local governments to  support structural readjustment or to supplement the capital of  other state-owned enterprises that are in need. However, the  proceeds must not be used for regular expenditures or to offset  budgetary deficits or to pay wages and bonuses. Departments  managing state-owned property must strengthen their supervision  over the use of proceeds from the transfer of property rights by  state-owned enterprises. Splitting shares of or selling  property rights of state-owned enterprises at low prices, as  well as distributing such rights free of charge to individuals,  are strictly banned. The transfer of property rights or shares  of state-owned enterprises on credit is prohibited. Enterprises  must undertake corrective measures if they have already done  these things. When transferring property rights of state-owned  enterprises, it is necessary to take specific measures to  properly provide jobs and social security for workers, while  doing a good job of handling ideological work among workers  (including retired workers) to maintain social stability.    The circular asks that activities of the property rights  market and trading organizations be temporarily halted, and that  relevant State Council departments promptly formulate new  procedures for governing property rights trading of state-owned  enterprises so as to establish the standardized and legalized  management of property rights trading of state-owned enterprises  and its proceeds. Provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal  governments and relevant State Council departments must  earnestly implement the stipulations of this circular as well as  realistically strengthen their supervision and management over  the state property of enterprises. Concerned parties and  principal administrative leaders shall be investigated for their  responsibility for violating state stipulations and causing the  loss of state property.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (1): Global trade on the brink - David Dodwell argues that failure of the Gatt talks to reach agreement could damage exporters' order books as early as 1994 and leave a 'Fortress Europe' on the sidelines of international trade / Comment THE Uruguay Round of world trade talks, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), may seem far removed from the daily concerns of small and medium-sized exporters across the UK and the continent of Europe. But this will not be the case over the coming two months, as make-or-break negotiations ahead of a December 15 deadline seek to cut tariff barriers, and boost world trade. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of these talks, focused on the Gatt headquarters on the edge of Lake Geneva. Failure of the negotiations could lead to a rapid escalation of trade conflict, with higher tariffs, a blizzard of anti-dumping actions, and countervailing duties against subsidised exports. The risk of failure is high, in part because time is running short, and in part because recession and high levels of unemployment have made governments baulk over the last, difficult compromises. Unhappily for European companies, there is also a considerable risk that Europe - and in particular France - would be blamed for the failure of the talks, because of a refusal to stand by an agreement made a year ago to cut back on Europe's exports of subsidised farm products. Some in Europe may argue that the cost of failure would be small. After all, European companies on average sell two thirds of their exports to other European Community countries. Planned growth of the EC would embrace the Efta countries of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Austria and Switzerland and establish special relationships with the liberalising economies of eastern and central Europe, leading to a wider European market of around 400m people. As such, some will argue that EC companies will be able to turn further inward without paying any particularly high price for the loss of export opportunities outside Europe. But others would argue that such a retreat behind the walls of 'Fortress Europe' would be catastrophic. First to suffer would be transnational companies which spread production across the globe: obstacles to the free flow of components from one subsidiary to another could force them to relocate outside Europe, or trim operations to serve Europe alone. This danger cannot be overestimated, since intra-company trade accounts for over 40 per cent of all trade. Europe's companies account for 52 per cent of the world's stock of international direct investment - totalling Dollars 956bn at the end of 1991 - with almost half of this invested outside Europe. With such deep roots in the world economy, thoughts of retreat behind Europe's fortress walls are nothing short of naive. This is starkest of all for Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands - Europe's leading foreign investors - although it is possible that the negligible reliance of France or Italy on inward investment from countries outside Europe could distort public perceptions there. Behind the multinationals, small and medium-sized companies would quickly suffer in their wake, since many have developed in order to supply them with components and other products and services. Declining competitiveness would almost certainly follow, as companies inside Europe were protected from the international competition that ensures the highest possible levels of efficiency, and the exploitation of new technologies. European competitiveness is already a mounting problem, because of the high price paid across Europe for subsidies to the farm sector, and to loss-making state-run enterprises such as those in the steel sector. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which represents the world's leading industrial nations, says farm subsidies alone cost Dollars 354bn last year, with Europe's share by far the largest at Dollars 156bn. It is self-evident how heavy a burden this is on Europe's consumers and manufacturers - with the inevitable danger that export opportunities to the world's fastest-growing economies in Asia would be lost because Europe's products are uncompetitively expensive. There are without question immense opportunities in the Asia Pacific region, in spite of increasing self-reliance, and Japan's obvious geographic advantages. After a decade of economic growth averaging between 6 and 10 per cent, countries such as China, Taiwan, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are becoming significant consumer markets in their own right. Even though they have industrialised rapidly, and have comparative advantages linked to low labour costs that make it difficult for exporters to supply anything except high-technology goods, these countries have a virtually insatiable need for foreign investment and high-tech imports in the decade ahead. This has been well realised by the US which has just launched an export promotion programme targeted hard at Asia which aims to lift exports from Dollars 700bn last year to Dollars 1,000bn by the year 2000. Also notable, President Bill Clinton has given high priority to a summit in Seattle in mid-November of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation grouping. At the very least, this is intended to forge closer trade and investment links across the Pacific. At worst - if Uruguay Round negotiations are going badly, with blame being laid at Europe's door because of intransigence over liberalisation of farm trade - it could be used to discuss trade reforms excluding Europe, and possible trade sanctions against European companies in retaliation against the continued export of subsidised farm products. It is perhaps this danger that prompted John Major, the British prime minister, to write recently: 'Only our joint interest in success in the Geneva negotiations has kept Europe and America back from trade war. Breakdown in those talks would threaten a repeat of the protectionism and isolationism of the 1930s, when production fell by one fifth, and investment by half. 'Failure would lead to an immediate crisis within the EC in its relations with the US, countries of the Cairns group (of farm exporting countries), and the whole developing world.' For an average managing director in a small company in the EC, this may all seem heady and remote. But failure could mean damage to order books quite early in 1994. Success on the other hand is forecast to lead to net gains in world income of Dollars 213bn by the year 2002, when the full force of Uruguay Round reforms would be in place. Can there be any doubt over the choice? Guest Column: Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, page 31 World economic trends, page 4</p>

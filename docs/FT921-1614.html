			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (10): Trade and the poverty trap THE TRADE TRAP: POVERTY AND THE GLOBAL COMMODITY MARKETS by Belinda Coote Oxfam Pounds 5.95, 214 pages MANY POOR developing countries appear to be caught in a trap: during a decade in which some have become even poorer, the commodities which they export have fallen steadily in price. The trend appears irreversible. Trade barriers have made the transition to higher-value-added processing a fraught one. The problems are real. It is good that Oxfam, in its latest publication, should focus attention on them. However, it is astonishing that it should have come to the conclusion that managed trade through charitably-based 'alternative trading organisations' in the west, and 'development friendly consumerism' provides any serious solution to such problems. The most disappointing aspect of the book is that it may be the only one on trade and developing countries that many interested readers see in the UK this year: it is saddening that such a glib and simplistic assessment of Third World problems, hyped by Oxfam's powerful publicity machine, is likely to have such influence. The book's case studies, based on Oxfam's extensive field experience in the developing world, provide interesting and valuable material. But the sentimental analysis has roots in the sort of dogma that used to exude from the (now metamorphosing) Unctad during the 1970s: blame for the poor's problems must be laid at the door of multinationals which rape a country's resources unfettered by national control, exploiting the poor, and ruining their environment; a rich men's club controls the rules of world trade, and exploits them ruthlessly at the expense of the poor. Where is necessary attention paid to the importance of local wars and the diversion of precious funds to military spending, to local corruption, massively inefficient state planning systems, uncontrolled population growth? Where is an effort to explain why some countries in the developing world have escaped poverty while others have remained mired? It is almost cruel to suggest to farmers in the Third World that salvation might be found in 'alternative trading organisations' that provide the same distorted price and market signals that protectionism and state socialism have provided so damagingly in the past. It is just such muddled logic that has led to the cossetting of Europe's farmers through the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) that costs European taxpayers so dear, and so damages world prices for the commodities on which exporters from the Third World depend.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (9): A fish among sharks / Profile of AST Research SINCE it entered the PC martketplace six years ago, AST Research has quietly become a Dollars 1bn-plus company that is compared favourably with such first-tier high-flyers as Compaq and Dell Computer. Revenues from the most recent second fiscal quarter soared to Dollars 346.3m, up Dollars 60m from the previous quarter and Dollars 107m from a year earlier, while net income almost doubled to Dollars 14.6m from the previous quarter. Revenues have grown 60 per cent over the past 12 months. In that second quarter AST shipped 200,00 notebook, portable and desktop PCs and expects to ship 1m units in the next 12 months. But that only makes AST a fish that is eighth in the US and 11th worldwide in a roiling PC marketplace, swimming among much larger sharks such as IBM, Apple, Compaq and Dell. It must navigate carefully to survive in a marketplace ruled by severe price competition, continuing shake-out of PC vendors and unrelenting technological innovation. Furthermore, all competitors have access to the same commodity components and software. Reflecting on market conditions, analysts with investment house Merrill Lynch Global Securities Research estimates that, although AST's revenues will continue to rise, gross margins continue to slide. Consequently, they lower the earnings per share estimate to Dollars 1.85 from Dollars 2.00 for the third quarter. However, the New York-based firm acknowledges that AST has 'significant' orders, is controlling costs and can expect greater revenues from new products such as notebook PCs. More bullish analysts at Alex Brown &amp; Sons in Baltimore, Maryland, declare that 'we know of no better, low-cost, design and volume PC manufacturer than AST'. They point to the company's ability to quickly sniff out 'sweet spots' in high-growth channels to jump into first, such as selling through large consumer electronic and appliance chains. They put AST in the 'PC elite' along with Compaq, Dell, IBM and Apple. To continue to grow, AST president and co-founder Safi U. Qureshey says that the company does not face external market challenges but internal ones. 'The challenge is how to build an organisation that thrives on change,' he says. AST in Irvine, California, for example, must find ways to continually improve production and execution, he says. Mr Qureshey points out that AST has a young workforce that might become overawed competing against the likes of IBM and Compaq. 'AST has to find its own solutions' and 'build an organisation that doesn't get scared,' he says. 'We must constantly re-engineer the organisation,' Mr Qureshey says. 'If we continue to do what we did a year ago, we will fail,' he says. AST employees must not be afraid to experiment, he adds. To prepare for growth, Mr Qureshey says that a strong management team has been brought in. The new head of engineering is a 15-year veteran from IBM's PC operation in Boca Raton, Florida. Worldwide service (an AST strong suit) is run by a 25-year Digital Equipment veteran and worldwide manufacturing by a manger with 10 years' experience at Motorola and 15 years at Texas Instruments. (The former engineering head now hunts for new business and technology opportunities.) But how does bringing in industry veterans from large organisations that might be perceived as slow-moving equate with a young company trying to thrive on change? Acknowledging that this was a concern, Mr Qureshey says that they were chosen carefully and attracted to AST in the first place. The ex-IBMer, for example, was responsible for several successful products there. AST's goal is to grow faster than the marketplace, Mr Qureshey declares. More moderate price declines in the coming months will help, he predicts. The big players were out of line with their prices and made a correction. Declines now are not likely to be as steep as the last six months of 1992, he maintains. According to Mr Qureshey, AST's success is based on being totally focused on the PC business, based in the biggest marketplace, able to pick and choose from the best technology, and staying close to customers to respond to their needs. That may sound like motherhood and apple pie, but Mr Qureshey says it is also based on the 'challenge' of having his 250-person engineering department wring out the best performance from commodity components and software. Mr Qureshey claims that when AST entered the PC market six years ago with a 286-based machine, it set new standards for price and performance and started the company's growth. Two years ago AST went after the notebook market against the likes of Compaq, NEC, Toshiba and Zenith and is now a solid number three in the notebook business. Alex Brown analysts call AST's PowerExec notebooks introduced last September 'unparalleled in the industry'. The notebooks have pop-out modules that enable users to upgrade their display screens, microprocessors and hard disk drives without having to buy a whole new system. The Dollars 995 to Dollars 3,395 Bravo line of desktops for small and medium-sized businesses feature graphics and modem capabilities that 'set (them) apart from similarly-priced competitive offerings', the analysts report. The initial Bravo line was brought out four years ago to offer business-oriented features when people were buying consumer-oriented PCs from Leading Edge and Samsung, Mr Qureshey says. A year ago it introduced the Advantage] line for consumer electronic chain stores, now in more than 900 US locations. 'We created a whole new strategy,' he declares, one that saw revenues for that segment grow to Dollars 50m in the second quarter from Dollars 30m in the first. Being vertically integrated also enables AST to design and manufacture PCs for other PC vendors. It reportedly builds PCs for Digital Equipment and may also do contract manufacturing for either IBM or Unisys, according to Alex Brown analysts. Mr Qureshey will not comment on specifics but says that because AST competes head to head with the best PC vendors in the marketplace, large system houses confidently come to the company for design and manufacturing. This represents the third phase of contract manufacturing. First, large system companies dabbled with the PC manufacturing and then turned to Far East manufacturers, who proved unsatisfactory. Alex Brown analysts say that OEM sales is an increasing percentage of North American sales, rising from 10 per cent to the teens, depending on the quarter. AST also grows by staying out of some markets, Mr Qureshey explains. For example, one is the Risc marketplace (Risc is speedy microprocessor technology that competes with standard PC microchips). 'People looked at Sun (Microsystems) and got seduced,' he says. 'Sun did a good marketing job but it sells a whole workstation whereas Risc clones couldn't and now are out of business.' Others include pen-based PCs and multimedia machines, which Mr Qureshey says have no primary applications driving them today. They will be niche markets for the next 12 months, he says. Nevertheless, AST will introduce a pen- based system in a few months as part of a measured product strategy in both areas. AST, now 12 years old, began as a maker of add-in boards that enabled users to add features to IBM PCs. It took its name from the first letters of its co-founders' first names. 'I think that there will be 10 or 12 PC manufacturers left in the world and AST will be one of them,' Mr Qureshey declares.</p>

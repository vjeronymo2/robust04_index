			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS PULSE: A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> DRUG TESTING;  </P> <P> MORE COMPANIES INSTITUTING DRUG-TESTING PROGRAMS  </P> <P> By his experience as a clerk in Municipal Court in Fullerton, Scott Matthew has  become convinced that employers should test their work force for illegal drug  use.  </P> <P> "I think that if the drug problem were eliminated, that would clear about 75%  of the cases off the dockets," said the Yorba Linda resident, who has watched  many trials prompted by illegal drug use in his 13 years as a court clerk.  </P> <P> Five years ago, Matthew said he probably wouldn't have championed compulsory  drug testing. But now, he said, "I have come to the realization that it would  probably help the people with the problem."  </P> <P> Matthews shares the view of the majority of local workers who appear eager to  stamp out drugs, starting in the workplace. According to The Times Orange  County Poll, 76% of those surveyed support drug and alcohol testing by  employers. And 22% perceived drug and alcohol abuse as "somewhat" of a problem  in their workplace.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, Orange County companies, like others throughout Southern  California, are increasingly instituting drug-testing programs, especially for  job applicants.  </P> <P> According to surveys by the Merchants and Manufacturers Assn. of Southern  California, the proportion of firms in the region that do pre-employment drug  testing more than doubled, from 20% in 1987 to 48%, last year. In the same  two-year period, the percentage of firms that administer drug tests to current  employees has burgeoned from 20% to 41%.  </P> <P> "I think we are becoming less and less tolerant of drugged out people in the  workplace," said Larry Bell, manager of the Santa Ana branch of the Merchants  and Manufacturers Assn.  </P> <P> Employers are motivated by a desire to protect productivity, which can be  undermined by absenteeism and poor job performance associated with drug and  alcohol dependency. They also are concerned about curbing the runaway costs of  workers compensation and medical insurance.  </P> <P> Employers share with employees an interest in enhancing on-the-job safety by  reducing the risk of accidents caused by workers under the influence of drugs  or alcohol.  </P> <P> While there may be good reasons for substance abuse testing, there are  important legal issues revolving around an individual's right to privacy.  </P> <P> Casey Hawes, a labor attorney in the Costa Mesa office of Latham &amp; Watkins,  said that California is more stringent than other states in scrutinizing the  drug-testing practices of employers because "the right to privacy is written  into the California Constitution."  </P> <P> He said that many California employers have been advised they could legally  require job applicants to be tested for drugs, usually through urine samples,  as part of their pre-employment physical examinations. That position was  confirmed in March by the state Supreme Court, which let stand a state Court of  Appeal decision that mandatory urinalysis to detect drug use among job-seekers  represented only a limited intrusion on the right to privacy and did not  violate the state Constitution.  </P> <P> But in another decision, the same Court of Appeal in San Francisco in February  upheld a $485,042 damage award to a railroad employee who was fired for  refusing to submit to a drug test. This decision has strengthened the belief of  many employers and employees that random drug testing of workers probably is  illegal, especially if the person is not in a safety-sensitive job.  </P> <P> Companies that test employees usually do so only "for cause," such as a bad  accident in which drug use is suspected to be a contributing factor or as part  of a scheduled recertification examination for bus drivers and others  responsible for the safety of others.  </P> <P> Ramona Ripston, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of  Southern California, said the civil rights group believes pre-employment  screening and random testing of employees is unconstitutional. She said an  employee should be subjected to a drug test only if his job performance becomes  erratic and drugs seem to be the problem.  </P> <P> Some unions agree and want a say in how drug tests are administered. Mary Yunt,  secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO Orange County Central Labor Council, said  unions want to help spell out the nature and criteria for workplace drug  testing in their contracts.  </P> <P> Bill Perry, secretary-treasurer of the Orange County District Council of  Carpenters, said there is considerable resistance to drug testing within that  organization. Much of the increased testing activity is traced to the passage  last year of the Drug Free Workplace Act, which requires firms with two or more  employees and doing more than $25,000 in business with the federal government  to have substance abuse programs.  </P> <P> While this legislation did not require firms to test employees for drugs, many  employers took it as a signal to start. Subsequently the U.S. Department of  Transportation set specific testing requirements for mass transit workers and  interstate truckers.  </P> <P> Philip Edelman, chief of the toxicology service at UCI Medical Center in  Orange, said the hospital's toxicology laboratory does drug testing of  employees for "everything from fire and police deparments to construction  companies and high-tech industries."  </P> <P> Edelman said that usually when a company begins pre-employment testing, between  10% and 25% of the applicants test positive for drugs and are turned away.  </P> <P> "Once you initiate the program, it is amazing how fast word gets out on the  street that you are doing it and the percentage drops to about 2%," he said.  </P> <P> Results of the Merchants and Manufacturers survey conducted in late 1989 showed  that for the companies that do pre-employment testing, the substances detected  most often are, in order of frequency, marijuana, amphetamines, cocaine and  alcohol.  </P> <P> Of the 733 employers who participated in the Merchants and Manufacturers  survey, 97% said that they would not consider hiring a job applicant who  refused to take a pre-employment drug and alcohol test.  </P> <P> Some managers would like to extend the testing to current employees. Ron  Wilson, 27, of Fullerton, said he would welcome such drug testing at the  discount retail outlet for Albertson's in South Gate, where he works as  assistant manager. He frequently has to cope with employee absenteeism caused  by drugs and alcohol.  </P> <P> "About every two weeks you lose a shift or two because someone can't make it to  work," Wilson said.  </P> <P> DRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE  </P> <P> TESTING AND ABUSE  </P> <P> "Do you approve or disapprove of employers testing their employees for drug and  alcohol abuse?"  </P> <P> Disapprove: 18%  </P> <P> Don't Know: 6%  </P> <P> Approve: 78%  </P> <P> "How much of a problem is employee drug and alcohol abuse at your workplace?"  </P> <P> Somewhat of a Problem: 19%  </P> <P> A Big Problem: 3%  </P> <P> No Problem: 78%  </P> <P> Source: The Times Orange County Poll  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMPANIES CONFRONT DRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE  </P> <P> A survey of more than 700 Southern California companies indicates a sharp  increase the adoption of drug policies and requiring drug tests in the past two  years.  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="4.09IN:1.56IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Drug policy  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 34%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 63%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pre-employment drug testing  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 21%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 48%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Employee drug testing  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 21%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 41%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Merchants and Manufacturers Association  </P></p>

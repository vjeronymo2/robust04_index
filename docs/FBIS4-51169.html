			<p>BFN     [Text] Led by Comrade Song Jian, state councillor and  chairman of the State Council Environmental Protection  Committee, a Huaihe-bound inspection team organized by the  National People's Congress [NPC] Environment and Resources  Committee and the State Council Environmental Protection  Committee arrived in Henan yesterday morning. The inspection  team will inspect Henan's environmental protection law  enforcement work.    Yesterday morning, provincial and Zhengzhou City leaders,  including Li Changchun, Fan Qinchen, Zhong Lisheng, Zhang  Honghua, and others, briefed the inspection team on Henan's  environmental protection work, discussed with the team problems  pertaining to the work, and expressed the hope that the state  will provide more assistance to Henan in environmental  protection.    After listening to reports made by the Henan leaders, State  Councillor Song Jian pointed out: Pollution in the Huaihe  valley has already reached an alarming level. If we fail to  take effective measures to solve this problem, some tributaries  of the Huaihe will soon turn into drainage canals. Having  basically solved the problem of food and clothing for the vast  majority of the people living along the Huaihe, we should now  start making every possible effort to help and guide the masses  in the area to free themselves from a dirty environment.  Economic development should never harm the environment; rather,  it should protect the environment. We should work harder,  redouble our efforts, strive to raise the region's social,  economic, and environmental efficiencies, gradually formulate  and enact stricter environmental protection laws, and ensure  that all environmental protection laws are implemented to the  letter so as to raise the work of harnessing the Huaihe to a new  level.    Provincial party committee Secretary Li Changchun said: As  Henan is the source of the Huaihe, the Henan comrades should  adopt a highly responsible attitude toward the people and make  energetic efforts to further the work of harnessing the Huaihe.    Comrade Yang Zhenhuai, vice chairman of the NPC Environment  and Resources Committee, along with comrades in charge of more  than 10 state ministries and commissions, also listened to the  reports made by the Henan leaders.    Yesterday afternoon, accompanied by Li Changchun, Zhang  Deguang, Zhang Honghua, and other provincial and Zhengzhou City  leaders, Song Jian and his entourage inspected a project built  for the purpose of harnessing the Qingshuihe [Qingshui Lake] and  visited Baixian Joint-stock Company Ltd. and Zhongyuan  Pharmaceutical Factory.    At the factory, Comrade Song Jian wrote: "Protect the  Environment To Benefit This and Coming Generations!"</p>

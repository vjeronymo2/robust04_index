			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Arts: Elves of Denmark - London Promenade Concerts THE elves of Denmark were malicious little creatures, not nice at all. Just when the people who lived around their territory thought things were progressing for the good of the community, the Danish elves would rouse from their other-worldly slumbers and throw a spanner in the works out of gleeful spite. All fiction, of course, handed down to us in folk-tales. Stories about elves were popular in Northern countries in the nineteenth century and the Danish composer Niels Gade was particularly taken by them. At the Promenade concert on Friday a visiting Danish choir and orchestra brought a rare performance of his cantata Elverskud ('The Elf-King's Daughter') with a text in which Hans Christian Andersen had a hand. A noble lord is lured to Elfin Hill on his wedding day by a elf-maiden of the night, whose seductive wiles bring him to a grisly end. The tale, with its barely-suppressed theme of the dangers of sexual attraction, is potentially a gripping one. If only the music was half as interesting. Unfortunately Gade was content to spend his time picturing at leisure star-lit nights on the Elfin Hill and barely gets to grips with the nub of the story at all (Schubert said far more in five minutes in his song 'Erlkonig'). The music is all watered-down Mendelssohn. Occasionally some of the descriptive passages catch the magical atmosphere, but the rest is far too monotonous, substituting a generalised naive and homely mood for the thrill of narrative tension that the story demands. The fine solo trio of Inga Nielsen, Anne Gjevang and Poul Elming introduced a couple of Wagnerian voices to this very sub-Wagnerian piece, accompanied by the Danish National Radio Choir and Symphony Orchestra under Dmitri Kitaenko. The chorus and orchestra, which had made a good impression in the Gade, returned later for a lacklustre performance of Prokofiev's Alexander Nevsky. In between, however, Aage Haugland was the awesomely gloomy bass soloist in an extraordinary arrangement of Musorgsky's Songs and Dances of Death by Edison Denisov, in which Denisov enjoys himself hugely adding vibraphones and ghostly chromatic celesta descants to the music. Nothing like Musorgsky at all, but novel and entertaining. The next night brought another choral concert, in which the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus might have made more impact if they had been galvanised into action by a conductor with some energy and a tough line on ragged ensemble. Instead, Gennady Rozhdestvensky led them in a sleepy account of Brahms's Schicksalslied ('Song of Destiny') and a slack one of Verdi's Quattro pezzi sacri. Strong music like the Verdi needs strong direction. A corresponding lack of energy and freshness marred Schumann's Piano Concerto. The soloist was Victoria Postnikova, who alternated a few passages of Prokofiev-like metallic virtuosity with long stretches in which all momentum was lost, as she laboured to find the poetry that should be at the heart of the concerto. If not for the glory of Verdi resounding through the Royal Albert Hall, this would have been a dispiriting evening. ***** THURSDAY'S BBC Philharmonic concert at the Proms was conducted by the orchestra's recently-appointed Composer Associate, Peter Maxwell Davies. It included, as well as works by Mozart, Tchaikovsky and Beethoven, a big Maxwell Davies revival - Black Pentecost (1979), the long, bleak-spirited song-symphony for mezzo (Della Jones) and baritone (David Wilson-Johnson) and large orchestra on texts by the Orkney poet George Mackay Brown. The theme is the destruction for commercial purposes of an Orkney island. This adds Black Pentecost to the honourable short list of twentieth century 'protest symphonies' (Shostakovich being, of course, Maxwell Davies's most significant predecessor on that list). It starts, Shostakovich-like, with a slow, dark, barely-scored rumination, shaped according to this composer's 'medieval-modern' structural designs, that gradually accrues bitter tints of Mahlerian anguish. The beauties of the island (touched in by achingly delicate applications of percussion glitter) are characterised as spacious and timeless; the violence and mindlessness of its destroyers are depicted in terms of 'mechanical' madness. The voice parts, grave in tone, work predominantly in narrative mode (though the baritone has a brief passage of this composer's dottiest Expressionist vocal writing). I don't feel Black Pentecost quite adds up, holds together; its form seems somehow distended, loose. But the impact of all its parts proves loweringly fierce.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Television takes on a wider role Television pictures as big as a sitting room wall have come nearer reality with the development of Home Theatre by MGM, writes Richard Rosen. The system looks like the wide-screen TVs used in hotels, but is designed for the home. The pixels are magnified to lessen the gaps between them and thus eliminate the picture fuzziness of present systems. An absolute colour is given to each pixel rather than the conventional system in which an image is made up by the eye blending red, green and blue dots. On sale from June, it will cost less than Dollars 1,000. AEEC (MGM licensee): US, 510 416 1259</p>

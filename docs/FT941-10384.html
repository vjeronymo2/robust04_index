			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / US telecoms group plans network for City of London MFS Communications, the largest national provider of telecommunications networks competing with the local Bell companies in the US, is to launch a network in the City of London. With turnover of Dollars 108.7m in 1992 and operations in 14 American cities, MFS will be a powerful competitor to BT and Mercury. It has a record of making swift inroads against former monopoly telephone companies through aggressive pricing and marketing. MFS's City of London network, which will be operational from April, will be its first outside the US. It is planning extensions to other UK cities, and expects to provide access to Paris and Frankfurt later this year. It will interconnect its London network with the long-distance networks of BT, Mercury and Energis, offering an end-to-end service at competitive tariffs. MFS has built its business by competing with former local monopoly carriers, offering access to long-distance networks. Since the break up of the US Bell telephone company in 1984, local and long-distance networks have been operated separately, with competition far more intense in the long distance market. The price of UK business phone calls is to fall on March 9, with the abolition of the peak-rate calling band by BT and Mercury, cutting between 20 and 25 per cent from the cost of weekday calls made between 9am and 1pm. BT's price cuts fulfil most of its obligation to reduce prices before July by 7.5 per cent after allowing for inflation, under a price cap agreement with Oftel, the telecommunications regulator. Residential customers, who will gain little from the abolition of the peak rate, were the main beneficiaries of a new weekend rate cutting long-distance call prices before Christmas. Mercury has matched BT's price cuts, and claims still to be cheaper for most long distance calls. The abolition of the peak rate will leave three charging bands: a standard daytime rate applicable from 8am to 6pm on weekdays; a cheap rate for calls between 6pm and 8am on weekdays; and a weekend rate. Mr Terry Rhodes, Mercury's director of competition policy, said Mercury had 'long been planning' to abolish its equivalent of peak rate but had been prevented from doing so 'by the existing interconnect payments that we make to BT'. Mercury does not have a local network, and competes with BT for long distance and international traffic. BT is already under pressure in its local market from cable companies mostly US owned, building combined cable TV and telephone networks. Observer, Page 15</p>

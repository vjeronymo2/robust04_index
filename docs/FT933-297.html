			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (8): Still a force to be reckoned with - Military power is now probably subordinate to civilian power THE appearance of tanks in April in the streets of Lima underlined the fact that the military remain a force to be reckoned with in Peru. The tanks' deployment, according to military experts, appeared to be a clumsy - although apparently successful - attempt by General Nicolas Hermoza Rios, the head of the armed forces, to deter Congressional investigations into the disappearance and probable murder of nine students and a professor at the Cantuta teaching institute in Lima in 1992. The Cantuta affair has become a cause celebre for those who want to end the continuing immunity of the military from prosecution for human rights abuses. But it is more than that: it is a stick with which the opposition can beat the government. It has also become a lightning rod for apparent divisions within the armed forces, which some military experts say have deepened under the government of President Alberto Fujimori. The students disappeared from Cantuta, a well-known nest of sympathisers for the Maoist terrorist organisation Sendero - Shining Path - in July last year, amid an outbreak of bombings in Lima. Documents published this year by magazines in Lima, and allegations made by General Rodolfo Robles, the former number three in the military hierarchy, implicated Gen Hermoza and the president's adviser of intelligence matters, Mr Vladimir Montesinos, in this and other human rights violations. Gen Robles took refuge in the US embassy and is now in Argentina. These developments followed an attempted coup - or at least a coup conspiracy - by a group of officers, of which Gen Jaime Salinas was the figurehead leader, against the high command in November last year. The coup plotters were planning to justify their action by citing their right to protect the constitution, usurped in April 1992 by President Alberto Fujimori with the support of many in the high command. Retired General Gaston Ibanez O'Brien says he saw the actions of generals Robles and Salinas as reflecting their frustration 'at being passed over for promotion'. Mr Enrique Obando of the Peruvian Centre of International Studies says that under the pre-Fujimori regime - where the head of the armed forces were changed annually - both generals could have expected to be commander-in-chief. 'During the government of (President Alan) Garcia, the armed forces appointed their own high command . . . with Fujimori, under a new law, the president chooses all the high-ranking generals and admirals. The head of the armed forces can also now remain in office for an entire presidential term,' says Mr Obando. 'As a result, the choice of the high command has become politicised.' This creates a high command, he suggests, that is loyal not to the constitution but to the president. He describes it as a system of 'co-optation' which has intensified under the current presidency. During the Garcia period, says Mr Obando, 'the civil government chose the most corrupt elements in the armed forces for important positions, knowing that the threat of making public their illegal acts would allow them to be easily controlled.' In the Fujimori era, Mr Obando says there has been a struggle - 'very costly and traumatic' - within the military between the institutionally-minded and the co-opted senior officers, in which the latter group appears to have been almost completely victorious. Resentment among some officers may also have been increased by the power wielded by Mr Montesinos, who is Mr Fujimori's senior adviser on military and intelligence matters. (Mr Montesinos, a former lawyer to Mr Fujimori, was cashiered from the army while a captain, for copying and passing on information to the US Central Intelligence Agency.) The choice of high command by the civilian president underlines a paradoxical aspect of the Fujimori government: although it is often described as authoritarian, the power of the armed forces at the centre is probably now more subordinate to the civilian power than at any time since the military government stepped down in 1980 after 12 years in power. On the other hand, the power of the armed forces in the regions - given a freer hand by Mr Fujimori - has increased. Mr Obando says that like all systems of co-optation this one is dependent on success for its perpetuation and is therefore inherently unstable. Nonetheless he believes that the likelihood of further coups against the Fujimori government is much reduced by the advances in intelligence gathering. This, says Mr Fujimori, helped to bring about the successes against Shining Path. Those with knowledge of military issues, however, say that much intelligence activity has been directed at the armed forces themselves. 'Vigilance against those who are against Fujimori is high,' says Mr Obando. Suspicion is such that those visiting Gen Hermoza's office have to give up their arms before they go in, he adds. 'There are few chances to meet outside the barracks and nobody now in the armed forces speaks about political issues - in contrast to the time of Alan Garcia.'</p>

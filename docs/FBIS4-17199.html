			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by special correspondents Nikolay Krivomazov and </F> Yevgeniy Fadeyev under the "`New World Order' in Action" rubric:  "Closing Your Eyes To Avoid Seeing the Truth: Why the Serbs  Love the Russians and Why the Russian Foreign Ministry Does Not  Requite"]    [Text] It is night. In the Balkans. Midnight and  another, the 100th, check point along the "lifeline" from  Belgrade to Knin, capital of Serbian Krajina, or to Pale,  capital of the [Bosnian] Serb Republic. There are guys two  meters tall standing there in camouflage gear, their eyes tired  and their faces no longer wearing a smile. It is passport  control.    But there are Serbian anti-vehicle obstacles. The weather is  damp. A Serbian fighter holds out his hand for the passport.  Light begins to penetrate the night. "Hello, brother!" say the  border guards, old people, and even children.    We have been together, we Russians and Serbs, throughout  time. You will remember "Anna Karenina." Where does Vronskiy go  at the end of Tolstoy's novel? We have a common history, common  memories, and even common enemies. That is the way it was.  That is the way it is.... But how will it be in future?    Here is an excerpt from a recent interview in the Russian  press by Mr. Kozyrev:    "Frankly, I am amazed how we suddenly fell in love with  Yugoslavia and the Serbs, whom for over 40 years the communist  regime simply could not abide. I can remember from my childhood  a caricature of Tito wielding a blood-stained fascist ax. I did  not for some reason think about the historical roots at the  time. If we pursue a one-sided policy toward Yugoslavia, we  take, for example, the side of Orthodoxy, what, in your opinion,  will be the reaction of Russia? The reaction of those who are  themselves Muslims or who are drawn toward Islam?..."    We arrive! The foreign minister of a still great Russia is  absolutely ignorant of History with a capital "H," which for  some begins with Tito but for others begins much earlier.    That first-rate diplomat Baron Dibich, who was sent to  Serbia  in the seventies of the last century on the orders of the tsar,  wrote:    "The uprising of the Serbs and their struggle for  independence is a fact of great significance to Russia. The  well-being of these two peoples is interlinked. Russia's  misfortune means Serbia's ruin, while Serbia's ruin is Russia's  misfortune. Russia will never be able to count on another  people if it leaves Serbia in the lurch."    However, Kozyrev, on visiting Belgrade for the first time,  delivered speeches on indestructible historical links, but, on  returning home, signed up to "the new political realities."    We supported the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia without  the participation of the Serbs. While declaring our love for  them, the Serbs, Churkin was in Washington among the leaders of  Croatia and Bosnia. There is no need to spell out how this was  interpreted by the Serbs.    Russia, having advocated sanctions against Yugoslavia, does  nothing to get them lifted. If anyone lifts these sanctions it  will be the United States. And then Russia will have nothing to  do in the Balkans for 50 years or so.    We Russians or, more precisely, the Russian Foreign  Ministry,  are either unaware of what is actually happening here in the  Balkans or are deliberately screwing up our eyes to avoid seeing  the truth and taking the situation in hand. Judge for  yourselves. First, Churkin states that the Russian contingent  of Blue Berets will never enter Sarajevo. A few days later and  our guys are there.    It is alleged that Washington did not notify Russia in  advance of the bombing of Gorazde. Untrue. Our Foreign  Ministry did know. At least Warren Christopher says so.    Back to Kozyrev: A few days after his amiable conversation  in Moscow with Karadzic he reminds his counterpart from  Sarajevo, Silajdic, that Russia is not only a Slavic country but  one of the largest Muslim countries in the world. Such words  were not expressed to Karadzic.    All the propaganda clamor about Russian diplomacy's  successes  is designed for naive souls. The game has long been played on  another field. The Serbs, by the way, are not so naive. They  are simply tactful, and the proverb "Christ is in Heaven but  Russia is on Earth" remains in their blood.    It is no wonder that Karadzic should state after his visit  to  Moscow that "Russia is not, as is mistakenly thought in the  world, such a defender of us as America is of the Muslims."    There is no provocative subtext here, merely bitter words.  And headlines such as "Whose Side Is Russia On?" and "Is Russia  Trading Serbian Land?" are now appearing in Belgrade newspapers.    As for Kozyrev's latest visit to Belgrade, there were the  standard calls by him to Warren Christopher both before and  after. And after his return Churkin's scandalous statement that  it is time for Russia to...cease all discussion with the Bosnian  Serbs.    Many people think that Russian diplomacy is doing quite a  lot  in the Balkans. At any rate, it is clear even to the  uninitiated that it is "busy." But this "business" increasingly  reminds one of the agitation of someone running ahead of a  political steamroller, darting first to the left and then to the  left to avoid being crushed.    In actual fact we have, to put it mildly, no diplomacy at  all  in the Balkans today. It is like a piece of plasticine from  which you can fashion whatever you like. Everyone fashions  whatever they like out of it. Everyone save us, save Russia.    The Serbs love us out of habit, through inertia. But for  what do they still love us today?</p>

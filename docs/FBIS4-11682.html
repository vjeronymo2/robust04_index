			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati arrived in  Burkina Faso yesterday as part of his trip to six African  countries and held talks with the local officials. Even though  the visit to Burkina Faso by Velayati and the high-ranking  political delegation accompanying him is the second phase of our  foreign minister's tour that began on Tuesday, the delegation  actually stopped in two countries before arriving in Burkina  Faso. In addition to meeting and talking with officials of  Guinea, the delegation stopped briefly at the airport in the  Chadian capital, Ndjamena, on its way to Burkina Faso and talked  with the Chadian foreign minister.    During the meeting between the Iranian and Chadian foreign  ministers, Chad requested that the Islamic Republic of Iran  assist in exploiting its oil resources as part of cooperation  among countries of the South. This request is vitally important  to Chad, especially after the discovery of an important oilfield  in southern Chad.    In Guinea the Iranian delegation held detailed talks on  economic, political, and cultural cooperation between Tehran and  Conakry, including discussions on cooperation in the  exploitation of bauxite mines, energy, the construction of  hydro-electrical dams, and the construction of railways.    In Burkina Faso our foreign minister and his delegation met  with the prime minister and discussed political and economic  relations between the two countries. During this meeting, the  initial basis for the expansion and consolidation of economic  and commercial cooperation was laid, and with the formation of a  joint commission in this field, a new era began in the economic  cooperation between Tehran and Ouagadougou. To acquaint the  government and nation of Burkina Faso with our country's high  economic potential, it was decided that a trade exhibition  including products and industries of Islamic Iran be set up in  Ouagadougou.    Iran's diplomatic activities in Africa are of interest to  political experts and analysts for various reasons. The first  is that this diplomatic initiative by the Islamic Republic of  Iran strengthens the position of Muslims in Africa, especially  in Black Africa. The second is that this activity is  significant to the expansion of South-South relations vis-a-vis  the array of forces by the North against the South. The third  is that meeting mutual needs in the economic, cultural, and  political fields and helping deprived countries, especially with  experts and know-how from the rich scientific and industrial  experiences that our country has among the Third World, is an  important objective in our country's diplomatic policy.    At any rate, Tehran's new look toward Africa has attracted  the attention of many political experts.</p>

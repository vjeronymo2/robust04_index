			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PROBLEMS OF THE LOS ANGELES FESTIVAL  </P> <P> If the Los Angeles Festival falls on its face, as a number of people now seem  to fear ("Is the L.A. Festival Getting the Word Out?," Aug. 4), I'm sure there  will be lots of hand-wringing about a failure to support non-Western cultural  performances. Let me disabuse everyone of seeing that beastly notion as an  excuse.  </P> <P> Both publicity and ticketing have been too little and too late. And a larger  problem is the catalogue, which is partly unreadable and partly unusable. The  designer decided it would be fun to lay dark type over dark backgrounds. (Good  luck on page 15, kids.)  </P> <P> I wanted to go. I tried to go. But at the end of an hour of eye- and  mind-frazzling investigation. . . .  </P> <P> MARY MILLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Bonds sign of Italy's confidence Sir, Barry Riley is puzzled by Italy issuing 30-year government paper ('Italy adds another dimension to debt', November 17). I agree that a country believing in low inflation should be wary of locking in high real interest rates for 30 years. But this did not stop the US government from issuing 30-year bonds at punitive rates in the early 1980s, when Paul Volcker (then chairman of the US Federal Reserve) was hell-bent on uprooting inflation. A country like Italy which, for better or worse, houses the third largest bond market in the world, must offer investors the possibility to play with all the notes of the maturity keyboard. As Barry Riley says, the 30-year bond is a diversion. But a useful one. Mr Riley's conclusion is pessimistic: Italy will be forced to restructure the debt, and 'there will be action long before 2023'. However, both the experience of Belgium (with a higher debt/gross domestic product ratio than Italy's) and the UK (where after the war the debt/GDP ratio stood at 300 per cent) show that default is not the only way out. Italy has already locked in low inflation through the most effective incomes policy in Europe. Policy makers can only wait for the markets to appreciate present virtue more than past vices. Finally, Barry Riley writes that Italy's primary budget deficit is worsening. This is incorrect, both as to level and rate of change. The primary budget has been in surplus since 1992. The OECD estimates that in 1993 Italy will have a surplus of 2 per cent of GDP in its primary balance, against a surplus of 0.4 per cent for Japan and a string of deficits for the the five other G7 countries. As to the rate of change, Italy is about the only country recording an improvement of its public finances in 1993. Maybe this is why the Italian government felt confident enough to dip its financial toes in the uncharted waters of the 30-year bond.

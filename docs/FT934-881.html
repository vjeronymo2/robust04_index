			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Wood gets flotation option: RBS joint venture could be sold if market value exceeds Pounds 200m Mr Peter Wood, chief executive of Direct Line, the motor and household insurer, will be allowed to float a new insurance joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland if it reaches a market value of Pounds 200m. Mr Wood will have the choice of full or partial flotation of the company, which will insure 'non-standard' risks such as young drivers. He will have the right to buy out Royal Bank's 60 per cent stake if it does not want a flotation. The deal follows speculation that Royal Bank might float Direct Line itself, which analysts have estimated could be worth more than Pounds 1bn. Speculation has eased since the recent strong rise in Royal Bank's share price. Details of the deal between Mr Wood, who was paid an Pounds 18m bonus by Royal Bank this year and an additional Pounds 24m to buy out his bonus arrangement, were disclosed in a letter to shareholders. They will be asked to approve the buy-out of Mr Wood's bonus scheme and the new joint venture at the annual meeting on January 14. Mr Wood is to invest Pounds 1m in the new venture, giving him a 40 per cent equity stake. The bank also revealed in its annual report and accounts that remuneration of directors had risen sharply as a result of the bank's increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 265.2m, against Pounds 12.6m for the year to September 1992. The remuneration of Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank's chief executive, has risen 55 per cent from Pounds 219,287 to Pounds 341,326, while that of Lord Younger, its chairman, has advanced 33 per cent to Pounds 167,814. Total performance-related bonuses of executive directors - excluding Mr Wood's - rose to Pounds 971,000 from Pounds 160,000, while pension contributions went up to Pounds 473,000 from Pounds 246,000, and other emoluments to Pounds 183,000 from Pounds 100,000. The bank's 22,000 UK staff will be paid a 5.1 per cent bonus from a profit-sharing scheme in January. Mr Wood will be non-executive chairman of the new insurance venture - in which Royal Bank is investing Pounds 1.5m in equity capital and Pounds 22.5m in preference shares - and will be allowed to spend up to a day a week working on it. The deal stipulates that if a merchant bank values the new company above Pounds 200m, Mr Wood may choose a full or partial flotation. If Royal Bank does not agree, he will have the right to buy out its preference and ordinary shares. It also says that if the new company requires additional capital which Royal Bank is not prepared to supply, then Mr Wood can provide the additional funds himself, or through a third party, and buy out the bank's equity stake.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Rail strike forecast to cause 'bedlam' RAIL WORKERS, miners and some London bus crews strike today in the biggest burst of co-ordinated public sector industrial action in recent years. The 24-hour rail strike will cause the greatest disruption, with the Automobile Association predicting 'traffic bedlam', particularly in the capital. London Underground workers are not expected to join in the action, although about 20 Tube stations, where tracks are shared with British Rail, could be closed. Mr Steven Norris, transport minister for London, warned drivers not to bring their cars into the capital unless they were sure of a parking space. The Confederation of British Industry said employers expected staff to 'make every effort to get into work if they can', using alternative means of transport - including car-sharing, cycling and walking. Many companies would be arranging coaches and allowing flexible starting and finishing times, said the CBI. The Institute of Management has suggested working from home. The strikes have been timed to coincide with a day of action by the European Trade Union Confederation. British union representatives will join EC unions in a march through Brussels. Mr Norman Willis, who is president of the ETUC as well as general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the protest was 'aimed at focusing public attention across Europe on the evils of mass unemployment, unacceptable working conditions and the growing threats from racism and xenophobia'. To comply with the law against secondary strike action, all the participants in today's stoppages are emphasising their individual grievances with their employers. The National Union of Mineworkers was the first group to go for a strike today and production at many pits ceased last night as about 30,000 walked out. The NUM believes that it can still stop privatisations and closures by mobilising public support. About 68,000 members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union are striking because BR is refusing to guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies. It is understood that BR management could take a much harder line over any future industrial action. About two thirds of red London buses are expected to be off the roads in a dispute about longer working hours and cuts in pay.

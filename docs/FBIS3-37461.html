Andrejevs cited the size of the military personnel at the  Skrunda radar, the size of the radar's rent and the social  status of retired servicemen in Latvia as the main obstacles  that block Latvia and Russia from withdrawal agreement.    Commenting on the controversial citizenship issue, Andrejevs  reminded Hurd that Latvia suffered from a heavy influx of  Russian-speaking immigrants during the 50-year Soviet occupation.    At the same time, Andrejevs said, Latvia takes into account  the reality of today and understands that "some compromises" are  needed to implement a slow and careful process of naturalization.    Latvia regards its enrollment to NATO's Partnership for  Peace  program as the first step toward full-fledged membership in the  Western alliance, Andrejevs said.    Hurd praised Latvia's efforts to return to Europe saying  that  "we see Latvia as part of the European family."    Hurd also spoke positively of Latvia's resolution to  compromise with Russia on the Skrunda radar installation.    The foreign secretary pledged his countries' support to  Latvia and other Baltic states in becoming active participants  of the Partnership program.</p>

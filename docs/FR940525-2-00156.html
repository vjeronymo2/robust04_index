(``DGOC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared substantially by DGOC. On February 16, 1994, and on March 4, 1994, DGOC submitted substantive amendments to the filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, DGOC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. DGOC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under current practice, the exercise settlement date, depending on certain factors, occurs from two to five business days following the expiration date or the date on which an exercise notice is tendered. Under the proposed amendments to section 1004 of DGOC's procedures, the exercise settlement date for an option contract on a Treasury bond or a Treasury note will be (1) the next business day following the date on which an exercise notice is purposely assigned for those contracts exercised on a day preceding the expiration date and (2) the next business day following the expiration date for those contracts exercised on the expiration date. For an option contract on a Treasury bill, the exercise settlement date will be the next business day after an exercise notice is properly tendered. The purpose of the proposal is to respond to participants who have requested that DGOC's settlement procedures more closely follow the practices already established in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') marketplace for the settlement of purchases and sales of Treasury securities and for the settlement of exercised options on such securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By shortening DGOC's settlement period to conform to the industry standard, DGOC will reduce the amount of time such settlement obligations remain outstanding which in turn will reduce credit exposure to DGOC as well as in the overall cash market clearing system for the settlement of Government securities. Using the same settlement period for the settlement of exercised options and for the settlement of securities in the cash market will ensure a consistent approach among clearing entities and will serve as a platform for additional coordination among clearing entities clearing identical or complimentary securities. In addition to reducing credit risk in the clearance system, a shortening of the settlement cycle will further reduce risk by enabling DGOC to uncover potential problems earlier and will allow DGOC to make expedited determinations of whether failures by participants to deliver securities are due to processing problems, market effect, or credit related difficulties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because DGOC's current settlement period of two to five business days is longer than the settlement period for similar OTC products cleared outside of DGOC, DGOC-issued options carry a price adjustment for the additional financing costs. As a result, the price of DGOC-issued options does not match exactly those of similar OTC-traded options. Implementation of DGOC's revised settlement procedures will make the relative values of DGOC-issued options comparable to those of OTC-traded options and will eliminate participants' need to make the additional calculations necessary to correlate the price of DGOC-issued options with the price of OTC-traded options. Therefore, this proposal should provide participants greater ease in trading and exercising options issued by DGOC and will allow for the automated clearance and settlement of securities transactions that otherwise would be cleared through decentralized and labor intensive processes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In connection with the modifications to the exercise settlement date, DGOC is proposing to amend section 1005 of its Procedures to provide that DGOC will allocate exercise settlement obligations prior to 8 a.m. on the business day prior to the exercise settlement date. Currently, DGOC allocates exercise settlement obligations on the second business day prior to the exercise settlement date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DGOC also is proposing to amend section 1102 of its procedures to clarify its buy-in process applicable when a participant fails to make a required delivery of Treasury securities to DGOC. First, upon the request of the participant failing to deliver and with good cause shown, DGOC will be authorized to defer the execution of a buy-in. Currently, DGOC can defer the execution of a buy-in for no more than twenty-four hours. Second, the time for the delivery of a notice of buy-in from DGOC to the participant which failed to deliver will be specifically set forth is thirty calendar days after the failure to deliver. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delta believes the proposed rule change is consistent with requirements of the Act, particularly section 17A of the Act, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to DGOC. This is because the proposed rule change will permit more utilization of the DGOC system by those participants who prefer to trade in options for hedging purposes or for speculation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

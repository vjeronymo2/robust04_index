			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Visitors passport may be scrapped The British visitors passport may disappear as a result of a review of its future being conducted by the government, Alan Pike writes. The review has been prompted by warnings from the Spanish government that it intends to cease recognising Britain's one-year travel document. No date for the Spanish action has yet been announced - but British officials believe it could take effect at the end of next year. This suggests that a decision on whether to withdraw the British visitors passport is likely to be taken before the end of this year. The government is seeking the views of the travel trade and a range of other interested groups as part of the review, which will be completed by the end of the summer. Ministers are likely to begin considering whether the British visitors passport should be withdrawn, and other possible implications for the issuing of passports, in the autumn.</p>

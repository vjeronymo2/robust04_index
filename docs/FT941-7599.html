			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Companies breach R&amp;D accounting standards A quarter of companies that refer to research-and-development expenditure in their annual reports are breaching accounting standards, a survey of financial reporting said yesterday. From a sample of 300 companies, 148 disclose evidence of R&amp;D - usually in the chairman's statement - but 25 per cent of these do not show the amount they spend. Fourteen per cent of the 65 FT-SE 100 companies that spend on R&amp;D do not disclose the amount. This practice contradicts SSAP 13, the accounting standard on R&amp;D, which demands disclosure of the amount split between spending in the current year and that capitalised over future years. The details emerge in Financial Reporting 1993-94, the annual survey of company accounts produced by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Mr David Tonkin, joint editor, said it was 'misleading' for companies to state that they spent money on R&amp;D unless the amount was material. If it was material, the amount should be disclosed. The survey shows that reporting practice is beginning to be affected by the changing accounting standards regime, especially FRS 3, the new standard on the profit-and-loss account. It shows that the number of companies with 'extraordinary items' - abolished by the standard - fell from 52 per cent in last year's survey to 26 per cent. It also shows a slight increase in the number of accounts qualified or prefaced by special comments from companies' auditors - rising from 4 per cent to 6 per cent. A chapter in the book describes existing regulations governing the advertising of half-year reports as 'lamentable'. It recommends that companies should be obliged to state whether they are exempt from requirements of the Stock Exchange, and says that the report should be dated. The survey suggests that the reforms being undertaken by the Accounting Standards Board are emphasising disclosure rather than tightly prescriptive measurement. Financial Reporting 1993-94.

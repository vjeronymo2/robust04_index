			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Who reads what and why As an FT reader, you are likely to be an Adrian Amex, Gordon Golfer or possibly a Terence or Tara Tennis. What you are least likely to be is a Cheryl Clubber or a Basil or Betty British. The characters are the creation of CIA, the independent advertising media buyer, drawn from information that 25,000 UK adults supplied about themselves. The technique used - known in market survey jargon as 'psychographic mapping' - is the latest attempt to build on the old A-E socio-economic classifications. Ian Rogers, CIA UK managing director, says the exercise has revealed that surprisingly diverse kinds of readers buy the same daily newspapers for different reasons. Further exploration of the characters should enable them to target their clients' advertising money more effectively. Here is CIA's full cast list. Terry Torremolinos, 6.6 per cent of the population, C2D, single, under 35 and an early school-leaver. Terry enjoys a night at the pub, hates gardening, plays football and rarely sits down to a meal. He reads The Daily Record, Daily Star, Sun or Today. Cheryl Clubber, 7.7 per cent of the population, C2D, 15-24, still studying if single but likely to finish education at 16; if married, likely to have children under four.

Carol Kitchen, 7.8 per cent of the population, DE, 35-54, finished education at 15. Carol is married with children aged five-15 and either does not go out to work, or works part time.

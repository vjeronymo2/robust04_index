			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER REJECTS SOVIET BID TO JOIN GLOBAL GROUPS  </P> <P> The United States rejects membership by the Soviet Union in international trade  and financial organizations because the Soviet economy remains "significantly  incompatible" with Western institutions, Secretary of State James A. Baker III  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The former treasury secretary, issuing the most comprehensive prescription for  change in the chaotic Soviet economy, challenged Moscow to institute six  reforms to move the Soviet Union from its "socialist market" system toward the  freer markets of the West.  </P> <P> Baker's remarks at a Senate Finance Committee hearing were the first public  statements on the subject by a senior U.S. official since Soviet Foreign  Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said last month that Moscow "would like to  participate actively in the work of the international economic organizations."  </P> <P> Although the Soviet Union has not formally asked to join, Shevardnadze said it  wants to "establish contacts" with the International Monetary Fund and the  World Bank and to cooperate with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  </P> <P> Membership in the international financial institutions would mark a major step  in making the Soviet Union a full-fledged partner in global economic  policy-making, providing prestige as well as technical advice, loans and access  to worldwide markets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Ease Pressure  </P> <P> Baker reiterated that the United States hopes that Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev will succeed in his efforts to restructure Soviet political, economic  and social systems. But he warned that the collective leadership under  Gorbachev is finding it "exceedingly difficult" to develop a comprehensive and  coherent program of reform.  </P> <P> Moreover, the Kremlin is run by "utilitarian, purposeful and determined men"  who are "not pursuing freedom for freedom's sake," Baker said. While their goal  is to modernize the Soviet Union, they will not necessarily adopt Western  values even if their reforms are successful, he said.  </P> <P> Allowing Moscow into world financial institutions prematurely, Baker said,  could reduce pressure for the perestroika reforms to be carried through and  cause difficulties within the affected organizations.  </P> <P> "The Soviet economic system remains significantly incompatible with the  operation of institutions like the GATT, the IMF and the World Bank," Baker  said. "Furthermore, given the size of the Soviet Union, its membership could  prove disruptive . . . especially if the long-term Soviet commitment to the  values represented by those institutions remains uncertain."  </P> <P> The interests of both the United States and the Soviet Union are best served  "by insisting that trade and other economic relations be conducted on a  commercial basis," Baker said. "Operating under these terms, we welcome  mutually beneficial, nonstrategic trade."  </P> <P> Baker listed six changes that the Soviet Union should undertake before it  increases its international economic involvement: price reform, stabilizing the  ruble, freer competition among Soviet enterprises, property rights, taxation  and regulation, and social welfare.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Korea yesterday entered into a string of quarterly  bilateral negotiations with Australia, New Zealand and the  United States to discuss matters concerning Korea's beef imports.    The meetings are the third of their kind since a memorandum  of understanding on beef market access was signed between Korea  and Korea's three major beef exporters last July, the Ministry  of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.    In yesterday's meeting, Australia urged Korea to expand the  volume of its grass-fed beef sold in wholesale markets to 5,000  tons from the present 800 tons, said a ministry official who  attended the meeting.    New Zealand is expected to make similar demands in a meeting  with Korea scheduled for April 25, the official said.    The United States with which Korea is scheduled to have a  beef negotiation April 26 will likely urge Korea to ease  restrictions on the local distribution of beef.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Enron in agreement with India on power station Enron Power of the US has reached agreement with the Indian national and provincial governments on a controversial Rs29bn (Pounds 622m) power station to be built near Bombay. Enron and the Maharashtra state government in western India yesterday signed an agreement under which the Maharashtra state electricity board will buy power from Enron's 695MW gas-fired plant, which will be constructed at Dhabol on the coast. The successful completion of talks with Enron will come as a relief to the Indian authorities in their quest to attract foreign investment into the power sector and into India generally. The project has attracted much attention; a failure in negotiations might have discouraged other potential investors. Dhabol is the second big power station project for which a power purchase agreement has been signed after the government last year invited private investors into the state-dominated generating industry to help ease India's chronic electricity shortages. National Power, the UK generator, and the UK-based Hinduja trading family last month signed a similar pact for a 1,000MW plant with the authorities in the southern state of Andrha Pradesh. In each case, the power purchase agreements are being supported by payment guarantees from the state and, indirectly, from the central government, a key condition sought by foreign investors who have otherwise been loth to invest in schemes involving the heavily indebted state electricity distribution boards. Enron originally envisaged a much larger scheme, a 2,000MW plant fuelled by liquid natural gas imported from Qatar. The company impressed the Indian authorities with its determination to press ahead rapidly with the project, pursuing its negotiations very vigorously. But the project ran into criticism from, among others, the World Bank, which was concerned about the cost, the reliance on imported fuel, and about doubts whether Maharashtra, which is relatively well served with power plants, really needed such a large new station. Enron now plans to build the giant plant in two stages: a 695MW plant to be completed by 1997, and a 1,320MW extension, which has yet to be approved by the state electricity board, and is planned to be finished by late 1998.</p>

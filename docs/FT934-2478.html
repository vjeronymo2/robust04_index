			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Tenders invited for prison scheme The public and private sectors will compete to manage a mothballed prison near Rochdale which is being redeveloped to help cope with growing prisoner numbers, Alan Pike writes. Buckley Hall, a former detention centre for 17 to 21-year-olds, closed in 1989 because of structural defects. Most of the existing buildings will be demolished, and it will be rebuilt to house 300 prisoners by 1995. The Prison Service intends to market-test the management of Buckley Hall by inviting the public and private sectors to submit bids.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Top ratings help CBS turnround CBS, which owns one of the three US television networks, yesterday posted a strong improvement in underlying first-quarter earnings, helped by a better business climate and the television network's ability to command higher advertising rates as it gains market share. Net income was Dollars 54.2m, or Dollars 3.50, compared with a net loss of Dollars 64m, or Dollars 4.18, a year ago. Earnings benefited from a pre-tax gain of Dollars 19.2m on the sale of some marketable securities. Sales fell 19 per cent to Dollars 878.9m from Dollars 1.08bn. A year ago, CBS took a non-cash post-tax charge of Dollars 81.5m, or Dollars 5.32, for the adoption of new accounting standards. On Wall Street, shares in CBS closed up Dollars 7 1/8 at a 52-week high of Dollars 237 1/8 . The New York Times Company, which owns 31 regional newspapers and a 50 per cent stake in the International Herald Tribune, yesterday posted net income of Dollars 10.9m, or 14 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 454.5m for the 1993 first quarter. A year earlier, the company suffered a net loss of Dollars 20m, or 26 cents, on revenues of Dollars 435.9m. The results were distorted by a charge of Dollars 33.4m, or 43 cents, for accounting changes.</p>

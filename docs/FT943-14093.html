			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Berlusconi defends release of corruption suspects The Italian authorities yesterday began releasing bribery and corruption suspects from prison, as a controversial new decree limiting magistrates' use of preventive detention took effect. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister, angrily defended the two-day-old decree after attacks by opposition politicians, magistrates and the press. He said in Rome that the decree would 'prevent the country turning into a police state'. Italy's best-known investigating magistrates - the Milan-based mani pulite ('clean hands') team - said on Thursday they would resign from the anti-corruption unit in protest. Magistrates in Genoa yesterday also refused to handle cases affected by the decree, which bans the use of preventive detention in bribery and corruption investigations. It is estimated that the decree could affect up to 2,000 people in preventive detention. Most of them, including a dozen top Italian executives for whom arrest warrants were issued on Thursday, will be put under house arrest instead. Mr Bettino Craxi, former socialist prime minister under suspicion in a number of corruption investigations, will also face house arrest, rather than imprisonment, if he returns from self-imposed exile in Tunisia. One of the first suspects released yesterday was the wife of Mr Duilio Poggiolini, a former health ministry official who allegedly received bribes from six drug companies in exchange for favours. She said she had experienced 'eight barbaric months' in a Neapolitan prison. The decree needs parliamentary support to survive and faces a rough ride from the opposition and from Mr Berlusconi's coalition partners, the regionalist Northern League. The justice and interior ministers both suggested yesterday that it could be amended. 'We don't issue decrees that are valid for eternity and cannot be discussed,' said Mr Alfredo Biondi, the justice minister. 'Everything can be modified, as long as the basis of the decree is not overturned.' The prime minister said the decree had his full backing and that of the whole cabinet. In a reference to the Milan team, Mr Berlusconi said certain magistrates 'had become stars, and are disappointed if their faces don't appear on television frequently. What better way to become the centre of attention than to adopt this or that measure reducing people's liberty and putting them in prison'? Mr Antonio Di Pietro has led the two-year crusade against widespread corruption in Italian business and politics which brought down the previous regime and prepared the way for Mr Berlusconi to win office in the March general election. While Mr Di Pietro's prosecution of suspects in the first of the so-called Tangentopoli ('Bribesville') trials has been followed by the public on television, questions have been raised about the magistrates' use of the media and the threat of detention to shame suspects into confession.

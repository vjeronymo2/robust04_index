			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Argos jumps to Pounds 83m but warns on spending Argos, the catalogue retailer, announced a sharp increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 52.9m to Pounds 83.5m for the year to January 1 1994 but warned that the pick-up in consumer spending could still be damaged by next month's tax increases. The 1992 figure was depressed by Pounds 18.9m of losses and closure costs at the Chesterman furniture chain. Taking account of those, however, underlying profits increased by 16.3 per cent. Mr Mike Smith, chief executive, warned, however, that while sales had not so far been damaged by the threat of tax rises, the group was prepared for a downturn in April. 'We're planning on the basis that it will happen,' he said. 'So if it doesn't, that will be a bonus.' Sales increased by 10.6 per cent to Pounds 1.11bn - although last year's figures were for a 53-week period, and included Chesterman. Excluding the furniture chain, sales in the catalogue business were up 12.4 per cent, with like-for-like sales up 7.3 per cent and new stores adding 5.1 per cent. Like-for-like growth increased from 5.9 per cent in the first half to 8.1 per cent in the second, and Mr Smith said sales growth had continued at about 8 per cent since January. He said part of the reason for the sales improvement was very competitive pricing, with three-quarters of Argos' lines carried over from its summer to winter catalogues at the same price or less, stronger price promotions and an expanded range. Argos increased market share in nearly all product areas, with furniture, office equipment and gifts the best performers. The gross margin increased by 0.25 points in the first half, but declined in the second half, leaving it 0.1 points up. Mr Smith warned that gross margins would fall as Argos continued to improve price competitiveness, but the effect on operating margins would be limited by 'managing' the gross margin - increasing the range of high-margin areas such as gifts and jewellery - careful cost controls, and continued store expansion. The home delivery operation showed a 37 per cent rise in the number of product lines contributing to a 49 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 37m Argos plans 30 new stores in 1994, taking the total, after some closures, to 345. The eventual target is 500 to 600 stores. Earnings increased to 18.6p per share (11.7p) and the proposed final dividend is 5.65p, lifting the total from 7p to 8p. See Lex</p>

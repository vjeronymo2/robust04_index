			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gencor plans announcement Gencor, the South African mining house which is bidding for parts of the metal and mining business of Royal Dutch/Shell's Billiton group, said it would make an announcement today on future prospects, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. Confirmation that it would release the outcome of the bid could not be obtained, but analysts said the subject of the announcement, to take the form of a presentation, would likely be Billiton. Analysts expect a deal, central to Gencor's foreign expansion ambitions, to cost it at least Dollars 1bn. The presentation is scheduled for this afternoon.</p>

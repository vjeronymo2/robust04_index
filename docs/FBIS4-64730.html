			<p>BFN     [Text] Police are investigating the possibility of a spying  case against the Republic. The suspects are three Albanians who  crossed into the free areas from the occupied areas and were  arrested this morning near a military camp in Nicosia. The  three Albanians crossed into the free areas from the buffer zone  in Nicosia but did not tell the interrogators their exact point  of entry. They testified that they flew to the occupied areas  from Turkey.    The three Albanians were arrested at 0800 this morning in  the  vicinity of the Hilton Hotel. A military camp is in this area.  A taxi driver gave police information on the movements of the  three Albanians. The Albanians had asked him to take them to  Agros; as soon as they arrived there, they asked him to bring  them back to Nicosia.    The three Albanians did not have any identity cards or  passports and gave contradictory testimony to the police, who  are investigating a case of illegal entry to the Republic. The  suspects will appear in court tomorrow morning so that a warrant  for their detention can be issued.</p>

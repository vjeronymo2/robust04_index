Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, DTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. DTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SID is a central repository for customer account and settlement information furnished by institutions, agents, and broker-dealers. The information includes items such as the agent for an institutional customer, the agent's internal account number for the institutional customer, and interested parties. A broker-dealer can link its internal account numbers for its institutional customers to the internal account numbers at the institutions. When entering trade data into the ID system, a broker-dealer can simply refer to its internal account number in SID, and the ID system will extract the necessary information from SID (such as customer name, agent, interested parties, and settlement related information) and automatically will add the information to the confirmation. SID will eliminate the need for the broker-dealer to provide all such information each time that the broker-dealer enters trade data into the ID system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SID is an optional feature for ID users. However, once a broker-dealer links its internal customer account number with account information furnished to SID by the institutional customer, data in SID will be used for certain fields in ID system processing, regardless of whether the broker-dealer submits data for those fields, when the broker-dealer submits trade data for that institutional customer's trades. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder because the proposed rule change will further automate the process by which securities transactions are cleared and settled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DTC perceives no impact on competition by reason of the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SID has been developed through widespread consultations with securities industry members.

			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Vengeful Saddam keeps Arab opponents on edge: The growing uncertainties afflicting the region THE surreal spectacle of a larger-than-life Saddam Hussein pinning 'mother of battles' anniversary medals on the chests of his military commanders would have brought little comfort to his jittery Arab opponents, preoccupied with developments in Algeria and their own domestic problems. While this week's television theatre in Baghdad, marked by the Iraqi president's claims of 'victory' in the Gulf war, might be dismissed as sheer bravado, the episode was nevertheless an uncomfortable reminder to his rivals that in spite of everything Mr Saddam lives on. An Arab proverb, repeated with some nervousness in Cairo these days, holds that a snake is not dead until its head is severed from the body. This melodramatic observation usually precedes criticism of the allies for not doing more to unseat the Iraqi leader when the opportunity presented itself. Now, a year after the US-led alliance began the assault which liberated Kuwait, the fruits of that victory in Arab eyes seem less appealing. True, Kuwait was saved and Mr Saddam was humbled, but divisions in the Arab world have scarcely been deeper and the future less certain. Not least, concern in the capitals of Washington's moderate Arab allies stems from the dramatic erosion in Mr Bush's domestic standing, with consequent fears that a weakened administration would be less steadfast in defence of its friends abroad, and thus less capable of imposing Middle East peace. Adding to these worries are the activities of the neo-isolationists on the Republican right-wing. Iraq's official media, reduced to a whisper by last January's bombing campaign, now spends its days gloating about Mr Bush's misfortunes. Iraqis are bombarded with negative images of recession-hit America, implying somehow that life in Iraq, in spite of everything, is preferable. 'As we celebrate, with our heads held high, the first anniversary of the tyrannical 30-state aggression against us, Bush. . . was touring Asian countries looking for a solution to the economic crisis the US is suffering from,' commented al Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Ba'ath party. While much Iraqi propaganda is ludicrous, recent visitors to Iraq have been struck by the regime's success in rebuilding the country's battered infrastructure, and restoring essential services. The authorities also appear to be making a reasonable fist of providing food rations for the needy, in spite of sanctions and the burden of rising prices; inflation of 30 per cent a month is reported. Predictions that defeat in Kuwait would foment a revolt against Mr Saddam among Iraq's office corps - the favoured scenario of the US and its Arab allies - have not come to fruition, and as the months pass hopes of this happening diminish. The Iraqi leadership appears to have regained some of its poise and is now more visible, although reports persist of dissension in the ranks, including within Mr Saddam's immediate coterie. The regime has also been obliged to deal with an incipient underground campaign, much like the one that was waged during the Iran-Iraq war by the outlawed al Dawaa Shia fundamentalists. At least one car-bombing - the trademark of the underground group - has been carried out in Baghdad in recent weeks. The military, shattered by its defeat in Kuwait and further run ragged by the Kurdish and Shia revolts following the war, has been reorganised and discipline tightened under new defence minister Ali Hassan al-Majid, a cousin of Mr Saddam. The Kurds in the north and the repressed Shia in the south would be drawing little comfort from this: Kurdish leaders have been warning for weeks that Mr Saddam will use the winter months to drive Kurdish fighters from towns south of the UN-declared safety zone. Recent reports suggest that Iraq has been seeking to replenish its depleted arsenal and UN experts, engaged in uncovering details of the Iraqi nuclear programme, suspect that work continues on efforts to acquire a nuclear capability. In the capitals of Arab states of the anti-Iraq alliance, officials have no doubt that a craving for revenge is never far from an isolated and weakened Mr Saddam. 'When the great confrontation took place,' the Iraqi president declared pointedly this week, 'God decreed that victory once again must go to the Iraqis because they follow the path of truth while their enemies follow the path of falsehood.'</p>

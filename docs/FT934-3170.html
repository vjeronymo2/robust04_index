			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Wholesale prices flat in November US wholesale prices were flat last month, indicating that inflationary pressures remain subdued, the Labour Department said yesterday. The figures left Wall Street analysts uncertain about the outlook for short-term interest rates, currently 3 per cent. Following ambiguous remarks by senior monetary officials, some analysts predict the Federal Reserve will respond to evidence of faster growth by nudging rates higher early next year. Others believe inflation is so subdued the Fed will delay action for many months. 'The inflation outlook remains benign,' said Mr David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities in New York. There was a 50 per cent chance the Fed would tighten policy next month - the decision would depend on the strength of economic data in coming weeks. The producer price index for finished goods was unchanged last month after a decline of 0.2 per cent in October. The lack of upward price pressure partly reflected the recent decline in world oil prices which led to a 2.7 per cent decline in US energy costs. The 'core' producer price index, which excludes the volatile components of food and energy, rose 0.4 per cent last month, more than expected in financial markets. However, this reflected a 2.1 per cent increase in car prices last month, which is not expected to recur in coming months. It was the first rise in the core index since July and followed a 0.5 per cent decline in October.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND HIGHLIGHTS FOR L.A. INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival continues  at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas this weekend. Highlights from  today's and Sunday's program follow.  </P> <P> TODAY  </P> <P> 'Krik? Krak! Tales of a Nightmare'  </P> <P> Haiti/United States/Canada, 1988, 82 minutes  </P> <P>  4:20 p.m.  </P> <P>  Haiti's Duvalier dictatorship survived as long as it did in part by exploiting  the population's widespread regard for and fear of voodoo, which should make  interesting documentary fodder. But this grim, elliptical compendium of  recollections of unpleasantness among the peasants, directed by Jac Avila and  Vanyoska Gee, is more often simply ominous and confusing.

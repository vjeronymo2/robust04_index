			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TELL TV TIMES: HOW FAR SHOULD TV GO ?  </P> <P> The new television season already has its share of controversy as several shows  are using frank language in characters' dialogue. Among the shows in the  spotlight are "Uncle Buck" (in the premiere young Sara Martineck, below left,  says "you suck") and "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" (Sharon Gless says "tits").  Producers say such language is needed to keep the shows realistic. The networks  argue that with freer-wheeling Fox and cable across the dial their shows must  attract audiences. What do you think? Does such language really add to a show?  Are euphemisms better? Send responses to Tell TV Times, TV Times, Times Mirror  Square, Los Angeles, Calif., 90053. Or fax them to (213) 237-7630. Letters must  be signed with full name and address.  </P> <P> Here are the responses to the Aug. 26 question: What favorites would you like  to see again?  </P> <P> I would be happy if some station brought back "The Bronx Zoo" with Ed Asner.  This was a terrific show, and NBC never gave it a decent chance. Instead, the  network now gives us "Hull High." No taste, these people!  </P> <P> Meridith Patera, Moorpark  </P> <P> 1) "The Partridge Family": I know that KCAL had it on for a while, but I would  love to see it on some other station's schedule again.  </P> <P> 2) "The Odd Couple," which used to air on KTLA.  </P> <P> 3) "Chico and the Man": KTTV used to show it, but then it was discontinued.  </P> <P> 4) "Hill Street Blues": Will this show be back on the air? I was informed by  KCOP that another station had bought it.  </P> <P> Paul Legas, Los Alamitos  </P> <P> "Hill Street Blues" is airing weeknights at 7 p.m. on KTTY in San Diego. WGN  cable also has syndication rights to the program until 1995, though it's not  carrying the MTM police series currently.  </P> <P> One of my favorite shows of the past was "Bewitched" with Elizabeth Montgomery  and Dick York. With the world in its present state, we could use some laughs,  magic and levitation.  </P> <P> Gary Traxler, North Hollywood  </P> <P> You'll find "Bewitched" Sundays at 1 a.m. on KCOP and weeknights at 8:30 p.m.  on Nickelodeon. And for early birds, TBS carries it weekdays at 5:30 a.m.  </P> <P> I would suggest "The Waltons." I don't recall any station running this series  since it ended, apart from a two-hour episode occasionally shown as an  afternoon movie. I would enjoy seeing all the episodes.  </P> <P> Sharon Denning, El Toro  </P> <P> I'd like to see "Thriller" (the early 1960s suspense series with Boris  Karloff), "One Step Beyond" (the syndicated title for "Alcoa Presents,"  1959-1961, an occult anthology) and "The Night Stalker" with Darren McGavin.  </P> <P> Joyce Jackson, Los Angeles  </P> <P> I would like to see "The Addams Family," "My Favorite Martian" and "Dave Allen  at Large," which featured the Irish comedian/talk show host.  </P> <P> Charles J. Meyer, Sherman Oaks  </P> <P> TNT carries "My Favorite Martian" weekdays at 6:30 a.m.  </P></p>

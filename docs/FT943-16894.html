			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: World Bank arm in Russia link The International Finance Corporation, the private-sector arm of the World Bank, has arranged a risk management facility with Tokobank, a privately-owned Russian bank based in Moscow, which will give the commercial bank access to the long-term international swaps market, writes Tracy Corrigan. It is the first such facility in Russia, though the IFC has completed similar arrangements in other emerging markets. The facility will allow Tokobank to hedge currency and interest rate risks in its portfolio and to offer risk-hedging products to its own clients. Tokobank will be able to enter swap transactions worth Dollars 50m with maturities up to seven years.</p>

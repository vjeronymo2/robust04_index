			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Leading Article: A cause for celebration 'TRY NOVELTIES for salesman's bait,' wrote Goethe. 'For novelties win everyone.' Europe's single market, which officially started yesterday, is a welcome novelty, and not just for political and commercial salesmen seeking a winning slogan in a bleak winter. It comes into force at an unpropitious moment, with west and east Europeans beset by recession and upheaval. Yet hope sometimes finds its firmest footing in a time of gloom. Opening up closed industrial, service and financial sectors to more competition may cause short-term pain, but it is the best recipe for growth. Provided companies, individuals and governments grasp the opportunities, the single market offers Europe its best chance of prosperity. Acrimony and fragmentation have characterised European politics in the past 12 months. But the Community deserves congratulation for enacting on time virtually all of a complex legislative programme, first outlined in 1985, allowing free movement of persons, goods, capital and services. Despite the impediments and imperfections remaining, the EC has pulled off an impressive feat. Placing the measures on the statute book was onerous. Making them work will be still harder. The EC faces four challenges. First, member countries will have to apply the rules firmly and equitably. The EC's new insistence on subsidiarity must not impede effective enforcement. Second, governments should seek ways of countering the currency instability, seen by many chief executives as undermining the single market's prospects of success. Increased access Third, the new market must be outward rather than inward-looking. This is crucial for relations with North America and Japan, and also for allowing increased access for exports from central and eastern Europe - all the more important in view of the EC's plans for enlargement. Fourth, the single market must be made attractive and inspiring to Europe's citizens - at a time when 16m people in the EC are without jobs, and economic growth is the lowest since 1981-82. If the EC now faces difficulties, the story of the single market shows how such tests can be surmounted. Following 12 years of debilitation after the 1973 oil shock, the single market was conceived as a means of bringing the Community back to life. The relaunch was accomplished through amendments to the Treaty of Rome which came into force with the Single European Act in 1987. The act was relatively uncontroversial, yet it encompassed far-reaching steps towards a supranational Europe. Along with the aim of establishing 'an area without internal frontiers', the act brought in qualified majority voting as well as the objective of economic and monetary union. Investment surge In some senses, the single market existed before it was born. An investment surge by companies anticipating abolition of borders, combined with the effect of German reunification, made 1986-90 a buoyant period. During that time the Community registered annual average growth of 3.2 per cent, three times the OECD's forecast for this year's performance. Without this helpful background, the single market may well have run into the type of opposition that has befallen the Maastricht treaty. As it is, the single market starts life punctually, but in a world made uncertain by change. One of the EC's prime problems is its flagging competitiveness, starkly underlined by a trade deficit with the rest of the world of Dollars 60bn to Dollars 70bn a year (against a Dollars 20bn surplus in 1985). Conscious of this handicap, not least vis-a-vis newly industrialised countries, large European companies seem likely initially to use the single market above all to spur further productivity gains, through rationalising and concentrating their activities. Over the longer term, the single market opens a path to a more cohesive and competitive Europe which will create and not destroy jobs. By encouraging countries and companies to adopt the best available business and labour practices, it lays groundwork for deeper integration, including, perhaps, monetary union. So the new year beacons of celebration shone in a good cause. The milestone of the single market shows how far the Community has travelled; and it provides a sense of direction and purpose for the arduous but rewarding journey still to come.</p>

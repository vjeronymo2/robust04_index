			<p>BFN     [Text] The minister of defense with profound sorrow  announces to the Rwandan people the untimely death of the head  of state, His Excellency Major General Juvenal Habyarimana,  which occurred on 6 April 1994 at about 2030 at Kanombe, when  the plane that was to have brought him from Dar es Salaam was  shot down by unidentified elements in circumstances that are  still unclear. Aboard the same plane was His Excellency  Cyprien Ntaryamira, president of the Republic of Burundi, who  also died in the same circumstances, together with two of his  ministers who were accompanying him.    The army chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Deogratias Sabimana,  Ambassador Jurvenal Renzaho, Colonel Elie, Dr. Emmanuel  Azingeneye, and Major Thadee Bagaragaza, as well as the crew  members, perished in the disaster.    The defense minister requests all Rwandan residents to  remain  at home until they are given other instructions.    The minister of national defense also particularly asks the  National Army to remain vigilant and maintain the people's  security, and the wisdom and courage that they have always  ceaselessly displayed whenever the country has gone through  difficult times.</p>

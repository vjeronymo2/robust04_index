			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: News Corporation Mr Rupert Murdoch has been so busy snapping up assets in recent months that it goes against the grain for him to sell out of one of the world's most profitable newspaper groups. Presumably not even he fancied his chances of trying to preserve the South China Morning Post's editorial and advertising appeal after Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Besides, the returns made on the original HKDollars 2.4bn investment would have been enough to tempt anyone to cash in their chips. The sale of a 34.9 per cent stake to the pro-Beijing Mr Robert Kuok ensures a full bid will not be sparked for SCMP. But this leaves News Corporation with an untidy rump of shares to sell. This would appear a straightforward enough task given that SCMP's shares have more than doubled to HKDollars 5.35 over the past two years. Then again, other investors may well reflect on the risks of owning shares in an English-language newspaper at such a politically-sensitive time. Significantly, News Corporation is choosing to recycle its proceeds into regional satellite television, which skirts such regulatory worries.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Bank regulations eased to encourage lending SEVERAL US bank regulations are being relaxed to help encourage renewed lending, particularly to small business, President Bill Clinton announced yesterday. It would make it easier for well-capitalised banks to make 'character loans' based on their judgment of the borrower, rather than on detailed documentation and collateral, without incurring the suspicions of bank supervisors. Mr Clinton also wants to raise the threshold below which appraisals will not be required for property loans, and stop the appraisal requirement when property is offered as additional collateral for a business loan. Loans secured by property should be valued on the basis of the borrower's ability to pay over time, rather than on the assumption of immediate liquidation. Supervisory agencies will also institute a process for banks to appeal against a supervisor's decision, as well as procedures for handling complaints from banks and from the general public. The measures have been widely trumpeted by the Clinton administration as a blow against the 'credit crunch', a constriction on lending that many bankers claim has been caused by excessive regulations. However, bank supervisory agencies expect them to have only a marginal impact on lending, arguing that new legislation would be needed to achieve a greater effect. 'There is very little we can do simply by changing regulations. Most of what we do is dictated by the law of the land,' said Mr Lawrence Lindsay, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, in a speech earlier this week. Congressman Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House of Representatives banking committee, has also warned President Clinton not to undo necessary bank safety regulations implemented to stop the rash lending that led to the bank debacle of the late 1980s. 'The truth is that all too many banks are taking the easy route of investing in Treasury securities rather than putting in the time and effort required to make a consumer loan,' Mr Gonzalez complained recently. Mr Charles Bowsher, the US comptroller general, has also defended the need for the additional safety and soundness regulations passed in new banking legislation in 1991. 'It would be foolish, in my view, to attempt to periodically weaken and tighten bank regulation in response to recession and inflation. 'Had the banking industry not dissipated its capital in the 1980s by making so many bad loans, it would have been better able to handle some of the problems encountered in this recession,' Mr Bowsher said in recent testimony to Congress. However, a study by regulatory agencies estimated the cost of regulatory burden on banks at somewhere between Dollars 7.5bn and Dollars 17bn in 1991.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, Ukraine, June 1 (A.A.) -- President Suleyman  Demirel on Wednesday said that Turkey strongly regrets  conditional U.S. aid to Turkey.    "We do not consider this a friendly gesture," he told  reporters in the Ukraine where he is on an official visit.    The U.S. House of Representatives, which approved on  Wednesday a 13.5-billion-dollar foreign aid bill for fiscal  1995, withheld a quarter of the 363 million dollars earmarked  for Turkey in foreign military sales, pending progress on human  rights and on Cyprus.    "We strongly regret the fact that the aid will be tied to  conditions such as human rights, terror and Cyprus," he said.  "Under these circumstances, it is only natural that the  extension of the multi-national allied forces in Incirlik was  not discussed at the National Security Council meeting which was  held during the weekend.    "The mandate for the forces is to end by the end of this  month," he said. Demirel pointed out that the force had been  invited by Turkey in the first place to protect northern Iraqi  Kurds from renewed attacks by Iraqi leader Saddam Husayn after a  failed Kurdish rebellion following Iraq's Gulf War defeat.    "We have been defending them (northern Iraqi Kurds) for  years," he said. "But now we are facing such behavior by the  U.S. Congress. The extension of the mandate is to the advantage  of Turkey and we shall meet with the Security Council again to  discuss it."    Regarding the U.N.-imposed trade embargo against Iraq,  Demirel said that Turkey has suffered from it and that nowhere  on earth can innocent people be so punished, referring to the  people of Iraq.    "The integration of the Iraqi Government to the  international  community is leading the country to disintegration and this will  hurt world peace," he said. "Unfortunately the United States,  Britain and France have transformed it into an internal  political issue."    Demirel also stressed that neither Turkey nor the Arab world  wants Iraq's disintegration.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As a noble tribute to the Cuban people, the upcoming  May Day will be turned into a decisive boost to production tasks  like the sugarcane, tuber, and vegetable harvests and the  planting and weeding. Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the  Cuban Workers Federation, stated in Havana that the traditional  Revolution Square rally and parade will not be held this May  Day. Ross added that the occasion will be observed by means of  ceremonies in the provinces and workplaces in keeping with the  characteristics and resources of the different individual  regions. These ceremonies will be held on 30 April because a  special session of the National Assembly of the People's  Government is scheduled for 1 May. Ross added that this is the  result of a desire to keep May Day alive, as well as keeping  alive, above all, the spirit of the workers assemblies recently  held thoroughout Cuba and described by Fidel as a tremendous  process by Cuba's union movement.    Ross stressed that one can pay no greater homage to Cuba's  workers than to discuss, on May Day, their suggestions on how to  streamline the nation's finances, since the workers will be  responsible for implementing the economic measures to be adopted  in Cuba.</p>

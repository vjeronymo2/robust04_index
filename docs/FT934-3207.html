			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (14): Profitable shake-up in Asia - Profile: Standard Chartered This year the world's institutional investors woke up to economic developments in eastern Asia. A flood of funds from overseas, particularly from the US, has sent most of the region's stock markets soaring. The Manila and Jakarta stock markets have risen more than 70 per cent since the beginning of the year. Hong Kong, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore have been setting new highs in often frantic trading. The rise of eastern Asia's equity markets has been very good news for Standard Chartered's custodial services division, now called the Equitor Group. 'In late 1991 the bank reorganised and decided to dedicate more people and resources to custodial services,' says Mr Paul Barker, the Equitor Group general manager overseeing the custodial needs in Asia of institutional clients. 'Before we offered services on a country by country basis. Now it's a more integrated operation. The reorganisation was really a recognition of the enormous potential of custody services in this region,' says Mr Barker. 'It was also part of the bank's overall aim to generate more fee-based business.' StanChart has been in the custody business for many years but it is only recently that the bank has emerged as a leading force in the Asia markets. The amount StanChart earns from its custodial services is not separated out in accounts. But its fast growing Asia operation is likely to be making considerable profits. 'Assets under management have grown by about 250 per cent in the last two years,' says Mr Barker. 'In value terms US funds would outweigh others but the Japanese are coming in in a big way. Intra Asia business is also growing rapidly, particularly with funds going into China.' StanChart Equitor stresses that it is not a global custodian. Its services are focused on an area it calls greater Asia, operating in 14 countries stretching from Pakistan and India in the west to Japan in the east. 'We act as a regional sub-custodian,' says Mr Barker. 'Our clients are the big global custodians and institutions in the US, Europe and Japan. We offer on the ground expertise and, perhaps most important, a comprehensive reporting service to clients in centres like Chicago and London on fast-growing markets Asian markets.' StanChart has been in Asia for more than 130 years. The region has a position of central importance in the bank's finances. Total assets of StanChart's Asia Pacific units stood at Pounds 14bn (Dollars 21bn) last year, about half the group's total assets. The Asia Pacific has traditionally been regarded as the group's crown jewel, producing profits to offset losses elsewhere. But the Bombay stock exchange scandal last year and the resulting Pounds 272m bad debt provision the bank was forced to make showed the region could produce some nasty surprises. A simultaneous, secondary listing of StanChart shares is now planned in Hong Kong and Singapore, probably taking place by the middle of next year. The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank (HSBC), Citibank and StanChart are the leaders in custodial services in Asia. Many domestic banks are also fast developing custodial expertise. While StanChart Equitor cannot match the market share of HSBC in many markets, it has quickly worked its way to the top in what is a very competitive business since reorganising operations two years ago. 'The bread and butter of our business is the safeguarding of share scrip, settlement and cash management,' says Mr Barker. 'But there are so many other services that are now essential.' 'A big part of the job is educating our clients in dealing with these markets. For instance there is a big contrast between the older and newer markets. 'For example, in Malaysia there is a mix of physical and scripless trading but in Shanghai and Shenzhen it's all very sophisticated with scripless trading and central depositories. It's very important that our clients keep updated on local developments. We continuously feed them information on the maze of settlement procedures and on new regulations.' Another important role of the custodian is liaising between market regulators and potential investors. A US pension fund might have particular requirements which have to be satisfied before investing in a market. 'We work behind the scenes to match the requirements of certain investors to the local market,' says Mr Barker. 'That means talking to regulators, helping to prepare the ground for investors and prevent any misunderstandings. If a market loses credibility with a US pension fund it can be disastrous.' The custody business in Asia is changing fast. More markets are moving towards completely scripless trading and central depositories. While this means that custody is becoming a less physical exercise - for one thing banks will no longer have to build enormous vaults to handle scrip - clients are now demanding many other services. More markets will soon be offering securities lending opportunities. 'This has already developed into a big business in Japan,' says Mr Barker. 'It's a form of hedging for the client that works best in markets where short selling is permitted. That is going to develop into a big part of our business.' The volatility of Asia's markets will ensure that operators of custodial services are kept busy. Custodians have to anticipate sudden swings in the market and be ready to handle volume surges. Earlier this year trading volumes in Kuala Lumpur suddenly soared to levels exceeding New York and Tokyo. Custodians have to have teams of professionals ready to handle such situations. If they are caught flat-footed, then clients, the big global custodians in the US or Europe, will quickly look elsewhere for service. 'The recent flood of funds being moved into Asia by the big institutions has been good for us,' says Mr Barker. 'But it won't go on like this forever. While a lot of funds will stay in the area the business is bound to ebb and flow. We've got to be prepared for the quiet as well as the hectic times.'</p>

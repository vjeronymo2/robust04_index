			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Survey of Fraud - Prevention and Detection (2): Greater alertness uncovers more cases - Money Laundering / Ian Rodger discusses reasons why the frequency of this crime has increased Money laundering has suddenly become among the most frequent of crimes being attacked by law enforcement officers and politicians. Scarcely a week goes by without a fresh call to action being issued against this most discreet of crimes. And scarcely a week goes by without a new case of money laundering coming to light or being prosecuted. It even figured in the recent macabre case of more than 50 religious cult-related deaths in Switzerland and Canada. The two trends are of course related. The increased focus on the problem has made banks and law enforcers more sensitive to it, thus leading to greater surveillance and more discoveries. According to recent estimates by US and UK officials, the amount of money laundered every year amounts to roughly Dollars 500bn. This money is the fuel that keeps organised crime going and growing, mainly in support of the international drug trade but also for various other sophisticated crimes, from insider trading to the traffic in nuclear materials. The attack on money laundering only became serious in the 1980s, mainly because of the expanding drug business. And there are still several loopholes or weak points within the international financial system, some of them bizarre. For example, in the US, which probably still tops the world money laundering league table, a 1970 Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to report suspicious transactions. But wire transfers, the most common form of transaction, are excluded from this requirement. In theory, money laundering should be relatively easy to prevent. If banks and other financial institutions deal only with customers they know and if they monitor carefully certain types of potentially suspicious transactions, they should be able to keep out big-time financial criminals. That is the rationale behind a plethora of guidelines and recommendations that have been issued by various international organisations in recent years. Starting in 1988, the Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices issued a recommendation calling on banks to make 'reasonable efforts' to determine the true identity of customers. The following year, the group of seven leading industrial countries set up a Financial Action Task Force to study ways of curbing money laundering. FATF has since established guidelines for national financial systems and carried out audits of several leading countries. A European Council 1991 directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering came into effect throughout the European Union at the beginning of last year. It obliges all financial institutions to know the true identity of their clients and to report any suspicious transactions to the police. Money launderers tend to use large financial centres or tax havens to try and disguise routes to the sources of their earnings. It is in places such as Switzerland, the City of London or New York that they are likely to find a few bent bankers willing to help them. In an attempt to preserve their reputations, these centres have been among the most aggressive in introducing laws and guidelines to prevent money laundering. The Swiss Federal Banking Commission, for example, issued detailed guidelines in 1992 outlining no fewer than 30 specific transactions - withdrawals, purchase of drafts, transfers or excessive cash movements - that should be regarded as suspicious. This year, a new law has broken the conflict between Switzerland's bank secrecy provisions and criminal investigations. Bankers may now report substantial suspicions of criminal activities by their clients to state prosecutors. This is, in fact, tantamount to an obligation. Failure to do so would be regarded by the banking commission as negligence. Switzerland has also made insider trading, money laundering and membership in a criminal organisation criminal offences, thus bringing them within the orbit of crimes on which it is willing to co-operate with law enforcers from other countries. With this sort of tightening occurring in most western countries, the focus has in the past couple of years moved eastward and southward. Money launderers were quick to realise that the former Warsaw pact and Soviet Union countries, with no experience of financial markets and with a desperate need for hard currency, were easy victims. There is also believed to have been a large flow of ill-gotten funds from former Communist officials to western banks. In June, Treuhandanstalt, the industrial reconstruction agency for eastern Germany, launched a civil action in Zurich against the Swiss subsidiary of Bank Austria. It claimed that agents of the former East German Communist Party stashed Sch1.76bn (Dollars 162m) there in the spring of 1991 as the German Democratic Republic collapsed. Bank Austria, Austria's largest bank, has denied the charges. In September, EU finance ministers met with their central and eastern European counterparts in Berlin and, among other things, urged the eastern countries to tighten their laws and regulations against money laundering. Meanwhile, the noose appears to be tightening on the tax havens of the Caribbean. In January, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and Britain's Scotland Yard set up a joint task force to fight white-collar crime in the UK dependent territories. The British Government has also recently reprimanded Gibraltar for not implementing the EU directive on money laundering. Such is the momentum that several speakers at an international symposium on economic crime at Cambridge University in England in September recommended that economic sanctions be imposed on countries that do not combat money laundering seriously. The idea was backed by a number of delegates attending the symposium. John Moscow, New York's assistant district attorney, said: 'It is an idea whose time has come.' All of this activity does not mean that money laundering is going to disappear in the near future. Even if new criminals are rebuffed by banks, it is going to take them some time to clear their books of long-standing dubious customers. This problem was highlighted by a case earlier this year in which a Dollars 150m account of a suspected Colombian drug dealer came to light at the Union Bank of Switzerland. It had remained undetected for several years partly because there had been very few transactions into or out of it.</p>

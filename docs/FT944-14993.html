			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Acquisitions spur Smiths to 12% advance over year Smiths Industries, the aerospace and healthcare group, yesterday reported better than expected full-year profits buoyed by acquisitions and a particularly strong performance by its medical systems business. Pre-tax profits for the year to July 31 rose 12 per cent to Pounds 117.2m from Pounds 104.6m. The shares gained 7p to close at 447p. Sales advanced 4.6 per cent to Pounds 759.3m including a Pounds 16.9m initial contribution from acquisitions such as Deltec, a US medical equipment manufacturer, which was purchased for Dollars 150m (Pounds 95m) in June. The group spent Pounds 129.4m on acquisitions during the year designed to strengthen its medical systems and industrial operations and offset the cyclical decline in the aerospace business. Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, said the group may make further acquisitions, but added: 'I would not like to say when and where.' He did not rule out a strategic acquisition which might be financed by equity but said smaller acquisitions would probably be for cash. Mr Hurn said the year had been one of 'strong progress' for the group. 'All three of our business groups performed well in their different markets. We used our cash for acquisitions, and kept up a high level of R&amp;D in aerospace.' Spending on research and development reached a new peak of Pounds 122m (Pounds 118m), of which Smiths funded Pounds 44m (Pounds 49m) and customers the rest. Operating profits of Pounds 113.3m (Pounds 102.8m) included a Pounds 2.5m contribution from acquisitions. For the second year running, medical systems contributed more to group results than the aerospace division which saw trading profits fall 4 per cent to Pounds 38.9m on sales of Pounds 374.2m (Pounds 392.8m) Despite the decline in sales, aerospace margins were maintained above 10 per cent by further job cuts and other cost reductions. Employment in the division has been cut by 45 per cent over the past four years. Medical systems increased trading profits by more than 13 per cent to Pounds 46.6m on sales of Pounds 200m (Pounds 181m). Existing businesses generated 11 percentage points of the profit increase. The expanded industrial division increased trading profits by 32 per cent to Pounds 27.8m, helped by a full-year contribution from Vent-Axia, the ventilation fans manufacturer, and four new businesses which were acquired during the year for Pounds 35m. Sales increased from Pounds 152m to Pounds 184.7m. Smiths generated Pounds 128.8m in operating cash flow during the year and ended the period with net borrowings of Pounds 20.4m representing gearing of 9.6 per cent. Earnings per share share grew 11.3 per cent to 26.6p (23.9p) and a final dividend of 8.4p (7.55p) is proposed making a total of 13p (11.85p). Lex, Page 26</p>

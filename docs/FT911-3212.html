			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Central &amp; Sheerwood to expand in Pounds 9.85m deal CENTRAL &amp; SHEERWOOD, the engineering group which last week requested a temporary suspension of its shares, is to buy three companies in cash and share transactions worth up to Pounds 9.85m. The shares yesterday returned at 4p, a rise of  3/4 p from the suspension level. The deals will give Mr Geoffrey Robinson, who has been a C&amp;S director for nearly four years and has close ties with all the purchased entities, a 28.1 per cent stake in the resulting company. Interests associated with Mr Robert Maxwell, the media magnate, will hold about 27.2 per cent of the shares, up from 20.7 per cent previously. Mr Robinson, who becomes 'the driving force' behind C&amp;S, according to one adviser, will also replace Mr Maxwell as chairman. The acquired entities are Transfer Technology, an electronics group owned by Mr Robinson, Lock International, a maker of metal detection equipment, and Petroleum Seals and Systems, which manufactures industrial rubber products and seals. The deals will create a more broadly based engineering group, to be renamed Transfer Technology Group. C&amp;S will pay Pounds 1.7m in cash and will issue at least 235m new shares at 3p to buy the three companies.</p>

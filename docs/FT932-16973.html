			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brent oil price edges up to Dollars 19.15 a barrel BRENT OIL prices broke out of their trading range on London's International Petroleum Exchange to close above Dollars 19 a barrel yesterday. The move followed news that production by the 12 members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries was around 24.3m barrels a day. While this is 700,000 b/d higher than Opec's self-imposed production quota, traders said the figures were enough to give the price a slight boost. The Brent June contract closed at Dollars 19.15 a barrel, up 21 cents on the day. The May gas oil contract was Dollars 2 ahead at Dollars 175 a tonne. 'Products are well supported and the news for crude is not disastrous,' said one trader. 'The market is creeping up.' The market showed strength from the outset, moving out of last fortnight's range between Dollars 18.55 and Dollars 18.90. Traders suggested the move would continue next week if the market holds the Dollars 19 level today. Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney, said the market appeared to be 'prepared to disregard the fundamentals and go higher.' If the Brent May contract reached Dollars 19.25, the market would move up to Dollars 19.50, he suggested.</p>

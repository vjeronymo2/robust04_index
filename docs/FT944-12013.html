			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Snapple Snapple's headlong rush into the arms of Quaker Oats is logical. Sales growth at the new-age fruit juice company remains heady, but the group is facing stiff competition from the likes of Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Nestle. Margins are being squeezed and the company has been forced to raise marketing expenditure. Snapple needs to internationalise but, on its own, has neither the necessary financial nor management resources to do so quickly. Quaker should provide the extra resources as well as access to its distribution system. By acquiring Snapple, Quaker is staking its claim to become a significant competitor in the soft-drink industry. The company already markets Gatorade, the top-selling US sports drink which it is beginning to push into Europe. But Quaker is paying a steep price for access to the new-age soft drinks sector, the fastest-growing part of the beverage market. The Dollars 14-a-share offer may be well below Snapple's peak of Dollars 31 in February, but it still represents a multiple of 38 times expected 1994 earnings. The deal will be dilutive for at least two years. Quaker plans to pay for the deal, at least in part, by selling its European pet food business, the region's second largest. Both Nestle and Dalgety, the next biggest competitors, would probably want it. But the Swiss group must be favourite. Dalgety is already distracted, trying to buy Allied Domecq's food ingredients business. Besides, Nestle has the deeper pockets.</p>

Fallahian, quoted on Monday [7 February] by HAMSHAHRI  newspaper, said the suspects either knew about the plot or  played a direct role in the failed bid last Tuesday.    A gunman fired several shots as the president addressed a  gathering in the shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni to mark  the 15th anniversary of the Islamic revolution, but nobody was  hurt.    The 26-year-old gunman, Kurosh Nik-Akhtar, was arrested  immediately after the incident. His picture was published for  the first time Monday on HAMSHAHRI's front page.    Fallahian said all of the people arrested in connection with  the shooting had confessed to having "ominous and  counter-revolutionary aims."    Several of the suspects are former members of leftist groups  who served jail terms because of their "immoral and corrupt  records," he said.    The minister added that the suspects had held a meeting the  night before the incident to coordinate the attack and to ensure  its success.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES JEWS GAIN CLOUT AS POWER SHIFTS TO THE WEST  </P> <P> Rabbi Harvey J. Fields was sitting in his large, book-lined office at the  Wilshire Boulevard Temple last week when he got a telephone call from New York.  </P> <P> A powerful Eastern organization that speaks for the Jewish community on many  social and political issues wanted him to evaluate a proposed policy on  American Jews and Israel.  </P> <P> "Three minutes later I had the fax of the policy on my desk," he said. "I  talked with people on my committee here, and 20 minutes later I responded to  New York."  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Role for Los Angeles  </P> <P> As the American Jewish Historical Society gathered in Century City today for  its five-day annual conference and prepared for a discussion of the future of  Los Angeles Jews, observers said that the phone call to Fields symbolized the  new importance of Los Angeles Jewry.  </P> <P> "Historically, Jewish power has been in Eastern hands," said Steven  Windmueller, executive director of the community relations committee of the  Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles. "I think that it will  increasingly be the case that not only individual but institutional leadership  from Los Angeles will show the way."  </P> <P> The historical society, which has met annually for 96 years, is meeting here  this year for the first time with the theme "Under Western Skies: The  California Jewish Adventure." In addition to the region's growing leadership  role, participants and other experts also made the following predictions:  </P> <P> * Despite rifts with other minorities over issues such as affirmative action,  Jews will continue fighting for civil rights by joining with other groups,  particularly the county's rapidly growing community of more than 2 million  Latinos. "If we are not integrated with them in terms of causes and issues, we  are going to be in danger. Jews realize this," said Gene Levine, a UCLA  sociologist specializing in the study of ethnic and racial groups.  </P> <P> * Jews will face social problems such as alcoholism, drug abuse and domestic  violence. "Fifteen years ago we seemed immune to the social ills of American  families," said Arnold R. Saltzman, executive director of the Jewish Family  Service of the Jewish Federation Council. "Today we meet businessmen who say 20  years ago my business went down the tubes because I had a problem and I didn't  face it. I could not go to the Jewish community because they thought alcoholism  wasn't a problem. I had to go to Alcoholics Anonymous in a church."  </P> <P> * Synagogues and other Jewish institutions must reach what researcher Steven  Huberman calls the "Jell-O Jews. They are sweet and good, but (their commitment  is) mushy," said Huberman, executive director for community services at the  federation. "They probably belong to a synagogue but don't participate. They  probably contribute to the United Jewish Fund but don't participate. . . . We  have to reach these people before we lose them."  </P> <P> The fact that this week's conference, expected to draw 200 from all over the  country, was held far away from the traditional epicenter of national Jewish  leadership shows that the power is moving west, experts say.  </P> <P> "The point is, the membership isn't (concentrated in New York) any longer. It's  shifting. New York used to be the site of all the national meetings, but now we  have to locate in places convenient for Los Angeles, San Francisco or San  Diego," said Mark Talisman, director of the Washington, D.C., office of the  Council of Jewish Federations.  </P> <P> Los Angeles' Jewish population has reached 600,000 and recently passed Chicago  to make it the world's second largest Jewish community, behind New York. In  addition, Angelenos now hold major positions in national Jewish organizations  and are being consulted on national and international Jewish issues as never  before.  </P> <P> "They (Los Angeles Jews) are players in every respect, and their programs are  sought after by communities throughout the country," Talisman said. "That's how  the influence developed."  </P> <P> Advances in communications also have helped West Coast Jewish leaders increase  their influence on national issues.  </P> <P> A satellite receiver dish installed two years ago at the Federation  headquarters allows links with New York or Washington meetings. Local leaders  in a conference room see the out-of-town discussions on a television screen and  address issues through a telephone hook up.  </P> <P> "In the past, your only option was to get on a plane and schlep across country  (all night for a meeting the next day) or to choose not to go. Unless you  elected to give up a day's work (and fly during the day)," said Wayne  Feinstein, executive vice president of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Windmueller said that not only do national organizations communicate better  with Los Angeles but that there has been "an explosion of organizations -- more  than 20 -- setting up shop and hiring staff here" in the last five to 10 years.  </P> <P> They include the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a major lobbyist for  Israel; the Golda Meir Foundation, which raises money for Israeli projects and  Agudath Israel, a political arm of the Orthodox community.  </P> <P> "It's not an accident that all three major Jewish academic institutions have  campuses in Los Angeles," Fields said. "There is only one other place that has  happened -- New York.  </P> <P> "Every major national Jewish organization has an office here. If you wish, you  can attend a dinner for a Jewish organization every night of the week."  </P> <P> New York leaders also recognize the change.  </P> <P> "Its opinions are more sought and more listened to than they were 15 or 20  years ago," said Carmi Schwartz, executive vice president of the Council of  Jewish Federations in New York. "I see Los Angeles in a very strong leadership  role here and globally."  </P> <P> Experts say Los Angeles' peculiar history also affects the community's role on  the cutting edge of Jewish ideas and programs.  </P> <P> "This is probably the least traditional Jewish community in the country," said  Bruce A. Phillips, associate professor of Jewish Communal Studies at Hebrew  Union College.  </P> <P> "It has grown up quicker and it's a new community. People here are not all from  the same Jewish neighborhood. Maybe they're from Detroit or Philadelphia or  Brooklyn. As a result, they are more likely to follow individual proclivities  than to feel pressure from other Jews to conform."  </P> <P> </P> <P> JEWISH POPULATION IN LOS ANGELES  </P> <P> 1900: 2,500  </P></p>

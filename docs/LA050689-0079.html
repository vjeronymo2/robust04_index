			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICAL RESEARCH AND ANIMAL RIGHTS  </P> <P> I wish to applaud you for your article "22 Are Arrested in Protest of Animal  Research at UCLA," by John Lee and Larry Gordon (Metro, April 25).  </P> <P> I fully endorse the demonstration done by the group Last Chance for Animals. It  is heartbreaking to learn how these precious little animals who, having the  misfortune of not only being unwanted, abandoned and/or lost, have wound up  being subjected to the most extreme torture and cruelty by mankind, all in the  name of "medical science."  </P> <P> FRANCES OPITZ  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

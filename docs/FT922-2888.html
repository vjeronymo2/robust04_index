			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Venture capitalists launch value study THE venture-capital industry is to carry out a pilot study aimed at gathering the first reliable statistics on the performance of its investments. The move is in response to pressure from institutional investors disappointed with the industry's poorer-than-expected performance and concerned to see they get value for money. The British Venture Capital Association will gather performance data on investments by six of its members. A project team will gather information on the performance of individual investments to see whether a common pattern emerges from investments made in a particular year or in a particular type of deal. It may also look at the returns from investments in particular industries. But the data will not be used to compare the performance of different funds, a prospect which worries many venture capitalists. Nor will it reveal the return to investors from particular investments, because different funds levy different fees and charges before passing on profits to investors. Mr Robert Drummond, chairman of the association and managing director of Grosvenor Venture Managers, said: 'My hope is that the data will allow us to explain to the world where we are successful and get away from a concentration on the deals which have run into problems such as the buy-outs of MFI, Magnet or Isosceles' The pilot project is also intended to establish a standardised method of assessing the return on venture-capital investments. It comes two years after the association agreed common guidelines on valuing investments, although these rules still leave room for variation. The venture-capital association is to begin a review of its valuation guidelines with the aim of simplifying them. The results of the study are expected to be available early next year.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Slough active A late buzz of activity in Slough Estates was enough to prompt a raft of rumours that the company was being closely eyed by British Land and its partner Quantum Fund. The two groups, the latter headed by the billionaire investor Mr George Soros, formed a Pounds 1bn partnership earlier this year to take advantage of the recovering property market. Slough closed 2 up at 254p. Turnover was an above-average 1.4m. An analyst said that a bid for Slough would need to be pitched at around Pounds 3 a share to take into account not only the premium to asset value but the premium in the group's shares to the market. In the aerospace sector, dealers reported a small amount of switching from Rolls-Royce into British Aerospace, where the shares retreated sharply in the last half-hour of trading. They finished 10 down at 420p. The market cheered the 35 per cent jump in full-year profits to Pounds 9.4m from engineering group Adwest. The company also said it was making a one-for-four rights issue at 140p a share to raise Pounds 22.2m for growth and development as well as acquisitions. The stock raced forward 11 to 183p. Continuing worries about the weakness in GKN's European markets, along with the recent profits downgradings from several brokers, saw the shares continue to slide. They lost 7 to 468p. Profit-taking was said to be the cause of a decline of 4 1/2 to 192 1/2 p in T &amp; N, although support was seen for Lucas Industries, which reports figures next month, and the shares hardened 1 1/2 to 150p. Full-year profits from Costain were Pounds 69.4m compared to Pounds 2.5m in 1992, although this was largely due to the sale of Australian coal mines. The company also announced a Pounds 83.9m rights issue, bringing much-needed funds to the indebted house builder. Building analysts are forecasting 1994 profits of around Pounds 15m. Turnover reached 11m shares and the stock finished 4 stronger at 37p. Berkeley Group climbed 6 to 439p as SG Warburg upgraded its profits forecast, but later fell back to 432p as the gain was consolidated. Chemicals were noticeably quiet, drifting with the market. ICI receded 6 to 714p. Textiles concern Dawson International eased 2 to 194p as talk of downgrades were heard ahead of an institutional presentation today.

Among those moving forward, South Wales was up 13 to 614p, Northern 8 to 605p and Manweb 8 to 611p. Shares in international mining group RTZ came under pressure on weakening metal prices and after James Capel was reported to have downgraded profits estimates The stock lost 17 to 684p, with Capel said to have reduced its current year estimate by Pounds 15m to Pounds 375m. Worries ahead of the UK Budget in November about possible tax increases on tobacco were said to have been responsible for falls in several tobacco-related stocks. BAT Industries shed 9 to 485p and Rothmans International 'B' 11 to 635p. The broker profits downgradings in international conglomerate Hanson earlier this week, in the wake of the continuing strike at Peabody, its US coal operation, continued to exact a toll. The shares ended 4 1/4 lower at 249 1/4 p. Volume was 6.5m. Royal Bank of Scotland shares were once again boosted by speculation that the bank was planning to float off its Direct Line Insurance business. They rose 8 to 324p.

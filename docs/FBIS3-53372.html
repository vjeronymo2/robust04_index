			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Brothers" page] </F>   [Text] The AL-INQADH AL-WATANI newspaper reports that  Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir has issued a decision  granting Sudanese nationality to some 1,000 Copts living in  Sudan. The newspaper says al-Bashir gave these instructions  during his meeting with a Coptic delegation led by Bishop  Daniel, head of the Coptic Church in Khartoum. The newspaper  quotes al-Bashir's allegation that the government serves all  Sudanese, regardless of their religions and creeds!! Several  thousand Copts and Christians live in Sudan. They originally  came from Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and other Middle East  countries.    The al-Bashir government has recently come under heavy  criticism because of its continuing persecution of Christians in  the south and the escape of over 100,000 northern Christians to  Western states.</p>

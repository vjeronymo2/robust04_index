			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Thatcher storms back to campaign fray - Philip Stephens sees the former prime minister relaunch the Tory bid for a fourth term IT WAS NOT a day for subtleties. Behind in the opinion polls, the team running Mr John Major's general election campaign needed all the help they could get. So Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the leader the Conservatives had unceremoniously dumped, was re-enlisted to back her successor's cause. Their joint appearance at a gathering of candidates in London was not a panic reaction to the opinion polls. It was agreed weeks ago that the party needed a public display of unity to heal the remaining wounds among its activists. Few guessed then that her re-emergence centre-stage would coincide with a relaunch of the Conservative campaign in an abrasive style much more suited to her political image than to Mr Major's. After 16 months of caring Conservatism designed to distance Mr Major and his colleagues from their predecessor, it has taken 10 days of uncertain campaigning to persuade them that the way to win the election is Mrs Thatcher's way. Labour must be branded again as the party of socialists and pacifists, Mr Neil Kinnock as the unprincipled, untrust-worthy leader who will say anything to get his hands on the levers of power. An electorate turned sullen and resentful by the poll tax and economic recession must be persuaded - as in 1987 - that Labour's tax and spending plans would rob them. So, as Mr Major and Mrs Thatcher sat on the same platform, cabinet ministers who began long ago to speak of her in hushed, embarrassed tones, were promising to harness again her aggressive campaigning style. Mr Chris Patten, never 'One of Us', listed her achievements in such glowing terms that many in the audience must have wondered why she was not still prime minister. 'Margaret's government,' the party chairman declared, 'transformed Britain in the 1980s. And no one should ever forget that.' Mrs Thatcher lived up to herself. In a passionate denunciation of socialism, Brussels and much else she dispelled any lingering suspicion that she might like to see her colleagues punished by a Labour victory. There were faint jibes at her successor - she feared the 'enormous detail' in his manifesto might obscure the important issues and reminded him that it was vital to keep a grip on public spending - but nothing that could be branded disloyal. Instead she promised her 'most earnest endeavour' in the campaign, declaring: 'Everything we have gained could so easily be lost unless we are returned for a fourth term under John Major's leadership.' The prime minister took up the same theme. In a speech delivered in unfamiliarly harsh, and occasionally angry, tones, he decried the 'socialist stone age', the 'politics of envy' and the 'calculated malice' of his opponents. Mr Kinnock was mocked by name as party managers abandoned the earlier plan to keep Mr Major above the fray. It was the approach demanded by the newspapers sympathetic to the Conservatives, which yesterday lambasted the party's approach as weak and directionless. It was one that had Mr Norman Tebbit ready to praise a campaign team of which he had previously been dismissive. 'At last they've stopped putting tranquillisers in his (Mr Major's) tea,' he said. Mrs Thatcher will not be here to see it through until April 9. Her aides said yesterday that she would be going ahead with a long-planned tour of the US during the last 10 days of the campaign. Nor are all in the Conservative camp convinced that the aggressive approach which fires party activists necessarily wins the votes of waverers among the electorate. But Mr Major's team promised to press ahead on the same tack until polling day. And few caught the unintended irony when one strategist promised that today it was Mr Michael Heseltine's turn to be let loose on Labour.</p>

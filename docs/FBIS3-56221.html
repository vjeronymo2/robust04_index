			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Provided no changes are made in the schedule of  U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Belarus, the President  will fly to Minsk on 15 January along with his wife Hillary and  daughter Chelsea. Guests are always shown what is best,  although this will not be an easy task given the fact that the  Clintons' visit will last only a couple of hours. As is known,  Hillary and Chelsea Clinton have plans of their own during the  visit. The President's daughter will attend a demonstration at  the State Choreography College, while his wife will visit the  Opera and Ballet Theater. She will be accompanied by our  Republic's first ladies -- Irina Shushkevich and Alena Kebich.  They will exchange souvenirs at the opera, after which Hillary  Clinton will meet with artists.</p>

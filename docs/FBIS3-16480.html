			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir </F> Zhirinovskiy by Moscow correspondent Dmitriy Prokofiev outside  the Russian parliament; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Prokofiev] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, you say that you  will be the next president of Russia, but recent polls give you  only 6 percent of the vote.    [Zhirinovskiy] The polls are rubbish. Before the elections  they said Zhirinovskiy would hardly make the minimum required  quota, but I won. The press publishes those polls because it is  paid to do so. It is paid to do me in. However, nobody will do  me in, and I will destroy them all.    [Prokofiev] Who is paying and who wants to destroy you?    [Zhirinovskiy] The mafia wants to do me in, because I will  exterminate it the day after the elections, when I become  president of the state. As soon as I enter the Kremlin, I will  issue a decree to exterminate organized crime.    Ten thousand gang leaders will be arrested and executed in  public ceremonies. That is what I will do to them. So, the  mafia is afraid and is paying for this character assassination.    And you, the journalists, publish it. You are turncoats.  You are constantly inciting. And then you are surprised when a  journalist disappears here and another is murdered there. If  you go on inciting and slandering, everybody will start killing  you off.    [Prokofiev] Are you sure you will become the next president  of the state in spite of what you call the incitement and  slander against you?    [Zhirinovskiy] No doubt about it. There are no other  candidates. If elections are held this year, I will get 55  percent of the vote in the first round. If the elections are  held in two years, then all the better. By then I will be 50,  the voters will give me a present, and I will probably get 70  percent.    There are no other candidates. There simply are not. All  the politicians who are identified with the government do not  stand a chance because they are responsible for the poverty,  inflation, and organized crime. A genocide, that is what is  happening here. Sexual deviation and death throes.    The health minister says there are fewer abortions now. Sure  there are less. After all, almost all the women who can still  have abortions have already emigrated from Russia. That is what  the current regime has done.    And, there is nobody in the opposition who the people know  as  well as they know me. When I visit the Russian countryside,  people kiss my hands. They truly overwhelm me with their  kissing.    They know I am the only one here protecting the rights of  the  Russian people. Nobody believes the libel you spread about me,  such as that I am a fascist, a Jew hater, and whatnot.    The name of my party is the Liberal Democratic Party. So, I  am a liberal and a democrat, and cannot be either a fascist or  an anti- Semite. [passage omitted]    [Prokofiev] So, you do not have any problems with the Jews?    [Zhirinovskiy] There are no problems. I am neither an anti-  Semite nor a Zionist. That does not interest me at all. Many  Jewish journalists claim that I am anti-Semite, but that is only  because the mafia pays them off. Other journalists claim that I  am a Zionist, and they are also paid by the underworld.    [Prokofiev] You also said that the CIA pays.    [Zhirinovskiy] Sure, the CIA pays. The Americans do not  want Russia to have a strong and intelligent leader who will  take care of national interests. But they will fail. Everybody  will fail, I will be the next president, and Russia will triumph.</p>

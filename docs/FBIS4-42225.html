			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Excerpts from new book, Rudolf Scharping, the SPD, </F> and Power (Chapter 1), by Thomas Leif and Joachim Raschke:  "The Scharping System--Loyalties Must Be Cultivated: On the Work  Methods of Rudolf Scharping, Minister-President of  Rhineland-Palatinate and Chancellor Candidate of the SPD"]    [Text] Exactly how does Rudolf Scharping,  minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate, party chairman of  the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany], and chancellor  candidate, engage in politics? Who advises him and who belongs  to his closest staff? What does his political style look like?  In the Rororo Aktuell book Rudolf Scharping, die SPD und  die Macht [Rudolf Scharping, the SPD, and Power], Thomas  Leif and Joachim Raschke describe the "system" of government  between Mainz and Bonn. We document from the first chapter of  the book that is being presented in Bonn today, Monday, by  Joschka Fischer and Peter Glotz.  <H5>  The Scharping System: Knowledge Is Power </H5>   "It is noteworthy that Rudolf Scharping looks at the trees  before he expresses himself on the state of the forest. This is  a special talent, and I know no other person who stores so much  detailed knowledge and does not thereby lose sight of the main  idea and the concept." This respectful assessment comes from  Edgar Meister, former Hesselbach consultant, manager in the BGAG  [expansion unknown] trade union holding company, and banker and  subsequently finance minister in Scharping's cabinet. Since the  end of 1993, Meister has belonged to the Bundesbank board of  directors. By the way, the other cabinet members likewise have  more than mere respect for the enormous storage capacity of his  memory. They often fear Scharping's "weapon of knowledge."    Dieter Kretschmer, chairman of the German Federation of  Trade  Unions in Rhineland-Palatinate, goes even further: "He scrapes  the knowledge from your mind," he admits. "Afterwards he knows  everything down to the last period and comma." Of course he is  "very late" in deciding and considers everything quite  thoroughly. When in an important question for the trade  unions--the shifting of the labor jurisdiction from the Social  Affairs to the Justice Ministry--Scharping gave in to the  pressure of the FDP [Free Democratic Party] in the coalition  talks, and the trade unions lamented that they were not asked,  Scharping answered tersely: "Why should I? After all I knew  that you are against it." This was a succinct and clear rebuff  from the lonesome ruler, who can build on an unusually high  level of authority. Scharping's squad of ministers has always  remained loyal to "godfather." As soon as someone departs even a  little from the prescribed course, he is caught and brought back  into line.    Juergen Zoellner, his friend and science minister, has  observed a typical work characteristic of Scharping:    No one can deny his steadfastness and ability to get things  done. "In many situations, he gives the impression of being  single-minded, of concentrating only on a very specific area or  object, but he thereby takes in all of the surrounding  circumstances. At these times, his interests and focal points  often appear unorderly, but then his strategic thinking suddenly  reveals itself in the end."    The pattern of his work techniques cannot be recognized  "until it is done." "When it is past," Zoellner repeats this  somewhat mysterious-sounding concept. But the science minister  assures that "there is no conceited striving by Scharping to  prove himself in the competence issue."    Scharping stresses his competence only when it really seems  necessary to him. But then--experienced ministers report  sorrowfully--he can also expose colleagues pitilessly in the  presence of everyone.  <H5>  Scharping's Government Office </H5>   Under Bernhard Vogel, the government office in Mainz was  more  of a sedate agency: loyal party soldiers in the ancestral land  of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] found a quiet living  here at the end of their careers. The critical signs of a  decline of the CDU in the late 1980's and early 1990's were not  even realized here.    Scharping misses no opportunity to praise the loyalty of  these CDU officials. Almost as a sign of his appreciation, he  continues to entrust Winfried Scheidt with recording the minutes  of the cabinet meetings. The chief of Central Department 1, an  old driver of the CDU, knows all the details about the  government but keeps his silence. Two other department heads  likewise still come from the old team. Beyond that, the  so-called SPIEGEL consultants who look after the individual  ministries are almost without exception "Vogel people." But,  just as in other laender affected by changes in the government,  the important department heads were assigned deputies from the  SPD, who are supposed to guarantee smooth proceedings in the  government headquarters. The slogan that comes down from the top  is this: "Establish loyalties in the control centers and do not  switch people." That leads only to unrest.    Dr. Karl-Heinz Klaer, chief of the government office, has  accomplished his administrative masterpiece with the  reorganization of Department 4.    Klaer, beginning in 1983 as office manager for Willy Brandt  and subsequently steeled by "four years of penal company under  Jochen Vogel," has put together the brain-trust for Rudolf  Scharping here. Together with the department head, Dr. Gerd  Mielke, an effective team was assembled within two years, one of  the largest policy departments in the realm of the ministerial  bureaucracies in the laender. The formula for success: very  diverse talents from almost all disciplines work hand in hand.  Also included are two new consultants, who know how the party  functions internally. Dr. Rainer Frank, formerly deputy business  manager for the Social Democratic Working Team for Municipal  Policy (SGK), and Peter Gruessner, consultant for Bundeswehr  questions in the barracks, know the mainstream of the SPD and  feed their experiences into Scharping's land politics. Their  greatest soft spot is for professionally prepared and  intelligently staged trips of the minister-president to the  districts.    Karl-Heinz Klaer, a cheerful sort from Saar-Rhine, is a  constant headhunter, Wherever he encounters people whom he  considers capable in some area, he collects their calling cards.  So far he has been fortunate in selecting the staff members,  probably also because he does not let himself be put under the  pressure of time. Scharping and Klaer are 100-percent adapted to  each other and can always be reached by each other. The chief of  the government office manages in the background, keeps a line of  retreat open for Rudolf Scharping, organizes the circle of state  secretaries on Monday afternoons, and clears up possible  conflicts in advance that could possibly disrupt the cabinet on  Tuesday. To be sure, he pursues his hobby of media politics but  otherwise avoids the public quite consciously. Klaer "makes  relatively few outside appointments, reads everything quite  carefully, does an unbelievable amount of talking with various  contacts, and takes charge of the communication in the house,  which is often missing in the immediate surroundings of  Scharping," according to the internal view.    Klaer, who loves detailed and precise notes in his black A5  "Cri-Cri" books with a red back, enjoys professional respect and  sympathy: "He never has anyone on his heels," report those  working for him, who emphasize his team capability and  single-mindedness.    Several of his close staff members sometimes come to lunch  in  the office and always convene once a week. Above all,  appointments are coordinated in the weekly working meetings.  Besides Klaer and his adviser Martin Stadelmaier (former  barracks), the minister-president meets together with office  manager Friedhelm Wollner (likewise Scharping's schoolmate and  former colleague of Dietrich Sperling), head secretary  Marie-Luise Fricker (formerly a secretary in the SPD  parliamentary group), and Heike Raab. Scharping's secretary, a  former staff member of Ralf Walter, a young member of the  Bundestag from Rhineland-Palatinate, is truly the "personal" one  in the team. She is the practical one in the background,  organizes the correspondence, writes texts, and schedules  appointments. She thereby maintains an overall view even in  hectic situations.    Scharping's extraordinary capability is based not least on  the effective help of his staff members. Because Scharping works  16 hours a day, "one cannot expect more commitment from Rudolf,"  say without qualification all those who work closely with him.    Karl-Heinz Klaer, who loves the work in the system, is  extremely loyal. Both of them, the minister-president and the  chief of the government office, "tick the same." There is no  place for frictional losses and no need for kitchen cabinets.  Klaer fulfills a critical condition to be allowed to work for  Rudolf Scharping: they have known each other for years. They sat  together in sociology seminars in Bonn. The present office  manager Friedhelm Wollner, a very close confidant of Scharping,  was also with them.    Rudolf Scharping had first arranged a job for the man from  Saarland in 1971 as a reader with Luchterhand. For this he  utilized his contacts in the aspiring circles of young social  democrats [Jusos]. The contact became closer when Klaer--lured  away from the University of Kassel--worked at the SPD  headquarters beginning in 1983. As early as 1986, Klaer was of  the opinion that Scharping ought to join the party executive  board with the support of Willy Brandt but Rudolf Scharping was  not yet willing to compete against Willi Rothley, one of his  adversaries within the party and currently a deputy in the  European Parliament. He was thereby giving himself more time.  When Klaer took over the important "politics" department in the  barracks in 1987, he remembered his friend and procured  "something very nice for Rhineland-Palatinate" in party  projects. The Saar-Palatinate axis was finally forged in its  final form during the Berlin party congress in December 1989.  Many--such as the present office manager Friedhelm Wollner--who  really work closely with Rudolf Scharping look back on similar  experiences. Klaer knows the formula: "One must cultivate  loyalties." Wollner and Klaer are living examples of opposites.  The one is as busy as a bee routinely managing the daily  business and sees to it that no mistakes are made--an effective  gatekeeper, who also takes the initiative in subjects that may  be important later on. The other basically deals with things in  the long term and thinks conceptually into the more distant  future. Scharping gathers around himself the "extremely contrary  types," can deal well with the conflict configuration, and can  even make productive use of it. He draws his impulsive strength  and dynamic force from this tension.    Rudolf Scharping grew up as a group politician. He worked  his  way up in the SPD of Rhineland-Palatinate as an individual  combatant with a great deal of perseverance. For this reason,  his terrain is not primarily the public. It is the party  committees. This learning experience results in a certain amount  of resentment against modern forms of political deliberation and  great speeches and daring concepts drafted on the intellectual  drawing board.    Scharping, who is not yet utilizing the full capacity of his  staff members, is seen by them as a "diligent, competent, and  unobtrusive team player," who is "extremely power-conscious,"  however, while thereby always seeking the "rational and  reasonable decision." In any case, he is "one who can give  himself time." The minister-president can "kneel into" themes  and then "draw from a cornucopia of well-processed knowledge."  The positive assessment of his work style is that he is "no  martinet" who "takes out his defects on others."    It is not an easy matter to advise Scharping, because he  often knows as much as the advisers themselves. It is even more  difficult to advise him with respect to his appointment  calendar, for Scharping tries to deal fairly with all questions.  But Karl-Heinz Klaer and Friedhelm Wollner have recognized the  problem and insist that Scharping be spared too many unimportant  matters.    In accordance with his soft spot for groups, Scharping has  found his own method of political consultation in nonpublic  circles of experts. At this level of consultation, he  deliberately organizes intellectual opposition in the debate  about questions of the future. With respect to the subject of  "incidental wage costs," for example, he had Professor Walter,  chief economist of Deutsche Bank, go against the Darmstadt  economist Bert Ruerup behind closed doors. Ludwig Zachert, chief  of the BKA [Federal Office of Criminal Investigation], argued  with the president of the Duesseldorf police about large-scale  eavesdropping. The deputy Swedish minister for immigration and  Dieter Oberndoerfer, the liberal-conservative Freiburg political  scientist, lectured on international streams of immigration. Pro  and contra positions meet each other in internal conferences on  "traffic and mobility" or the controversial subject of the  negative tax/public money.    In such circles, where no one "is on stage," Scharping  always  follows the same pattern. He brings experts together with the  important representatives of interests with respect to  particular subjects and with the ministerial bureaucracy. He  does not make a big fuss about these meetings but uses them for  effective internal opinionmaking. Once Scharping, who tends to  make decisions by himself, has decided on a position, there are  then just two maxims for action: "decisiveness" and  "uniformity." This is the "pure pragmatism" that the chancellor  candidate counts on and swears his staff members to.  <H5>  Rhineland-Palatinate--Model for Bonn? </H5>   Scharping has also introduced his Rhineland-Palatinate work  style in Bonn. In the "barracks," he meets on Mondays in a small  group with federal business manager Guenther Verheugen; Wolfgang  Clement, chief of the government office in North  Rhine-Westphalia; Lafontaine's subordinate Reinhard Klimmt;  Karl-Heinz Klaer; and, when needed, some department heads in the  SPD executive board.    This circle of his personal advisers preplans the election  campaign and prestructures the work of the SPD Presidium, for  what is discussed here is also done. Important discussions are  moved here first, and to this extent the presidium is  functionally controlled.    When Scharping made Guenter Vergeugen, the former general  secretary of the FDP, his federal business manager, it was clear  to him that someone was taking the office who suits him. He is  no visionary but a professional tradesman, a sober citizen  rather than a charismatic. Upon taking office, the business  manager of the SPD, who was also supposed to rise in the  parliamentary group, wanted to "put the SPD in a position where  it is worthwhile to take part in the elections." Rudolf  Scharping could also formulate his self-understanding as a  "streetcar staff" this way: "In the practice of politics, you  spend the largest part of your time establishing the  preconditions that allow you to take political action at all. To  gain majorities requires the second largest amount of time. The  time that is then left for you can be used for concepts."    The analyst Verheugen praises "the tremendous activity" and  "unbelievable presence" of Scharping, whose character portrait  appears different to him than it does to some others: "His real  qualities are learned only by those who are permitted to work  with him for a longer time--his self-irony, for example, and his  tremendously witty, pithy, and funny talent for expressing  himself, which comes so easily for him." The thing that  Verheugen most appreciates about his chief, however, is his  leadership style: "He leads intimately and coordinates closely."    Also with the support of Verheugen, who left the SPD  parliamentary group as parliamentary business manager, Scharping  was able almost overnight--"with no public spectacle"--to take  over the "community of independent speakers" [GUS] (Verheugen  means the SPD parliamentary group). Once again Scharping was  fortunate.    A "power vacuum" had arisen around the rather ineffective  chairman Hans-Ulrich Klose, which no one was filling. The  parliamentary group was accustomed, however, "to being led  strictly. Moreover for the deputies the power in Bonn had never  been as close as at the time of their (re-) installation in the  election districts." Scharping took advantage of this  situation and enthroned himself, with no resistance from Klose,  the shadow foreign minister, as de facto chairman of the  parliamentary group. The influence of the party chairman and his  opportunities to present himself externally were thereby  expanded and his forces were concentrated. Verheugen loves this  form of inconspicuous disciplining: the parliamentary group  "presently perceives the leadership with tight reins as hearty.  The people sense that self-acquired substance is there."    When important appointments are pending in Bonn, Scharping  spends half the week there, pursues his favorite activities, and  "carries on talks into the night." With success, for the quiet  takeover of the parliamentary group was anything but child's  play.    But it is clear to Scharping that the unity cannot last. It  is no accident that it came to a dispute in the SPD about  compensation in the question of nursing care insurance, when he  had to cure a case of the flu at the beginning of March 1994.    Conflicts such as this between Rudolf Dressler, the chairman  of the SPD's Working Association for Employee Questions (AfA),  who is close to the trade unions, and Oskar Lafontaine, the  postmodern deregulator, will flare up again and again: in  pension (cutting) policy, social policy, and, in general,  finance policy. Scharping's principle of strict limitation of  expenditures in the event that they take over the government  collides with greediness in finance policy in the left wing of  the party.  <H5>  Profile of Scharping's Program </H5>   Peculiarities in the biography, learning experiences,  successes, and failures determine the long-term goals and  orientations not only of top politicians. The subjective access  to social-policy formulations of the problem determine the  program profile of a politician. Hence the theme of political  scientist Hans Buchheim also applies to Rudolf Scharping:    "Ultimately the person orders all the content that he knows  and all the experiences that he has, not in accordance with  objective, but rather with personal criteria: in accordance with  his biography, intentions, concerns, and state of health....  Therefore, the overall order of reality present in the  consciousness of the person is organized not objectively but  personally." It is also true for Rudolf Scharping that "politics  is an interaction that serves only to form personal relations,  namely the definition of the common situation of all members of  a society.... It is not a matter of what is, but of how what is  is interpreted."    Following this theme, it is illuminating in the  clarification  of fundamental positions to measure persons and policies against  the specific practice rather than against somewhat nebulous  explanations and nonbinding theoretical papers.    A characteristic example of such practice was the strictly  secret coalition negotiations with the Greens and the FDP in two  middle-class hotels in Rheingau in the first half of May 1991.  After initial exploratory talks on 25 April 1991, Scharping, the  SPD chief, achieved parallel talks with the Greens and the FDP.  It was a strategically ingenious coup, for until the end he was  able to leave both partners in the belief that serious  negotiations were under way with them and the respective other  party. That produced in both of them a pressure for success that  could only benefit him and thereby helped him to put through his  standards for the coalition talks--"a maximum amount of social  democratic content" and a "maximum amount of dependability," as  is noted in the confidential minutes of the Greens on the talks.    It was thereby clear from the outset for him and the leaders  of the negotiations for the SPD that the meeting with the Greens  involved "sham negotiations," as top people in the SPD now admit  privately. But there are some negotiation leaders of the SPD who  stubbornly dispute this assessment. They insist that their  decision situation was open. Scharping negotiated for 70 hours  with the Greens and produced almost 100 pages of minutes. In the  end, his list of differences from 14 May 1991 essentially agreed  with his letter on 29 April, in which he had presented to the  Greens--in advance--the secret predetermined break points of the  negotiations in the form of three pages of questions.    But at the core it was a matter of the "maximum amount of  dependability." Parliamentarian Scharping could imagine this  only with the liberals. The background of the SPD's policy of  differentiation from the Realo-Greens in Mainz that Scharping  had practiced even in opposition times was probably that he  considered the new parliamentary force to be superfluous. His  statement that "We ourselves are green," is meant quite  seriously. With the rise of the Greens, which occurred parallel  to Scharping's political career, the pace of his career was  first slowed. The habits of most Greens also displease him. He  also maintains strict distance to Green female politicians such  as the top-realo Gisela Bill, who possibly could also work in  the Working Association of Social Democratic Women (AsF),  because he perceives fundamentalist tendencies in her. Only land  parliament deputy Manfred Seibel, a printer from Hauenstein near  Pirmasens, is accepted by the Social Democrats, although he  frequently represents strongly leftist positions. But in his  "bourgeois" bearing and in his work style--he likes to read  files and like Scharping is sometimes brilliant with details--he  corresponds to the established parliamentary habits of the SPD.    In an internal and still unpublished memorandum, the Greens  have summarized common opposition experiences, the intensive  coalition negotiations, and the results from two years of  government by the SPD-FDP. The comments therein on Scharping's  personality profile cast a glaring green light on the SPD  politician, who comes from the same generation as the Green  politicians in the parliamentary group. It is a picture marked  by lack of understanding and by distance:    ``Scharping's stiffness corresponds to his dispassionate way  of pursuing politics. It is difficult to find deeper convictions  in him. Accordingly, fundamental statements from him--government  statements, for example--are colorless and without any vision,  as boring as the business reports of companies. He very much  loves the enumeration of specific technical problems and  possible solutions, as if to demonstrate his competence. The  derivation of causes and the attempt at a social-policy analysis  or the corresponding evaluations are not his thing.    ``Scharping provides nothing on further reaching problems  even in Rhineland-Palatinate, such as the development of rural  areas, the future of agriculture, the distressed viniculture,  and sick shoe industry, or postal and railroad reform, or he  just gives prepared ideas from the conservative drawer. When  Greens present alternative concepts here, one always hear the  charge of `unrealistic' from Scharping.    ``On complex themes such as economic growth as opposed to  ecology, the exploitation of resources, the problems of carbon  dioxide, gene technology, unfair world economic order, and  impoverishment of the Third World, there are no conceptual  initiatives from Scharping. He either stays with superficial  phrases, or he prefers to omit such themes entirely.    ``Such rather one-dimensional ways of perception qualify  him,  on the other hand, to his first nationally observed appearances  for the SPD when it is a matter of the pragmatic checking off of  issues with the conservatives--in the compromise on asylum just  as in the negotiations on the solidarity pact.    ``Smug portrayals are highly developed with Scharping. He  understands the language of rhetoric on problems nearly  perfectly. Compromises have no reverse side for him. Criticism  of his politics or person is never justified at all.    ``After all of these experiences, it is not very likely that  Scharping's heart will begin to beat vigorously on the left or  that he will develop an ecological awareness.    ``We must, however, be prepared to see Scharping make some  surprising leaps in his uncurbed drive for power and that he  will suddenly take on ecological and social questions. But it is  more probable that Scharping will seek his chance in the  cultivation of his conservative image, his `technical  competence' and his `dependability,' etc.''    Despite this tough criticism, in the final passage one can  hear what even the Greens admit privately. If the majority  relations were to point to red-green and not allow any  alternative government formations, then the chairman of the SPD  would also work with the Greens for the sake of power. He will  then use the 70 hours of coalition talks with the Greens in  Rhineland-Pfalz as a store of experience.</p>

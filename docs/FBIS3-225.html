			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cape Town March 1 SAPA--The Transitional Executive  Council [TEC] has resolved that the R[rand]90-billion housing  plan announced by Housing Minister Louis Shill should be  suspended until the controversy about the matter has been  settled, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio  news reported on Tuesday [1 March]. The Council could not agree  on another resolution, which among other things asked for the  minister's action to be condemned.    Democratic Party negotiator said Mr Shill should be allowed  to explain his position before such a resolution could be  accepted. African National Congress [ANC] Secretary General  Cyril Ramaphosa said the housing scheme was still under  discussion at a multiparty level within the housing forum.    Mr Shill was summoned to appear before the TEC at its next  sitting in Pretoria to answer questions from the Council and the  National Housing Forum.    The ANC, the ANC-aligned SA [South African] National Civic  Organisation and the National Housing Forum have said the  minister's announcement was unilateral and "blatant  politicking". The announcement had damaged the process of  achieving concensus on housing subsidy policy and thereby  delayed the delivery of housing. By announcing an "incomplete"  housing guarantee scheme, long and sensitive negotiations  undertaken to bring the banks into the delivery of low income  housing might also now be jeopardised, they claimed.</p>

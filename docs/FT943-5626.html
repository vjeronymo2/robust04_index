			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: World timber shortage hitting British sawmills A worldwide shortage of timber is pushing up prices for logs in the UK and leading to supply problems as sawmills struggle to secure their raw materials. Many British sawmills are trying to run their plants at double shifts to cope with the increase in demand, but are having difficulties obtaining logs. The Forestry Commission reported a 9 per cent rise in the price of standing timber in the six months to the end of March as demand picked up when the economy began to emerge from recession. The commission also said that softwood log prices increased by 16 per cent in the year to the end of March. 'We've almost certainly seen prices higher than that in the past five months  -just judging from the timber we've sold,' said Mr Martin Wilkinson, forestry operations director at Tilhill Economic Forestry, a division of Booker, which manages 12 per cent of the UK's private woodland. The UK, which ranks the eighth largest consumer of wood and wood products in the world, produces only 14 per cent of its own requirements domestically. Its import bill for logs from Canada, Scandinavia and Russia among other suppliers amounts to nearly Pounds 7bn. But imports are dropping off after reaching a peak in 1989 as environmental concerns world-wide restrict the harvest of natural forests. The value of timber imports to the UK has declined from Pounds 10bn in 1989 to Pounds 6bn in recent years. In addition, growing consumption of wood in many developing countries has led to fewer exports. Mr Ian Mosley, president of the Timber Packaging and Pallet Confederation, said makers of wooden pallets had seen their wood costs increase by 20 per cent over the past six months due to shortages. Pallet makers are in competition with the construction industry and fencing manufacturers for tight timber supplies. 'Pallets play a vital part in Britain's export drive. This timber shortage will make the export drive falter and higher pallet prices could make exporters less competitive in foreign markets,' Mr Mosley said. As more British tree plantations reach maturity, the UK is expected to become more self-sufficient in wood production - it should be able to supply 27 per cent of its needs by 2010. Mr Wilkinson expects timber output in Britain to reach a peak in 2025 when production should touch 20m cubic metres a year, but by then demand will have grown from a current 55m cubic metres to 75m cubic metres. The government recently introduced a new incentives package for landowners to plant commercial trees, but Mr Wilkinson believes it is insufficient to compete land for agriculture - the value of which is buoyed by European Union subsidies. 'There is a lot of agricultural land which is eminently suited to growing conifer trees, if farmers were given incentives to plant trees on set-aside land, we could grow a lot more wood than we do now,' he said. Trees need to be planted now for harvesting in 30 years or otherwise many plantations will reach their peak and then output will drop off.</p>

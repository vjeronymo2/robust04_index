			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Guidelines issued for derivatives operators Far-reaching guidelines for UK corporate users of derivatives are published today in the wake of a succession of write-offs inflicted by interest rate swaps and other complicated financial instruments. The Association of Corporate Treasurers argues that companies must guard against 'the failure to implement and operate controls at a very basic level' that typically lies behind the worst losses. That was the fundamental danger, Mr Derek Ross, chairman of the association, said yesterday. He downplayed the role of complex products such as 'swaptions' and 'captions' that have taken much of the blame for losses. The association, the professional body which groups together corporate treasurers and finance directors from the UK's largest companies, laid responsibility with top management. The statement on best practice says: 'Strategies, policies and procedures . . . must be clearly agreed by senior management and at least endorsed by the board of directors.' Nine tenths of companies state in surveys that they use derivatives to hedge rather than to speculate, but the association argues that 'hedging' is too ambiguous a concept to be sufficient as a policy statement. The initiative comes in response to a procession of corporate setbacks. MG Corp's oil futures positions cost Metallgesellschaft, its German parent, more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m). Procter &amp; Gamble and Gibson Greeting Cards of the US are both suing Bankers Trust after interest rate swaps went wrong. UK companies have escaped the latest wave of reported losses and some executives argued that the media and politicians, particularly in the US, have over-reacted to derivatives. There is no problem.' Most controversial for less intensive users of derivatives is the recommendation that companies establish 'an independent risk management function' separate from treasury and dealers.

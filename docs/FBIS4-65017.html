			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Marina Vikha from Gjirokaster] </F>   [Excerpts] According to evaluations of the Greek minority  in Albania, the policy that the Albanian Government--especially  President Sali Berisha--will follow in the near future is to  continue its provocations in the form of statements or  provocative acts that will be blamed on "Greek terrorist  organizations."    The same sources clarified that "while the Albanian people  depend on Greece for financial help, Berisha and his environment  depend politically and economically on foreign centers that do  not want Greek-Albanian relations to improve. On the contrary,  these centers would benefit if relations deteriorated."    It is especially significant to look at the interpretation  of  Berisha's policy toward Greece. "What the Albanian president is  really afraid of is not the Greek minority in Albania, but that  the vast majority in southern Albania--Greeks, Albanians,  Orthodox people, and Muslims--has its eyes turned toward Greece,  is learning the Greek language, is trading in drachmas, and is  living peacefully." This is what concerns the Albanian  Government, a government that during its two years in power has  nothing to show for it other than dictatorship, terrorism,  political persecution, censorship, offensive talk against  opponents, and financial corruption. For such a government to  survive, it needs to exaggerate foreign danger--Greek danger--to  revitalize its national conscience and avoid the opposition.    Albanian Government officials already believe that under  this  possible scenario that has been implemented with foreign  guidance, Berisha foresees--if his policy of slanting "the  foreign danger of Byzantine Greece" succeeds--that the  opposition will join with the government and form a "government  of national unity that will deal with the foreign threat."  [passage omitted]    Albanian opposition and Greek minority officials believe  that  it is urgent to strengthen relations between them because both  groups are being tried by the Albanian Government's dictatorship  and their human rights are being violated. If the Human Rights  Party does not realize its real role of defending the human  rights of the minority and the Albanian people, then it is in  danger of being isolated and falling into the trap set by the  Albanian Government. [passage omitted]    The Greek minority party Omonoia will give a news conference  in Tirana to say that "the Albanian people and the Albanian  political parties must be informed of the organization's real  positions so that they do not become an object of exploitation  by third parties that do not want Greek-Albanian relations to  improve."</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Japan hints at cut in car exports JAPAN indicated yesterday it was likely to agree to a furtherreduction in its car exports to the European Community, as a result of a fall in EC new car sales which has proved much steeper than expected. 'We have not refused (the EC approach); we are listening to it. We have not closed our ears,' an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said, following three days of talks in Brussels which ended without formal agreement. During the talks, the European Commission asked the Japanese delegation to reduce the 1.09m exports envisaged for this year in the 'understanding' governing access to the EC market during the Community's transition to an open market in new cars by the end of the decade. Japan agreed in April to reduce its car exports by 9.4 per cent on the basis of forecasts that the EC market would decline by 6.5 per cent to around 13m units this year. The Commission now expects a fall of between 11 and 16 per cent. New car sales in western Europe as a whole were already down 17.2 per cent between January and June and, in its latest forecast, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association predicts that demand will be down by 15.8 per cent for the year as a whole. Without further reductions, Japan's market share would rise to 'substantially' more than 13 per cent this year, compared with less than 11 per cent in 1992, the EAMA warned yesterday. The Japanese position has been that, while Japan recognised the fall in demand in the EC car market, revising a formally agreed quota after only three months would undermine the credibility of the bilateral agreement. It was only agreed in April after months of wrangling. Japanese car exports to the Community, however, have already fallen sharply, according to Mr Robert Verrue, chief EC delegate to the talks - down in the April-June period by about 30 per cent.</p>

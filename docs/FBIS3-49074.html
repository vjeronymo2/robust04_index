Following the speech of HDZ  President Mate Boban concerning the political and security  situation and the negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  committee declared themselves in favor of a persistent seeking  of a peaceful solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but  also ordered all the bodies of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna to do everything for a successful defense of the  Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna from aggression.    The political declaration of the HDZ was also adopted at the  session, in which it is stated that "the HDZ is the main and  almost the only political force of the Croatian people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina," and that under its leadership, "the  Croatian people have managed to defend from the Serb, as well as  the Muslim, aggression most of the populated territory, thus  gaining the right to the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, which  has a vital and strategic importance for the Croatian people."    The HDZ supports the "providing of an equal status of the  Croats and the other peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croat  republic of Herceg-Bosna, in the union of republics of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, a democratically organized Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna that will guarantee and secure all the rights and  freedoms to every citizen," the integral city of Mostar as the  capital of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, the protection,  improvement, and security of all the rights of the Croats as  "the precondition for stopping the eviction of the Croats,  securing the return of the refugees and displaced persons," and  also "the building of firm principles of protecting the Croats  who remain outside the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna on a  reciprocal basis, regarding the rights of the other two peoples  in Bosnia-Herzegovina."    Among the decisions listed in the declarations, it was  stated  that the HDZ will continue to support the ending of the war  through political negotiations, the protection of the rights of  the Croatian people and just peace, and, in cooperation with the  international community, a permanent political solution for  Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially on the basis of the latest  initiative of the European Union and the peace initiative of the  president of the Republic of Croatia, Dr. Franjo Tudjman, on an  equal basis for determining the rights of each of the three  peoples: Croats, Muslims, and Serbs, especially on the basis of  territorial demarcation. The HDZ considers unconditional  observance of the international war and humanitarian law, the  disclosing and punishment of war crimes, regardless of who the  perpetrators are, and the free passage and delivery of  humanitarian aid on the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina  to be obligations no one can be exempt from. The HDZ will  retain its political influence through new forms of  organizational solutions and appointments of new people, as well  as improving the political unity of the Croatian people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and implementing the tasks contained in the  program through political activities.</p>

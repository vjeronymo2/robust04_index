			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (2): New business difficult to find - The contract hire and leasing industry has been shrinking THE UK's vehicle contract hire and leasing industry has been shrinking in the recession. The most spectacular example of rationalisation has been provided by the T Cowie group which in November snapped up the Royal Bank of Scotland's loss-making Royscot subsidiary for Pounds 38m. Cowie also snapped up the assets of Centre Contracts, previously part of the John Martin car retailing group in Edinburgh, for about Pounds 300,000, and Ringways Contract Hire in Leeds for Pounds 2m. Several other small contract hire companies are up for sale because they find it almost impossible to make a living in present market conditions. All this might bring problems for their clients. Dozens of small companies elbowed their way into the contract hire industry in the late 1980s when business was booming. Many of them based their prices on the car residual values being achieved at the peak and they are feeling real pain today because most residual values have remained flat for nearly two years. One contract hire company which was approached recently by a number of smaller rivals said an analysis of the residual values of the cars on their books showed that 'if we took on those companies, we'd lose fortunes'. Accountancy in contract hire being what it is, most companies can 'roll forward' their mistakes in assessing residual values - as long as new business keeps coming in. Unfortunately for them, since Britain's car-buying boom ended dramatically in 1990, new business has been hard to find. 'The industry is very short of new business and it is very hard to make a living as a small contract hire company,' says Mr Roger Macey, chairman of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association and a director of Commercial Union Insurance's FMM Group. Competition is incredibly intense, he says, 'and contract hire prices are not going up as they realistically should'. The lack of new business is not a total disaster, of course. It means in most cases that customer companies are simply extending the life of individual contracts and keeping the vehicles longer, typically for four instead of three years. This brings some headaches for the contract hire company. Maintenance costs are bound to rise as cars get older and high-mileage cars are very difficult to sell. Mr Macey points out: 'The irony is that manufacturers are making cars that are more reliable and will last for at least 80,000 miles. But people don't want to buy a car with 80,000 miles on the clock.' Mr Macey says some of the newer contract hire companies grew up in the 1980s and assumed that new car prices would continue to rise, pulling used-car prices up with them. 'But for the past 18 months residual values have been absolutely flat. The gap between new car and used car prices is becoming wider and wider.' A simple example of the impact on the industry is as follows: a company bought a car three years ago for Pounds 10,000 and assumed a residual value in 1992 pounds of Pounds 4,500. In present conditions the car is unlikely to fetch more than Pounds 4,000, thus all profit on that particular contract is eliminated. Mr Macey points out that, because contracts usually run for three years and as the industry's most recent glory days did not end until 1989, there are still two years of painful financial results to come through. At the same time, even if, as many predict, the UK new car market picks up in the second half of this year, the improvement will not make itself felt on contract hire companies' balance sheets until 1995. He also warns that the industry must not assume car prices will rise steadily through the 1990s. There are a number of important factors in the offing which are likely to conspire to keep a lid on UK car prices. These include the report on car pricing by the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission which has just been published and which the Trade and Industry Secretary is at present mulling over. Meanwhile, the European Commission is urging harmonisation of taxes and the UK government might well pay heed. The UK-based car producers have certainly been campaigning hard for a reduction in the total tax on new cars. Then in 1995 the so-called 'block exemption' given to the car makers by the European Commission comes to an end. This is the system which enables them to have exclusive dealer networks - the Commission previously considered that it was in the public interest, particularly when it came to the safety that comes from having cars serviced properly, for these exclusive dealer networks to continue. If the Commission changes its mind, car retailing in Europe will undergo a massive shake-up. As for customers, most hire contracts contain clauses which enable users to 'escape' should the worst happen and the contract hire concern go into liquidation. However, previous experience suggests that users suffer when contract hire companies get into trouble. For example, if a contract hire concern does not pay its maintenance and repair bills on time, the impact is felt by its clients. Client companies lose the use of their cars if the vehicles are kept off the road when the contracted garage refuses to do the necessary repair or maintenance work because its bills have not been paid. Mr Robert Blower, T Cowie's corporate communications manager, says that already contract hire customers are putting much more emphasis on the financial stability of potential car suppliers when choosing between them. 'Last year was very damaging for contract hire companies and 1992 will be even worse for many in the industry, particularly those which rely on car residual values for their profits,' he says. Cowie is not dependent on residuals for profit, he points out. 'We compete on quality of service, not price.' Overheads are kept to a minimum. For example, at the time of the takeover, Royscot had 83 people looking after 6,000 cars while Cowie had 250 for 55,000. 'This enables us to make money while others are losing it.' Cowie's three acquisitions last year has taken the total of vehicles it has on hire to corporate clients to more than 60,000, making it by far the largest business of its kind in the UK. Mr Blower says the takeovers came only after Cowie completed extensive research and found that 'the contract hire industry has a good future'.</p>

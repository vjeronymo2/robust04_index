			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Delors challenged on projects European Union finance ministers yesterday mounted a challenge to Mr Jacques Delors, the outgoing Commission president, by refusing to endorse the use of additional borrowed funds to pay for multi-million-Ecu cross-frontier transport projects. Mr Delors has argued that without extra capital raised by the Union, most of the 14 ambitious infrastructure projects may not get off the ground. But ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday agreed that funding for each project should be tackled on a case-by-case basis using only private finance, national exchequers, loans from the European Investment Bank and designated EU funds. The ministers' recommendations will be presented to the Essen heads of state summit later this week. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

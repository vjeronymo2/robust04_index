			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICHAEL CRAWFORD TO RETURN TO 'PHANTOM' ROLE;  </P> <P> THEATER: THE ORIGINATOR OF THE TITLE ROLE IN 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' WILL  RETURN TO THE AHMANSON ON DEC. 31 TO PLAY THE PART AGAIN FOR AT LEAST THREE  MONTHS.  </P> <P> A big New Year's Eve party is being planned for Michael Crawford fans in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> The originator of the title role in "The Phantom of the Opera" will return to  the part at the Ahmanson Theatre on Dec. 31 for a run of at least three months.  </P> <P> The original Phantom left the show with a grand flourish on April 29, after  1,070 performances in London, New York and Los Angeles. He donated three pairs  of house seats at his April 29 performance to charities; the top bidder paid  $27,500 for a pair of seats at what was billed as his final bow.  </P> <P> But now it appears that it wasn't so final.  </P> <P> When Crawford left the role, he was planning on starring in the film version,  with shooting scheduled for the fall. However, shooting of the movie has now  been delayed until next summer.  </P> <P> In a statement issued through a spokeswoman, Crawford said he is "delighted to  have the opportunity to return to the Los Angeles company . . . Due to the  delay in filming the movie version of the Phantom, it is now possible for me to  do this. I've missed all my friends at the Ahmanson very much, and can't wait  to see them all again."  </P> <P> Four North American companies of the Andrew Lloyd Webber maxi-musical are  reportedly selling nearly $3 million worth of tickets each week.  </P> <P> When Crawford left the Ahmanson, he was replaced by Robert Guillaume, whose  contract expires Dec. 30. Asked on Thursday how Guillaume felt about the return  of Crawford, Guillaume's manager Hillard Elkins quipped, "He (Guillaume)  couldn't have picked a better guy to go in and follow him."  </P> <P> Does that mean Guillaume is ready and willing to leave the role?  </P> <P> "Enough, already," replied Elkins. "He's going to go out and make some money."  He added that while Guillaume was "delighted" to have played the Phantom,  "there is a reason why the producer (of 'Phantom') is a millionaire and Michael  Crawford is just a rich guy."  </P> <P> Elkins said a television project featuring Guillaume is being assembled at  Disney.  </P></p>

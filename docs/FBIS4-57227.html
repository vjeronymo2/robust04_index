Late this afternoon, the president will again  meet with the ministers of strategic sectors to review the  decision on the Army presence at Federal Police facilities.    During last night's meeting at Planalto Palace, the  president, the military ministers, Justice Minister Alexandre  Dupeyrat, and Federal Administrative Secretary Ronaldo Canhim  analyzed the Federal Police strike for two and a half hours.

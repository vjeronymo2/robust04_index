			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOYNIHAN URGES SOCIAL SECURITY TAX CUT, RETURN TO PAY-AS-YOU-GO BENEFITS SYSTEM  </P> <P> A key senator Friday advocated cuts in the Social Security payroll tax that  would save 130 million workers and employers a total of $62 billion during the  next two years.  </P> <P> The proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (Y.) would cancel a 0.14% increase  in the levy scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1 and would lower the rate by an  additional 0.96% for workers and employers in 1991.  </P> <P> Moynihan, who as chairman of the Senate Finance subcommittee on Social Security  is in a crucial position to advance his plan, said that it would put the  retirement system back on a pay-as-you-go basis instead of amassing trust fund  surpluses exceeding $200 billion in the coming decade.  </P> <P> "The Administration is content to see the budget deficit gradually eliminated  by the growing Social Security tax revenue," Moynihan said at a news  conference. "This . . . perverts the original purpose for the surpluses -- to  provide for the retirement of the baby boom (generation) in the next century."  </P> <P> The trust fund concept was adopted in 1983 to accumulate reserves in advance of  the huge demands expected on Social Security when members of the baby boom  generation born after the end of World War II begin to retire in the early part  of the next century. But Moynihan and others said that the huge surpluses have  been used instead to mask the size of the federal deficit. Without the  surpluses, Congress and the Administration would have to make more drastic  spending cuts or generate new revenue to meet deficit reduction targets.  </P> <P> "We can no longer tolerate the use of Social Security surpluses to finance,  say, B-2 bombers or a capital gains tax cut," he added.  </P> <P> The deficit for fiscal 1989, Moynihan said, would be $204 billion instead of  $152 billion if the Social Security surplus had not been counted. Congressional  Budget Office projections show the Social Security surplus rising to $236  billion in the year 2000, virtually concealing a deficit of $268 billion in  other government transactions.  </P> <P> Although there is strong support in the Senate for excluding the trust fund  surpluses in calculating the budget deficit, President Bush has opposed any  change in the current accounting system. He is also expected to oppose  Moynihan's proposed cut in the payroll tax because of revenue losses estimated  at $7 billion next year and $55 billion in 1991. The fate of the proposal is  difficult to predict.  </P> <P> The 7.65% tax -- including 1.45% for Medicare, which everyone pays -- will be  imposed next year on both workers and employers on all earnings up to a cutoff  of $51,300, with a maximum tax of $3,924 for each.  </P> <P> Moynihan contends that it is unfair tax policy to rely so heavily on a payroll  tax that allows no deductions and takes the same percentage from everyone  regardless of their ability to pay.  </P> <P> "The United States almost certainly now has the most regressive tax structure  of any Western nation," he said. "This is so because the Social Security  payroll tax -- which is decidely regressive -- has come to make up an  increasingly larger share of total federal tax levies."  </P> <P> About three-fourths of all wage-earners, he said, will pay more in Social  Security taxes in 1990 than they will pay in federal income taxes, which are  more geared to the ability to pay.  </P> <P> Under the legislation that Moynihan will introduce when Congress reconvenes in  late January, an increase in the Social Security payroll tax to 7.65% from  7.51%, due to take effect Monday, would be repealed.  </P> <P> If the 1990 tax is held at the 1989 rate of 7.51%, the savings for those paying  the maximum would be about $72. In 1991, those earning more than the estimated  maximum wage base of $54,300 would pay about $600 less than they are scheduled  to do if the law is unchanged, Moynihan said.  </P> <P> Starting in 1991, the tax rate would be lowered to 6.55% under the Moynihan  plan.  </P> <P> With the changes, Moynihan said, the nation's basic retirement system would  revert to financing on a pay-as-you-go basis -- or setting the tax rate at the  lowest level needed to produce enough revenues for current benefits.  </P> <P> "This approach will eliminate the current regressive financing of the budget  deficit, while keeping Social Security on a sound financial basis," the senator  said.  </P> <P> Robert J. Myers, who was chief actuary of the Social Security system for nearly  a quarter of a century, has advocated a return to pay-as-you-go financing, the  method used for decades to provide payments to beneficiaries.  </P></p>

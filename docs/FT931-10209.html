			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Brussels tries to forge steel rescue plan: Call to cut over-capacity upsets Spain but gets cautious welcome elsewhere EUROPEAN Commissioners yesterday began the sensitive task of preparing a draft rescue plan for the ailing European steel industry, after getting a cautiously positive response from steelmakers to a Commission report on over-capacity. But the report by Mr Fernand Braun, the EC's 'steel envoy,' immediately ran into trouble in Spain, where the government's long-standing attempt to restructure its loss-making, state-owned steel industry is threatened. Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert, responsible for competition policy, met senior executives of the EC's largest steel manufacturers in northern Belgium on Monday night to discuss the report. Mr Braun has concluded that steelmakers could cut capacity by up to 25.8m tonnes in crude steel and 17.9m tonnes in rolled products. '(The steelmakers) have said the Braun report is very positive and very constructive, and they confirmed, more or less, the range (of capacity cuts),' said one senior Commission official yesterday. Both Mr Bangemann and Mr van Miert insist cuts in capacity are essential if the industry is to get Community aid for the 50,000 redundancies likely as a result of restructuring. The Commission must come up with detailed proposals for a meeting of EC industry ministers on February 25. In Madrid, the government is shocked that Spain is called on to provide almost 50 per cent of the proposed overall cuts in rolled flat steel capacity when it produces just 6 per cent of the Community's output. As Madrid sees it, Mr Braun's recommendations call for a total capacity cut of 3m tonnes in flat products, of which the Spanish contribution will be 1.3m tonnes. Madrid may have only itself to blame, for just under a year ago it unilaterally forwarded a plan to Brussels that outlined a cut in its steel output from 6m tonnes a year to 4.5m tonnes. In return Madrid wanted permission to implement subsidies for a Dollars 5bn restructuring plan. The Spanish plan ran aground in October when the EC Commission told Madrid it should either write off more capacity or trim the subsidies. Meanwhile, steel unions, mainly based in the politically volatile Basque country, demanded more subsidies for smaller cuts. Mr Braun's report has made the government's position still more uncomfortable. Elsewhere, leading European steel companies welcomed the Braun report but were not prepared to say individually whether they had offered any capacity cuts. Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steel maker, finds the commission report 'positive,' according to a group official. 'Now we must follow it through to the end,' he said. The French company argues that Commission policing of closures must measure actual falls in production rather than theoretical cuts in capacity. 'It is very much up to Brussels to find a means of regulation,' the official said. British Steel said Monday's meeting with the Commission was 'useful and positive'. The Commission, it said, was 'clearly cognisant of the problems facing the industry and intends to take action to facilitate the restructuring.'

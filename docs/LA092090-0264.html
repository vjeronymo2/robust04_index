			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> LITTLE RICHARD GETS A BOULEVARD  </P> <P> Good golly Miss Molly! Little Richard is going to be on the road for a long  time!  </P> <P> The Macon City Council voted Tuesday to name a road after its local hero.  </P> <P> The Little Richard Penniman Boulevard beat other suggestions to honor the  flamboyant rocker, such as "Tutti Frutti," one of the singer's biggest hits.  </P> <P> Little Richard Penniman Boulevard had been known as simply the "downtown  connector." Penniman is Little Richard's surname, which, after some debate, the  council decided to include in the street name.  </P></p>

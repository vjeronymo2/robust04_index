			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Antonio Martino by Rodolfo </F> Brancoli in Rome; date not given: "Martino: No Adventures in  Foreign Policy, We Are Loyal to Europe"]    [Text] Rome -- The international offensive by the  Berlusconi government is to begin in Brussels, a sort of  "operation information" which is the absolute priority of  Italian diplomacy. A wave of telegrams sent from the Foreign  Ministry will make all the ambassadors who represent Italy in  the EC countries converge on the Belgian capital Sunday [15 May]  so that they can agree with Minister Martino on what should be  said and done to begin restoring an image which, at this time,  could not be any worse. The next day the minister is to meet  with [EC Commission President] Delors and take part in a meeting  with his colleagues, even at the price of sweeping aside the  planned statements by the president of the Council. "It is  essential that we quickly make it understood that we do not  intend to renounce Italy's European vocation," said Antonio  Martino in his new office on the second floor of the Foreign  Ministry. Soon afterward, there will be a visit to Washington.  The objective is to complete the "clarification" before the G-7  summit, which is to start on 8 July in Naples and which will  mark Silvio Berlusconi's grand international debut. There is  not a lot of time, and no Italian Government has ever been so  gripped by distrust and reservations.    [Brancoli] Minister, how will you be impacted by making a  debut at the head of the Italian Foreign Ministry in such a  climate?    [Martino] It is certainly a difficult time, for objective  reasons and also for reasons having to do with our image. We  must make it quite clear to both international public opinion  and our allies that the radical change in our political system  does not mean discontinuity in the basic lines of our foreign  policy. Foreign policy will be characterized, above all, by  continuity. I do not mean that nothing will change, but I do  mean that the basic lines will stay the same.    [Brancoli] Good, but I think that your interlocutors will  ask  you first of all for other explanations and other guarantees. I  do not need to remind you of how the government of which you are  part was received, or of the alarmed questions that were raised.    [Martino] I would say that our country has turned a page in  its history and adopted a more modern electoral system which  will force us to change the attitude toward what were once  considered extreme attitudes, and as such were marginalized. I  would then say that we need to look at the government program,  which nobody can honestly say is a right-wing program. The same  program by the National Alliance was drafted by people who have  nothing to do with, I would not say fascism, but the Italian  Social Movement.    [Brancoli] The NEW YORK TIMES -- and it is not the only one  -- wondered whether there is a risk of contamination.    [Martino] That is mistaken. It does not make sense to talk  about contamination. In our elections it is true that the Left  was defeated, but is not true that the Right won. I would  explain that Forza Italia, the authentic novel element in this  coalition, draws its inspiration from the great liberal  tradition, occupying a central position in the old scheme of  things. I would also underline the importance of the change  made among politicians.    [Brancoli] The FINANCIAL TIMES feels that the new government  has a "worrying lack" of experience.    [Martino] We have already experienced expert politicians,  and  it was not a good experience.    [Brancoli] Meanwhile, however, friendly and allied  governments are discussing the "Italian case," and there is even  talk of a cordon sanitaire. Do you not fear isolation?    [Martino] Honestly no. I do not fear it because the picture  is a mixed one. There are governments which have shown that  they understand what is happening here in Italy, and the press  in some countries has been much more articulate in its judgments  than in other countries. We are also taking account of the  electoral climate for the European elections, which causes  political people in some countries to make strong affirmations  for domestic purposes. I feel that when we will come out of  this, the climate will change, and naturally we will not be  sitting there hand in hand. This image problem is the first  thing.    [Brancoli] There are also problems of substance. For  example, your position on the Osimo Treaty [on borders with the  former Yugoslavia] will take on symbolic importance for  understanding who you are.    [Martino] Among all the members of the pole of freedom there  is absolute agreement on some points. First, the borders will  not be touched. Second, we have no intention of just throwing  out the treaty. Third, there are bilateral problems which can  be tackled calmly, without creating a big drama. As a supporter  of laissez- faire, I have always loathed the borders.    [Brancoli] Let us move on to Europe. You are described not  only as a "Euroskeptic," but even as anti-EC.    [Martino] Do you think it possible that the son of Gaetano  Martino could be anti-European?    [Brancoli] I will quote [French Socialist Party Secretary  General] Rocard for you: "It is not enough to say that you  support Europe. You have to say which Europe you support."    [Martino] He is right. But we know that we can also agree on  what Europe must do. The point is how do we achieve it.  Choosing a mistaken strategy means, in actual fact, creating  anti-European sentiment, and thus meaning that we do not achieve  it.    [Brancoli] You, for example, criticize the strategy of  monetary unification.    [Martino] That is nothing new. I feel that after what  happened in September 1992, with the de facto collapse of the  European exchange rate mechanism, defending the strategy of  European monetary unification would be the same as defending a  problematic position against all evidence to the contrary.  However, this does not mean that I am against the European  currency -- just as I am not anti- European when I criticize  excessive intervention on markets. I would like to reiterate  that an excess of directives creates an impression among the  people that Europe is just another level of regulation  superimposed on national regulations. The reaction of rejection  is visible.    [Brancoli] I will quote for you a question asked by LE  MONDE:  What will be the European policy of Berlusconi's Italy?    [Martino] It will be a convinced and active policy in favor  of a political Europe, something which is absolutely necessary.  Europe must find a way of speaking with a single voice only in  matters of foreign policy. It must also achieve a common  defense. The United States, among others, has asked for this  because it realized that the pax americana is an illusion.    [Brancoli] How would you reproach previous governments'  European policies?    [Martino] My criticism would mainly be that they did not  allow our presence in Europe to be up to the level of Italians'  enthusiasm for Europe. There was also a widespread perception  in the political class that the power was only at national level  and therefore our presence in the institutions could be  entrusted to people with a low political profile. At the same  time, paradoxically, the idea prevailed that Europe is the  solution to all our problems, when it is actually the opposite  that is true. We have to solve our problems independently of  our membership in Europe, knowing that if we fail to solve them  we will become incompatible with the other member states.    [Brancoli] For many years now there has been very broad  agreement about our foreign policy. How much value do you  attach to maintaining it?    [Martino] A lot of value. In fact, I have already had  contacts with members of the opposition. Our foreign policy  must aim to serve the national interest. It is also important  that the main lines are understood and shared by the greatest  number of people possible. It seems to me that there are  conditions for a foreign policy based on a broad consensus.    [Brancoli] Judging by the debate, it would seem, however,  that your arrival in the government has swept the issue aside.    [Martino] I believe that when we get down to work, if we  manage to keep the channels of information open with all the  political forces, we will manage to extract foreign policy from  the guerrilla warfare of ordinary politics. Naturally, there  can be differences of opinion on individual points: We cannot  follow a policy which is the weighted average of the opinions  prevailing in parliament. However, the general lines can be  broadly shared.    [Brancoli] One condition is that you do not end up isolating  Italy in the decisionmaking bodies.    [Martino] Both of these are linked. If we have an  authoritative, credible, and acceptable foreign policy, then we  will also have the chance to give it prominence in international  organizations. This is a new Italy. It has turned a page. It  will surprise a lot of people.</p>

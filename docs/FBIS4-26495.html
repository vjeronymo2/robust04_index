			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of  the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said here today that China  attaches great importance to developing friendly ties with the  Republic of Gabon.    Li, meeting with Edmond Nkogho, president of Gabon's  Economic  and Social Council (ESC) [name and title as received], and his  party, said there have always been good relations between China  and Gabon, and between the CPPCC and ESC.    The group's visit will serve to further exchanges between  the  two countries in economic, trade and other spheres, Li noted.    China, while engaging in large-scale economic construction,  needs a stable and harmonious domestic situation as well as a  friendly and peaceful international environment, Li said.    Only under these conditions can China focus all its  attention  on economic construction and develop exchanges and cooperation  with other countries, Li said.    Nkogho said Gabon desires to further its friendly ties of  cooperation with China.    Speaking highly of China's achievements in reform and  opening  to the outside world, Nkogho said that Gabon, which is also  committed to economic development, is willing to draw on China's  experience.    Nkogho and his party arrived here on June 20 at the CPPCC's  invitation.</p>

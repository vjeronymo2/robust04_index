			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: Bicycles speed up the pace Cost and conviction are boosting the bicycle beyond the automobile as the world's preferred mode of transportation, according to a recent study by the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental think-tank. Although there have always been more bikes than cars, 20 years ago it was universally assumed that the automobile would surpass the bike as the preferred vehicle. Between 1950 and 1969, world car output rose from 8m vehicles to 23m. Car companies prepared for large increases in production in North America, Europe and the developing countries. But oil price hikes and mushrooming car prices hit the car industry hard. Auto output in 1991 - 35m - was only slightly greater than the 31m produced in 1979. Bicycle production, 25m in 1969, surged with the environmental movement and doubled by 1973. The economic reforms in China pushed demand for bikes ever higher. Production increased there from 7m in 1976 to 40m by 1987. Last year, world bicycle output was nearly 100m. Lester Brown and Ed Ayres, authors of the study, urge more investment in bike paths and improvement in bicycle accessories. Densely populated industrial countries, like Japan and the Netherlands, have pioneered bike-rail commuting arrangements. Japan has built vertical bicycle parking facilities three-four stories high. Traffic congestion has led to growing use of bikes in both developing and industrialised nations. Messenger services use bikes through urban streets, as do fast-food companies. In the US, more than 100 police departments have bicycle squads. City officials, doing routine inspections or supervising public services, use bikes to reduce costs. 'Historically, bicycling has suffered from unfriendly streets and has not benefited from public initiatives nearly to the extent it might have,' the report said. 'Where initiatives have occurred, bicycles have thrived.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, March 25 (AFP) -- Cambodian King Norodom  Sihanouk is "worried" about his government's offensive against  the Khmer Rouge stronghold at Pailin and wants to see dialogue  re- established between the two sides, his foreign minister said  Friday.    Prince Norodom Sirivut, speaking after his return from  Beijing, where he visited the king, said Sihanouk was "in fine  form" as he recovered from prostate cancer surgery in the  Chinese capital.    King Sihanouk is "in good health," said Prince Sirivut.  Government sources said the king has seen his cancer reduced  "95.5 percent."    As for the Khmer Rouge, the prince said "We should not close  (?the door) on them. We have to give them the chance to return  to the international community" and Cambodia should avoid  "putting their backs to the wall," the prince said.    "We have tried the policy of the carrot, of the open door  and  then that of the stick, but now we have to allow the Khmer Rouge  the opportunity to come forward to talk," he added, describing  his discussions with the king.    He said Sihanouk was "a little worried" about the government  offensive launched on the Khmer Rouge base at Pailin, in  northwest Cambodia, earlier this month, and particularly about  the ability of Phnom Penh to keep control of the area.    "His concern is justified, and I therefore have messages"  for  co- Prime-Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh "about His Majesty's  thoughts on Pailin," Sirivut added.    He said China, an ally of the Khmer Rouge from 1970 until  the  Paris peace accord of 1991, "thinks it is not at all appropriate  to involve itself in a little war" against the rebel movement.    The dialogue between Cambodia's government and the Khmer  Rouges has all but broken down, as the guerrillas refuse to lay  down their arms and allow access to territory under their  control as called for under the peace pact.    The offensive on Pailin follows last month's battle for  another major guerrilla stronghold, the northern town of Anlung  Veng, in which the government suffered a major defeat.    King Sihanouk is expected to return to Phnom Penh on April 8  after visiting his long-standing friend, North Korean leader Kim  Il-song in Pyongyang, where he arrives on April 4 to celebrate  Kim's birthday.    Sirivut added that the king had reiterated his support for  Cambodian Finance Minister Sam Rangsi, who also visited the  monarch in Beijing.    Rangsi's clean-up of the economy and the friction it caused,  particularly with Thai investors, resulted in rumours that he  may lose his post.</p>

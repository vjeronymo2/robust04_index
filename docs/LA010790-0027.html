			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPEN HOUSE;  </P> <P> REMODELED MANHATTAN BEACH HOME TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE MATCHLESS VIEW  </P> <P> HOW DO YOU transform a warren of dark rooms into a light and airy house for an  expanding family? That was the challenge facing Culver City-based architect  Melinda Gray Payne when she began to remodel an oceanfront home on The Strand  in Manhattan Beach. The house -- actually a three-story building plus an  apartment over the garage in back -- had a matchless view, but it had been  poorly planned and divided in two by its previous owners. Payne's task was to  create a few spacious living areas and seven bedrooms for her client, a venture  capitalist with three small children and live-in help. "I want to know I'm at  the beach," the owner told her, "and I need to keep track of my family." So in  her renovation, Payne grouped the rooms coherently -- and allowed each to share  the view.  </P> <P> Payne began by stripping the exterior of its fake Spanish trim and removing the  tiled roof. That allowed her to raise the ceilings in the upper-story rooms  without changing the restricted height of the building. Then she remodeled the  facade, setting big oceanfront windows back behind the structural frame to  shield them from direct sunlight. That formed deeply recessed balconies, which  Payne enclosed with glass parapets to shelter them from coastal breezes.  </P> <P> To open up the rest of the house, Payne gutted the interior to fashion a  6,000-square-foot living space, which she pierced with two wells of light. The  circular core of the house embraces the entrance hall and a courtyard that  contains a pool and hot tub. The core is echoed in a circular light well that  rises from the living room through the master bedroom suite above. The two  cylinders suffuse every corner with light, contribute to the cross ventilation  that keeps the house cool and allow almost every room a glimpse of the ocean.  </P> <P> The children's bedrooms are separated from the master suite by both the  courtyard and a family room and are designed to delight the youngest members of  the household. The children's bathtub is in a lofty circular room tiled in  their favorite colors, and a hatch and slide link the rooms of the two older  children.  </P> <P> The master suite is a free-flowing space, with bed, bathroom, dressing room and  balcony occupying the four corners of a tiny interior courtyard.  </P> <P> This previously awkward house now has a pleasing sense of intimacy inside and  out, making this remodel an inspiration for the design of smaller structures as  well.

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELLO MUSIC BY JAMES LASDUN  </P> <P> You're visiting a castle. There's a lake,  </P> <P> A hill, a wood, gardens, a herd of deer,  </P> <P> And then inside, paintings of lakes and hills,  </P> <P> Mounted antlers, the cornucopian year  </P> <P> Carved in four oak festoons -- you're here to slake  </P> <P> A once-yearly thirst for the concentrate  </P> <P> Of irretrievable times. It doesn't work --  </P> <P> Like drinking to get drunk and staying sober;  </P> <P> The trees don't make a wood, that rain-pocked murk  </P> <P> Won't turn into a lake, you can't translate  </P> <P> These stones into a castle . . . Time to go;  </P> <P> The windows darken as you set off home --  </P> <P> Room after room, the blaze of chandeliers  </P> <P> Sliding away like honey from a comb,  </P> <P> Days out of a life, or any slow  </P> <P> Extinguishing of fire . . . Much later on,  </P> <P> Reaching a village with a puddled street  </P> <P> And wet bronze soldier, slowing down, you see  </P> <P> Framed in a window misted by the heat  </P> <P> Of a single lamp and her own action,  </P> <P> A woman playing the cello, all alone  </P> <P> In a plain room at a plain brass music stand,  </P> <P> But cradling rose-grained curves and scrolls of wood  </P> <P> Like something alive; one splayed-out, powerful hand  </P> <P> Trembling where her blood pulses into the tone  </P> <P> As she plunges and draws back the bow --  </P> <P> She seems incongruous in this dead place,  </P> <P> Its only light her own. You cannot hear  </P> <P> But you can see the music in her face,  </P> <P> Its ecstasies -- you see it now  </P> <P> And it's not a face you see, but a lake  </P> <P> Mottled like jade with lily-pads, dead leaves,  </P> <P> Gold in a silk-tailed swish scrolled through the black --  </P> <P> You climb a hill, and underfoot thick sheaves  </P> <P> Of wet grass furrow silver like the track  </P> <P> A finger leaves in velvet. Browsing deer  </P> <P> Move like a forest carpet come to life --  </P> <P> Split chestnut eyes, bare branches, wet red leaves  </P> <P> Dotted with melting snow, you catch a whiff  </P> <P> Of wild rose, then white battlements appear.  </P> <P> From "A Jump Start" by James Lasdun (W.W. Norton: $7.95, paper; 46 pp.;  0-393-30590-2).

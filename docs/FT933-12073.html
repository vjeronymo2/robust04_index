			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Inflation in Germany edges higher INCREASES in insurance costs and dearer bananas contributed to a further increase in western German inflation this month. Provisional figures from three main states, published yesterday, tended to confirm forecasts of a modest rise in the cost-of-living index. Most economists expect an annual rate of between 4.2 per cent and 4.4 per cent for all of western Germany to be ann-ounced later this week when the various state figures have been collated. Figures for June showed an annual inflation rate of 4.2 per cent. Early in the day, the stock market received a boost when Baden-Wurttemberg reported a rise of just 0.1 per cent in consumer prices over June. Traders speculated this might encourage the Bundesbank to cut interest rates on Thursday. But later details, showing price increases of 0.2 per cent on the month in North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse, raising annual inflation rates there to 4.1 per cent and 4.8 per cent respectively, were more in line with general forecasts. Economists suggested that the figures had already been allowed for in the Bundesbank's calculations and that the main question was how far the central bank felt able to move to support the French franc without compromising its reputation for firm resistance to inflation. Ms Ros Lifton at Nomura Research in Frankfurt found the decision 'hard to call', although a further 'encouraging' cut in the rate at which the central bank supplies wholesale funds to the market was possible. This 'repo' rate was set last week at 7.15 per cent, and any further cuts will be made known tomorrow. Deutsche Bank Research suggested there was a 60 per cent chance of a cut in the Bundesbank's key discount rate on Thursday. Deutsche Bank's Paris office said an 'unambiguous' reduction would take the pressure off the franc, although most observers believe the Bundesbank is more likely to continue its quarter or half-point cuts. High rents and service costs are still the main source of inflationary pressure, but an increase in taxes on insurance premiums, introduced on July 1, have also played a role. In North Rhine-Westphalia, statisticians noted that bananas, Germany's most popular fruit, are 30 per cent dearer than a year ago because the EC has forced Germany to buy from dearer suppliers.</p>

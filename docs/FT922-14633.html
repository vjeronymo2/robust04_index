			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (6): Investors react to free choice - Country Funds / Secondary Markets NOT SO long ago, international investors with a penchant for the emerging markets of Latin America found that the simplest - and in some cases the only - way to invest was through an appropriate country fund. Today, they have more freedom of choice. The number of funds investing in individual countries and in Latin America as a whole is increasing. However, some large institutional investors are shifting away from collective investments and turning to direct investment in the underlying equities instead, as more and more Latin American countries ease restrictions on direct investment and as the quality of research improves. In some markets, such as Mexico, investors can easily invest in the main stocks so fund managers say there is little point in using a country fund. 'There has been a change: the big investors are less preponderant (when it comes to funds) because some are buying stocks and bonds on their own,' says Mr Lincoln Rathnam, director of the Latin American group at fund managers Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark. The ability to invest directly in certain Latin American markets may have killed off demand for funds investing in those countries. For example, the fund management group Genesis decided to wind up its Brazil unit trust once it became easier to invest directly in equities there. However, there are still plenty of investors who do want to use a selection of diversified country funds to achieve a wider spread of investments. Mr Rathnam claims that the percentage of retail investors in country funds has increased as the markets become more accessible, and that some institutions continue to use managed funds as 'they can find it difficult to follow the markets'. The fact remains for some countries - Chile is a prime example - the laws governing investment by foreigners still mean it is easier to invest through a managed fund. Foreign investors who want to buy shares in Chilean companies have to set up a special fund. The initial capital is tied up for a minimum of three years and realised capital gains, interest and dividends are subject to a 10 per cent withholding tax. Mr Anthony Newsome, managing director of Genesis, says investors often see little point in setting up their own funds when they can choose from existing quoted funds investing in Chile. Mr Audley Twiston Davies, of Latin American Securities, whose Latin American Investment Trust was the top performing investment trust in 1991, points out that while countries such as Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Peru charge tax on investments, there is likely to be a trend towards lower taxes on investment gains. Again, such a move might encourage international investors to take the direct route rather than an open-ended or closed-end fund. While the Latin American markets were among the top performers last year, these markets remain very volatile and naturally this is reflected in the performance of the country funds. 'You can get tremendous upswings and downswings', points out Mr Rathnam. Indeed, Scudder's Brazil Fund showed a 68.3 per cent drop in capital in 1990 - which Mr Rathnam blames on the poor performance of the stock market - before gaining 131.1 per cent in 1991. The closed-end fund is now trading at a discount to net asset value of about 5 per cent. Such volatility can pose more of a problem for open-ended than for closed-end funds: if investors panic as the markets fall and want to redeem their units quickly, the fund manager must be able to sell the underlying investments easily. As a result, open-ended funds investing in this region tend to concentrate on the larger, more liquid stocks while closed-end funds have more freedom to buy small- and medium-sized companies for their portfolio.</p>

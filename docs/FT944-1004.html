			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Starmin to raise Pounds 5.8m in placing and disposal Starmin, the quarry products company, has announced a series of changes designed to ensure its survival. It plans to raise Pounds 2.48m in a placing and open offer, sell its Lovie activities for Pounds 3.3m, appoint a new management and undergo a capital reorganisation. It is issuing 401.8m shares at 0.75p with a 7-for-10 clawback. To enable the placing to go ahead the 5p shares are being split into 0.1p ordinary and 4.9p deferred. The Lovie quarry companies in north-east Scotland are being bought by Mr W Lovie, managing director of Starmin (Scotland), for Pounds 3.3m cash resulting in a book loss of Pounds 621,000. Starmin will concentrate on its landfill and aggregates business at Water Hall Farm in Hertfordshire and plans to change its name to Water Hall Group. In addition, the Starmin Pension plan is being wound up with the expected surplus of Pounds 200,000 being paid to the company. Lord Parkinson is to resign as chairman and be replaced by Mr Edward Weiss. Mr Stuart Larnder will become chief executive in place of Mr Michael Gurner. The sale and placing will cut gearing from 424 per cent at June 30 to a pro-forma 66 per cent. Starmin is in breach of its bank facilities. Its bankers have confirmed the avail-ability of the facilities until January 18 and have agreed to provide ongoing working capital for 12 months from the EGM agreeing the plans. However, the company warned that rejection of the plans would mean it would have to seek alternative financing.</p>

"He praised the new parliament's role as direct  representatives of the citizens" and emphasized that Italy "will  be able to be different and better, and that the differences  will not provide fuel for divisions," but "the right kind of  constructive spirit."    Rome RAI Televideo Teletext in Italian at 0906 GMT on 15  April reports that "Francesco de Martino, as the oldest senator,  opened the inaugural session of the Senate's 12th legislature.

This part of his speech was accompanied by grumbling  noises from where the Right was seated. He said: `It is not my  job to express political judgements about the outcome of the  vote,' but `I hope that in seeking out the new, our republican  history is preserved,' and the unity of Italy, above all."    Rome RAI Televideo Teletext in Italian at 0959 GMT on 15  April reports the result of the first ballot for the post of  Senate speaker as follows: The quota needed for the election to  go ahead is a majority of those with voting rights -- 164 votes.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Spadolini                             |156                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Scognamiglio                          |153                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Boso                                  |2                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |De Martino                            |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Miglio                                |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "The Dniester Area: A Front Without a Front Line. </F> There Is a Clear Sky Over Moscow -- for the Time Being...."]    [Text] The Dniester area is a corner of paradise.  Thirty-degree heat, freshened by the wind from the Dniester.  Early cherries and strawberries, masses of cucumbers, tomatoes  and all sorts of vegetables, at prices that are absurd by  Russian standards. The beautiful girls in short skirts attract  the gaze of the men around them like a magnet.    Peace    The war seems to be a thing of the past. Only the  gravestones  in the cemeteries in Bendery and Dubossary and the modest graves  right on the streets remind us of what happened here in 1992.  Then, at the time of the "summer military campaign," as  officials say, they laid to rest for eternity over 600 young  men, and 4,000 Dniester area inhabitants were maimed and wounded.    Since the war, begun exactly a day after the decision of the  Moldavian [Moldovan] Parliament on peaceful settlement of the  territorial conflict with the Dniester area, the PMR [Dniester  Moldavian Republic] residents have no very warm feelings toward  the Mircea Snegur country. The independence in hand, won with  Kalashnikov, is sacred. An independence so far unrecognized by  the world community.    The possibility of the renewal of military conflict, despite  the negotiations which have been going on with Moldavia  [Moldova], with Russia as mediator, for almost two years now, is  not ruled out. Moldavia is suddenly strengthening its Armed  Forces. The PMR is hurriedly forming its power structures.    The number of armed military men, special forces and state  security workers in Tiraspol is not a happy sight for a peaceful  person. According to our rough estimates -- we simply could get  no official information on this score -- the Dniester power  structures number close to 8,000-10,000 people, for a total PMR  population of 700,000. If one adds to this the 14th Russian  Army, stationed in Tiraspol, which by our calculations  constitutes anywhere from 12,000-13,000 persons, the armed  readiness of the region can easily take first place over other  similar spots.    The point, however, is not so much in the actual number of  people in camouflage. During the war, 15,000 barrels -- from  pistols to grenade launchers -- were seized from the 14th  Russian Army. Commander Aleksandr Lebed, on one side, and the  Dniester state authorities, on the other, signed an "Act of  Seizure." The fate of most of the weapons is unknown.    Meanwhile, the "material" existence of the ordinary, so to  speak, peaceful inhabitants of the Dniester Republic does not  evoke pleasant emotions: most of them receive below the  subsistence level. The average wage is somewhere around 120,000  "dniestrofiki," in the official version bearing the name  "suvoriki" (stamps with a picture of Aleksandr Suvorov are glued  on the old Soviet money). One of our Russian rubles equals 6-6.5  Dniester ones.    Poverty particularly graces the pensioners, who have a  pension with a maximum of 80,000 "suvoriki," with the average  subsistence minimum being 150,000. People with the physical and  mental potentials, and moreover -- links with the criminal world  (which, incidentally, long ago divided the Dniester land into  spheres of influence) engage either in so-called commerce, or in  general in things that have little to do with the law.  Homicides, theft, rackets, kidnapping people with a view to  ransoming them to the PMR -- are the order of the day.    In this situation too, over a period of actually  one-and-a-half years in the Dniester area, a conflict has been  flaring up, so far, thank God, on a verbal level, between the  leaders of the 14th Army and the headquarters of the Tiraspol  Garrison on the one hand, and the local state authorities on the  other. This is a conflict which at present has a good chance of  turning into armed confrontation.  <H8>  Ministers with Double Last Names </H8>   The internal enemies of the local authorities are Lt Gen  Aleksandr Lebed, 14th Army commander, and Col Mikhail Bergman,  Tiraspol commander. The leaders of the state authorities in  opposition are Vadim Shevtsov, chairman of the State Security  Committee, and President Igor Smirnov. In that precise order.  Other representatives of the "opposing sides" naturally take  part in the verbal "Mord-bashing."    The interrelations between them are so emotional that they  are far from parliamentary formulations. There are thousands of  people who are for both of them, though. The Dniester citizens.  Since almost the entire staff of the 14th Army and the Tiraspol  Military Headquarters are local residents.    Despite the two years that have passed since the war,  Tiraspol resembles a typically post-front city, with signs that  anarchy holds sway, an anarchy based on physical-firing power.  With a mass information media very clearly marked official,  whose methods openly resemble the "bright" repressive-stagnant  years. It is no trouble to pick up the lies, whatever the topic.  Lt Gen Lebed and Col Bergman can get a whole program out of  them. The former -- in the most modest expressions, on the  strength, apparently, of his special status, and the latter -- a  whole string of them. The Armenian newspaper SYN OTECHESTVA and  the television program "AsKET," reciprocate their feelings. The  court regularly hears suits brought by local leaders against  Mikhail Bergman -- in defense of honor and worthiness or for  slander. For some reason, though, not once has the colonel, who  is not loved by the authorities, been punished. In the opinion  of the Dniester authorities, Bergman is the man who provides the  sound for Lebed. The main arguments for public accusation of the  colonel: he has "outlived" two army commanders, has a summer  home and rose too quickly to the rank of colonel. De facto  --that is all.    Meanwhile, the accusations coming from the mouths of the  leaders of the Russian units are much more interesting.  Moreover, this is not a game of cat and mouse. It is  large-scale. Out in the open. "Do you know, where you have  landed?" Bergman says to us. "The mafia rules in the Dniester  area. There are a few people in the government who have been  convicted. Aleksandr Saydakov, minister of Local Industry, has  two counts, including one for motor vehicle theft. Vladimir  Yemelyanov, chairman of the United Strike Committee, was  convicted of illicit trading in state plates. The chairman of  the State Security Committee, now Maj Gen Vadim Shevtsov (real  last name Antyufeyev), is sought by Baltic authorities for "gay"  affairs when he was working in agencies in Riga. There are many  persons in the government who do not go by their real last names  -- in addition to Shevtsov, that same Matveyev, the former  Goncharenko, who served with Antyufeyev in Riga. There are  former KGB and GRU workers -- a lot of them. Gudymo, the present  minister of State Security, is on pension from organs of the  KGB. President Smirnov is a puppet, a habitual drunkard.  Moreover, a weak-willed one. Shevtsov has all the authority, and  he tramples the people under him: he makes compromises with many  people. For example, Smirnov's son, a State Security captain,  drives around in a car worth $48,000. The godfather of the local  mafia also gets around the same way. Everyone knows about this,  you realize, ours is a small town...."    The facts about Bergman have really turned out to be common  knowledge. Vadim Shevtsov, in a private interview with us,  stated that he had not just one, but five last names: "I was an  operations worker." The change in last name "is fully natural,  after all, I am in hiding." As for the mafia in the government:  "Bergman is a sick man." The convictions of the ministers --  well, there were some. "But after all, you can't begin life from  scratch." Are there any former members of the special organs  from Moscow among the republic's leaders? "You understand, after  all, people want to protect the Dniester area."    The more information we learned about the "state leaders" of  the Dniester area, the "warmer" our feelings grew. Valeriy  Litskay, the present minister of Foreign Relations, even in  1983, gave a signed statement to the Moldavian organs of the KGB  on cooperation, having become an agent using the nickname Oleg.  The minister of Foreign Affairs, as he calls himself, took this  historic action on the basis of the fact that he "as a patriot  of our Motherland, expresses his desire to cooperate with the  organs of state security in the matter of ensuring the interests  of the Soviet Union" (quotation from a statement to the KGB).    The personal file of another local leader -- Bolshakov,  known  in the organs of the KGB by the nickname of Agent Berzin,  personally sent by Mikhail Bergman to the Dniester ministry of  State Security, was suddenly lost in the course of a week, a  fact which V. Luchik, procurator general of the PMR, sorrowfully  announced.  <H8>  Modest Crime? </H8>   Right at the time of the war, the PMR president issued some  very curious documents. On the seventh day of the war, 25 June  1992, a presidential edict was issued "On Setting Up Republic  Administration of Foreign Economic Activity." Implementation of  the foreign economic activity of the Dniester region was handed  over to... a limited liability company, "Tri Plyus Ko ltd," of  the Ukrainian Republic. On the basis of which a Tiraspol branch  of republic administration for the above-named problems was to  be set up. Where did this currency favor to a Ukrainian firm  come from?    Another document, of the postwar days, is no less  attractive:  the "Act of Counter-Checking the Dispatch of Railcars from the  Rybnitsa Station by the Kvant Cooperative on 12 December 1992."  Some 307 cars of metal, steel and wire rods, addressed to Kvant,  arrived from the Cherepovets Metallurgical Plant. According to  the waybills. The goods were remolded by the cooperative into a  very cheap finished product called "arch modules" and were  immediately dispatched to the CIS countries and Bulgaria. A very  simple scheme for illegal sale of valuable metal.    Meanwhile, the power structures of the Dniester area are  being hit with very significant mix-ups. Of 46 criminal  investigators, 32 experienced officers "left." A whole company  of regular officers left the Dniester Special Service Battalion.  The other day, there was a rebellion in the Dniester, as they  say in Tiraspol. The reason was quite unique: a few days back,  the special service men had seized a group of one of the  representatives of the local mafia, Stas, who was literally  released there and then. For reasons incomprehensible to the  surrounding masses. The rebels were quickly sorted out, and the  battalion commander was immediately replaced.    The departure of the local workers of the power structures  for Bergman's headquarters is easily explained by the  "perpetrators of the celebration," themselves: revealing the  crime of homicide is actually tantamount to revealing the crime  of stealing chickens. Vadim Shevtsov smiles: "It is a pity I  don't have the documents on some of the workers right now. You  should take a look. The reason for the departure: at  headquarters they pay, after all, in Russian rubles, almost  twice as much as we do..."    The report of the Tiraspol GUVD, which we obtained from  President Igor Smirnov, is astounding: a modest amount of crime  and a 50-70 percent disclosure rate. In the words of Mikhail  Bergman and the officers retiring from criminal investigation,  the secret is simple. In the first place, the militia workers  were given a verbal order to cease serious investigative  activity. In the second place, there is a secret agreement with  the criminal groups on carrying out their "actions" and moreover  "stripping down" outside the limits of the Dniester capital. In  the third place, which is, perhaps, the most terrible thing --  many of the corpses fished out of the Dniester, despite the  degree of their decomposition, are written off to the war, and  the contemporary homicides, that the whole city knows about, are  for some reason not entered in the official reports of the GUVD.  Two days before we arrived, a businessman was killed by a bullet  in the head. An old man who was a witness is to this day in a  resuscitation ward. A short time earlier, another businessman  was killed in his motor vehicle and "at the same time," again, a  small child ended up in a resuscitation ward.    Like a living legend, the story goes around Tiraspol of how  two subdivisions of the power structure -- special service and  GB [state security] -- shot at each other. According to the  Tiraspol version, two policemen from Ukraine were tracking their  "own" criminal, who had decided to visit the charming land of  the Dniester. The special groups decided to take them all at the  same time. The result -- three "guests" and a few of their own  men were killed.    "You understand, we are just setting up our organs of law  and  order," Vadim Shevtsov told us.  <H8>  Power Is a Simple Matter </H8>   We were able to sense Vadim Shevtsov's power from personal  experience. Three days before we arrived, Viktor Petrenko,  director of the Tiraspol Motor Vehicle Service, was suddenly  arrested. His last name figured in a story with a "Lincoln,"  which had been standing idle on enterprise territory for several  months, and according to certain data, had been bought as a  present for President Smirnov who, for understandable reasons,  refused the latter. Petrenko, who was on friendly terms with  Smirnov, like one of the family, as they say, had access to the  government house, and in addition -- had MVD and GB certificates  and several models of weapons. He was taken on the way from the  local "White House" to the presidential car -- and what was  curious, escorted by Smirnov himself. Vadim Shevtsov, who  personally took part in this incident, described Petrenko's  behavior as a "violation of the conditions of a special  position," and of his own will placed him under administrative  arrest for a while... for 30 days. Just like the good old days  -- without a trial or investigation. Igor Smirnov kept modestly  silent.    Appearing on television on the subject of Petrenko's strange  arrest, on the third day of Petrenko's sojourn with vagrants in  a jail cell, Mikhail Bergman then and there "received" a whole  program from Dniester Radio. The radio reported that Bergman had  "resorted to such dirty tricks" that he had even thought up a  kind of arrest for Petrenko. In confirmation of its conclusion,  it cited the words of the motor vehicle service director's wife,  who had informed it that her husband, she said, had gone off to  Odessa and would be there for dinner. At this point, Petrenko  had not been there for dinner three times.    We received the answer to our question about Petrenko's  strange fate next morning: by decision of the Dniester Public  Prosecutor, he was released from the jail cell with the  admission that Vadim Shevtsov, director of the State Security  Committee, had violated his authority, since in Petrenko's  actions "there were no elements comprising a crime."    Vadim Shevtsov himself explained the occurrence with the  very  simple sentence: "This is our private matter."    The "private matter" resulted in the fact that during this  time, Victor Petrenko and his family, after thanking us for the  unexpected help, left the borders of his native land, in the  hope of finding a safe little town in a different region.    Aleksandr Lebed, laughing, evaluated what had happened: "It  is obvious. Shevtsov is simply showing his strength, to keep  Petrenko from saying anything unpleasant. Remember: Molotov's  wife stayed home, and Kalinin's wife too, so that their husbands  could walk on a short leash. Here, it is I, Shevtsov, who is the  master."    In a private conversation with Petrenko, we received a  similar response:    "Who is the boss in the city and the republic? Shevtsov?"    "Shevtsov."    "Can Smirnov count on his own guard in an emergency  situation?"    "No."    The presidential guard, which confirmed our suppositions, is  really subordinate to Vadim Shevtsov. Officially. He himself can  see nothing so terrible in joining all the state security forces  in the same hands.    Russia, it seems, has already gone through this. In August  1991.  <H8>  The "Special Feature" of Weapons -- Killing </H8>   No one can name the whereabouts of the thousands of gun  barrels that disappeared during the war. There are only local  disputes about one-and-a-half thousand barrels, removed from the  people "in the trenches," by military headquarters after the  war. Local authorities accuse Bergman of specially destroying  the registration log of the confiscated weapons, and "putting it  to his own uses." Meanwhile, as Aleksandr Lebed confirmed for  us, the situation was somewhat different: "The confiscated  weapons were turned over to the local commanders. After that a  special commission came to us for verification, and it even  included Col Yakovlev (I am his enemy No 1, he even passed over  Bergman). So they counted and recounted everything down to the  last piece. The commission signed the written statement. Only  then did I call out Col Bergman and say: put the statement at  the bottom of the safe, but destroy the registration log as not  assigned by the regulations. We created a special commission for  this and destroyed it."    So just where are these thousands of firing pieces now? When  will they surface? And whom will they kill and maim?    On the other hand, several hundred barrels with thousands of  cartridges have already surfaced: according to the assertion of  qualified Moscow authorities, they were already transported for  the opposition to Moscow from the Dniester area during the  October events of last year. As for the several dozens of  participants from this sunny republic, in the words of Vadim  Shevtsov, he bears no responsibility for them. Even though in  "identikit" pictures, sent from Moscow to Tiraspol, people  assigned to the same Dniester Special Service Battalion have now  been recognized. Their last names, positions and nicknames are  well-known.    In an interview for MK correspondents, Aleksandr Lebed  informed us of one "attractive" fact. Military headquarters has  documents according to which the Dniester Battalion sent the  following weapons to Gagauzia (Budzhak Battalion): AKS-74 -- 300  pieces, AKS-74u -- 50 pieces, 180 Makarov pistols, RPKS-74,  Dergunov sniper rifles -- 7 pieces, AGS-17 automatic grenade  launcher -- one, 100,000 ammunition units and 96 grenades.  "Nothing reached Gagauzia, as its spokesmen confirmed."    Vadim Shevtsov had contrasting information on this score.  Lebed sent the above-named weapons to Gagauzia. And they arrived  there.    We did not see either side's documents.    Trustworthy confidential sources in Tiraspol made it known  to  us that in September of last year, three Russian opposition  leaders were made a gift of three attractive Dergunov sniper  rifles, which make a very accurate hole in the forehead of the  desired victim at a distance of 1,200 meters. Their numbers: No  65347, No 84282 and No 66480. Vadim Shevtsov answered this  question: "I did not give any rifles to anyone."    The question was open for competent authorities in Moscow.    As for the Russian opposition, most of it shows open  sympathy  with the present Dniester authorities. Zyuganov, Makashov,  Anpilov, Alksnis, Baburin, Umalatova, Pavlov and others visit  Tiraspol on holidays and non-working days. Shevtsov thinks that,  if the patriots are drawn to the Dniester area, why not mix with  them? After all, other "leaders" express no particular desire to  visit Suvorov's corner....    For the "internal security" of the citizens of the Dniester  region, particularly in 1992-1993, those wishing them were  handed out weapons by the president's hand. This can be  explained by the need for independent defense against criminal  groups, since the organs of internal affairs have little power.  Let us note that this situation developed against the background  of the highly publicized shortage of weapons among the organs of  law and order.    In all, according to the available registration book, 900  barrels were issued to those wishing them. The Tiraspol Cotton  Production Association asked for seven TT pistols and got them.  Weapons are officially registered to the management of the  metallurgical plant, the small Olimp enterprise, the editors of  that same Dniester Radio, the directors of a metals structures  plant, and others. And naturally, to all the officials of the  republic -- "by virtue of the danger of their job."    In general -- it is all nothing. Some formulas resemble  anecdotes. For example, Galina Andreyeva, a political leader, is  permitted to carry a weapon only "if she has a weapon  available." They permitted the deputy of one of the firms "to be  issued one --." Pistol, rifle, and perhaps, machine gun? The  head physician of the Tiraspol Maternity Home got the "go-ahead"  for official registration of a personal pistol, but "supplying  the weapon is his problem" -- as the resolution says. Some  Dniester citizens are issued weapons from ... material evidence,  from specific crimes.    There is a special approach for ten executives in the  Dniester Government who hold the rank of ministers and deputies.  They were issued... Simonov semi-automatic carbines, which in  the stagnant times could be found only in the use of servicemen  of the former Soviet Army. A. Karaman, vice-president of the  Dniester area was distinguished more than anyone, in the sense  of armament. He has the use of six types of weapons: two types  of Kalashnikov automatic, TT, Makarov and Stechkin pistols  (actually submachine guns), and a Simonov semi-automatic carbine.    Some of the people presented with weapons are now taking up  permanent residence outside the boundaries of their beloved  Motherland -- more precisely, in the far abroad. And just where  the weapon itself is --remains only a guess, because the  registration book has no notes on its being turned over.    All these things, however, in the words of Mikhail Bergman,  are just the beginning. The worst is yet to come: "The Dniester  Army is now preparing for the next putsch in Moscow," says the  colonel. "Weapons are hidden throughout the villages, up to 800  barrels each in the same place. They are preparing to ferry them  to the Russian capital, where some of the barrels are already  concentrated. Forty-six people using assumed names have now come  to Tiraspol from Moscow. They are getting ready. A huge  slaughter is slated for the autumn in Moscow...."    Vadim Shevtsov expresses no particular desire to refute  Bergman and Lebed: "There are other people in the 14th." "There  is no doubt that specific forces are standing behind Lebed, and  it is generally known that he is a friend of Grachev and makes  use of the army commander of the moment," the director of the  republic's State Security explains to us. "After all, Lebed and  I were friends. On 4 January 1993, however, Lebed suggested to  me and to Matveyev, the former minister of Internal Affairs,  that we take part in the overthrow of the PMR government. We  refused. And then it started. (...) He, Lebed, by no means sees  himself as Russian minister of Defense -- he sees himself as the  second person who will bring order in Russia."    (In parentheses we note: to the frank question we put to  Lebed concerning the fact that many people are waiting for him  in Moscow, the lieutenant-general answered: "I do not want to go  to Moscow.")    Igor Smirnov, president of the Dniester area, develops his  colleague's idea: "The present situation is quite convenient for  Bergman and people like him. If we, the PMR, can find a common  language with Moldova, the Dniester area as a "hot spot" will  disappear. (...) Russia needs all of Moldova because of  geopolitical and strategic interests. We do not object, we are  not leaving Moldova. (...) As Goebbels said, the more impudent  the lie, the more plausible it is. They accuse us of the fact  that the Dniester Battalion was at the White House...."    Both of them were of one accord: we don't want to collect  documents on the 14th Army, we want it to be here, we don't need  any aggravation.    So they just did not give us any documents against the 14th  Army and the Tiraspol Military Headquarters.  <H8>  What Can We Expect? </H8>   The atmosphere in Tiraspol is unpleasant. Everyone knows  about the tailing, telephone bugging and mutual "reconnaissance"  of the opposing sides. It sometimes reaches the point of  absurdity: people know the quarters from which the outside  surveillance comes. The "adversaries" know each other by sight.  The republic seems to be split in half.    Representatives of the Russian Army and the political  opposition speak openly about replacing the "mafiosa" Dniester  Government. With a more respectable one? Or -- with a more loyal  one? Replacement -- in what form?    Russia's interests, as always, are veiled. It is possible,  as  quite often happens these days -- they are simply unpredictable.  The Dniester area -- beyond any doubt -- is a "card" in the  political game with Moldavia, which has so far not come into the  CIS. The "card," however, may be played both in a peaceful way  and in a military way. This can happen in the near future.    At the same time, the Dniester Government is not a sweet  treat. Its relations with the Moscow opposition are obvious. The  priority of force is unconcealed. The number of unregistered  weapons is unpredictably high.    In both the Dniester area and Moscow there is peace for the  time being. God grant that no one disturbs it.    P.S. Having returned to the capital of our Motherland,  the MK correspondents noticed an outside tail following them. We  do not know to which structure these people belong. On 21 May,  the apartment of one of us was "frisked." The "guests" took no  money or valuables. What they were looking for -- is still a  mystery.</p>

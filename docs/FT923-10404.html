			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Vaccine makers set up unit in Europe PASTEUR Merieux Serums et Vaccins, the world's biggest supplier of vaccines and the vaccine unit of Merck of the US, another leading producer, have agreed to set up a jointly owned European subsidiary. This is the latest in a series of international alliances in the vaccines industry, as national companies join forces to pool technology to create multiple vaccines, capable of immunising against several diseases at once. No single national group owns enough antigens - proteins which stimulate the production of antibodies - to make a good all-in-one inoculation. The pair will concentrate on developing multiple vaccines for the European market, 'to obtain, with a simplified vaccination timetable, better immune cover against a bigger number of illnesses,' they said. They have signed a letter of intent for an equally owned subsidiary to promote their vaccines and other human health products and seek other alliances across Europe. If accepted by the European Commission's anti-trust authorities, the new company should be in place by the end of the year, said a joint statement. Institut Merieux, the vaccine group's parent, was one of the first in the current round of alliances, with its takeover three years ago of Connaught, the Canadian vaccine group, which turned it into the world's biggest supplier. At the turn of this year, the French group's vaccines unit signed a letter of intent with Merck to co-operate on developing and marketing combined childhood vaccines in the US. Institut Merieux, majority owned by Rhone-Poulenc, the French state-owned chemicals group, is the world's leading human and animal biology group, while Merck is the leader in human and veterinary pharmaceuticals.</p>

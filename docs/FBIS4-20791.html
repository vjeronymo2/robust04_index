			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "TADA Is Valid, But..."] </F>   [Text] The Supreme Court, while upholding the  constitutional validity of the Terrorism And Disruptive  Activities Act [TADA] has also called for a review of all TADA  cases. When TADA was debated in Parliament in 1987, there was a  huge outcry describing it as a draconian law. In 1991, when the  Act came up for renewal, the opposition was muted; something  must have happened to show the civil libertarians the  uselessness of shedding tears for terrorists. People of Punjab  have shown that civil society is willing to pay the heavy price  required to maintain peace. And this is the logic behind public  endorsement of TADA. Going for the substance, the Supreme Court  has lamented that the scope of TADA has not been progressively  reduced but has rather increased. Since less than 1 percent of  those arrested under TADA have been convicted, society must take  serious note. TADA has been upheld, but the Court has also put  the onus on the authorities to enforce it properly. As in other  parts of the world, the Indian police are not necessarily kind  and gentle. When the police are also engaged in trading bullets  with terrorists, the state has an additional problem as to how a  force armed to the teeth and trained to kill is going to police  the by-lanes of small-town India? Punjab is currently facing  this problem. TADA or no TADA, the crux of the matter is to  control the police. The steps recommended by the Court must, of  course, be incorporated into the TADA procedure, but at the same  time the police must be trained, educated, and better led. If  the police system is brought back into order, then TADA will  cease to be so controversial.</p>

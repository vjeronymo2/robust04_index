			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Berlin poll call as link to far right revealed Berlin's coalition government, or Senate, was last night thrown into turmoil after party officials said they would call new elections failing any agreement on the future status of the interior senator. The Social Democrats, who are in coalition with the Christian Democrats, have insisted that Mr Dieter Heckelmann, the senator responsible for interior affairs, should resign after it was disclosed that his press spokesman had ties to a far right-wing group of intellectuals known as the 'Tuesday Circle'. Mr Heckelmann, CDU, has already survived two votes of no confidence by the SPD. But yesterday, the Party for Democratic Socialism, the successor to the former east German communist party, and the Greens/Bundnis 90, which groups together environmentalists and independent movements, called for another no-confidence vote. Mr Eberhard Diepgen, the CDU mayor of Berlin, and Mr Ditmar Staffald, head of the Social Democrats, said they would be forced to call elections if they could not resolve the dispute. Last night, Mr Diepgen said the elections would probably take place in October, when the federal, and other state elections are held. The coalition has been in power since 1992. He said a confidence vote would be a 'hostile' gesture that would destabilise the coalition. 'If it comes to a destabilisation of the coalition - and a vote of no confidence is destabilising - then I would prefer calling new elections,' Mr Diepgen said at a news conference. The coalition's existence hinges on the SPD, which last night said they would decide soon if they would hold another confidence vote. They are likely to face pressure to call for another formal vote since its support in Berlin, particularly east Berlin, is drifting increasingly to the PDS. During the elections for the European Parliament, the PDS received more than 44 per cent of the votes in Berlin-Mitte, the heart of Berlin before the second world war, and over 40 per cent in east Berlin as a whole.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Pounds 10m centre for business training THE BIGGEST capital project undertaken by a Training and Enterprise Council, a Pounds 10m business training centre described as Britain's first commercial campus, will be inaugurated today. Northumberland Tec - one of the organisations that deliver government-funded training schemes in England and Wales - has bought Longhirst, a listed mansion in 45 acres of parkland near Morpeth, for management training and business education. Longhirst Hall is to be refurbished and run from September next year by the Tec as a management training and conference centre. The Northumberland Tec will also build a business college for the expanding University of Northumbria at Newcastle upon Tyne, formerly Newcastle Polytechnic. The college, opening in stages from September, will offer degree, diploma and certificate courses in business studies, management, marketing and accountancy for 600 full-time and part-time students, with a target of 1,000 by the year 2000.</p>

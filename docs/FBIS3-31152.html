			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 9 (BTA) -- The Confederation of the  Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) leaves the National  Council for Tripartite Cooperation (comprising the government,  the trade unions and the employers) until parliament passes the  1994 budget and the parliamentary forces take a stand on the  KNSB-sponsored measures accompanying the budget, KNSB leader  Prof. Krustyu Petkov told a briefing today. An address of the  KNSB Executive Committee to the parliamentary factions says that  the passage of the 1994 budget in its present form would place  the socially weak strata in an extremely difficult situation and  would result in unwarranted cuts in social expenditures.    The independent trade unions insist that parliament urgently  pass acts to regulate the social funds and provide moderate  protection for Bulgarian industrial and agricultural production.  The KNSB is for revising the unreasonably high taxes and fees  payable by private entrepreneurs and leaseholders, the document  reads. This trade union amalgamation wants the cabinet to set  up a 500 million leva (about U.S.$12 million) fund for extending  credits at moderately preferential terms to managers and workers  to facilitate their participation in privatization. The KNSB  also demands the passing of an act restituting the property of  juristic persons the economic activity of whom was terminated by  the communist regime after September 9, 1944.    The KNSB has moved in parliament a package of proposals and  projects comprising fundamental principles of bills regulating  the setting up and management of a special "social assistance"  fund and the election of representatives of the insured in the  management of different social funds. A declaration of the  executive committee of the confederation regarding the property  of the former trade unions by the end of 1993 proposes that this  property be used in setting up a fund for the social assistance  of the poorest strata of the population, controlled jointly by  state and public organizations. Over 2.5 billion leva (about  U.S.$75 million), the sum at which the KNSB estimates the  property of the former trade unions, are actually frozen, a  letter of the KNSB to the National Assembly reads. By the end  of the week this trade union amalgamation intends to hold  meetings with representatives of the parliamentary political  forces, Prof. Krustyu Petkov said at the briefing. The meetings  will discuss issues related to the draft budget and the funds  allocated to education, health care and the municipalities in  this country, the trade union leader added.</p>

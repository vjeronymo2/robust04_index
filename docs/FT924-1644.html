			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / World Bank on Debt: Flow of private capital 'may slow' THE wave of private capital that has flooded into developing countries in the past three years could prove unsustainable in the years ahead, the World Bank warns in its latest annual report on developing country debt, published today. Thanks largely to the surge in private investment, external finance for developing countries will this year reach a third more than two years ago, at Dollars 134.3bn (Pounds 88.3bn), the bank estimates. Last year, the net flows of resources to these countries totalled Dollars 115.2bn. The bank adds that the poorest countries have not benefited from this financing boom, being forced to rely on official loans and grants which have grown only marginally this decade. The private capital on which the middle-income countries have come to rely could prove a double-edged blessing, Mr Masood Ahmed, head of the bank's debt and international finance division, warned. 'There is some degree of concern about how sustainable the new flows will be,' he said, commenting on the report. Much of the new private capital has been driven by a search for higher returns, against a background of low or falling interest rates in developed countries. Such capital flows could be reversed if investment returns in the developed world rise. Also, it represents a redirection of a small portion of the total portfolios of institutional investors in developed countries - a one-off process which will not lead to a sustained flow of capital. 'Voluntary private capital flows provide welcome financing for development but may become a mixed blessing if mismanaged,' warns the bank. As financial markets around the world become more integrated, allowing capital to move more rapidly, pressure will grow on policy makers in developing countries. 'Both good and bad policies and macroeconomic conditions will be rewarded or punished sharply by international investors,' the bank says. 'Portfolio debt flows, especially short-term deposits, are more volatile than long-term commercial bank loans and trade financing. Likewise, portfolio equity flows in emerging markets can be taken out fast at low cost.' A further concern highlighted by the bank is that foreign direct investment is unlikely to provide a net source of finance over the medium term. As investments made in recent years start to yield results, the flow of profits out of the developing world will come to exceed new capital being invested. The main benefit of this investment 'may lie more in the transfer of technology than in medium-term balance of payments financing,' the bank says. Foreign direct investment has amounted to Dollars 38bn in 1992, up from Dollars 34bn last year and just Dollars 24bn in 1990. By contrast, the bank says that the growing indebtedness of developing countries as a whole should not be a matter for concern, provided it fuels economic development and stimulates exports rather than simply being used to plug fiscal deficits. Total foreign debt of the 116 countries under scrutiny leapt by nearly Dollars 100bn last year, to Dollars 1,700bn. During 1992, portfolio investment to developing countries has amounted to Dollars 27.2bn, up from Dollars 20.3bn in 1991. While last year these flows were driven largely by a return of flight capital held abroad for tax or other reasons, to Latin America, this year they represent growing investment in a wider range of countries, principally the East Asia and Pacific region. Institutional investors such as insurance companies and pension funds have become more important as providers of capital, and there has been a greater use of debt rather than equity: bonds and loans this year are expected to total Dollars 26bn, up from Dollars 14bn in 1991, while portfolio equity investment has risen from Dollars 7.6bn to Dollars 8.1bn. Net transfers of finance to the developing countries - total net flows less debt servicing and profit remittances - rose this year to Dollars 56.3bn from Dollars 37.7bn.

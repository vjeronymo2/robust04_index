			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NESUHI ERTEGUN, 71; PRODUCER, RECORD INDUSTRY LEADER  </P> <P> Nesuhi Ertegun, who rose from a teen-age jazz fanatic to become a powerful  record executive, died Saturday in New York after cancer surgery. He was 71.  </P> <P> Ertegun, who was born in Istanbul, created WEA International company, the  distributor outside the United States of the music products of Warner Brothers  Records, Atlantic Records, Elektra Records and MCA Records. He founded the firm  in 1971 and remained its president and chief executive officer until 1987. He  was also a writer, historian and producer of recordings by a wide range of  musicians.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Son of Ambassador  </P> <P> Ertegun's fascination with jazz began when his father, then Turkish ambassador  to Britain, took him to see a Duke Ellington concert at the London Palladium in  1933. When his father became the Turkish ambassador to the United States,  Ertegun and his brother, Ahmet, followed. The brothers began promoting jazz  concerts in Washington in the early 1940s and had amassed a collection of  20,000 records by the mid-1940s.  </P> <P> In 1944, Ertegun and his first wife, Marili Morden, moved to Los Angeles where  he opened a record shop. When the late actor Orson Welles suggested that  Ertegun organize a band, he put together the New Orleans immortals Kid Ory,  Mutt Carey and Jimmy Noone and founded the Crescent label to record them.  Several years later, for the Contemporary label, he recorded such West Coast  modern jazz artists as Shelly Manne, Shorty Rogers and Jimmy Guiffre.  </P> <P> Ertegun lectured in the history of American music at UCLA, considered the first  courses on the history of jazz given for college credit in an American  university.  </P> <P> In 1955, he moved to New York to help manage Ahmet's Atlantic Records, which  the brothers started in 1948. He signed such artists as the Modern Jazz  Quartet, Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and Charlie Mingus. He  also signed pop singer Roberta Flack and produced recordings by Ray Charles,  Bobby Darin, the Drifters and Big Joe Turner.  </P> <P> Some performers criticized the Erteguns' motives. Mel Torme, for one, said: "I  was ecstatic about singing with them . . . (but) the Erteguns basically are  businessmen with a totally commercial approach."  </P> <P> Ertegun was the first president of the National Assn. of Recording Arts and  Sciences, which gives the record industry's Grammy awards.  </P> <P> A soccer fan, he founded the New York Cosmos Soccer Club, now defunct, which  brought international stars such as Pele to the United States.  </P> <P> Ertegun was also known for his flamboyance. Married four times, he spoke six  languages and after his retirement, divided his time among his residences in  New York City, Katonah, N.Y., and Binot, France.  </P> <P> He is survived by his wife, Selma, his daughter, Leyla, and his son, Rustem.  </P></p>

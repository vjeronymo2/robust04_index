No such plans have been made  in the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy for the next few  years either," Russian Minister of Fuel and Energy Yuriy  Shafranik said.    In an interview with BUSINESS-TASS on Wednesday, Shafranik  said that "the results from oil sales should cover the expenses.  This is what the ministry has been guided by while holding  consultations with its partners and OPEC and assessing the  European Market."    OPEC, Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, plans  to  discuss at its session in Geneva on March 25 the possibility of  a five-per cent cut in export quotas for member countries. If  approved, Russia will be offered to cut its oil export by five  per cent.    "The European market is saturated, but we will fight for  it,"  Shafranik said.    Russia cannot transport all the oil extracted by joint  ventures. Additionally, the ministry has many requests from  Western partners for additional oil supplies. With this in  mind, the ministry plans to suggest establishing a Baltic oil  consortium in the Timano- Pechora region in order to penetrate  the Baltic and Finnish oil markets.    The Russian oil industry also plans to expand operations to  tap new oil deposits in the Irkutsk region, Kazakhstan,  Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Nigeria and boost  activity in Vietnam where Russia extracts about 20 million  tonnes of oil annually.</p>

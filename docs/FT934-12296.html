			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sharp drop at GBL in first half FIRST-HALF net consolidated profits at Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, Belgium's second-largest holding company, dropped by 21 per cent because of lower capital gains. Net profit was BFr3.99bn (Dollars 114m) for the six months to June, against BFr5.03bn in the equivalent 1992 period, and BFr6.01bn in the first six months of 1991. GBL said there was an increase in income from all its principal holdings, except for its 20.5 per cent stake in Petrofina, the Belgian oil company. Consolidated profit before exceptional items and capital gains rose from BFr2.98bn to BFr3.42bn. Capital gains fell from BFr2.05bn to BFr562m. The company, headed by Mr Albert Frere, said full-year consolidated profit - excluding capital gains - should be greater than 1992's BFr6.34bn, of which capital gains accounted for BFr1.76bn. GBL's 11.2 per cent stake in Tractebel, the Belgian utility company, is still the biggest contributor to profit, bringing in net income of BFr557m (BFr515m) in the first half of 1993. Biggest increases in income came from indirect holdings in Royale Belge, the Belgian insurer, which contributed BFr462m (BFr318m), and CLT, the Luxembourg audiovisual group, which contributed LFr488m (LFr359m).</p>

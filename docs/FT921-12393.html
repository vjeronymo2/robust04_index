			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Man charged with false accounting A FIFTY-year-old man is expected to appear in a Belfast court today charged with offences of false accounting and other offences relating to financial transactions. The Royal Ulster Constabulary last night refused to identify the man or give details of the offences he is alleged to have committed. The move is taking place, however, against a background of a continuing crackdown by the government on terrorist funds gath-ered from racketeering. The crackdown is being spearheaded by C13, a police squad attached to the RUC, and a new government unit made up of civil servants with expert knowledge of the taxation and financial systems. There was no official confirmation last night of a report at the weekend that British investigators suspected one British company quoted on the stock market of having been used as a front for the IRA and of having laundered several million pounds during the past eight years. The Stock Exchange would not comment on the report last night. If true, the action represents a new level of sophistication in the raising of IRA funds that may require tighter guidelines for financial institutions dealing with funds that may have been laundered. A government official said last night that investigators had not yet made 'a major breakthrough' in neutralising the IRA's complex financial structure. The RUC meanwhile emphasised that today's court case should not be seen to have any direct relationship with its drive against racketeering. New powers under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill include scope for the courts to seize the assets of anyone who benefits from terrorist-related activities.</p>

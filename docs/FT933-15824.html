			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers determined to derail BR rebels THE prime minister yesterday said it was 'probable' that the government would try to reverse its humiliating defeat earlier this week on a central element of the plans to privatise British Rail. Ministers appear set on a collision course with potential Tory rebels as they looked increasingly determined to overturn the embarrassing setback on Monday, when the Lords voted to allow BR to bid for rail franchises after privatisation. In the Commons, Labour exploited the government's discomfiture, as Mrs Margaret Beckett, the opposition deputy leader, urged minsters: 'Why doesn't the government show some common sense for once and just admit they have got it wrong?' While Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, sought to steer a course between dismissing the Lords' arguments and indicating that he would look again at the question, ministers are privately forthright in opposing the move. But the Tory MPs who previously threatened revolt to win concessions from the government on issues such as railcards have taken heart from the Lords' decision. Mr Tim Rathbone (Lewes), a leading Tory campaigner, suggested the proposal would now command more support than the similar bid to change the bill when MPs last discussed it. 'An amendment that has been proposed by a very distinguished previous Tory Transport Minister, and carried with the support of Conservative members of the House of Lords, bears rather more careful consideration by Conservative MPs than something that is put forward by the Labour party,' he said. The bill returns to the Commons in the autumn, and ministers are demonstrating their confidence by not rushing into negotiations with earlier rebels such as Sir Keith Speed and Sir John Stanley. A further sign of confidence was the Department of Transport's coolness on one possible area of compromise mentioned by Lord Caithness, a government spokesman in the Lords. He said it would be permissible for BR to be a junior partner in a private consortium bidding for passenger franchises. Officials said yesterday that though allowable, it was not the government's intention that BR should be involved in this way. Ministers argue such a move would run counter to the logic of the measure which envisages teams of former BR employees effectively privatising BR routes by bidding for individual franchises. They also point out BR will be involved in every bidding process anyway, since each route will be kept in BR's hands if the private bidders fail to offer the government a better deal. The government is today expected to set July 29 as the date for the Christchurch by-election, ending speculation they could seek to delay the poll until September. The focus of the contest - caused by the death of Mr Robert Adley, the noted Tory rail rebel - will be Mr Robert Hayward's efforts to defend a majority of 23,000 against a strong Liberal Democrat challenge.</p>

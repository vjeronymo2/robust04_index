			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Banks spoil media man's appetite  -Debts threaten Robert Hersant's paper empire A succession of French governments has tried and failed to curb the power of Mr Robert Hersant, the secretive media magnate who is the dominant force in the French press. However, Mr Hersant is now under unprecedented pressure to dismantle his empire - not from the government, but from his banks. Mr Hersant, 74, is more accustomed to buying newspapers than selling them. His appetite for acquisitions has earned him the nickname le papivore, the 'paper eater', in France. It has also created one of Europe's largest newspaper groups including Le Figaro, the biggest-selling French national daily; France-Soir, the sensationalist evening paper; a string of regional titles; and significant press interests as far afield as Belgium, Poland, Hungary, Tahiti and Guadelope. However le papivore is heavily in debt. His main lender is Credit Lyonnais, the ailing state-controlled bank which has made no secret of the fact that it is pressing Mr Hersant to redeem some of his loans, just as it has been pursuing Mr Bernard Tapie, the beleaguered left-wing entrepreneur, to repay his debts. Mr Hersant's refusal to publish accounts makes it impossible to gauge his financial position. Analysts estimate he has total debts of around FFr4bn (Dollars 719.4m). They calculate he is obliged to repay FFr1bn of it by the end of this year, in one tranche of FFr600m in late October and another of FFr400m at the end of December. Given that most of his titles are believed to be in the red, and that Mr Hersant is known to be bitterly opposed to the possibility of bringing in external investors, his only solution seems to be disposals. The Hersant group has no shortage of candidates for sale. Mr Hersant, the self-made son of a merchant navy officer, has been expanding his empire since he founded his first title, L'Auto-Journal, after the second world war. L'Auto-Journal prospered in the buoyant economic climate of post-war France and, by the late 1950s, Mr Hersant had hit the acquisition trail. A series of deals culminated in the mid-1970s with the takeover of Le Figaro. He owns roughly 35 per cent (in circulation terms) of the French newspaper market and 40 per cent of the Polish press. Mr Hersant even boasted he had a monopoly over the Tahitian national daily press until, earlier this month, a rival was launched to compete against his two titles. Analysts are wary of pinning precise valuations on the Hersant group. 'We have absolutely no idea of its true value,' said Mr Jean-Laurent Nabet, media analyst at Societe Generale in Paris. 'After all, we don't even know the exact level of sales or debt.' However, the consensus in financial circles is that Le Figaro alone is worth around FFr2bn. The French regional titles (which include Le Progres, the influential Lyon daily that has a higher circulation than Le Figaro) are thought likely to fetch another FFr2bn. Mr Hersant could also expect to raise between FFr400m and FFr500m from selling his papers in Poland. This means he could comfortably repay all his debts simply by selling part of his empire. Mr Hersant recently raised FFr204m by selling a bundle of magazines - including L'Auto Journal, his first title  - to Emap, the UK media group. There is no shortage of suitors for his remaining interests. Hollinger, the Canadian group headed by Mr Conrad Black, is said to have expressed interest in a number of titles. The UK's Associated Newspapers is mooted as a prospective buyer for the Polish titles. Le Figaro is rumoured to have attracted a string of potential purchasers including Hollinger; Mr Jimmy Goldsmith, the flamboyant financier; and a French consortium composed of the LVMH luxury goods group, the Alcatel-Alsthom electronics concern and Havas, the powerful media company. Moreover, the climate in the French newspaper market is improving, enhancing the prospects for disposals. France's newspapers have had a tough time over the past two years, as the recession triggered a sharp decline in circulation and advertising. But the economy is recovering and the industry has stabilised. 'The worst is definitely over,' said Societe Generale's Mr Nabet. However, Mr Hersant shows no sign of being prepared to sell. He revels in his role as a hands-on proprietor in the traditional mould. He does nothing to disguise the imposition of his political views on his papers: Le Figaro has been steered steadily to the right under his ownership. He has also used his titles as a platform for his political career - in both the French and European parliaments - and has long relished playing a power-broker role in French politics. Mr Hersant's response to the current crisis has been to tighten his grip on his empire, rather than relax it. One of the first victims of the credit crunch was Mr Philippe Villin, the high-flying 40-year-old who had been seen as Mr Hersant's heir-apparent until he was fired two months ago as chairman of of France-Soir. The septuagenarian Mr Hersant announced he was personally taking charge. However, pressure is mounting. The deadline for his FFr600m repayment is only two months away. The Emap deal shows Mr Hersant will make disposals if he has to. Any future sales, however, are likely to be along similar lines, involving relatively low-profile titles. Even the most optimistic of Le Figaro's suitors have accepted that Mr Hersant will try to cling on to that paper at least until after he has played the power broker again in next spring's presidential elections.</p>

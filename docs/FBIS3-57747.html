			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Nikita Yermakov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    [Excerpts] Davos, 29 Jan -- Russia will not deviate from  its course of reforms. The serious work that has been started  in the country will be continued. This was stated today by  Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, speaking at a  news conference here. He is in Davos to take part in the world  economic forum. [passage omitted]    V. Chernomyrdin said that the fight against inflation is one  of the main areas for the government's work in 1994. Last year  the task was to knock down the rate of inflation from over 30  percent to 12-15 percent a month. This task was fulfilled. "We  should now keep to this level," the Russian prime minister  stressed. "The rate of inflation will fluctuate around 20  percent a month in the first half of the year. We will try to  bring it down to 15-18 percent by the end of the year." The head  of the Russian Government noted the need for the restructuring  of industry and of agrarian and other sectors of the economy.  According to him, this will play a predominant role. He  pointed out that there would not be any control over wages and  distribution. The government is raising the question of  granting more rights to the regions.    Touching upon the formation of the government, V.  Chernomyrdin reported that there were no lengthy talks with the  president on cadre reshuffling. This question was discussed in  early December and, but for the elections, but for the  referendum, the reshuffle would have been carried out last year.  "Therefore, there's no need to think things up, everything is  going as agreed with the president," he stressed, adding that  the reorganization of the government is continuing. [passage  omitted]    "Russia has always played and will continue to play a  certain  role in the world community. Difficult processes which are  painful for us are under way in Russia today. We are  experiencing difficulties. In order to join the market economy  in a real way, to move forward into the world community, we  should bring everything into line with the demands of market  relations." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNLEASHING CREATIVITY;  </P> <P> ARTS CENTER HAS A NO-FAIL APPROACH FOR CULTURALLY DEPRIVED CHILDREN  </P> <P> Children who visit downtown's Inner City Arts Center studio squeal in delight  and tear toward a great igloo-like structure covered in tan butcher paper and  decorated in the mysterious hieroglyphics of grade schoolers.  </P> <P> Yards of paper catch the light of a nearby window, transmitting a rich acorn  glow that beckons the children inside. They do so with near-abandon, scooting  low through a narrow entryway to gather within and whisper in a special place  they have created.  </P> <P> None of the children know it, but the "art cave" made by students from a nearby  elementary school is really a metaphor for the one-of-a-kind arts center,  opened last fall by an artist and a real estate financier as a haven for the  impoverished and culturally undernourished children of the city's urban core.  </P> <P> "I look at all the graffiti in the city and I think sometimes these young  people are crying out to express themselves," said artist Bob Bates, director  and co-founder of Inner City Arts. "If we can show children who come to us that  there's a channel for this, I believe we can get them to believe in themselves  and love who they are."  </P> <P> Nearly 600 children from downtown's 9th Street Elementary School and Para Los  Ninos Latchkey program come to the huge art studio on Olympic Boulevard near  Central Avenue each week, either to attend one-hour classes or to spend the  after-school hours as part of the latchkey program.  </P> <P> They come from some of the city's most troubled spots, from crowded brick  apartments near MacArthur Park and dank single room hotels on Skid Row. For  most, life has not offered the richness that shapes a more affluent child: no  wide green lawn and plenty of toys to play with, no summer camp, no crafts with  mom or dad.  </P> <P> There is a deep conviction among Bates, a former art teacher at the University  of Miami, and other teachers at Inner City Arts that they must reawaken the  muffled creative urges that fuel a child's learning and self-esteem.  </P> <P> In this lofty, warm room stocked with paints, ceramics, a kiln, a piano, a  video camera, and, of course, the art cave, that creative force is being let  loose.  </P> <P> "We love art class and we wish we could come every day but we get to come two  days," said Anna Maria Diaz, 11. "There's nothing like this in regular school  and I don't think anywhere else, even. Here we've done animals and houses and  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. We love ceramics and we love painting!"  </P> <P> Almost entirely funded from private sources, the center offers free one-hour  classes to children from 9th Street Elementary School who walk with their  teachers from the school, at Stanford and Towne avenues near Skid Row, to the  studio to attend class as part of their regular school day.  </P> <P> Lacking badly needed buses, Inner City Arts runs an outreach class in which  program teachers visit schools whose children cannot get to the studio. Each  week, they visit 270 children at Utah, San Pedro and 28th Street elementary  schools.  </P> <P> Real estate financier Irwin Jaeger put up $137,000 to create the Inner City  Arts Center, leasing the large studio in a neighborhood of low-slung industrial  buildings. Jaeger, a Beverly Hills resident, oversees a private foundation that  is donating and raising funds to expand the studio to serve other schools.  Jaeger hopes the studio can one day serve 5,500 inner-city children.  </P> <P> Unlike public school, the Inner City Arts program follows few rules. Classes  are taught not by trained teachers, but by professional artists such as Bob  Nydam, Summer Lowe and Gail Bates. There are no grades, no tests, no work  sheets -- and no failures.  </P> <P> "Because we are working with the creative minds and hearts of the children,  when we give materials to them they make and create things that we adults  cannot even conceive," said Bob Bates, a lanky and soft-spoken man who always  hovers near the children, and whom they call simply "Bob."  </P> <P> Debra Sanders, a single mother who lives with her brother at the Premier Towers  apartment on a tattered stretch of Spring Street downtown, said it is a  constant struggle to provide "a real childhood" for her daughter, Angel, a  7-year-old student at 9th Street school.  </P> <P> The close-knit mother and daughter have been homeless once before, and live  only in hotels.  </P> <P> "Angel can go out of the apartment and see a bum on the street and that can  bring a lot onto any child," Sanders said. "That's where the art center comes  in. You can tell your kid they're the greatest all day long, but When somebody  else says it and gives them a chance to prove it, that makes all the  difference."  </P> <P> One recent day, 5th- and 6th-graders from 9th Street were daubing bright colors  onto their handmade ceramics, readying them for the last firing in the kiln.  </P> <P> Excited jostling flared up as a line formed to use a big jar of green paint. It  was the key ingredient for completing a handcrafted Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle  replica, and there were nearly a dozen versions of the popular creature  clutched in small hands.  </P> <P> But as is always the way at Inner City Arts, no child felt constrained to  follow the pack. Ivan Munoz, 10, painstakingly applied blue paint to tiny clay  clothing and put a removable hat on a figurine of a Dodger baseball player  created by a friend. It was, Ivan said, a team project.  </P> <P> "I'm in latchkey and after school we get to come here again, and it's the  best," Ivan said. "Then, after that, my dad comes and picks me up, but you know  what? I'm not always ready to go!"  </P> <P> The idea for the studio grew from a casual conversation Bob Bates and Jaeger  had a few years ago about helping children.  </P> <P> "These kids are sponges who absorb everything, and we know we are giving them a  chance to absorb the right things," said Jaeger, a frequent and popular visitor  to the studio. "This is all about giving kids the equal opportunity so that  they can stay equal as adults."  </P> <P> That philosophy has earned the art center the respect of parents and of the Los  Angeles Unified School District.  </P> <P> Betty Peifer, principal of the 9th Street school, said the entire school is  enrolled in the federal free lunch program because so many students come from  low-income families.  </P> <P> "These children are not just needy in monetary terms," Peifer said, "and if  people go and see what is happening they will know how wonderful this program  is."  </P> <P> Peifer, who bemoans the small amount of school district money used to run arts  and music programs, said one major benefit of Inner City Arts "is just the  space, the bigness, the airiness, the size of a place where a child can be free  who lives in pretty cramped quarters."  </P> <P> She said the district pays about 1% of the cost of the Inner City Arts program.  </P> <P> But the center does get help.  </P> <P> Donations arrive at the studio weekly, ranging from loads of tempera for  painting to shipments of foam and other basic building blocks for creating art.  Rega Petlin, director of development at the studio, said volunteers have begun  to appear at the front door, just wanting to give their time.  </P> <P> "One woman comes faithfully every Tuesday and helps run the office," Petlin  said. "She said she just wants to be near the kids."  </P> <P> Yet for all the good, there is the constant reminder that just outside the  front door, a harsh world awaits these children. A homeless woman lives beside  the center, and Bates has hired her at $5 an hour to clean up the studio.  </P> <P> Bates sees each new twist and turn as a chance to show children how to maintain  their self-worth in an increasingly uncertain urban milieu.  </P> <P> "I see these children rising above incredible problems and incredible  adversity," he said. "If we can give them the tools to do that, we will have a  better culture for it."  </P></p>

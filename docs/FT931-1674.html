			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: JSH to raise USDollars 358.5m through rights issue JARDINE Strategic (JSH), the Jardine Matheson group's investment holding company, is to raise USDollars 358.5m through a rights issue of convertible preference shares. This follows the successful launch of Dollars 200m of convertible preference shares in April 1992. The latest convertible issue is to fund JSH's recent acquisition of a 16 per cent stake in Singapore-listed Cycle &amp; Carriage and provide the Dollars 94m necessary to take up its 46 per cent rights entitlement to the Dairy Farm convertible share issue. JSH also announced profit estimates for 1992, indicating that it would report net profits of Dollars 262m for 1992, a 12 per cent increase over 1991. A final dividend of 7.7 cents per share will be announced when the company releases full details of its results tomorrow. The JSH convertible preference shares have a yield of 7.4 per cent, and will convert at HKDollars 24, compared with yesterday's closing price of HKDollars 20.60. Some analysts believe the issue may be the prelude to an acquisition.</p>

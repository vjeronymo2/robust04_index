			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Currency gains help Saatchi to Pounds 9m - Shift in spending patterns means uncertain outlook for worldwide advertising growth CURRENCY gains boosted interim sales and profits at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the heavily-indebted advertising group, which yesterday reported a Pounds 7.4m increase in the pre-tax return to Pounds 9.1m. The profits advance was achieved on revenue up 11.5 per cent to Pounds 404m for the six months to June 30. Favourable currency movements had been responsible for virtually all of the 13.4 per cent improvement in continuing operations. Mr Charles Scott, the accountant who took over as chief executive of the world's fourth largest advertising agency in April, said that in spite of the currency gains the interim results showed a group 'improving steadily from a financial viewpoint'. Revenue for the current year was expected to be broadly similar to last year's Pounds 748m, excluding currency movements. He warned against complacency, however, saying that a shift in the spending patterns of customers away from short bursts of promotional activity to more sustained value for money branding 'could disrupt . . . traditional expenditure patterns'. The worldwide outlook for advertising growth 'is uncertain,' he added. Net debt had fallen from Pounds 192m at the end of 1992 to Pounds 177m at June 30 following the Pounds 73m rights issue. Mr Scott said the group aimed to reduce borrowings to Pounds 145m by the end of 1993. He re-emphasised his commitment to paying a dividend in 1994. Earnings per share were 1.9p (4.9p losses). Mr Scott said much remained to be done to improve the group, particularly in light of the downturn in Europe. 'We still need to get our costs down in some areas.' Margins had fallen from a peak of 5.5 per cent in the first half of 1992 to 4.7 per cent. This was expected to rise to 6 per cent by the end of the year, after further cost-cutting, and to 10 per cent by the end of 1995. Saatchi, which has cut staff by 5 per cent to 11,900 in the last 18 months, is expected to seek further reductions in Europe and possibly the US. Continental Europe had suffered most severely in the first half, particularly Spain. Trading profits were more than halved from Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 4.5m. The 33 per cent increase in profits from the US to Pounds 10.8m was mainly because of currency gains. Underlying revenue growth remained flat. The most encouraging signs came from the UK and Pacific region. Although UK revenues fell 3 per cent, trading profits were up from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 3.1m. The group's stronger financial position meant that it would begin to focus on investing the rights issue money, Mr Scott said. One of the first targets would be to build up the Zenith media buying company in to a global concern.</p>

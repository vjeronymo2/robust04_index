			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIAL NOTICE OF INQUIRY SENT TO CLEMSON BY NCAA  </P> <P> The NCAA has sent Clemson an official letter of inquiry after a preliminary  investigation uncovered 14 alleged rule violations, ranging from monetary  payments to illegal recruiting contacts, the school said Friday.  </P> <P> David Berst, assistant executive director for enforcement for the NCAA, said in  a letter Thursday to university President Max Lennon that it appears the school  had violated NCAA rules.  </P> <P> "Based upon a review of the available information, it appears reasonable to  expect that the NCAA Committee on Infractions will find violations of NCAA  legislation concerning these matters," Berst said. "Accordingly, this letter .  . . constitutes an official inquiry."  </P> <P> The alleged rule violations occurred from 1984 to 1988 and involved both  players and recruits, according to the school, which received the NCAA letter  Friday.  </P> <P> The violations include the payment of $50 to $150, gifts of a cap and  sweatshirt, improper purchase of meals and auto transportation and violation of  recruiting rules that limit the number of visits and the period of time when  visits can be made, the school said.  </P> <P> Lennon was out of town and could not be reached for comment. Nick Lomax, vice  president for student affairs, said the school's internal investigation and its  work with the NCAA had prepared it for the NCAA's announcement.  </P> <P> "We pretty well had an idea of what they were coming up with," Lomax said. "I  would say that we didn't have any surprises in this report."  </P> <P> Clemson was placed on two years' probation beginning in 1982 for recruiting  violations, one year after the Atlantic Coast Conference school won the  national championship.  </P> <P> Ten James Madison University basketball players violated an NCAA rule during a  trip to Hawaii in 1988 when they received free airline tickets for agreeing to  be bumped off their original flight.  </P> <P> The school said Thursday that the NCAA was informed of the violation this week,  but no further action is anticipated.  </P> <P> NCAA enforcement director David Berst said the type of violation is minor.  </P></p>

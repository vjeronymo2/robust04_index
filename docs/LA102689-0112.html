			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE;  </P> <P> FREEWAY SEISMIC SAFETY NOT 'HIGHEST PRIORITY';  </P> <P> FUNDING: A NUMBER OF CALTRANS ENGINEERS SAY THEY WERE PRESSURED TO INSTEAD FIX  ROADS THAT CAUSED FAR MORE DEATHS THAN QUAKES.  </P> <P> In the 18 years since the Sylmar earthquake toppled a freeway interchange, a  program to shore up 2,500 of the most vulnerable bridges and elevated roadways  in California has never been a top state priority -- getting less money, for  example, than freeway landscaping or sound walls.  </P> <P> State Transportation Director Robert K. Best conceded Wednesday that earthquake  safety "was not the highest priority in the department for the expenditure of  whatever funds became available. It's just as simple as that."  </P> <P> However, the slow pace of beefing up bridges had long troubled a number of  state Department of Transportation engineers, who wanted to get the work done  before a major quake knocked down other highway structures. These civil  servants said in interviews with Times reporters that they felt shackled by  dwindling highway dollars and were under constant pressure to clean up the  state's many "blood alleys" -- stretches of road that produced far more deaths  than earthquakes had.  </P> <P> While the engineers blame a general shortage of money for the slow progress  under three governors -- Ronald Reagan, Edmund G. Brown Jr. and George  Deukmejian -- several top state officials disagree. They insist that there was  money available for earthquake safety and that Caltrans got whatever it  requested for that purpose.  </P> <P> With the deaths of at least 39 people caught in the collapse of the Nimitz  Freeway in Oakland during last Tuesday's quake, officials are being asked  whether they did enough, quickly enough to head off an earthquake disaster.  </P> <P> Bridge design engineer Oris H. Degenkolb was in charge of the Caltrans  earthquake retrofitting program until he retired in 1981. It was Degenkolb who  drew up the list of bridges supported by columns that might fall in an  earthquake. He said he complained frequently within the agency that progress  was too slow. But he never put his concerns in writing, and it is unclear  whether they were forwarded to top Caltrans officials.  </P> <P> "You knew an earthquake was coming," Degenkolb said in an interview. "There was  going to be a catastrophe coming out of it and something ought to be done about  it before we get caught with our pants down."  </P> <P> Another retired Caltrans engineer, Arthur L. Elliott, said that Caltrans  engineers felt lucky to get a commitment of $2 million to $3 million a year for  earthquake improvements.  </P> <P> "We were all champing at the bit and wanting to get it done," said Elliott, who  was in charge of bridge design. "The money was the main drawback on why we  weren't moving faster."  </P> <P> "The attitude was there was only so much money and that's it," said William J.  Jurkovich, Caltrans chief of special bridge projects.  </P> <P> "It's like a leaky roof," he said. "You can't fix it if it's raining. When it  isn't raining, why fix it?"  </P> <P> During the first five years after the 1971 San Fernando quake, highway  officials spent $7.7 million to reinforce bridges and elevated roadways for  earthquake safety. The amount is less than the $8.6 million that the highway  division spent in one single budget year -- 1971-72 -- on an ambitious tree-  and shrub-planting program.  </P> <P> By the time of the 1987 Whittier quake, Caltrans had spent most of the $55  million budgeted for tying down bridge spans to keep them from sliding off  during a severe quake.  </P> <P> However, the subsequent Whittier quake proved what Caltrans engineers had long  believed -- that the columns supporting many of the bridges built before 1971  could be severely damaged and even toppled in a major quake.  </P> <P> After the 1987 quake, James E. Roberts, chief of Caltrans' structures division,  wrote a memo urging his superiors to accelerate spending on reinforcing bridge  supports "to prevent the collapse of major structures during an earthquake."  </P> <P> As a result of the memo, Caltrans now has plans to spend $64 million over five  years in a second phase of earthquake improvements. But the spending plan would  not have addressed the problems now believed responsible for the Nimitz  collapse.  </P> <P> Even under that accelerated spending plan, the total for earthquake safety is  scarcely more than the $63 million the department has budgeted for new  landscaping over the same period. It's also less than the $75 million allocated  for construction and reinforcing of sound walls.  </P> <P> This year alone, Caltrans plans to spend $44.5 million to maintain and care for  21,000 acres of landscaping along California's freeways, compared to $18  million budgeted for earthquake improvements.  </P> <P> Allan H. Hendrix, chief of program development for Caltrans highway division,  said that "there was never an explicit trade-off" made in budgeting money for  earthquake safety versus budgeting for other programs. The amount allocated for  earthquake safety, he said, "was the total that our technical experts told us  was needed."  </P> <P> Top officials with the California Transportation Commission, which generally  decides how highway money is spent in the state, say they always gave Caltrans  whatever it requested for safety programs.  </P> <P> William T. Bagley, who stepped down as chairman of the commission earlier this  year, pointed out that the panel approved spending $64 million for retrofitting  bridges and other elevated structures, just as the Caltrans staff had  requested.  </P> <P> "We gave them what they asked for, in the face of arguments that we shouldn't,  that we were in effect stealing $64 million from new construction," Bagley  said. "Safety does come first when it's on the table in front of you."  </P> <P> State Finance Director Jesse R. Huff pointed out that the state is spending  from $900 million to $1.3 billion each year on new highway construction  projects -- sums that dwarf what has been proposed for earthquake safety.  </P> <P> "We put a lot of money into highways -- there has been a lot of rehabilitation,  a lot of widening, a lot of safety work," Huff said. "So it just doesn't make  any sense to say there is a chill in the air that has scared people away (from  requesting funds for earthquake safety). It just doesn't add up."  </P> <P> But other top Caltrans and Administration officials disagree, contending that  every aspect of highway construction and maintenance has been affected by a  shortage of gasoline tax funds that began with the Arab oil embargoes of the  1970s. Changes in gasoline consumption -- brought on in large part by higher  costs at the pump -- meant a sharp drop in federal and state gasoline tax  dollars for California.  </P> <P> During the same period, several years of double-digit inflation also cut into  the number of projects that could be funded each year.  </P> <P> A number of state transportation officials, past and present, have said that  they found themselves having to choose between earthquake safety and making  improvements in dangerous stretches of highways -- the so-called "blood  alleys."  </P> <P> Pointing to other safety problems on the state's highways, William Schaefer,  chief Caltrans engineer, said at a recent press briefing that even if there  were more money to spend, "I could not in good conscience say we would focus  every dime on earthquake safety programs to the exclusion of every other  program."  </P> <P> A senior transportation official in a previous Administration stated flatly  that earthquake safety was competing for funds with other safety programs --  and usually losing.  </P> <P> The Nimitz Freeway "was always on the watch list of roadways to monitor," said  the official, who asked not to be identified. "But the debate always was  whether you worked on a freeway such as this or fixed the blood alleys. The  blood alleys always won out over questions of structural integrity. It was a  case of some obscure engineering report that says there may or may not be a  problem someday versus a freeway where people are getting killed now."  </P> <P> Also contributing to this story were Times staff writers Daniel M. Weintraub,  Richard C. Paddock, Virginia Ellis and George Skelton.  </P></p>

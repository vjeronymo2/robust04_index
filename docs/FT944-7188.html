			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: ABB merges robotics and paint units ABB, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, is merging its robotics and paint finishing businesses into a single company with 3,700 employees worldwide and expected sales this year of Dollars 1.1bn. The new company, ABB Flexible Automation, will account for about 10 per cent of ABB's industrial systems and products segment. It represents another step by Zurich-based ABB to simplify its structure, save on administrative costs and boost its market presence. The former ABB Robotics claimed to be the world's largest supplier of robots and the paint finishing business was a leading supplier in the automotive paint systems market, worth about Dollars 2.5bn a year. Both have been expanding through organic growth and acquisitions of companies such as Trallfa and Ransburg. Mr Stelio Demark, president of the new company, said yesterday that, by merging the two businesses and exploiting their synergies, 'we are in a good position to improve the overall profitability of our businesses'. The merger will not lead to any job cuts, said Mr Roland Nordstrom, chief executive of the UK arm of ABB Flexible Automation. But savings could be made by merging administrative and other functions, and co-operating in research and development, he said. The new name is seen by ABB as better reflecting the real capabilities of the business.</p>

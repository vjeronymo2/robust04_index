			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THANKS TO PROGRAM, HOMELESS FAMILIES SLEEP BETTER AT NIGHT  </P> <P> The homeless couple couldn't believe what they were hearing.  </P> <P> On May 3, Donald Mack, 35, and his fiancee, 36-year-old Linda McGhee, weary  from months of living on the streets and in shelters, had just been told that  they would be given two months' free rent, free job-placement counseling, free  private schooling for their children and free child care for their unborn  child. Free.  </P> <P> They were stunned.  </P> <P> Just hours before, Donald and Linda had been waiting patiently in a food line  set up every Wednesday night by church workers at 11th Avenue and K Street  downtown. Unshed tears shimmered in Linda's eyes as she gratefully received her  plate. But, after hearing the amazing news from one of the workers, the tears  streamed down her face.  </P> <P> The couple, who were married that night, became the first of 10 families chosen  to participate in "Home Again," an innovative, nationwide program whose goal is  to rid the country of homeless families, said Cecelia Thomas, co-coordinator of  the San Diego program.  </P> <P> As the Macks began to move into their new apartment Wednesday, Linda reflected  in disbelief on their good fortune.  </P> <P> "I couldn't believe it. We had so many bad times that I came to a point where I  said, 'There's no end to this.' I had nowhere to go or no one to turn to. I  just started praying, 'Lord, there's got to be a better way.' I asked Him to  send someone, and when they told me (about the program), 'I just said, Lord,  you heard my prayers.' "  </P> <P> After months of living in and out of shelters and spending occasional nights  "on the curb," Donald Mack is relieved to have a permanent home.  </P> <P> "There's nothing (on the street) but chaos," he said. "There's a few good  people who have had bad times in life that's put them down there, but it's sad  to see some of them."  </P> <P> "Home Again" for the San Diego area is being operated through St. Stephen's  Church of God in Christ in Southeast San Diego. The church has received a  $10,000 grant from the U. S. Ministries division of World Vision, a Monrovia,  Calif.-based international Christian agency that began the program March 1.  </P> <P> U. S. Ministries has designated 21 coordination sites for "Home Again" in 16  cities to help about 120 families, said Jana Webb, the national coordinator.  The participating churches are from San Diego, Long Beach, Pasadena, Glendale,  Oakland, Fresno, Boston, Jackson, Miss.; Memphis, Tenn., Philadelphia, Chicago,  Wheaton, Ill., Denver, Omaha, Detroit and Seattle.  </P> <P> "We're hoping to contract with (churches) on a long-term basis to seriously  impact homeless families in these cities," Webb said. "We want to eliminate  homeless families totally. . . . Every three months we will begin another phase  until we saturate the areas that have desperate homeless needs."  </P> <P> St. Stephen's is also working in cooperation with 22 other San Diego churches  to adopt the 10 homeless families, Thomas said. Depending on the size of the  church, each will be responsible for adopting one family or sharing the  responsibility with another church.  </P> <P> "We are looking for families that are on the streets, where there is a desire  to be reintroduced to a productive life style," said Bishop George D. McKinney,  pastor of St. Stephen's. "Some homeless do not want to leave the streets. We  are looking for the motivation and the strengths we can build on.  </P> <P> "The church is saying we're going not only to identify a family and place them  in an apartment building, but we will offer child care, day school,  psychological and pastoral counseling and job placement," McKinney said. "We'll  use the network we have to concentrate on getting the families from the streets  back into the mainstream."  </P> <P> Donald Mack said he will begin work Monday at the Pacific Marine Sheet Metal  Corp., installing and repairing ventilation systems aboard the amphibious  assault ship Okinawa. Linda Mack, who said she has had problems finding a job  since she suffered injuries from a car accident two years ago, said she may  have to go on disability.  </P> <P> But, for the couple, the new apartment means stability and the rebuilding of  their families. Both have children from previous relationships that they hope  to retain custody of once they have become settled, and Donald Mack is  confident that they will soon be a complete family.  </P> <P> "Everything's been falling right into place," he said.  </P></p>

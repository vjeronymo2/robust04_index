			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Vita shows sharp fall to Pounds 33.7m British Vita, the foam and fibre group, saw profits drop from a restated Pounds 52.3m in 1992 to Pounds 33.7m last year as the recession in continental Europe took its toll. The figures also bore Pounds 10m of trading and disposal losses relating to the group's withdrawal from Spain. However, Mr Bob McGee, chairman, said that early indications for the current year were 'heartening'. 'Across Europe conditions appear to have stabilised, albeit at 1993 levels. Some recovery is showing through in the UK while North America continues to exhibit steady improvement.' Earnings per share fell from 15.6p to 9.6p, but dividends are up from 7.15p to 7.4p with a final payment of 3.75p. Mr McGee said that while volumes in most areas, apart from Germany, had remained 'reasonable', there had been increasing pressure on margins. Excluding acquisitions and disposals, sales rose 2.5 per cent to Pounds 712m. Germany, which accounts for more than a fifth of group sales, bore the brunt of a cost reduction programme which has reduced staff in continental Europe by 9 per cent. Total rationalisation costs more than doubled to Pounds 5m. Mr Kanak Bhatt, finance director, said that price pressure had been particularly intense in automotive products, which account for some 15 per cent of group sales. Icoa, the Spanish foam manufacturer acquired in 1988, had been 'losing a fortune' on automotive components while the group's Spanish plastics business was badly hit by the construction downturn. Both have been sold to management for nominal sums. Thanks to a Pounds 73m rights issue two years ago the balance sheet is strong, with gearing of 14 per cent. Mr McGee said the company was particularly keen to expand in the US and eastern Europe where its Pounds 6m foam plant in Poland will be commissioned next month. Favourable exchange rate movements boosted operating profits by Pounds 1.4m and the group has switched to translating figures at average exchange rates, restating the 1992 results. See Lex</p>

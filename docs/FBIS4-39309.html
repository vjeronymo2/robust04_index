			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Pozdeyev report: "Americans Buy Rockets in the </F> Urals"]    [Text] Following an exhibition of Russian technologies in  the United States, the U.S. firm Douglas has concluded a  contract with Yekaterinburg's "Novator" design bureau. The  Urals firm has pledged to ship 2,000 rockets to the United  States.    These rockets are not going to join the U.S. Army's arsenal  but will indirectly help enhance its combat might. The thing is  that specialists from Douglas intend to use the Russian rockets  as targets when testing new arms.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Governments cut stake in DAF The Dutch and Flemish governments have cut their combined holding in Daf from 52.5 per cent to 48.6 per cent. Last year, the two governments led the rescue of the Dutch truck maker. Mr Cor Baan, Daf chairman, confirmed a net profit of Fl 10.8m (Dollars 5.40m) in the company's truncated financial year from March 2 to December 31. However, he warned that the company still faced very difficult market conditions. He indicated that further job cuts and cost-savings might be necessary. Rather than having any immediate impact on the way Daf is run, the move to a minority stake by the two governments was seen as a gesture towards Brussels, and its reluctance to see overt intervention by governments in corporate rescues. The rest of the shares in Daf Trucks NV, created with Fl 463.3m of risk capital a year ago, are held by an Amro-led consortium of banks and institutional investors. The company indicated there were unlikely to be further substantial changes in the equity structure 'for the foreseeable future'. Daf's net profit was on turnover of Fl 1.3bn. It made Fl 24.1m at the operating level. In spite of the slump in continental Europe's main truck markets, Mr Baan said he expected further growth and 'noticeably higher' profits in the current year. Production volumes were now 10 per cent higher than the 40 vehicles a day originally planned.</p>

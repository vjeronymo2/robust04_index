			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KILAUEA VOLCANO DESTROYS 82ND HOME  </P> <P> Lava from Kilauea Volcano torched another Hawaii Island home Thursday, the 82nd  destroyed during its current eruption, and continued moving toward other  dwellings, authorities said.  </P> <P> A house in the Kalapana Gardens subdivision was ignited less than 12 hours  after another home a short distance away burned Wednesday, said Bruce Butts of  the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency.  </P> <P> The flow was moving toward another home that was about 350 feet away, Butts  said.  </P> <P> "This is a killer for the residents," Civil Defense Director Harry Kim said  from a command post set up at a park in Kalapana, on the southeastern coast of  the island. "It is painstakingly slow. This is real high stress," he said.  </P> <P> The lava was coming from the north and was following the path of another flow  that destroyed two homes on April 4. In all, the volcano has destroyed six  homes in the Kalapana area this month.  </P> <P> The latest destruction brings to 82 the number of dwellings claimed by the  volcano since it began erupting in January, 1983.  </P></p>

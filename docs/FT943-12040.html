			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Expansion at Filofax with Pounds 5.3m purchase of Henry Ling Filofax Group, the USM-quoted personal organiser concern, yesterday announced an expansion into the greetings cards business with the Pounds 5.3m acquisition of Henry Ling, the privately-owned stationery company. Filofax, which has embarked on an aggressive acquisition strategy in the past 12 months, is funding the transaction by raising Pounds 3.8m from a vendor placing of 2m new ordinary shares at 186p. It has also agreed to issue 764,185 shares to Ling's directors, who will remain in place, and has set aside a further Pounds 100,000 to cover share options held by its employees. The move follows two months of talks with the Kent-based group, which has specialised in fine art greeting cards since the early 1970s. Mr Robin Field, Filofax chief executive, said the two companies served common customers and could establish a strong presence among retailers such as WH Smith and Ryman. 'Greeting cards are the largest and still one of the fastest growing categories in the personal stationery market, and Lings is one of the most active competitors with a brand name that is very widely recognised and well respected,' he said. In the year to March 31, Lings made profits before tax and interest of Pounds 750,000 on turnover of Pounds 5.8m. Filofax shares closed up 4p at 198p. Dealings in the enlarged group are expected to begin on July 29.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana exporters 'devastated' LATIN AMERICAN banana exporters will be 'devastated' by the decision in December by the European Community to set tariffs on banana imports from the region, a meeting of the Union of Banana Exporting Countries has concluded. The union claims 174,000 workers will lose their jobs as a result of the EC decision, which fixed a 2m tonne quota for Latin American exporters at a reduced duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 80) a tonne, and a hefty Ecu850 tariff - about 170 per cent - on exports above that level. A study presented by the union says the new EC banana regime, forged to protect traditional Caribbean exporters to the EC and at the same time to move towards a tariff-based system of regulating imports, will pull 33,600 hectares (83,000 acres) out of banana production, 12 per cent of the total area planted, in its seven member countries - Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and Venezuela. Mr Enrique Betancourt, executive director of the union, says export volumes will fall by 30 per cent from the 1992 level of 2.6m tonnes. He makes no mention, however, of the fact that banana exports to the EC from Latin America surged rapidly between 1989 and 1992 as exporters positioned themselves for expected liberalisation of the EC banana market on creation of the single market on January 1 1993. Exports surged by 20 per cent over that period, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shiny Li] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong's top policy makers are skeptical of  recent conciliatory moves by China to resolve some of the  biggest disagreements over the territory's future after 1997.    Privately, senior officials have voiced doubts over  Beijing's  surprise announcement this week that the rows over funding for  the new Chek Lap Kok airport and the fate of 38 military sites  in Hong Kong could be resolved rapidly.    Senior government sources said: "Don't put too much store by  China's recent statements. We have to wait and see."    They said they did not expect those issues -- under  negotiation for some years to be resolved so quickly.    China and Britain have yet to reach agreement over the  future  of the military sites, although there has been "good progress"  during the 16th round of expert talks.    The Sino-British talks will be concluded today.    Briefed on the progress of negotiations, the Executive  Council expressed reservations over a Chinese proposal that the  council provide a written commitment that sites not used for  military purposes after 1997 will be turned over to the Special  Administrative Region (SAR) for commercial use.    Britain had previously insisted on a formal agreement.    Another sticking point, sources said, was the budget for the  new naval base on Stonecutters Island and facilities of other  military sites.    Even though the two sides had agreed that the size of the  new  naval base would be reduced, the Chinese side never spelt out  what would be the exact budget for building the naval port and  the facilities of other military sites, such as dormitories for  the People's Liberation Army (PLA).    The sources said the government had a "reasonable" amount in  mind and would try to lobby the legislators party by party for  funding support.    Also yesterday, it was announced that the plenary Joint  Liaison Group (JLG) meeting would take place from 21 to 23 June.</p>

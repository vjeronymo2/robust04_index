			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Sport: The Welsh dragon must roar - Rugby Union ELEVEN weeks ago I sat in the press box at Twickenham filled with apprehension as England faced Australia in the final of the World Cup. England had played heroically to defeat France and Scotland in eight days - away from home, at that - but now, surely, their number was up against the most gifted all-round team in the event. So Australia's victory was not unexpected (they had beaten England 40-15 only a few months earlier). What was a surprise was England's stubborn resistance. They outplayed the Australians in the second half when facing the wind and outscored them by two penalties to one. Had England played to their forwards, who were colossal that November afternoon, as they had in their two previous matches, they could have beaten the Aussies. But they did not. Instead they contributed enormously to a thrilling final that did as much for rugby around the world as anyone could have wished. Now here we go again. This afternoon England face Scotland at Murrayfield and Wales play Ireland at Lansdowne Road. The 1991-92 five nations' championship will not equal the World Cup in many aspects, if any. The standard of play will be lower, the players less well-prepared and motivated, but it is certain to add a bit of zing to life between now and March 21. During the World Cup, Finlay Calder, the Scottish captain, said he thought the championship would diminish in significance in coming years, overshadowed by the World Cup. I think he is wrong. The World Cup has raised the public's awareness of the game and thus of the five nations. Rugby has never been so popular; as a result, this championship is the most widely anticipated ever. Every ground will be full for the eight matches (610,000 spectators will attend in all, paying Pounds 16m). England's home matches at Twickenham could have been sold out three times over. What makes the 1991-92 five nations so interesting are the questions that can be asked: can England, under new coach Dick Best, win the grand slam again? The odds are against them, even though they are the best team. Successive slams have been won only three times in 82 years. How will Scotland fare without the magnificent back row that was together for 22 matches and outstanding scrum-half Gary Armstrong? Was Ireland's stunning performance against the Australians in the World Cup quarter-finals a fluke? The Irish have more match winners and more depth than for years and they have, as Yeats said, 'still the indomitable Irishry'. What will these virtues bring them in the coming weeks? A much more significant question is whether Wales can make significant progress towards parity with the other countries instead of being their whipping boys. This is an important matter to me. I am a Welshman. I was born in Wales of Welsh parentage. My grandfather was involved in selecting schoolboy players in Wales and remembers choosing a promising full-back named Vivian Jenkins. I went to school in south Wales and on holiday in north Wales. I have sung Welsh in Wales. I am Welsh from top to toe. There was a time when I would have said it was good for Wales to lose a match. It would puncture the complacency that existed around Cardiff. For example, it would have been better for Wales if they had been run into the ground by England in that notorious match in 1980, the match in which Paul Ringer was sent off early on. Instead, a sordid game went down in Wales's history as a glorious defeat. Wales's third-place finish in the first World Cup in 1987 was also unfortunate, for it papered over the cracks in their game. 'Well, boys, we can't be that bad can we if we came third in the World Cup,' went the argument. But now, I have had enough of defeats. I am desperate for a Welsh victory. Just as it used to be said that English rugby was strongest when Gloucester, Coventry and Northampton were at their best, so British rugby is strongest when Welsh rugby is at its best. Welsh rugby is the heartbeat of the game in Europe. If Welsh rugby was as strong as it was 15 or 20 years ago, the British Lions would be unbeatable. When Welsh rugby is weak, as it is now, British rugby is diminished by far more than one quarter. 'When Wales are out of rugby, rugby is out of sorts,' says Tony O'Reilly. Welsh rugby is so out of sorts at present that only one Welshman would get into a British Lions' side. The good news for those from the land of the leek is that Alan Davies has set about his duties as coach to the national team with flair and vision. He replaced the Stakhanovite coaching techniques of his predecessor with a lighter, defter touch. He raised the players' confidence, tried to make rugby a game to enjoy, not endure. He has employed sportsmen and coaches from other disciplines to talk to his players about fitness and has recruited some of the most influential names from Welsh rugby of the past two decades to help. Whether it will be sufficient for Wales to achieve Davies's target of winning one of their four matches in the five nations remains to be seen. Wales have to play France at home, which is far better than facing them in Paris. England, however, must be faced at Twickenham. How Wales will set about the task of countering the twin towers of Martin Bayfield and Wade Dooley, England's gigantic locks is just one question that will be answered in the next five weeks. All I want is the start of a Welsh revival, a sign of something to sing about. A strong Welsh team is good for the game. No one can deny that, not even an Englishman.</p>

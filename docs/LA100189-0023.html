			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GIRL IN THE PHOTOGRAPH  </P> <P> I am a Vietnam vet and a retired U.S. Naval officer. I am shocked that you  would run such a blatant piece of propaganda as Judith Coburn's "The Girl in  the Photograph" (Aug. 20). Yes, I feel sorry for Kim Phuc. But is her pain any  greater than that being suffered by the men still being held captive in  Southeast Asia? Is her trauma any more severe than that of the families of my  brothers whose fates have been withheld by the beasts of Hanoi? Should I  welcome her and her "mission of reconciliation" until my friends come home or I  know what happened to them? I think not.  </P> <P> HUGH R. TAYLOR, Los Angeles  </P></p>

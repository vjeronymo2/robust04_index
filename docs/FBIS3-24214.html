			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergei Strokan: "Economic Missionaries From the </F> USA Coming to Russia"; first paragraph is introductory paragraph]    [Text] An American organization has suggested an original  form of cooperation to Russian entrepreneurs: it will find  Western specialists and pay for their work at Russian  enterprises.    "The purpose of our organization is to mobilize the  knowledge  and resources of the US private sector for assisting reforms in  Central Europe," says Maureen Kiser, official representative of  the Citizens Democracy Corps (CDC) in Moscow. "We are working on  the assumption that the transition to the market implies not  only reforms at the macro-level, but also day-to-day work at the  level of enterprises, public organizations and municipal  services."    The Citizens Democracy Corps is an American noncommercial,  nongovernmental organization whose Executive Committee includes  former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former US  Ambassador in Russia Robert Strauss, many prominent Congressmen,  industrialists and scientists. It is financed by the state-owned  US Agency of International Development (USAID) which has  allotted 2.2 million dollars for the Corps' programmes. These  programmes envisage the extension of aid by highly skilled  consultants from the USA.    A distinctive feature of the CDC program is that it  envisages  the extension of aid in the shape of business advice on a pro  bono basis. The Corps' staff members identify what specialists  are needed for a particular enterprise and undertake all  subsequent work to complete the Russian applications. They find  specialists in the USA and pay the cost of air tickets.  Customers must only offer local transportation, provide housing  and an interpreter.    One more feature of the programme is its volunteers. They  are  Americans who desire to share their time and knowledge with  those who could utilize it in Russia.    The work of the Citizens Democracy Corps is carried out on  the basis of two main programmes. The first -- Business  Entrepreneur -- is geared to small and medium-size businesses.  "We do not impose our model, but explain things which are the  abc's of any successful entrepreneurship making it possible to  bring out competitive products," says Robert C. Jacoby, director  of the Business Entrepreneur program in Moscow.    The second programme -- Citizens Volunteer Program --  focuses  on strengthening the economic basis of public and private  democratic institutions. This programme is used to render  assistance to local authorities in areas such as local economic  development and institution supporting privatization.    The selection of Russian customers is highly competitive.  "For the time being we select a mere 10 percent of the total  number of applications, counting on promising enterprises which  seriously desire to reach out to the world market," says Robert  C. Jacoby about his programme.    What requirements must an enterprise meet? The number of its  employees vary from 50 to 1,500, the enterprise must have been  privatized or be in the process of privatization, with priority  being given to producer enterprises. Besides, the leadership of  the enterprise must be receptive to new ideas. At present and in  the next few months the Business Entrepreneur program will be  carried out the most actively in Moscow, the Moscow Region and  Samara.    The Citizens Democracy Corps has been active in Russia since  July 1992. Here are but a few examples of its cooperation with  Russian partners.    Administration of the Nizhniy Novgorod Region    Barbara Chronovski, business consultant with  international experience, has helped in appraising the  investment proposals of individual enterprises and in selecting  the most attractive of them for the CEETEX-94 Exhibition in  London.

The samples of  products were sent to the USA. The second consultant, Paul  Kirschner, carried out a financial analysis of the activities of  one of Lima's subunits and compiled a business plan.

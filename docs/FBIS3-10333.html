			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Ana de Molina said yesterday that  the public workers' trade unions will not accept any government  proposal regarding their salary demands because the salary issue  is only a pretext for a movement to destabilize the government.    The minister said the union leaders will not accept a bonus  or a 100-, 200-, or 300-quetzal wage increase because obviously  the salary hike is not the real reason why the government is  being pressured. "If there was a genuine desire to find a  solution to the problem, the situation would be different," de  Molina affirmed.    The finance minister said it still cannot be determined who  is behind the destabilizing movement, adding that several fronts  have been opened against the current administration. "There is  invasion of land in the area of agriculture, kidnappings in the  area of security, strikes in the area of labor, and limitations  on the finance minister to obtaining resources. This cannot be  a mere coincidence," Ana de Molina asserted.    The minister declared that the position expressed by the  economic cabinet on Tuesday remains unchanged; specifically, no  salary negotiating process is being held with union  representatives. The issue must be treated as part of the Great  National Agreement (GAN) proposed by President Ramiro De Leon  Carpio.    The minister argued that a wage increase for all state  workers cannot be called a coherent salary policy because a  salary hike program includes a review of the efficiency and  profile of the employee as well as his abilities.    She added that by reorganizing the executive branch there  could be room for a reclassification of wages for those who  deserve it.    The minister also said that if the government's offer of a  50-quetzal wage increase for workers earning less than 2,000  quetzales does not meet workers' expectations, it still  represents a gain for workers and an expense of 120 million  quetzales annually for the state treasury.    The government proposal was to increase basic salaries by 50  quetzales and reduce the 360-quetzal bonus for fiscal  collections by 100 quetzales, a proposal made previously by the  National Federation of Public Employees Unions (FENASEP) and  accepted by the government. Public workers, however, rejected  the aforementioned offer.  <H5>  Bureaucrats Reject 50-Quetzal Increase </H5>   Leaders of FENASEP and FENASTEG [National Federation of  State  Workers Unions] as well as leaders of other state labor unions  yesterday rejected the 50-quetzal hike proposed by the  government to solve the labor conflict.    The bureaucrats termed the salary increase "an insult to the  working class."    FENASTEG Secretary General Felix Hernandez said: "The  50-quetzal hike proposed by the government does not meet the  aspirations or expectations of state workers."  <H5>  FENASEP Will Not Talk With the Economic Cabinet </H5>   The FENASEP leadership was scheduled to meet yesterday with  the economic cabinet. However, the labor leader explained that  they had changed their mind because "they are fed up" with those  officials.</p>

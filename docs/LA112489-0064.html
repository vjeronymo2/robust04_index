			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEAUTY AND THE BEST;  </P> <P> BUCOLIC SETTING BELIES TOUGH TRAIL AWAITING RANGER CADETS  </P> <P> The dense pine forest is alive with birds chirping merrily, with deer,  chipmunks, raccoon and other wildlife -- an ideal setting for a state park  ranger academy.  </P> <P> For the handful of cadet rangers attending the William Penn Mott Junior  Training Center, however, the serene setting is somewhat deceptive. Enrollment  here represents the culmination of a long, difficult struggle.  </P> <P> It is one of the hardest schools in the state to get into.  </P> <P> "Competition to become a state park ranger is unbelievable," sighed Carol  Provost of San Diego. She ought to know. She tried for six years before being  accepted to the academy.  </P> <P> Provost, 30, is one of 15 women and 11 men now enrolled as ranger cadets at the  state Department of Parks and Recreation training center. They were selected  from a list of more than 2,000 applicants for the eagerly sought park ranger  jobs.  </P> <P> They are halfway through an 18-week course for new rangers. Provost has a  bachelor of science degree in resources management. She has been a seasonal  ranger for the U.S. Forest Service and for the Parks Department the last six  summers.  </P> <P> "Many of my classmates say being here is the biggest accomplishment of their  lives. There are a lot of pitfalls. As many as 10% of the class usually washes  out before the 18 weeks are completed. For me, my biggest accomplishment will  be when I graduate, put on my Stetson and go to work as a ranger in one of the  state parks," Provost said.  </P> <P> California has 750 rangers staffing 250 park units. "We go into this thing for  a sense of fulfillment, not for the money," said Jay Hamann, 54, who graduated  from the ranger academy last February, the oldest graduate in the 20-year  history of the training center.  </P> <P> Cadets are paid $1,800 a month. Rangers earn between $22,404 and $33,396 a  year, depending on experience.  </P> <P> Minimum age to become a ranger is 21. There is no maximum age limit. An  applicant must have completed at least 60 units of college study and be  physically fit. Oral and written exams are given, and there is psychological  screening.  </P> <P> Many ranger cadets have had previous experience working as seasonal rangers  with the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management  or state Department of Parks and Recreation, or have worked as rangers for  county or city parks, as firefighters for the California Department of Forestry  or as correctional officers. Many have college degrees, and a few have done  graduate work.  </P> <P> Persistence and patience are a prerequisite to becoming a ranger cadet. Many  try for years before being accepted. Hamann, now a ranger at Ocotillo Wells  State Vehicular Recreation Area in San Diego County, had been an applicant  eight years before he was finally accepted.  </P> <P> He is married and has five children and four grandchildren. He spent three  years in the Marines, was a teacher-principal for a rural elementary school in  Sierraville for nine years, taught in other schools and worked 10 summers as a  seasonal ranger with the U.S. Forest Service.  </P> <P> "I love working outdoors with the public. I know I'm older than dirt to begin a  new career, but I believe I have a lot of good years left and am certain I can  make a valuable contribution to the state park system in California as a  ranger," Hamann said.  </P> <P> For him, the toughest part of his training as a ranger cadet was the physical  fitness requirements, "the endurance runs, the obstacle course, climbing walls  and fences that I had to do in order to graduate -- but I made it. The Marines  put a lot of that into me."  </P> <P> Dave Matthews, 23, of Novato tried for three years before becoming a ranger  cadet. He has a degree in recreation administration and worked as a seasonal  employee with the National Parks Service. Sylvia Ramos, 33, has a degree in  physical anthropology, is married to a state game warden and has an 8-year-old  daughter. She waited four years before being accepted, working for a year as a  ranger with the Ventura County Parks Department and for three years as a  seasonal worker with the state Parks Department.  </P> <P> Cadet Elizabeth McDaniel, 31, from Tierrasanta in San Diego County, is the  mother of three children. Her husband is a career man in the Navy. She studied  for three years at the University of Guam and worked as a correctional officer  for two years at the Ventura County Jail. She tried to become a ranger for four  years before being accepted. "I love state parks and enjoy working with the  public," McDaniel said.  </P> <P> Each year, there are one or two ranger cadet classes at the Mott training  center, depending upon need, as well as more than 20 other educational programs  for Parks Department employees. Broc Stenman, 42, a 16-year veteran of the  Parks Department, has been the director of the training center for seven years.  </P> <P> The academy began accepting students in 1969 in a small cottage here in Pacific  Grove. At dedication ceremonies in 1974 for the training center, made up of  three residential lodges, classrooms and administrative offices, the  then-director of parks and recreation, William Penn Mott Jr., declared:  </P> <P> "For the first time in any state, a central facility has been built  specifically to provide basic and advanced educational programs for people who  operate and manage state parks, beaches and recreational areas." The center was  renamed in Mott's honor later when he was director of the National Parks  Service.  </P> <P> According to Stenman, to this day "no other state park department has a  facility or program approaching California's."  </P> <P> The first 530 hours for a ranger cadet are spent completing the Police Officers  Standards Training Program, a course required by many law enforcement agencies.  This part of the training includes instructions in community relations, law,  evidence, communications, vehicle operations, force and weaponry, defensive  tactics, arrest control procedures, criminal investigation, custody and  physical fitness.  </P> <P> Then comes 160 hours studying state park procedures, management policies,  equipment operation and fire prevention and suppression, as well as learning  about wildlife, park environment and the history of parks.  </P> <P> Field trips are made to parks for hands-on experience. Cadets receive 12 hours'  college credit upon completing the course.  </P> <P> In addition to the 26 ranger cadets now enrolled, there are seven state park  lifeguards, who are also required to take ranger classes, in attendance. Also  taking the course are three men and three women advancing to park  superintendent positions who lack experience as rangers or peace officers.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In regard to the third comment, legislation passed subsequent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Law 100&hyph;435 further defined the requirements regarding joint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications for GA and food stamps. Section 1740 of the Leland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act modified the combined application form requirement in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11(i)(3) of the Food Stamp Act to require a combined GA and food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stamp application form only in States that have a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statewide GA application form. The Department implemented this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision in the December 4, 1991, final rule (56 FR 63597) which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented the categorical eligibility and application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the Leland Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A fourth commenter recommended that the Department withhold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval of joint applications which require clients to answer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questions irrelevant to the Food Stamp Program if they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying for food stamps only. The commenter felt that clients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be informed that answers to those questions are optional.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees that any joint application must be clear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enough to afford applicants the option of answering only those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questions relevant to the program or programs for which they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying. The Department is amending the regulatory language at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7 CFR 273.2(b)(3) to add this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Application Process_Verification_7 CFR 273.2(f) and 273.21(j)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 311 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 and the interim rule published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 7, 1989, implemented five provisions pertaining to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verification of application information supplied by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household. The interim provisions required that State agencies:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Provide all applicant households with a clear written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement explaining what the household must do to cooperate in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtaining verification and completing the application; (2) assist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each applicant household in obtaining verification and completing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the application process; (3) not require households to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple sources of verification when the household has already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided verification which adequately supports statements on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application (although a State agency may require households to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide additional verification when the State agency determines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that existing verification is incomplete, inaccurate or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent); (4) not deny an application solely because a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person outside of the household (who is not a person outside of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the household because of a specific disqualification action or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ineligible status) fails to cooperate with the State agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing of the application; and (5) process applications, if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household cooperates by providing information, by taking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate steps to verify information otherwise required to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verified under the Food Stamp Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter felt that clarification is needed regarding whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a State agency must provide applicants with a general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verification statement or a specific verification statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tailored to each applicant household (7 CFR 273.2(c)(5)). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes the preamble to the interim rule was quite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clear in encouraging State agencies to develop a general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement that could be given to all applicant households, rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than a written statement which would need to be tailored to each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant household.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the interim rule provided guidelines that must be used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing the general verification notice, the Department wishes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to promote greater conformity among State agency-designed notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure that applicant households are consistently informed of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the necessary documents needed for verification of information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this final action amends 7 CFR 273.2(c)(5) to add a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that the State agency, at a minimum, include in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general verification notice examples of the types of documents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the household should provide and an explanation of the period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time the documents should cover.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Survey of International Standards (5): Gulf of misunderstanding - Frank McGurty sorts out some of the confusion in the US system AT FIRST glance, the American system for setting industrial and commercial standards is intimidating. In contrast with the UK, where a single body - the British Standards Institution - has a monopoly over standard writing, there are some 450 separate groups, from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers to the American Dental Association, involved in making the rules and specifications to be followed by companies doing business in the US. Many outsiders view the system as confusing. Some are suspicious of the inability or reluctance of American industry to streamline what is by any measure a highly fragmented process. They believe the system's centre of gravity - the American National Standards Institute - needs to be strengthened to bring more coherence to the system. 'There is a gulf of understanding between the two sides of the Atlantic over the role of standards,' admits Mr Stephen Cooney, a senior policy director at the National Association of Manufacturers, an umbrella organisation representing the interests of US industry. Mr Cooney believes Europeans have historically viewed standards as a barrier to trade. Indeed, standard-setting within the EC has proved a pivotal issue in negotiations leading to the establishment of the single European market. This perspective has flavoured attitudes towards the US process. In contrast, he says, American companies generally have a more trusting attitude towards the enterprise of standard setting, long considered an essential ingredient in fostering inter-state commerce. A bicycle manufacturer in Brunswick, Maine, to take one example, can feel confident buying frames from a Pasadena, California, manufacturer because the American Welding Society has established about 100 standards for metal welds. Most of those involved with the business of standard development agree that the reason the US system has won such broad support is its voluntary, self-regulatory approach. Market forces, rather than government oversight, are usually the catalyst for an industry to establish a new standard. However, 'the hot breath of government regulators', as Mr Cooney points out, sometimes spurs the private sector into action. Mr George Willingmyre, vice-president of ANSI, which represents the US in international standards organisations, describes the process as 'complementary'. If government agencies, such as the Federal Drug Administration or the Consumer Products Safety Commission, 'can meet their mission by encouraging the marketplace to develop standards on their own, they will do so'. Federal law requires the government to defer to any voluntary standard if an acceptable one exists. For the private sector, the development of standards on a voluntary basis has some decided advantages. It allows industry to play a dominant role in shaping the standard as well as in revising it to reflect subsequent changes in technology and market conditions. This bottom-to-top orientation is typified by the work of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, one of the most active of the standard writing bodies in the US. At the end of the last century, the ASME set the system's guiding precedent in response to growing concern over the safety of heating boilers, which were exploding at the rate of 1,000 a year. A voluntary committee, with representatives of the industry, was convened to develop a criteria for the accreditation of manufacturers. The ASME standard is now recognised in about 80 countries. Since then, ASME committees in a range of engineering fields have been engaged in developing two other types of standards. The first include performance test codes - that is, determining how a product such a compressor should perform, and drawing up criteria on design, manufacture and testing to ensure that the product meets the specified level of performance. The second category is dimensional standards for fasteners, machine threads and the like. The hallmark of the system, its advocates claim, is its openness. What is known as 'a balance of communities', including manufacturers and users of their products, is required. The intention is to prevent a standard from becoming a tool for an industry's most powerful players to freeze out the competition. The process must also allow ample opportunity of public review and comment. 'Standards are set for public use, so the public has a right to be part of the process,' says Mr Mel Greene, ASME's associate executive director. ANSI, a privately funded, non-profit organisation, stands at the centre of the process, though its presence is hardly imposing. It has no direct role in setting standards, but instead sets the standards to which American standard-setters are expected to conform. Its criteria relate to process rather than substance. ANSI stipulates that a standard be developed under the principles of balanced interests, consensus, public notice and rights of appeal. The process must be 'open to all interested parties'. If the method conforms to these rules, ANSI may then certify the result as an 'American national standard' - which forms the basis for any product's acceptance in the US market. Last year, 570 new national standards were approved, bringing the total number in ANSI's register to almost 11,000. ANSI's power to co-ordinate activities of the various standard setting bodies, however, is less than absolute. The institute's remit is to help a standard-setting body to determine if a competing body is working on a parallel standard, or if one already exists. However, some members of the standard-setting community believe that ANSI, as a private-sector organisation with no official authority, can in effect only minimise the overlap of its members' activities. It does this through a series of standards boards - medical devices, construction and health and safety and the like - to facilitate consultation among standard developers. Dr Wallace Read, IEEE's vice-president for standards, says the relatively passive role of ANSI sometimes results in unnecessary duplication by rival standard setters, as well as excessive delays in implementing acceptable standards. But Mr Cooney of National Association of Manufacturers defends the US approach. 'The system works well,' he insists, 'There is no need to make it tight and neat' just because some are uncomfortable with its complexities. None the less, he accepts that US industry must take a more international approach to standard writing. In this regard, he points out, US standard writers are increasingly looking for a complementary international standard before formulating their own. Second, government-to-government efforts are under way to improve the ability of foreign companies to test their products against US national standards, and vice versa.</p>

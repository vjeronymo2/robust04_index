			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / HK unveils tax cuts package Hong Kong yesterday announced cuts in corporate and personal taxes after producing a budget surplus this year of HKDollars 15bn (USDollars 1.9bn). The government had predicted a HKDollars 3.4bn deficit. Sir Hamish Macleod, Hong Kong's financial secretary, presenting the budget for the 1994/95 year, said: 'I am convinced that a major reason for our success is that we have not succumbed to the temptation to spend money simply because we have it.' The surplus had been underpinned by strong growth in stock and property markets, he added. In addition, rising exports had been buoyed in part by Hong Kong's ties with southern China's growing economy. A further budget surplus of HKDollars 8bn is predicted for the coming year. In a surprise move the financial secretary cut the corporate tax rate by one percentage point to 16.5 per cent. This returned it to the level of two years ago when, in his first budget, he raised it. He also over-indexed personal tax allowances, some by as much as three times the inflation rate. The tax cuts are made against a background of rising output and stable growth in prices. Sir Hamish predicted that gross domestic product, after allowing for inflation, would grow by 5.5 per cent this year, the same as in 1993. Inflation would average 8.5 per cent, the same as last year. The government would conduct a thorough review of company law in Hong Kong, Sir Hamish added. It would extend the law against insider trading to derivatives, such as warrants and stock options. By the end of the last full year of British rule (1996/97), Hong Kong would have accumulated fiscal reserves of HKDollars 120bn, some HKDollars 95bn greater than Britain promised China in 1991 that it would leave behind. His medium-term forecast for the economy suggested that in China's first year of administration of Hong Kong (1997/98) the colony's fiscal reserves might amount to HKDollars 141bn. Including the accumulated reserves held in Hong Kong's land fund for China, total reserves would amount to HKDollars 270bn. In spite of the level of accumulated reserves, Sir Hamish said it would be wrong for the Hong Kong government to fund completely the colony's planned airport and connecting railway. 'When a project produces a reasonable revenue stream on which you can borrow, then that's the right thing to do,' Sir Hamish said. 'I hope that when (China) looks at the debt in relation to our fiscal position, they will be reassured.' Britain and China meet today to discuss the government's fourth financial plan for Hong Kong's new airport. It provides for a government injection of HKDollars 60bn in equity, and debt of HKDollars 23bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HONG KONG BUDGET  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Preliminary       Forecast                                                estimate            for                                                for 1993           1994                                                     (%)            (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Growth rate in real terms:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Private consumption expenditure                     7.2            7 Government consumption expenditure                  2.2            3.5 Gross domestic fixed capital formation              5.5            5.2 Total exports of goods                             13.0           16.5 Domestic exports                                   -5.1           -2 Re-exports                                         19.8           22 Imports of goods                                   12.8           16.7 Exports of services                                 8.1            9 Imports of services                                 7.0            8 Gross domestic product                              5.5            5.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rate of increase in:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GDP deflator                                        7.8            8 Domestic demand deflator                            5.7            7.5 Consumer price index                                8.5            8.5  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

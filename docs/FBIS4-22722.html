			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, special representative of </F> the president of the Russian Federation in the former Yugoslavia  and deputy minister of foreign affairs of Russia, by Yelena  Shchedrunova; place and date not given: "Vitaliy Churkin:  Negotiations Should Be Conducted Before, Not After, War Starts"]    [Text] The EC recognized Bosnia-Hercegovina's  independence two years ago. This decision in fact provoked the  war that is still lacerating this Balkan republic. SEGODNYA  offers on this topic an interview with Vitaliy Churkin, special  representative of the president of the Russian Federation in the  former Yugoslavia and deputy minister of foreign affairs of  Russia, who returned from Zagreb the day before yesterday with a  new diplomatic victory: With his direct assistance the  leadership of Croatia and the leaders of the Serbs of Krajina  reached agreement on an end to armed operations.    [Shchedrunova] What, for all that, was the cause of the war  in Bosnia, in your opinion?    [Churkin] There was a historical structure going by the name  of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, which, by  virtue of certain political conditions, lasted for several  decades. Then, when, in 1980, Tito died, it gradually began to  weaken, and many experts began to express fears that it would  collapse. This in fact happened. At the time of the  disintegration of the Socialist Federative Republic of  Yugoslavia the most vulnerable spot was Bosnia-Hercegovina,  where three national groups with complex historical relations  were most closely intermingled. And they were unable at this  difficult time to achieve political solutions that would have  made it possible to avoid war. The fact that the international  community moved in haste to recognize, specifically,  Bosnia-Hercegovina did not, most likely, help either. This was  done on the basis of the parties' preliminary accord on the plan  of the Portuguese diplomat Cutellero. This plan, which was  devised in March 1992, is reminiscent of the present proposal  concerning the creation of a union of three states. After Bosnia  had been recognized by the EC, a succession of other  recognitions followed. The intention was very good--to support  by the authority of the international community the new  realities--but the result proved the opposite. The Muslims and  Croats adopted a decision on independence without the consent of  the Serbs. A war, which subsequently developed according to its  own laws, began. It is not only soldiers who are fighting.  Hostility has begun among the peaceful inhabitants also.    [Shchedrunova] One has the impression that the Serbs have,  for all that, won this war.    [Churkin] Well, yes, certainly. There need be no doubt about  this. This is their tragedy, to a certain extent. Because while  they are asking why the international community is up in arms  against them--they are capturing territory. They now control 72  percent of the territory, although even by their estimates they  are entitled to 64 percent. Yes, in the military plane they have  proven more successful. As for the question of who the aggressor  in this war is, I have from the very outset employed the  following wording, which was recently repeated by President  Clinton, incidentally: It is a civil war aggravated by outside  interference. This also is understandable. These were, after  all, internal borders. And here is the conclusion the  international community needs to draw: Some realities in the  world exist independently of borders. Particularly when these  are borders within a mononational state. Borders are borders,  and the peoples lived cross-wise, paying no attention to them.  The border of the conflict did not coincide with the borders of  the republic. A more involved preliminary political period of a  search for solutions should have been negotiated, obviously,  before the proclamation of independence by the Muslims and  Croats and the world community's recognition of it.    [Shchedrunova] About the efforts of the world community.  Following the London conference, which afforded some prospects,  there has been a break in diplomatic work of many months.    [Churkin] This is, indeed, the case. It seems to me that a  principal reason for such a protracted conflict was the fact  that originally the format of the coordinating committee created  by the London conference was insufficiently convincing for the  parties. Because neither Russia nor the United States were  sufficiently vigorously engaged in this format. The United  Nations and the EC lacked, for all that, sufficient political  weight. Generally, granted all the respect for the EC, a  conclusion is that a serious crisis, even if it is purely  European, cannot be resolved by the EC independently. The  inclusion of heavy artillery in the shape of Russia and the  United States was needed. But under no circumstances can all  efforts be turned into a purely Russian-American operation.  Everything should be done in an alliance with the EC. And we  have now approached the most successful option here. It was  actually this new format--Russia, the United States, and the  international conference on the former Yugoslavia, that is, the  EC and the United Nations--which is at this stage the most  effective, most likely--which emerged in Zagreb. Although not  one guaranteeing rapid success. But I now have more of a feeling  that the parties themselves have approached the fact that it is  time to negotiate.    [Shchedrunova] As far as the relations of Russia and the  United States on this question are concerned. One sometimes has  the impression that certain actions of Russia have been inspired  by actions of the United States, that is, that Russia has tried  to keep pace with it, as it were.    [Churkin] I would not, to be honest, be opposed to such  "socialist competition" with the Americans in respect to who  would do more for a settlement of the situation in the former  Yugoslavia, provided that we worked together, keeping one  another informed. But as far as recent events (the signing of  the agreement on the creation of a Croatian-Muslim federation in  Washington and the agreement on a cease-fire between the Croats  and the Serbs in Krajina in the Russian Embassy in  Zagreb--Ye.Shch.) are concerned, this was pure coincidence.  Before my last tour of the "towns and villages," which began on  11 March, it never crossed my mind even that such a round of  negotiations would be organized in the Russian Embassy.  Everything was born in the course of conversations with Tudjman  and Milosevic, which left the impression that the parties were  really interested in finally signing an agreement. I jumped at  this.    [Shchedrunova] Your opinion of the development of the  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Churkin] There are three or four sore points, agreement on  which having been reached, the problem of the borders of the new  republics could be resolved. The most important point is  Sarajevo, where the parties' positions are directly opposite.  Whereas the Muslims are saying that Sarajevo "must be ours," the  Serbs are declaring that they cannot conceive of any kind of  agreement without part of Sarajevo. We see as a solution the  preservation of the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  and Sarajevo as the capital of this state. A capital consisting  of two parts. The problem, true, will be how to reestablish  normal life in the city in order that it not be divided. Despite  the fact that politically it would belong to two parts of one  and the same union. Specialists say that this is possible. But  the division of territories is, of course, a complex issue, and  rapid success is not to be expected here. As far as the plan for  the entry of the new state formations on the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina into a confederation with other states is  concerned, the proposal according to which the Croatian-Muslim  federation would form a confederation with Croatia, and the  Serbian Republic, with Serbia, would seem perfectly fair. That  is, Bosnia-Herzegovina would not wholly become part of a  confederation with anyone. The Croats are not objecting to this  plan.    [Shchedrunova] But this would be unprecedented in world  politics.    [Churkin] Yes, this is a unique plan, but perhaps it would  pave the way toward the solution of other conflicts also. But  this needs to be approached very cautiously, for we are talking  no more, no less, after all, about one state entering into  confederative relations with part of another state.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Plea for British Coal split before sell-off BRITISH COAL must be broken up before privatisation if the government is to avoid the mistakes made in previous flotations, Professor Colin Robinson of Surrey University said at a conference in London yesterday. Prof Robinson contradicted a claim by Mr Cecil Parkinson, a former energy secretary, at the same conference that privatisation had liberalised the electricity industry. 'There is almost as much government intervention as in the old days,' he said. National Power and PowerGen, the two privatised generators, were supposed to be commercial companies but had so much market share that Offer, the electricity industry watchdog, was having to regulate them closely. He said the government should aim to create genuine competition in the domestic coal and electricity industries by breaking up British Coal and by dismantling National Power and PowerGen.</p>

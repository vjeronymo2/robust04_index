			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic in TV video campaign BELL ATLANTIC, one of the seven 'Baby Bell' local US telephone companies, said yesterday it would seek the support of the Justice Department in a campaign to be allowed to poke a toe into the long-distance communications market so as to deliver video programmes to customers. The Baby Bells were spun off from long-distance carrier AT&amp;T in 1984 under a court-ordered anti-trust settlement which also forbade them to enter the long-distance market. Bell Atlantic is the first to make a filing of this kind to enter the long-distance market. Its move forms part of a battle between the US cable television and local telephone industries over which will provide information services and entertainment to the home in the 21st century. Bell Atlantic has developed several initiatives to deliver video to the home, but it said it needed relief from the ban on long distance operations to deploy these services in a cost-effective manner. It explained that it planned to use multi-million dollar digital servers for storing and forwarding video programming, and it would be most effective if these could be used beyond the major urban areas where it is allowed to carry calls. The views of the Clinton administration's Justice Department on the issue are unknown. But even if it backs Bell Atlantic, the company's request would still require the approval of Judge Harold Greene, the man who oversaw the break-up of AT&amp;T. He has generally opposed relaxing restrictions on the Baby Bells.</p>

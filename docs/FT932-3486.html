			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Observer: Out of the hunt When it comes to filling the chief executive's post at Barclays, the NatWest directors John Melbourn and John Tugwell may not be such hot tips as many in the City of London believe. Earlier this year, Barclays asked executive searchers Spencer Stuart to draw up a short-list for the job. The headhunters, however, had a longstanding relationship with NatWest, and accordingly asked the established client if they could take on the Barclays assignment. NatWest said it had no objection, so long as the headhunter did not feel it faced a conflict of interest - which of course was a warning to steer clear of NatWest staff when approaching candidates. Whereupon Spencer Stuart intimated that no one from the Action Bank would be on the list.</p>

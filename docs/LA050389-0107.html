			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> CONVICTION OVERTURNED IN DISNEYLAND MURDER  </P> <P> A state appeals court has overturned the second-degree murder conviction of a  reputed gang member who fatally shot a rival gang member in a Disneyland  parking lot in 1987.  </P> <P> The 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana ruled that jurors who convicted  Keleti Naea, 20, were not properly instructed about the lesser crime of  involuntary manslaughter.  </P> <P> Prosecutors must give Naea a new murder trial or reduce his conviction to  involuntary manslaughter, the justices said in the ruling issued this week.  </P> <P> Naea was sentenced to 17 years to life in state prison last year after his  conviction stemming from the March 17, 1987, shooting during a midnight gang  clash in the Disneyland parking lot.  </P> <P> Salesi Tai, 15, a reputed member of a Compton street gang, was shot four times  -- three in the back -- and later died at a hospital.  </P> <P> Naea contended that he thought the gun, which belonged to the victim, was a toy  when he picked it off the ground and fired at Tai.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unnattributed "special dispatch": "Wang Dan Ends His </F> Hunger Strike, But Says He Will Not Yield to Public Security  Police"]    [Text] Wang Dan, one of the leaders of the 1989  pro-democracy movement in Beijing and who was on a 48-hour  hunger strike in protest against public security police watching  him day and night, ended his "symbolic" action quietly at his  Beijing residence at 2100 yesterday evening. However, when  answering a question from a reporter of this newspaper by  long-distance telephone, Wang Dan said that he would certainly  escalate to a move of confrontation if the public security  police stepped up the above-said surveillance.    Wang Dan said he was feeling weak as his current hunger  strike was the longest he had experienced since 4 June 1989. As  it was anticipated, the public security police remained  indifferent. He thinks that his personal safety is less  guaranteed now than at any time before, including his time in  jail. His present situation is precisely as former U.S.  President Roosevelt said: "Living in the freedom of terror."  According to his judgment, the authorities around-the-clock  surveillance is aimed at controlling his remarks on one hand,  and threatening and intimidating him on the other. He believes  he has never said anything wrong or false, so he will not shut  his mouth because of that. However, he pointed out that if the  public security bureau's surveillance is stepped up, he would  employ another method to escalate his protest.    Wang Dan said that the public security's close watch of him  had caused a lot of inconvenience in his daily life. He was  unable to call on some friends whom he wanted to see, because  "no one is willing to have contact with policemen."    He also disclosed that when he returned to his home town in  Shandong around 4 June this year, he had stayed the night at an  inn, and now that inn has been closed up.</p>

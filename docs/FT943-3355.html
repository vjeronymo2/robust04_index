			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Royal Oak raises CDollars 100m for purchases Royal Oak Mines, the Vancouver-based gold producer which this summer launched a bold but unsuccessful bid for Lac Minerals, is raising CDollars 100m (USDollars 72.4m) in equity to finance other potential acquisitions. Royal Oak said yesterday it had agreed to sell 17.4m shares to a group of Canadian securities firms at CDollars 5.75 a share. The shares will then be sold to the public. The funds were required, the company said, to enable it to 'react promptly in the event that a desirable acquisition opportunity should emerge'. Royal Oak's CDollars 2.4bn bid for Lac would have been partly financed by a share issue. It eventually lost the struggle to American Barrick, but analysts predicted that Royal Oak's tenacious president Ms Peggy Witte would seek other opportunities. Among the possibilities are one or more of Lac's mines in North America, which are expected to be put up for sale by American Barrick. The underwriting group for the Royal Oak issue includes ScotiaMcLeod, Salomon Brothers Canada, First Marathon Securities and Midland Walwyn Capital.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Thorp go-ahead attacked in court The government's decision to give the go-ahead for the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant was legally flawed by an irrational failure of Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, to hold a public inquiry, the High Court was told yesterday. Mr Andrew Collins QC, for environmental group Greenpeace, told Mr Justice Potts: 'This is the most important radioactive discharge concern which there ever has been or is ever likely to be - at least in the foreseeable future.' Greenpeace and Lancashire County Council have launched a joint application for judicial review over the authorisation for the Pounds 2.8bn plant at Sellafield, Cumbria. Mr Collins urged the judge to declare unlawful the consultation process which led to British Nuclear Fuels being given approval for the plant. If Thorp went ahead, radioactive discharges into the air and the Irish Sea would occur as uranium and plutonium were separated from spent fuel. Greenpeace and Lancashire argue that without a public inquiry no authorising authority could properly agree to the proposed 'dramatic increases' in radioactive emissions, which could lead to many deaths. BNF rejects the allegations and insists that Thorp will operate within acceptable safety limits. Mr Collins said Greenpeace had been asking for a public inquiry ever since consultations on the plant were first announced in November 1992, but the request had consistently been turned down. One of BNF's grounds for not having an inquiry now was the cost - the company was losing more than Pounds 1m a week and would do so until the new plant became operational. Mr Collins said that if the government had acted as it should have done and held an inquiry at the appropriate time it would have been over by now. The hearing, which is expected to last five days, continues tomorrow.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Andrey Krasnoshchekov </F> and Konstantin Pribytkov]    [Text] Crans-Montana (Switzerland) June 18 TASS -- The West  should switch from aid to East European countries to mutually  advantageous and equal cooperation with them, Speaker of the  Byelorussian [Belarus] parliament Mechyslav Hryb said in an  interview with ITAR-TASS here on Saturday.    According to the speaker, equality in trade and economic  relations should mean, above all, "an increase or complete  abrogation by the West of export quotas", since only this can  evoke interest from both sides.    The idea of the need for establishing equal partnership  between East and West European countries key-noted the first two  days of the international forum in Crans-Montana devoted to  East-West relations. Forum participants spoke about this at  plenary meetings, seminars and at intervals between sessions.    In turn, Ivan Korotchenya, executive secretary of the  Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), said in an interview  with ITAR-TASS that the West's aid was inefficient to a great  extent. For instance, the refusal by Byelorussia to take  humanitarial aid has not virtually affected the situation in the  republic in any way.    Therefore, he noted, relations between CIS republics and  Western partners should be built on quite another basis: to  develop contacts at all levels --from small enterprises to  state-owned companies. "It is humiliating for our states to  receive just aid," the executive secretary said.    The forum is discussing specific projects of cooperation.  Korotchenya said that some delegations from CIS countries are  already discussing proposals from potential Western partners.    Speaking at a plenary meeting, Swiss Economics Minister  Jean-Pascal Delamuraz noted that success of international  cooperation would be determined, above all, by stability in East  European countries and consistency with which they would pursue  reforms.    Interdependence of the countries in the old world has  graphically demonstrated itself: The economic slump in the West  negatively told on export opportunities from Eastern Europe.    Commercial relations is an important factor for economic  growth. "Therefore, our aim should be the development of trade  with the East and not aid," he summed up his speech.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Moldavian [Moldova]  President  Mircea Snegur called attention to the fact that the present  forum considerably differs from other similar meetings: It  examines not only economic but also political problems.    "Economic reforms and the development of relations are  linked  here directly with measures to ensure political stability on the  continent," he stressed. This is of great interest for  Moldavia, since "it is forced to overcome the consequences of a  short armed conflict in 1992 up to this time".</p>

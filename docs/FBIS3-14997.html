The meeting was held in a constructive atmosphere, stated  Agrarian Party Deputy Chairman Mikhail Frolov. We favor social  justice for workers of the agricultural sector, the issuing of  additional benefits which are necessary for the development of  the agricultural sector. In this respect, the stance of the  president coincides with ours.    We came with a package of proposals, said Yefim Fiks,  chairman of the Party of Social Guarantees, and the president  suggested that edicts be drafted by us on the basis of our  proposals.

When Sergey Nikulin, presidential adviser for relations with  parties and public organizations, commented on this meeting, he  noted that Yuriy Mechkov asked all the participants to forward  proposals for candidates to vacancies in all state bodies. In  the opinion of Nikulin, the consolidation will make it possible  to create a powerful bloc supporting the course of the  president. This will be a new kind of legislature, he stressed.</p>

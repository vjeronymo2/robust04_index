			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL LIBRARIES A BASIC NEED  </P> <P> The recent financial problems of the Simi Valley Unified School District have  exposed one of the weakest links in our educational system, particularly here  in California: school libraries.  </P> <P> We hear of one horror story after another about the educational inadequacies of  our population. Most experts seem to agree that an emphasis on reading is  needed. Yet school libraries, an obvious reading resource, continue to exist  (or sometimes not exist) on inadequate funding for both books and personnel.  </P> <P> Now the Simi district proposes severe cutbacks for school libraries. The cry  "back to basics" is often heard. What could be more basic than books for the  students to read?  </P> <P> ALAN LANGVILLE  </P> <P> Moorpark  </P></p>

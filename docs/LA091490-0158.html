			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> CLINT EASTWOOD'S ACID TEST  </P> <P> You see, movies are all foolishness . . . an exercise in insanity . . . pure  madness. . . . But, as we're in this thing, well, we might as well bluff our  way through to the bitter end.  </P> <P>  -- John Wilson, in Peter Viertel's "White Hunter, Black Heart."  </P> <P> Films about moviemaking often veer between honey and gall: the sweetness of  self-celebration, the acid of iconoclasm. In "White Hunter, Black Heart"  (citywide), Clint Eastwood reaches for the acid. He's adapted a famous, bitter,  backstage roman a clef: Peter Viertel's scalding fictionalization of events  leading up to the making of "The African Queen." And he's cast himself in its  great central role: violently self-indulgent filmmaker John Wilson.  </P> <P> Wilson is modeled on John Huston, and the movie is a marriage of seeming  opposites. In 1953, when Viertel wrote "White Hunter," Huston was a rebel and  Hollywood outsider. The book -- which Viertel may have intended partly as  vengeance for a bad time and partly as a plea for a reckless, brilliant talent  to recover his own balance -- is a little poisonous.  </P> <P> Wilson is shown as a sublime egotist, stranding his company in the Belgian  Congo, while he scours the plains in pursuit of the "big tusker," the  magnificent bull elephant he wants as a trophy. Viertel's surrogate character  -- screenwriter "Pete Verrill" (played in the film by Jeff Fahey) -- is the  self-conscious voice of sanity and reason. And the characters obviously modeled  on Sam Spiegel (George Dzundza's Paul Landers), Katharine Hepburn (Marisa  Berenson's Kay Gibson) and Humphrey Bogart (Richard Vanstone's Phil Duncan) are  stunned or somewhat helpless bystanders.  </P> <P> Reading or watching "White Hunter, Black Heart," it's hard to imagine that "The  African Queen" was made at all -- much less that it became a major box-office  hit, Oscar-winner and well-beloved classic. Now, almost four decades later, we  see John Huston and his film -- even his obsessions -- in a different light.  Huston may have seemed a semi-legendary rogue in 1953. After his death, he's a  legend, pure and simple.  </P> <P> The moviemakers play on this -- even quoting actual dialogue from "The African  Queen" during the Wilson-Verrill script sessions and inventing a sequence where  Wilson takes the Queen on a test run and almost sends her over Victoria Falls.  Inevitably, a little reverence glazes over the criticism. Plot and dialogue are  intact -- "Hunter" lists Viertel as one of three screenwriters -- but the tone  has shifted. It becomes, more clearly, Wilson's tragedy.  </P> <P> Eastwood, playing Wilson, takes the biggest gamble of his career. He doesn't  play a new conception of Wilson, or Eastwood-as-Wilson. He actually plays John  Huston. He imitates the vocal timbre, the loose, aimlessly expansive hand  gestures, the mockingly grand manner, the avuncular "Hey, kids." Occasionally  the impersonation works shockingly well. In two scenes, when Wilson grins at a  soccer match or slumps exhausted after another unsuccessful hunt, the  resemblance is almost eerie.  </P> <P> But it's erratic. The mix of mannerisms is distracting; it might have been  better to soft-pedal them, take the role deeper inside. Sometimes, Eastwood  seems to be weaving languid gestures in the airy, arch manner of a Restoration  fop; he doesn't drink in interlocutors with his gaze the way Huston would. The  voices are a weird blend: Eastwood's light and pinched, where Huston's was a  slightly cracked organ, wheezing out ironic toccatas in a mash of Ohio drawl  and pure stage blarney.  </P> <P> If profligate, eloquent, life-gorging Huston was, for James Agee, "one of the  ranking grasshoppers of the Western Hemisphere," considerate Clint seems his  opposite: the model citizen, the ant. (Verrill is his more natural part.) Yet,  beneath every ant's skin, a grasshopper's heart may secretly beat, and vice  versa -- something Eastwood's "Bird" also suggested. This split is reflected in  the movie's spare, visually laconic style. It doesn't dwell on the landscapes,  the sun, the vibrant life around Wilson. Instead, it zeroes in on the  characters and conflict, fixes them in a cool, hard gaze that verges on the  clinical.  </P> <P> "White Hunter" is a movie about an obsessive artist, a moviemaker -- but the  story's dark joke is that the artist isn't obsessed with his own work, the  movie he's about to shoot. He's obsessed with the movie he's made of his life:  the willful, outrageous character he's created for himself. Like the classic  American adventurer of literature, he's pulled back by his community -- the  film crew -- and his "wife," the alienated screenwriter, trying to keep him on  the set and out of the savannah.  </P> <P> Wilson, a patriarch of flamboyant jokes, is a God who seems driven to become  his own Lucifer. But the movie also make it clear that he's a secret moralist,  a portrait that jells most strongly during Wilson's quietly furious put-down of  the anti-semitic Mrs. McGregor (Mel Martin), and his challenge of a burly hotel  manager who's been maltreating black servants. They're ferocious scenes,  impeccably acted. And they connect Wilson to Eastwood's previous roles: fantasy  heroes who actually deliver on their quixotic gestures.  </P> <P> "White Hunter, Black Heart" was not a great novel -- in some ways, it's not  even a good novel -- but it's always been first-rate movie material. And  perhaps it's wrong to complain that Eastwood hasn't made a perfect version of  it. The ideal "White Hunter" probably would have been shot around 1970, would  have starred Huston himself and Paul Newman as Verrill, and it would have been  directed by either Huston or Sam Peckinpah. But that "White Hunter" doesn't  exist and the one that Eastwood has made is a good, solid, admirable, deeply  felt movie.  </P> <P> It's well-acted -- not only by Eastwood, Fahey, Martin and Dzundza -- but by  Alun Armstrong as a sour location manager and Timothy Spall as a raffish pilot.  The last scene has withering power. And it's a movie that's about something:  the contradictions of the artist and American macho, the evils of racism, the  byzantine madness of some big-time movies. It's about exploitation and  betrayal, man's attacks on nature and the dark side of the adventurous spirit.  </P> <P> It's a fine film in many ways -- even if Huston's persona becomes Eastwood's  own big tusker: the prey he can't quite shoot. He doesn't bring back the Big  One, but he doesn't return empty-handed; intellectually and morally, there's  plenty of game for the pot.  </P> <P> 'WHITE HUNTER, BLACK HEART'  </P> <P> A Warner Bros. presentation of a Malpaso/Rastar production.

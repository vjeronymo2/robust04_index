			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Tory rail rebels back compromise THE GOVERNMENT last night appeared to have headed off a Tory backbench revolt over rail privatisation after Sir Keith Speed, leader of the potential rebel MPs, backed a compromise allowing British Rail to bid for some franchises. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, has tabled an amendment to a Lords amendment to the privatisation bill preventing BR bidding for any franchise for which there is a 'credible' alternative, either a management buy-out or a private-sector bidder. In practice the franchising director is unlikely to allow BR to bid for more than a few of the 25 franchise areas. But Mr MacGregor conceded last night that BR would now certainly continue to operate some services. Government officials said potential Tory dissidents who threatened to rebel over the original plans, under which BR would not have had the right to bid, had said they would support this latest move. Asked whether the partial retreat was simply aimed at preventing another backbench rebellion Mr MacGregor said: 'This is not a sleight of hand. It will still be possible for BR to bid (for franchises).' The Lords' amendment gave BR the right to bid for franchises. This was opposed by the government because it would give BR the ability to undercut competitors by cross-subsiding its bid with revenues from other services. Mr MacGregor is understood to believe his proposals will encourage buy-outs and prevent BR, which will not be able to cross-subsidise bids, from winning more than a small minority of the franchises. During an exchange at prime minister's questions Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, accused the government of 'blatant and discreditable' manoeuvres by introducing amendments to allow BR to bid for franchises, but under strict conditions. Mr Smith claimed the government was indulging in a 'cynical trick'. Mr John Major replied: 'You accuse us of shams while a Labour transport spokesman had accused the government of a U-turn - it can't be both.' Later Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour transport spokesman, wrote to the prime minister taking issue with him over his comments and saying no Labour frontbench spokesman had accused the government of such a U-turn. The franchises will be established gradually over the next few years. Mr MacGregor is understood to expect only one or two to be set up next year after BR has created 25 'shadow' franchises.</p>

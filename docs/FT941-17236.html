			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Merck shuffles top managers Merck, the US's biggest pharmaceuticals group, reshuffled its senior management team to give a prominent role to Mr Martin Wygod, chairman of the recently-acquired Medco Containment Services, writes Richard Waters. Mr Wygod, who sold his company last November for Dollars 6bn, has been given responsibility for all of Merck's North American prescription drug businesses, more than half the company's sales. He has been prominent in driving down drug prices for large-scale buyers. Part of his responsibility will be a new division in Merck, announced yesterday, which will merge Merck and Medco's sales and marketing operations to managed care organisations.</p>

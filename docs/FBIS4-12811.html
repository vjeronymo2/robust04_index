			<p>BFN     [Text] The speaker of the Iranian parliament, 'Ali Akbar  Nateq- Nuri, has said Pakistan can always count on strong  Iranian support in the wake of complex regional and global  situations. Addressing a special session of the National  Assembly in Islamabad this morning, Mr. Nateq-Nuri fully  supported Pakistan's stand on the Kashmir issue and its stance  on acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. The  Iranian speaker called upon the Muslim ummah [community] to  beware of the conspiracies being hatched against the Muslim  world. Unity alone, he emphasized, can pull the Muslim world  out of the present difficult situation.    Mr. Nateq-Nuri called for an immediate end to the atrocities  in occupied Kashmir and allowing the Kashmiri people to exercise  their right of self-determination. He warned that if serious  efforts were not made to resolve the Kashmir issue, it will pave  the way for those seeking power domination in the region and  plunge the region into a state of instability and tension.    Mr. Nateq-Nuri also endorsed Iran's full support to Pakistan  for acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. He said  the West is against the acquisition of such a technology by any  Islamic country in the world. These countries, he said, are  silent over the nuclear program being followed by Israel. There  should be no double standards, he emphasized. Iran, he said,  did not advocate the proliferation of nuclear arms and said the  whole world should be free from such weapons.    During the course of his inspired speech, the Iranian  speaker  also spoke on the situation in Palestine, Bosnia-Herzegovina,  and Afghanistan. He asked the ummah to join hands for the  assistance of these people. He said the demolition of the Babri  Masjid [mosque] is another conspiracy against the Muslims and  Islam and strongly condemned these acts. He demanded immediate  reconstruction and restoration of the Babri Masjid.    Earlier, welcoming Mr. Nateq-Nuri, the speaker of the  National Assembly, Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani, said the  parliamentarians of the Islamic countries have a special role to  play in view of the challenges being faced by the Muslim world  today. During talks with Mr. Nateq-Nuri, he said we have  resolved to work together for the well-being of the Muslim  ummah. We want to complement our efforts in establishing an  association of interparliamentary union of Muslim countries as  well as an association on interparliamentarians of ECO [Economic  Cooperation Organization] countries.    Speaking on the occasion, Law and Parliamentary Minister  Syed  Iqbal Haider, welcomed the speech of the Iranian speaker and  said it is a great source of inspiration to the Pakistani  Government and people. He said the visit of the Iranian speaker  will lead to the strengthening of existing cordial relations  between the two countries. The sentiments expressed by the  Iranian speaker for the Muslims of Bosnia, Palestine, and  particularly for the valiant struggle launched by the people of  Kashmir are a great source of satisfaction.    The deputy leader of the opposition, Mr. Gauhar Ayub Khan,  in  his speech said Iran always stood with Pakistan in hour of  crisis. The relations between the two countries are extremely  cordial and strong links bind the people of both the countries.    Hojjat-ol Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri called on the  president, Mr. Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, in Islamabad. They  discussed matters of mutual interest in the meeting which lasted  one and a half hours. The president paid rich tributes to the  late Iranian spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni, and  prayed for the progress and prosperity of the Iranian people. A  15-member delegation also accompanied the Iranian speaker.</p>

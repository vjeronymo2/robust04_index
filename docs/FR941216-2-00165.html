			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the impacts of the SOES changes cannot be precisely segregated from the impacts of other factors with 100 percent certainty, the absence of negative changes in measures of market quality and the presence of positive changes in such measures following the introduction of the SOES changes in late January 1994 support a conclusion that the changes resulted in improved market quality. The higher mandated exposure requirements and larger order sizes in place from mid-1988 to January 31, 1994, in retrospect, were not necessary and appear to have caused wider spreads as market makers adjusted their activities to avoid the transactions of active traders in SOES. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Analysis of Potential for Order Queues to Develop in NPROVE <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a letter dated August 16, 1994, Commission staff requested that Nasdaq provide an assessment of the potential for queues to develop and the basis for this assessment. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  In a letter dated December 7, 1994, Nasdaq responded in writing to the request. The relevant portions of Nasdaq's letter are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter from Katherine A. England, Assistant Director, SEC, to Robert E. Aber, Vice President and General Counsel, Nasdaq (Aug. 16, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In sum, as the attached graphs and tables indicate, Nasdaq believes the potential for sustained, lengthy order queues to develop in NPROVE for any given security is minimal. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  In fact, for the days analyzed by the staff, the data shows that over 98 percent of the orders transmitted by non-SOES activist firms <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  would have received an execution within 30 seconds. In addition, while our analysis illustrates that queues for a given security will develop for brief periods of time, our analysis also indicates that these occasional queues appear likely to abate in a matter of minutes. Moreover, and perhaps most importantly, our analysis demonstrates that, to the extent that there would be noticeable queues in NPROVE, these queues would be directly attributable to a narrow segment of orders originating from SOES activists that were transmitted in waves during discreet, short periods of time. When these queues do develop, however, a small percentage of retail customer orders (2 percent) may be delayed by the queue created by the SOES activists' orders. Aside from these episodic queues attributable to SOES activists, the data indicates that lengthy queues in NPROVE would be rare. Accordingly, Nasdaq does not believe it is very likely that significant, on-going order queues will develop in NPROVE during peak volume days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> To analyze the potential for order queuing in NPROVE Nasdaq staff used actual trading data for Nasdaq's Small Order Execution System (``SOES'') for certain trading days. To simulate trading in NPROVE with this SOES data, the staff ``spaced out'' the SOES orders so that, at a minimum there was at least a 15 second interval between the execution of these orders. For example, if three orders in the same security were sent simultaneously into SOES, fifteen seconds were inserted between the orders. In light of the recent amendments to NPROVE submitted to the Commission on December 1, 1994, Nasdaq notes that fifteen seconds will be the maximum length of time it will take for an order to be executed in NPROVE once that order becomes subject to NPROVE's order execution methodology, although in very limited circumstances NPROVE orders directed to a priority market maker may take between fifteen and thirty seconds to be executed. Moreover, market makers will have the ability to affirmatively execute against market orders any time during the fifteen-second display period.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 35024 (November 29, 1994). Thus, the insertion of fifteen seconds between SOES orders facilitates an extremely conservative replication of how such orders would have been processed through NPROVE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> text accompanying note 16 for the definition of a SOES-activist firm for purposes of this study. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, Nasdaq notes that the recent proposed amendments to NPROVE will further help to ensure that significant, on-going order queues will not develop in NPROVE. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, under the proposed order processing methodology for NPROVE, unpreferenced market orders entered into the system will be broadcast to all NPROVE market makers at the applicable inside market for acceptance within 15 seconds, with the market next in rotation for an NPROVE execution receiving an indicator that the system will execute the order against him should he fail to reject the order or if no other market maker accepts the order (market orders with such notifications appended to them are referred to as ``designated, unpreferenced orders'' and orders without such a notification are referred to as ``undesignated, unpreferenced orders''). <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  If a market maker rejects a designated, unpreferenced NPROVE order and no other market maker accepts the order within the 15-second period, the system will automatically execute the order against the market maker next in rotation that has not rejected the order upon expiration of the 15 second period. If all market makers decline the order consistent with Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1 under the Act, the order will be automatically executed against the market maker next in rotation at the new inside quotation. Thus, with this proposal, Rounds 1 and 2 are effectively collapsed into one round and Round 3 is eliminated because orders rejected by all market makers would be executed automatically at the new inside market. Accordingly, with this one-round order processing format, the NASD believes even more strongly that significant order queues will not occur in NPROVE, during normal trading days or peak volume days, and that investors will receive timely executions at prices at or superior to the quotes displayed when they entered their orders into NPROVE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As previously designed, the execution of unpreferenced market and marketable limit orders through NPROVE may have involved up to three 15-second rounds. In Round 1, an unpreferenced order would have been routed to the market maker at the inside bid or offer that was next in line for an NPROVE execution. The market maker could have manually executed the order or allowed the system to automatically execute the order after 15 seconds. If the market maker had effected a trade (or was in the process of executing a trade in that security) and had updated its quotation (or was in the process of updating), it could have rejected the unpreferenced NPROVE order. When, consistent with the requirements of Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1 under the Act, an order was rejected by the first market maker in rotation, the order would have entered Round 2 and would have been automatically displayed to all remaining market makers at the inside quote. All of these market makers would have had the opportunity to execute the order during a 15 second period. If no market maker manually accepted the order, it would have been automatically executed against the first market maker in rotation. In the unlikely event that all of these market makers had rejected the order during Round 2 pursuant to a valid exception from Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1, the system would have automatically executed the order against the first market maker in rotation quoting at the new inside market after fifteen seconds. This was called Round 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Market orders matched against limit orders (preferenced or unpreferenced) priced between the inside bit or offer also will be processed pursuant to this one-round order processing procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is important to note that our response is not intended to be a subjective commentary on the activities of SOES activists; rather it is an objective reflection of the source of potential order queues in NPROVE. It is axiomatic that episodic surges in order volume on one or the other side of the market will impact the timing and price of execution of these orders by virtue of fundamental economic principles of supply and demand. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY PROFILE / ELFIN FOREST: NO MADDING CROWD -- YET;  </P> <P> COMMUNITY: RESIDENTS OF THIS SMALL ENCLAVE WITH A FAIRYLIKE NAME LIKE THINGS  QUAINT -- AND EVEN DOUSE ALL OUTDOOR LIGHTS BY 11 P.M. . . . THE BETTER TO SEE  THE STARS.  </P> <P> On Harmony Grove Road in Escondido, past the cows lounging languidly in open  meadows, and beyond the rock quarries, lies a tiny community called Elfin  Forest. Yosemite it's not, but, with the squirrels darting across the road, the  coastal chaparral ground cover and the patches of tall skinny trees covering  the rolling hillside, Elfin Forest is aptly named.  </P> <P> A quick blink of the eye and the rural community could easily be bypassed on  the narrow road that also leads to the San Marcos landfill. But, within its 12  square miles -- situated west of Escondido, east of Carlsbad, north of Rancho  Santa Fe and south of San Marcos -- Elfin Forest does have most of the usual  trappings of civilized life, including a grocery store, a volunteer fire  company, a spiritual retreat and, of course, the obligatory llama crossing.  </P> <P> What Elfin Forest doesn't have could fill a book. There are no sidewalks, no  traffic signals, no cable television, and, until last year, no regular San  Diego newspaper delivery. The only thing that glaringly smacks of urban life is  a pay telephone near the Elfin Forest Grocery, which bills itself as the  smallest store in the country.  </P> <P> The inhabitants of Elfin Forest -- mostly retired or moderate- to upper-income  business people, doctors and lawyers who live on a minimum of 2.5 acres --  don't seem to mind. Their attitude towards the conveniences of urban life is  succinctly expressed by their Town Council letterhead that reads, "Dedicated to  a Continuing Rural Atmosphere."  </P> <P> Most of the 500 citizens obey a tacit law to turn off all outdoor lights after  11 p.m. This way, there is nothing to detract from the brilliant twinkle of the  stars against a black midnight sky.  </P> <P> "It's one of the few places where you can still see the stars without going to  the deserts or the mountains," said Bill Barker, the 54-year-old fire chief for  the Elfin Forest-Harmony Grove Volunteer Fire Co.  </P> <P> Crime is practically non-existent in this community. A rash of daytime  burglaries a couple years ago prompted the citizens of Elfin Forest to  reinstitute a Neighborhood Watch program, and it has been working well ever  since, Barker said.  </P> <P> The rural serenity is ideal for the Questhaven Retreat, a nondenominational  spiritual retreat that occupies 640 acres in the northern valley of Elfin  Forest. Each year, hundreds of visitors from around the world come to  Questhaven to commune with nature and study the teachings of the Rev. Flower  Newhouse, which deal with the angelic kingdom and the role of angels in human  life.  </P> <P> Newhouse founded Questhaven in 1940 when she bought the land and is still  director of the retreat. Christward Ministry, a nondenominational group, now  owns Questhaven and holds services for the locals every Sunday in a church on  the property.  </P> <P> Another important community institution is the Elfin Forest-Harmony Grove  Volunteer Fire Co. Formed in 1972, it now has 28 volunteer firefighters who  wear beepers and are on call 24 hours a day.  </P> <P> Bill Barker said 14 fires in 1989 blackened more than 2,000 acres of Elfin  Forest. The fire risk in is exceptionally high because of the number of trees  and the dense coastal chaparral everywhere, he said.  </P> <P> The community's history starts with Elfin Forest Vacation Ranch. Now a mobile  home park for 62 people, the ranch once was a park owned by San Diego dentist  Harvey Urban, who in 1958 charged people $2 a night to camp there. He also  dammed Escondido Creek to create Elfin Forest Lake, which was destroyed in 1979  by heavy rains.  </P> <P> Originally called Tooth Acres, after Urban's profession, the camp derived its  present name from the 1923 book by Francis Marion Fultz titled, "The Elfin  Forest of California." In the book on Southern California flora and fauna,  Fultz described many backcountry areas as appearing to be an "elfin forest."  </P> <P> Urban's children adopted the name for the campgrounds, and soon after, the  whole community followed suit.  </P> <P> But the area's residents now are fighting to make sure the name remains  descriptive of their town. There is a constant battle to keep the nearby San  Marcos landfill from expanding, and now residents are fighting annexation by  the city of San Marcos.  </P> <P> The citizens of Elfin Forest have to be political or get mowed down, said Nona  Barker, an Elfin Forest resident and owner of Llama Luggage, a business that  designs backpacks and outdoor gear for the animals.  </P> <P> There is a sign posted on a road in front of Barker's three-acre property that  proclaims, "Llama Crossing." It calls attention to the seven llamas Barker owns  that sometimes cross the road on their way to a community parade at Elfin  Forest Vacation Ranch.  </P> <P> Barker (no relation to Bill, the fire chief) believes that the residents are  going to have to prepare for even harder battles than the landfill expansion or  the trash-to-energy plant.  </P> <P> "We just got a letter in the mail from the city of San Marcos saying they want  to annex into Elfin Forest," Barker said. "Ninety percent of us don't want to  be annexed, we like being part of the county, but they don't care."  </P> <P> Monthly Town Council meetings at the fire station are always well attended and  often heated, especially when the topic is proposed housing developments or a  trash incineration plant, said Patricia Mack Newton.  </P></p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (7): An important role in the economy - Rentiers from outside appear to be well integrated with the local people / Rentiers GUERNSEY, like Jersey, has a 'rentier' sector which is important to its economy. Rentiers - residents whose main income is derived from investments  -contribute 20 per cent of Guernsey's gross national product. Outsiders wishing to settle in Guernsey form part of the rentier group but not all of it. Unlike Jersey, Guernsey does not have a limit on the number of people who can settle in the Bailiwick. In Guernsey, anyone can occupy an open-market property provided they can afford the price. In practice, the inflow is regulated by the island's complex two-tier housing system. The Bailiwick has a local market for people who were either born in Guernsey, or married someone who was born in Guernsey. Exceptions have been made for professional people such as doctors and dentists who have bought local-market houses under special licence. The open market is controlled by a physical limit on the number of houses. At present there are just under 1,800 houses on the open market. The stock is not being increased. Several open-market properties are on the site of the old Fort St George. In 1961, the States (parliament) sold the 54-acre former British army garrison for development as a wealthy settlers' enclave. Prices on the estate range from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 3m. It is thought these price levels preclude anybody who is not at least comfortably off trying to settle. Because Guernsey is not part of the EC, it is not subject to the immigration restrictions of the Community. In practice, more than 90 per cent of the settlers are of British derivation. As financial services have grown, more licences have been given to people in this sector to buy local-market houses. Others rent properties. Many of these people would qualify as rentiers. Rentiers from outside appear to be well integrated with the local people. Mr Tony Carey, who retired from the British army as a major and is now involved in business in his native Guernsey, says: 'There is a great deal of mingling on Guernsey. If you are invited to a dinner party you would probably find a wide cross-section of people, from the local policeman to a visiting banker, to a grower. Guernsey's settlers are much less ostentatious than those on Jersey.' There are exceptions. Oliver Reed, the actor, can be found taking a stroll around St Peter Port, although his appearances are apparently less frequent than in the recent years. Broadcaster and former politician Brian Walden is also a rentier. He keeps a very low profile, rarely gives interviews to the local press and is seldom seen. On Sark and Alderney, which are part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the rules are different again. On Sark, there are very few houses to buy and anyone wishing to build a new one must first live on the island for 15 years. On Alderney, technically, anyone can buy a home if he or she can find one. Ian Botham, the England cricketer has a holiday home on Alderney.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Mercedes considers cutting 20,000 jobs MERCEDES-BENZ, the automotive unit of industrial group Daimler-Benz AG, is considering cutting up to 20,000 jobs by 1995 as part of a radical cost-cutting plan, industry sources said. Sources said the management board had not yet decided how and when cuts of this magnitude should occur, but a drastic reduction of Mercedes' worldwide workforce of 238,000 people was necessary to achieve targetted savings of DM4bn (Dollars 2.5bn) annually by 1995. Reuter reports. Mercedes said last week a slowing down of car sales in Germany, coupled with weak sales in other European markets and the recession in the US, could lead to lay-offs. The company would only confirm it was 'considering a reduction in the workforce of several thousand.' A cut of 20,000 jobs would mainly affect production workers in Germany as the company strives to make its production process leaner, the sources said. In addition to the 20,000 job cuts, another 3,000 jobs will be lost by 1995 from the administrative HQ of Mercedes and the Daimler holding in the Stuttgart area. A reduction in the administrative staff was announced by the Daimler management board last year. Last week, BMW announced it would axe 3,000 jobs by the end of this year to increase productivity in light of sharper competition coupled with a contraction of the German market.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- Russia possesses unique  technologies for comprehensive processing of combat toxic agents  and nuclear waste, according to Professor Mikhail Sviderskiy.    Speaking at an international conference on chemical  disarmament in Moscow on Thursday, Sviderskiy, who is a member  of the Russian Engineering Academy, said that Russian scientists  have developed and tested such technologies. They allowed them  to make new materials with unique qualities which, according to  specialists, will be widely used in the 21st century.    The new technologies also provide for processing used  uranium  into valuable materials. He said, however, that further  research and experiments will require international  participation. The United States, France, Britain and Germany  could also benefit from the use of these technologies as they  all face the same problem -- utilisation of radioactive waste.    Academician Valentin Fedotov said that chemical disarmament  must not only make up for the cost of manufactured toxic agents,  but also augment state coffers. In his view, the processing of  lewisite (liquid vesicant) into super pure arsenic may earn  Russia billions of roubles and hard currency and provide the  industry with high-quality materials.    Georgia, traditional supplier of arsenic, has stopped  selling  it to Russia which needs it for its electronics industry,  Fedotov said. He noted that, the demand for super pure arsenic  in the U.S. electronics industry will exceed 100 tonnes by the  end of the century.    The academician stressed that new technologies meet Russia's  national interests. ``We must count only on ourselves and have  no right to wait for someone else to solve our problems for  us,'' he said.</p>

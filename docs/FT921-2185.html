			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: US buy behind 35% rise at Wassall WASSALL, the mini- conglomerate run by former Hanson executives, yesterday reported a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits on the back of its recent acquisition of DAP, a US supplier of construction products and filling compounds. For the year to end-December pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 7.6m) on sales up by 27 per cent from Pounds 130m to Pounds 165m. Without the 14-week contribution from DAP, which was acquired in September for Pounds 58m, taxable profits would have remained unchanged from last year. The consumer division, which includes DAP and Antler, the UK luggage manufacturer, increased trading profit to Pounds 3.98m (Pounds 1.03m). DAP is undergoing a rationalisation programme, which could see a reduction in the number of plants, and a wide-ranging evaluation of its business. The acquisition is concentrating on the expanding DIY market in the US. Wassall is confident of doubling its current 5 per cent return on sales. Provisions of Pounds 7.7m were taken to cover reorganisation and environmental costs as well as other post-employment benefits at DAP, which include pensions and private health care. The closures business, which includes bottle top companies in the UK, Italy and South Africa, increased trading profit to Pounds 8.02m (Pounds 7.02m). The industrial and commercial side saw a fall in profits from Pounds 3.02m to Pounds 816,000 as office furniture reported a small trading loss. A reorganisation, which saw the number of plants decrease from five to three, cost Pounds 450,000. Earnings per share increased to 13p (11.9p). A final dividend of 2p raises the total to 3p compared to 2.5p. The group proposes to make a scrip issue of one new share for every two held. COMMENT Wassall's results pleased the City more for its reduction in debt and conservative accounting policies than its record profit increase. DAP's contribution should not, however, be underestimated, producing operating profits of Pounds 2.77m with a significant contribution still to come. The group may also expand its US operations with a few strategic bolt-on acquisitions. The reduction in net debt from Pounds 47m to Pounds 24m, bringing gearing down from 140 per cent to 43 per cent, underlined the group's ability to generate cash. The market also welcomed the group's decision to take its Pounds 450,000 rationalisation cost above the line. With forecasts of pre-tax profits of about Pounds 18m, the shares, up 9p to 235p, are on a prospective multiple of 15.2. Not a demanding premium given the group's momentum.</p>

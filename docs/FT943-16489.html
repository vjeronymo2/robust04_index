			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Italian investors show signs of issue fatigue - International offerings July marks the beginning of the summer holidays for many Italian companies. But this year it also marks the end - or nearly the end - of a frenetic four or five weeks of globe-trotting presentations by Italian executives, trying to sell their new issues of shares to international investors. The surge in activity on the Milan stock market, prompted by the victory of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing political grouping in March's general election, was the spur for a series of rights issues and share offerings by Italian companies. Such has been the density of Italian issues - analysts estimate more than L10,000bn is being raised on the market in July - that some roadshows may well have collided at big London or Frankfurt banks during June. Among the biggest forthcoming issues is the L1,650bn sale of shares in Cariplo, probably the world's biggest savings bank, which is seeking a stock market listing for the first time, while at more than L4,800bn, last week's sale of Ina, the state-owned insurer, is Italy's biggest privatisation so far. However, evidence is beginning to emerge of 'issue fatigue' on the part of retail investors in Italy. The public offering of Ina shares, which begin trading on Wednesday, was oversubscribed, but enthusiasm was muted compared with previous privatisations. Advisers put part of the blame on the sheer size of the sale. The smaller issue by Finanza &amp; Futuro, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's financial services operation, which has so far raised about L130bn, had to be re- jigged to account for disappointingly low demand by the Italian public. However, turbulence on world markets has not substantially dampened international fund managers' interest in Italian share issues so far, partly because the strong performance of the stock market this year, particularly relative to other markets, has buoyed demand. In addition, 'Italy was completely under-owned by UK fund managers,' before the start of the privatisation programme, according to one fund manager. However, the fatigue noted among Italian investors is also beginning to become apparent in Europe and the US. 'People have overdosed on European paper in general and on Italian names in particular,' said one observer. Salomon Brothers, lead manager of the 200m share international tranche of the Cariplo deal, has decided against targeting the US specifically, given the relatively small size of the international portion and the relatively unenthusiastic reception to earlier issues. The deal has a 144a option, allowing placement among US institutional investors, but there will be no US roadshows. Insurance and bank stocks are likely to suffer most, given that the financial sector is falling out of vogue. The pulling of Mediobanca's L1,500bn rights issue last month was viewed as a bad omen by some international investors. But the more pressing question for the Italian government is whether international investor appetite will be sufficient to help consume the much larger state sell-offs to come. The results of the Ina sale - and early trading in the issue this week  - should give indications of the prospects for selling shares in Stet, the state telecommunications company, and Enel, the electricity generator, in the autumn. Stet seems likely to attract the strongest interest, given the enthusiasm for telecommunications, although the stock is already readily available in the secondary market.</p>

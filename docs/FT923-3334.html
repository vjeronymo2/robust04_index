			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Guaranteed equity launch Allied Dunbar is launching a guaranteed equity product. Like other recent offerings it invests in options. The account lasts five years. On each anniversary, investors will receive at least 85 per cent of the rise in the FT-SE 100 index over the period. Gains will be locked in and guaranteed at the end of five years. If the market goes down over a 12-month period, the account will keep its value - and Allied Dunbar guarantees that it will not lose over five years. The drawbacks are the inflexibility - no money can be withdrawn early except on death - the lack of income (investors do not benefit from the yield on the Footsie) and the tax position. Any profits on the product are subject to income tax but profits on conventional equity investment are subject to capital gains tax. Since each investor has an annual Pounds 5,800 CGT allowance, after indexation for inflation, few ever pay CGT. See Serious Money.</p>

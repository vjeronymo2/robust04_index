			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Nuclear Program Is the Protector of the </F> Nation, and the Nation Knows How To Protect It"]    [Text] Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, the opposition leader  and former prime minister, has said that the nation does not  want to make any compromise on Kashmir and nuclear issues. The  Pakistan People's Party government may cease to exist, but the  nuclear program cannot be wound up. Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan,  chairman of the National Assembly's Kashmir Committee, has also  said that the foreign minister's statement about the acceptance  of the U.S. proposal for inspection of Pakistan's nuclear  program is tantamount to ridiculing the whole nation. The  Pakistan Muslim League-J also expressed concern over the foreign  minister's statement about Pakistan's readiness to accept the  inspection of its nuclear installations and declared that we  will protect the nuclear program the way people protect the  dignity of mothers and sisters. Sheikh Abdur Rashid, deputy  chief organizer of the Muslim League and member of the National  Assembly, has warned in a peculiar way. He said that he will  burn himself at Lahore's Minar-i-Pakistan tower if the present  government allows a nuclear inspection. Various religious  parties have also condemned the foreign minister's statement and  expressed the apprehension that the government might have knelt  down to the United States. They feel that the term of  "nonphysical inspection" of Pakistan's nuclear installations  actually means the American idea of establishing Indian hegemony  in the region. Hamid Gul, former chief of the Inter Service  Intelligence, has also said that accepting the U.S. conditions  on the nuclear program will be a national tragedy.    The foreign minister's statement hints at grave dangers. The  nation does not accept the U.S. inspection in any manner. We  had taken a strong note of the foreign minister's remarks in  these columns the other day. Despite his prompt statement  refuting his earlier remarks, we had suggested him to think  twice and be very careful before making any statement on the  most sensitive issues of the nation. The foreign affairs  department requires great caution. The past record of Sardar  Asif Ali is not that enviable, either. He had accused Pakistan  of being involved in terrorism when he was a minister in the  previous government. We had to suffer for his accusation, and  the sufferings manifested themselves in the form of U.S. steps  against us and our failure to present the Kashmir issue at the  Geneva Human Rights Commission meeting. Similarly, he continues  to make irresponsible remarks about Islam. A progovernment  paper issued a clarification on his behalf yesterday. The irony  is that instead of accepting the clarification as true, the  paper published an editorial supporting the foreign minister's  statement. The Foreign Office also issued a rejection of the  statement and blamed the newspapers, saying that they carried  the report in an irresponsible manner, despite the fact that the  same report was also released by the government news agency of  ASSOCIATED PRESS OF PAKISTAN itself.    The nation is not willing to accept the argument that the  foreign minister was not careful when making the statement or  that the press attributed a wrong statement to him. There is  definitely something wrong, and the statement, not the refusal,  is more important. As the issue is very sensitive and delicate,  and it is feared that a compromise has been made on a program  that grantees national security and the country's independence,  it becomes imperative that the foreign minister make a  clarification of his statement to the nation, either at the  Senate or the National Assembly or on television, and assure the  people that his government is not involved in any compromise  with the United States. Only after this will the nation decide  whether it is satisfied with the clarification or the statement.    Any kind of compromise on the nuclear program is not in the  interest of Pakistan. The nation has already been afflicted by  grief at the disclosure of the news that the nuclear program has  been capped. The United States is now demanding an inspection.  It is apparently trying to compensate by promising to supply  the F-16 planes. The fact is that the F-16 is Pakistan's right.  The cost of these planes have already been paid by Pakistan  under a bilateral trade deal. Any kind of interference by the  United States in our nuclear program, whether physical or  nonphysical, that is, whether a visit to our country by a team  of U.S. inspectors as was done in Iraq or monitoring the Kahuta  nuclear plant through telescopes installed on satellites, is not  acceptable to the Pakistani nation. If a government accepts such  a proposal and defends it by juggling words, it will only be  committing an act of stupidity. The reality is that the nation  knows how to protect the nuclear program, which protects the  Pakistani nation. The present government might have some ill  intentions, but it should not make any mistake in understanding  the nation's aspirations.</p>

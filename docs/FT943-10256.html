			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Moscow to act as corporate debt threatens stability The Russian government prepared yesterday to tackle the mounting inter-enterprise debt which threatens to jeopardise the nation's fragile economic stabilisation. Officials announced yesterday that the president and cabinet were preparing five decrees to deal with the issue and a special commission, chaired by Mr Oleg Soskovets, a deputy prime minister, and including two other deputy prime ministers and the chairman of the central bank, was formed to address the problem. Mr Soskovets, who is to report weekly on the work of the committee to the president and prime minister, said the issue of inter-enterprise debt was so serious that 'it must be resolved without a single minute of delay'. Mounting inter-enterprise debt, which has appeared in many of the countries moving from communism to the market, has emerged in Russia because the government's relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies have not been matched by restructuring of large enterprises. Unable to obtain the soft state credits upon which they have traditionally relied, Russian factories have simply lent one another money, or shipped goods without being paid. By doing so, they have created a byzantine web of inter-enterprise debt which now threatens to paralyse the economy.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / 200 jobs to go at Galileo's Swindon A TOTAL of 200 jobs in computer operations are expected to be lost at Galileo's Swindon headquarters as a result of the merger announced yesterday between the UK-based airline reservation system and the US Covia system. The merged company's data processing operations will be at a combined centre in Denver, Colorado, and Galileo's Swindon operations will be transferred there within 12 months. Extra short-term staff may have to be employed to help with the transfer. Galileo has about 600 staff. Product development will still be carried out in the UK and the Swindon centre may be leased to another company which needs a large data processing installation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 1 April, the Electrical Union issued the  following communique on the breakdowns and other situations  affecting the output of electric plants:    As reported, since last week, outages have exceeded the  national schedule of outages due to breakdowns of generator  units at several electrical plants. This lessens the electricity  generation capacity of the National Electric System. The Diez de  Octubre plant, in Nuevitas, experienced a temporary fuel  shortage that forced it to reduce its output between 26 and 31  March; this situation was resolved last night.    The Electrical Union reported that the situation will  continue over the next few days, including 2 and 3 April. The  outages will continue to be longer than scheduled and in  accordance with the outage program designed in each region to  cover this period. Maintenance workers at the power plants are  working around the clock to complete repairs and increase the  output of the National Electric System in the shortest time  possible.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / US offers EC more time over farm subsidies US OFFICIALS have offered the EC a big concession in negotiations over farm trade which would allow the Community 7-10 years to reduce the volume of subsidised farm exports by 24 per cent, according to an authoritative report in Washington. Officials who met Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, last week offered a longer time for the subsidy cuts instead of accepting a lower level of cuts, as previously proposed by Mr Jacques Delors, the EC president. The offer, part of a US endeavour to break a 16-month deadlock over agriculture trade, is not expected to be enough alone to resolve the Gatt talks. The stalemate is blocking completion of the Uruguay Round at a cost of billions of dollars a year in lost trade. Officials in Brussels said yesterday they saw little hope of a Gatt breakthrough because new US proposals for the Community to take more land out of production would require unpicking the EC farm reform package carefully stitched together last week. EC farm ministers last week agreed radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. The agreement included provisions that European farmers should be compensated for price support cuts, provided they took at least 15 per cent of their land out of cereal production, beginning in 1993-94. The degree of this required 'set-aside' would be reviewed each year thereafter. But the US told Mr Andriessen it wanted the EC to commit itself to set aside more than 15 per cent for the full planned five-year life of a Gatt accord. 'It will be very difficult to re-negotiate any part of last week's CAP reform deal,' said one official yesterday. The US concession on grain subsidies is not likely to find much support among American farm groups. Their main, long-standing concern - and that of their counterparts in Canada, Australia and other farm exporting nations - has been to rid the world grain market of trade-distorting export subsidies.</p>

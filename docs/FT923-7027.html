			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Move by OFT hits WH Smith THE decision by the UK Office of Fair Trading to refer distribution of national newspapers by publishers and wholesalers to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission hit WH Smith and John Menzies, two of the leading companies in this area of business. Smith tumbled 14 to 391p and Menzies retreated 19 to 320p. A somewhat pointed statement by Menzies yesterday said there had already been two previous enquiries into the industry, in 1974 and 1985, as well as a decision last year by the former OFT director general not to make a referral to the MMC. While analysts agreed that a fresh inquiry was unlikely to uncover anything new, it was felt that anything which provoked negative sentiment in a thin and volatile market was bound to be damaging to the shares. Mr Nick Hawkins at Kleinwort Benson said: 'Smith has its results next week, which should give it a good forum to dispel some of the worries, but the poor sentiment is likely to overhang the stock for some time yet.' Coincidentally, Kleinwort moved from a buy to a hold on Smith yesterday prior to the announcement, Mr Hawkins arguing that the shares had had a good run and may prove volatile ahead of the results. The house advised a switch into Kingfisher, which appreciated 5 to 450p. Euro Disney falls Shares in Euro Disney fell heavily in Paris and London after broker Morgan Stanley became the first major US house to issue a sell recommendation on the stock, arguing that the French theme park operator will make a loss in the year to September 1993. In London, the stock closed at 800p, down 60. The house was said to have blamed higher than expected operating costs and lease payments to the finance companies used by Euro Disney to fund its operation. These had been estimated at FFr950m per year, but were now put at around FFr1.3bn, according to Morgan Stanley. It expects to publish its full recommendation and figures shortly. Arch Euro Disney bear Mr Nigel Reed at Paribas said he believed the company faces at least two years of losses and that the stock is likely to remain under pressure, chiefly because the market has little on which to value the shares other than Euro Disney's net asset value. Hanson easier Conglomerate Hanson was held back by a bearish piece of research from US brokerage house Merrill Lynch, which changed its near-term recommendation from 'above average' to 'neutral' following the decline in third-quarter profits reported last week. Merrill analyst Ms Carol Neves said that because of the continuing worries about the UK economy, and particularly the housing market, the conglomerate was 'continuing to mothball brick kilns'. She added that prices and earnings for titanium dioxide, the whitener that represents a significant part of Hanson's income, were under pressure because of a world glut. She has trimmed her earnings per share forecast for this year by 3p to 17p. The stock eased 1 1/4 to 191 3/4 p on healthy turnover of 5.5m. Reed hit again Pressure on magazine publisher Reed International intensified yesterday after the company's broker was said to have joined the list of those turning negative on the stock. The shares declined 9 to 459p, making a two-day slide of nearly 20. The fall began at the end of last week when agency broker James Capel said that, although the company was solid, the shares were expensive in the short term and clients should look for opportunities to switch out. There was further selling yesterday as talk circulated that Cazenove, Reed's broker, was said to have taken a more negative view. Cazenove never comments on market speculation, but Reed is known to be holding interviews with analysts from various securities houses at present and a number of forecast cuts are believed to be in the offing. The company was talking to SG Warburg yesterday and is likely to have spoken to its own broker beforehand. Good business was seen in electricity utilities as investors switched out of the package and into the individual stocks. The first salvo was fired in the battle to launch the Racal demerger from its Chubb subsidiary, due in October. Joint broker Smith New Court produced a hefty research document, claiming that the value of Chubb suggests a pre-split share price of 78p for Racal and that investors should buy up to 70p. County NatWest, the other joint broker, will publish its research in the next few days. Racal held steady at 63 1/2 p. Mining group RTZ put on 6 to 533p, supported by a buoyant copper market and recent dollar strength. Britannic Assurance moved ahead 13 to 923p after announcing a raised dividend with its interim results. Glaxo gained 8 to 728p, with SG Warburg said to have turned more positive. A series of forecast cuts hit Unigate as the group became the latest in the food manufacturing sector to face a downward revision. The shares fell 22 to 253p. Northern Foods shed 13 to 252p in sympathy. A big buyer of Forte took the hotel group to the top of the trading volume list in the market yesterday. Kleinwort Benson was said to have purchased 7.5m shares at 129p and placed them at 130p. Total turnover reached 21m. The stock gained 3 to 131p. An upbeat presentation to analysts after the company had reported interim profits at the top end of market expectations boosted BICC. The shares reversed a recent downtrend and jumped 17 to 279p. Consideration of results from Hickson International prompted a number of analysts to lower forecasts and the shares receded 7 to 167p. International conglomerate Lonrho closed 5 higher at 81p, after touching 84p, on suggestions that Malaysian trading company Genting, which already has a 5 per cent stake in Lonrho, was interested in acquiring the 10 per cent shareholding held by Fidelity, of the US. Analysts, however, discounted the talk. Airports group BAA jumped 14 to 671p in thin trading, sentiment boosted by news that it had signed a deal to sell advertising space.

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / As They Say in Europe: Is Europe just out of breath? 'From the economic point of view, we in the Federal Republic have always moved forward up to now. Prosperity has risen from year to year. Now we are in an economic crisis. Is this a turning point, or have we just reached a standstill, a breathing space, after which we shall move forward again?' That was a question in a poll of the state of German opinion. Once a month the Germans are asked about everything by the Allensbach organisation. These days they are unimpressed. But the real interest is that someone has asked the question that underlies discussion about almost everything. Is this moment a breathing space or a turning point? In Germany, 57 per cent replied positively, saying the 'crisis' was just a pause. That it represented a fundamental change was accepted by 27 per cent. Have British readers noted the use of the word 'crisis'? It turns up on most news pages in Germany and also in France, Italy and Spain. But I cannot remember at any time in the past three bad years in Britain any reference to 'the crisis'. This is because the British have become used to a far lower standard of economic performance than the Germans, Italians, French and many others. Imagine a British pollster asking respondents if they thought that current difficulties represented merely a pause in the ever upward progress of the British economy. Anyway, the Germans believe, by a margin of more than 2:1, that they are not at a turning point. That may be because the past two years have been flat, dull and awful. The period began with the start of the Yugoslav catastrophe, was punctuated by the arrival of Bill Clinton in the White House and ended with the conclusion of the Gatt Round. The contrast with the three years before 1992 is stunning. This fact alone should reinforce the 'breathing space' theory, for the frenetic pace of events of 1989-91 was unsustainable. The apparent uneventfulness of the present by no means equates to tranquility. The 'crisis' breeds angst and morosite. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung headlined the results of the Allensbach poll like this: 'In the downpour, the Germans pull in their horns.' The French, once so anxious to cut a dash, now confess their timidity and insularity. Le Monde wrote that both France and Germany are experiencing an identity crisis. The article concluded with the words: 'Misunderstanding between one country and another leads to mutual distancing and creates the illusion that there exists a national capacity to master shared crises.' Meanwhile, Italians speak of Italy as finished. Spain has found it possesses no resources to confront the recession: once the industrial implants of the last two or three decades rot away, there is nothing to replace them. To the east, the morose Magyars and paranoid Poles cast a wary eye over the benefits of liberalisation, which are more real than they believe, while the Balkans return to Bismarck's nightmare characterisation - the place where some damn fool can trigger a European war. But this pervading gloom is not a global phenomenon; it is very European. It is reflected in marked loss of European self-confidence, which historically has occurred only in the face of American or Japanese achievement. But now Europe is plagued with visions of what Le Figaro charmingly called Asiatic ants. The new industrial nations of south-east Asia, so many believe, are going to steal our jobs and dominate the world of work with sweatshop industries. Countless lessons have been drawn from this belief, but always the wrong ones. They include the idea that, in order to compete, wage levels are what really count, and that economic success is founded on sweatshop economics and no rights for workers. So, say European leaders of opinion, outside Britain, if that is the way to succeed we do not want to know about it. But what they fail, churlishly, to recognise is that the successes of the Far East have been gained through positive achievement rather than systematic exploitation of specific cost advantages. This achievement is based on simple ideas - such as not subsidising loss-making state-owned juggernauts, and a preparedness to make policy U-turns. This includes pulling out of heavy industries, as in Korea, or reversing the thrust of social programmes, as in Malaysia. The approach is not driven by capricious events but by recognising that times change and different solutions are needed. Europe must ask whether 1994 will be the breathing space in which we run out of breath, or whether European governments learn from those whom they seem to despise and fear. I started with a question so I will finish with a question: in 1993, did you read any interview with those in charge of the world's most successful economies?

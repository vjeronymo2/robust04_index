			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Western firms get leaner and fitter Not surprisingly, in the country's worst recession since the second world war, Germany's Mittelstand companies are suffering. But according to the head of Germany's largest independent venture capital firm, they are not necessarily doing as badly as their bigger, stock-market quoted competitors. 'It is my impression that 50 per cent of the Mittelstand has not felt the impact of the recession at all,' says Thomas Schlytter-Henrichsen, joint managing director of the German arm of 3i, the UK venture capital firm. 'In fact many companies have record order-books.' Germany has 15,000 companies with turnovers of between DM20 and DM200m and only 665 quoted companies. The Mittelstand employs 75 per cent of the workforce and generates 50 per cent of non-state sector GNP. According to Schlytter-Henrichsen the outlook is mixed. Suppliers of components to the big German car manufacturers are suffering as their customers wage war on costs. Manufacturers are demanding price cuts of as much as 30 per cent, insisting on a simplification of component supplies, and cutting the number of suppliers they are prepared to do business with. In the machine-tool sector, a traditional stronghold of German manufacturing industry, companies are under intense competitive pressure from lower-cost Japanese rivals - and an overall slump in world demand for capital goods. It has been suggested that Baden-Wurttemberg, a state in the south-west of Germany where there is a large concentration of family businesses in both stricken sectors, will be the German 'crisis-region' of the 1990s. But according to Schlytter-Henrichsen, the gloom is far from universal, especially in service-sector companies and those involved in the construction industry, either directly or as suppliers. Here, profits are continuing to rise from last year's record levels. A survey* of 201 Mittelstand companies published recently by 3i shows 30 per cent of companies expect profits to climb again this year and another 32 per cent anticipate levels similar to last year. An overwhelming majority - 81 per cent - plans to rationalise as a way of dealing with mounting costs. The companies think this preferable to setting up plants in countries with lower wage costs. This rationalisation will not necessarily be at the expense of the workforce  -60 per cent plan to keep staff numbers at current levels or to expand. And 45 per cent intend to maintain capital investment at the same high level as last year. 'This is the big difference between the way German medium-sized companies and UK companies of similar size have reacted to recession,' Schlytter-Henrichsen says. 'German companies are still investing - albeit at a lower level - whereas in the UK investment ground to a halt. 'Many Mittelstand companies are taking advantage of the downturn to push through rationalisation measures which they could not have contemplated in better times,' he says. 'Profits may go down this year but not dramatically so - and when the upturn comes, the companies will emerge leaner, fitter and more competitive than ever before.'

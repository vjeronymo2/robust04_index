			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Decline found in children's reading except in Scotland, according to a survey. Less than a third of children enjoy reading in the classroom compared with more than half their grandparents in their schooldays. But in Scotland the popularity of reading has grown from 33 per cent two generations ago to 43 per cent. Some 52% of grandparents looking back on their schooldays said reading had been one of their favourite subjects. But for primary school children today the figure is 30 per cent. Reading for pleasure at home has suffered a similar fall in popularity, down from 43 per cent to 32 per cent. In all, 679 children aged between five and 11 and 570 grandparents across Britain were surveyed by Birds Eye frozen foods at the start of its free books for schools scheme in conjunction with HarperCollins.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Politics of bribery claims a fresh victim in Japan: Why the downfall of a close associate is putting Miyazawa on the defensive BY JAPANESE political standards, the downfall of Mr Fumio Abe, the senior Japanese politician arrested on Monday for alleged bribe taking, has more to do with ineptitude than corruption. Instead of spreading his favours and his sources of finance, Mr Abe relied heavily on one rather shoddy property development company for his money. The case has drawn comparisons with the demise of Mr Sousuke Uno, the short-stay prime minister entangled in the 'geisha' scandal of 1989. It is no secret that Japanese politicians often keep mistresses, but Mr Uno was thought particularly inept because his stinginess prompted a frustrated companion to tell all to the tabloid press. Mr Abe, who admitted himself to hospital in the time-honoured tradition of the scandal-afflicted, appears to have had a lifestyle no more lavish than other senior MPs. He dined well in Tokyo's nightlife districts and is said to have bought a gold-plated watch for a well-known actress who caught his eye, but prosecutors have been unable to uncover any truly outlandish exploits by a man who routinely flew economy class. One of Mr Abe's staff alleged that his boss had received a significant amount of money - reportedly Y500m (Pounds 2.2m) - from Kyowa, a steel frame manufacturer turned property developer, but that Mr Abe had done nothing out of the ordinary in collecting his money. 'He acted as a go-between for the company - everybody does that.' But not 'everybody' is a close associate of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who is dependent on the tolerance of other Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) factions for his power. Mr Abe was the Miyazawa faction manager until a month ago, when the the scandal forced him to resign the post. The largest opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, formerly the Japan Socialist Party, says it will apply the blowtorch to the prime minister's belly when parliament resumes next week. Mr Miyazawa has denied reports that his faction received Kyowa money, but he will be forced to offer a detailed explanation, and to clarify again his role in the Recruit stocks-for-favours scandal of 1988-89. It is Mr Miyazawa's hope that the new scandal will slip into the recesses of the voters' memory before an Upper House election in the summer that is likely to determine whether he has a second year in office. Not that the LDP will lose power, but if the party does not regain control of the house, other faction heads will probably decide that Mr Miyazawa does not deserve an extension of his tenure. Given the slowness of the Japanese judicial process, it could be a decade or so before final judgment is passed on the unfortunate Mr Abe. But the coming weeks are likely to see a rush of embarrassing allegations made against the former cabinet minister, now fair game for the often merciless Japanese tabloid press. Whatever the sum received by Mr Abe, 69, who characterises himself as a battler made good, the charges against him centre on Y80m and the alleged leaking of planning information during his stint as director-general of the Hokkaido Development Agency from August 1989. The case is a by-product of the financial excesses of the late 1980s, as Kyowa was a long-established maker of steel frames for the construction industry until a change of management and a sudden embrace of property development. As a result, the company allegedly sought confidential information from Mr Abe about the route of a new Hokkaido motorway with a view to buying property in the vicinity. Kyowa collapsed in late November 1990, after an increase in interest rates and a softening of the property market undermined its ambitious resort and golf course projects, and left it with outstanding debts of about Y200bn. But, in its last two years of life, the newly-aggressive company managed to tarnish several prestigious names. In mid-1990, Kyowa was involved in a serious of fictitious deals that led to the bankruptcy of a steel trader and the sullying of the reputation of Marubeni the trading house, in whose famous name the fraudulent deals were made. A Marubeni manager was later arrested and the company admitted that its 'honour and reputation' had been damaged by Kyowa. It remains to be seen how much Mr Miyazawa's honour and reputation will be affected by the new scandal. Even though he resigned as finance minister in 1988 after admitting that one of his aides accepted cut-price stock offered by Recruit, Mr Miyazawa was thought to be a 'clean' politician. The arrest of a close associate can only harm that image. The prime minister would regain public respect if he pushed ahead with an overhaul of the electoral system and other reforms intended to make Japanese politics cheaper for the participants and thus less prone to financial scandal. But Mr Miyazawa will be cautious, as the enthusiasm of Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the former prime minister, for these very same reforms irritated the LDP elders and prompted them to terminate his mandate abruptly late last year.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> As a junior high school teacher, I have always enjoyed "The Wonder Years" for  its intensely accurate portrayal of the heart and mind of the adolescent. A  recent episode about Kevin's reaction to his math teacher's death was  brilliantly depicted. Every junior high counselor should have a copy of this  episode in his desk and no parent should be without a video copy of it.  </P> <P> Paula Hamilton, Ontario  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific or Educational Purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No threat from overutilization of these species is known to exist at this time. Collection for scientific or educational purposes could become a threat if specific localities become widely known.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Disease or Predation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the time of listing, predation by and competition with non-native species introduced in association with human habitation was considered a potential threat to the karst invertebrates. Human activities facilitate movement of non-native competitors and predators such as sowbugs, cockroaches, and fire ants into an area. Buildings, lawns, roadways, and landscaped areas provide habitat from which these species can disperse. The relative accessibility of the shallow caves in Travis and Williamson counties makes them especially vulnerable to invasion by non-native species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fire ants are a major threat to the karst invertebrates. The significance of this threat and the difficulty of controlling fire ants should not be underestimated. Fire ants are voracious predators and there is evidence that overall arthropod diversity drops in their presence (Vinson and Sorensen 1986, Porter and Savignano 1990). Reddell ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1993) lists at least nine cave-inhabiting species that he has observed being preyed upon by fire ants. Elliott (1992) cites other examples and notes that fire ant activity has increased dramatically in Central Texas since 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the threat posed by fire ants was not recognized at the time these species were listed, the magnitude of the threat the ants pose has subsequently become quite apparent. Even in the unlikely event that fire ants do not prey upon the listed species, their presence in and around caves could have a drastic detrimental effect on the cave ecosystem through loss of species, inside the cave and out, that provide nutrient input and critical links in the food chain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Controlling fire ants once they have invaded the cave and vicinity is difficult. Chemical control methods have some effectiveness but the effect of these agents on non-target species is unclear. Consequently, using chemicals to control fire ants in and near caves is not advisable. Currently, the Service recommends only boiling water treatment for control of fire ant colonies near caves inhabited by listed invertebrates. This method is labor-intensive and only moderately effective. Presently, the burden of carrying out such practices is not a designated or mandated duty of any agency, individual, or organization. This type of control will likely be needed indefinitely or until a long-term method of fire ant control is developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Invertebrates are not included on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's list of threatened and endangered species and are provided no protection by the State; nor do the Department regulations contain provisions for protecting habitat of any listed species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously discussed, some of the caves containing endangered invertebrates are in TSNL and city preserves. A small preserve surrounds the entrance to each of these caves. However, these preserves encompass only a fraction of the surface drainage area that provides input of nutrients and moisture into the caves. The entire surface and subsurface drainage area is the minimum area believed necessary to provide adequate long-term protection for cave ecosystems. The preserves around these caves are not sufficient to counter nutrient depletion and prevent pollution, should the surrounding areas be developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the TSNL caves are under temporary deed to TSNL and may be sold at the owner's discretion (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). In addition, City of Austin cave protection laws do not apply in most cases, since the great majority of these caves lie outside the city limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service is unaware of other threats to these species beyond those discussed under factors A&hyph;D (above). As noted under Factor A, the Bone Cave harvestman exhibits considerable geographical variation. Loss of a number of locations within any one part of its range would result in a loss of genetic diversity for the species (Reddell,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1993). The Tooth Cave pseudoscorpion, Tooth Cave spider, Coffin Cave and Kretschmarr Cave mold beetles, and Bee Creek Cave harvestman are each known from fewer than 10 locations (4, 4, 5, 4, and 6 locations respectively, including unconfirmed identifications). Therefore, the loss of even a single location would represent a significant loss of genetic diversity for any of those species. Lack of genetic diversity can accelerate the decline or extinction of rare species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

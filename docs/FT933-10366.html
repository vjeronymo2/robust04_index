			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: PolyGram earnings improve 19% POLYGRAM shrugged off the European recession and raised net income by 19 per cent to Fl 204m (Dollars 107m) in the first half of 1993. Profits were lifted by the Sting album, Ten Summoner's Tales, which sold more than 3m copies in the first half. Mr Alain Levy, chief executive, said an increase in the group's continental European market share had mitigated the effects of the recession. Sales were strong in Asia Pacific but the group suffered a small decline in North American market share. In classical music, the recession and strong price competition resulted in a slight fall in sales. Overall, sales rose 6 per cent to Fl 3.2bn. Income from operations was up 18 per cent to Fl 319m. Net income per share rose 19 per cent to Fl 1.20. Mr Levy said the group had a strong release schedule for the second half, with new albums from Elton John, U2, Lionel Richie and Stevie Wonder. PolyGram will be releasing the cast recording of Mr Andrew Lloyd Webber's London musical Sunset Boulevard. PolyGram has a 30 per cent stake in Mr Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Holdings. Last May, Gramercy Pictures, the group's film distribution joint venture in North America, released its first movie, Posse.</p>

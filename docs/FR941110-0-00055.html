			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;We renumber proposed &sect;&sect;488.150&hyph;488.185 and proposed &sect;&sect;488.200&hyph;488.240 as &sect;&sect;488.300&hyph;488.335 and &sect;&sect;488.400&hyph;488.456, respectively, to take into account existing section numbers already included in part 488, subpart D. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We incorporate the provision of proposed &sect;488.240, Transfer of residents, into &sect;488.426 in the final rule. We revise the title of &sect;488.426 to Closure and/or transfer of residents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We incorporate the provisions of proposed &sect;488.228 into &sect;488.406 of the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Discussion of Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We received more than 27,900 timely letters in response to our August 28, 1992 proposed rule. Most were from the owners and operators, administrators, staff, and attorneys of long term care facilities. Others were from professional organizations, chains of long term care facilities, employee unions, and vendors that supply facilities. We also heard from consumer advocates and ombudsmen, Federal, State, and local governments, consumer organizations, and residents of long term care facilities. Families of residents and their guardians and other legal representatives commented as well. A discussion of the comments follows. We do not discuss sections of the rule on which the public had no comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, a final rule is not effective until 30 or 60 days after it is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Because implementation of the complex and far-reaching provisions of this final rule will require a major, nationwide training effort to train surveyors, their supervisors and related personnel, this rule is effective June 1, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effective Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that HCFA must provide nursing homes with a reasonable education and retraining grace period of no less than one year before implementing the new survey standards so that facilities can adjust to the enormous changes. The States and HCFA should provide reasonable funding to ensure that training is completed before the new requirements take effect. There is a precedent for this in HCFA's recent recognition that State certification requirements for home health care aides should be accompanied by State funding to help facilitate retraining. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HCFA routinely provides a long lag time for the effective date of particularly complicated regulations and has done so for this regulation as well. The new long term care requirements were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on September 26, 1991 (56 FR 48826), and were effective April 1, 1992. This final enforcement rule should have no effect on the requirements for long-term care as stated in the September 1991 regulation and the facilities should have had ample time to become familiar with its requirements. Our primary concern is to provide oversight for the protection of residents in nursing homes who are dependent upon others for the care they receive. It would serve no purpose to allow facilities to have additional time to become familiar with requirements of which they are already aware. Our responsibility is to continue to move forward in enacting the enforcement provisions for long term care facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

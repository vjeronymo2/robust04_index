			<p>BFN     [Text] Yahya Husayn al-'Arashi, Yemeni minister of civil  service and administrative reform, arrived in Morocco this  morning carrying a message from the Yemeni President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, to His Majesty King Hassan II, may God make him  victorious.    The Yemeni official spoke to the radio about this visit, and  said:    [Begin al-'Arashi recording] I have come carrying a message  from His Excellency Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council in the Republic of Yemen,  to his brother His Majesty King Hassan II.    As you know, Yemen is going through special circumstances,  therefore it was necessary to brief his majesty on the  development of the situation, particularly that the brother  president attaches special interest to his majesty's  point-of-view.    We also certainly start from the premise that the Kingdom of  Morocco, king, government, and people, stand beside Yemen and  its national unity and the unity of its Yemeni territory,  therefore it is necessary to put them in the picture for more  consultations over the consultations that are currently taking  place at the level of the Arab and Yemeni arenas.    It is a good opportunity to know the view point and also  clarify the stance directly. [end recording]</p>

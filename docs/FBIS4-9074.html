			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi by </F> RIA-NOVOSTI special correspondent Vladimir Gurzhiy in Tirana  under the "Diplomacy" rubric; date not given: "For Peace in  Europe, All States Must Make a Contribution"]    [Text] [Gurzhiy] Minister, what are the foreign policy  priorities of democratic Albania today?    [Serreqi] Albania's foreign policy is based on three main  directions. First, to facilitate the transitional period and  create favorable conditions for building a rule-of-law state and  establishing true democracy in Albania. Second, to accelerate  Albania's integration into Europe. Third, to secure a stable,  acceptable, and honest solution to what we call the all-Albania  question, which is directly linked with what is happening in the  former Yugoslav federation.    [Gurzhiy] What is Albania's approach to problems of  all-European partnership and cooperation, to the CSCE as an  all-region political organization, and to the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council as an organization of military-political  cooperation?    [Serreqi] As I already pointed out at the start of our  conversation, one of our foreign policy priorities is Albania's  speediest worthy integration into all European and international  structures. Here we rely on the reforms being implemented in  Albania and on the successes achieved on this path over the past  two years, and we take into consideration the special features  of the Albanian people's mentality via a pronounced European  orientation.    We believe that our main problems can be resolved more  successfully via fruitful cooperation with international  organizations than via bilateral alliances. We proceed from  this logic in building our relations with European security  structures -- above all, NATO -- at the first stage through  participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program and at the  next stage through full membership of this organization.    [Gurzhiy] How do you rate the Russian position on these  problems?    [Serreqi] We believe that membership of these international  organizations presupposes the fulfillment of all the provisions  of the corresponding documents. In the context of events in  Europe and in the world, particularly after the collapse of the  "bloc system," we believe that to build a more stable and  peaceful Europe all states must make a contribution. We rate  positively and support all efforts by other organizations within  the CSCE framework aimed at restoring peace and international  order. Any other approaches pose a threat to stability. They  cannot, of course, be welcomed.    [Gurzhiy] The resolution of the Albanian national question  obviously presupposes the Kosovo problem. What is Albania's  present position in respect to Kosovo?    [Serreqi] We believe that the problem of Kosovo is the key  to settling the crisis in the former Yugoslavia -- a crisis  which could spread to the whole of the Balkans. Under real  conditions, Albania takes a clear stand: We are opposed to  altering borders by force. We have repeatedly advocated the  inviolability of state borders. But this certainly does not  mean that we are abandoning our demands to observe the rights of  Albanians in accordance with international documents and the  norms of international law.    I believe that the Yugoslav crisis is complex. So far the  war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been its most tragic part, and it  is unfortunately continuing.    We welcome the recent very promising initiatives aimed at  extinguishing the flames of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, just as  we supported the NATO ultimatum, the sanctions resolution, and  the Russian presence aimed at persuading the Serbs to join in  this process.    We insist that the "Kosovo question" must be a constituent  part of the overall plan for settling the crisis as its key  problem. We believe that pressure must be put on Serbia to make  it agree to the establishment of international control over  Kosovo, starting with the return of the CSCE observers mission.  Second, the question of lifting or easing the sanctions should  be linked not only with the restoration of peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina but also with the resolution of the problem  of the Albanians in Kosovo.    [Gurzhiy] So do you believe that the problem of Kosovo must  be tackled right now, without waiting for a settlement in  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Serreqi] The crisis in the former Yugoslavia is complex.  We respect the strategy of a phased resolution, but we cannot  agree with the sidelining of its key elements. The problems of  the crisis are organically linked to one another and must all be  resolved together -- step by step. The war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina has somewhat pushed other problems into the  background. The international community must realize that a  potential threat of the widening of the crisis is linked with  them. Thus, in respect to Kosovo it is obvious that it is  unacceptable to regard the Kosovo problem as an internal matter  for Serbia. If this problem is not tackled in a timely way on  the basis of an honest and fair approach, the threat of the  destabilization of the situation inside and outside the Balkans  will arise.    [Gurzhiy] What place does Russia occupy in Albania's foreign  policy? How do you rate Russia's Balkan policy and, on the  whole, the state of Albanian-Russian relations and their  development prospects?    [Serreqi] Russia's presence in the Balkans is a historical  fact, and its present participation in the context of the  development of events in the former Yugoslavia is real. If we  base ourselves on our previous conclusion that this presence  must be realized within the framework of the efforts of the  international community (CSCE, NATO), then any contribution,  including Russia's, aimed at establishing peace should be  welcomed.    In terms of bilateral relations, I would like to emphasize  that we have long been working with Russian Ambassador to  Albania V. Nerubaylo on the realization of a visit to Moscow by  an Albanian Government delegation headed by A. Meksi, chairman  of the Council of Ministers. We are awaiting a decision on the  date of the visit.    [Gurzhiy] I believe that your interview will also serve to  realize this visit. In this connection, what would you like to  convey to Russian readers?    [Serreqi] Unfortunately, I have not yet had an opportunity  to visit your country, but I believe that I do nevertheless have  some idea of Russia. I am not sure that my knowledge of the  political situation is consonant with my acquaintance with  Russian culture. The sociopolitical changes in your country have  been so great and so rapid.... In particular, I feel optimism  at the well-known assessments of the Russian people's spirit and  culture, and I am sure that the present processes will lead  Russia to democracy. I would be pleased to visit your country  as soon as possible. I also hope that your country might be  able to make a worthy contribution to European and world affairs  under conditions of genuine democracy.</p>

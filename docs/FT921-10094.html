			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Provision dents Waste Management returns WASTE Management, the largest US waste disposal company, yesterday reported a fall in 1991 profits to Dollars 606.3m from Dollars 684.8m a year earlier. But the reduction comes after a special after-tax charge of representing the company's estimate of its share of future liabilities relating to the clean-up of old disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Liability and Compensation Act. The company warned last month that the clean-up charge would be taken in the fourth quarter, and yesterday its shares gained Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 46 1/4 . Before this extraordinary item, annual profits increased from Dollars 709.3m to Dollars 787.3m, on revenues up from Dollars 6bn to Dollars 7.55bn, and fourth-quarter profits improved from Dollars 195.6m to Dollars 207.5m. Earnings per share for the year - which saw Waste Management acquire Wimpey Waste Management in the UK via a joint venture partnership with Wessex Water  -fell from Dollars 1.44 to Dollars 1.23, with the charge accounting for 37 cents.</p>

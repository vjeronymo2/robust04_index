			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestine Ambassador to Jordan al-Tayyib  'Abd-al-Rahim, who is minister of presidential affairs in the  Palestinian National Authority, has welcomed the progress  achieved so far on the Jordanian track in the peace process. He  said what was achieved represents a Jordanian accomplishment and  commitment to what had been agreed upon between Arab parties  involved in the peace process. Mr. 'Abd-al-Rahim denied that  negotiation on each track would lead to isolating one Arab party  and leave Israel capable of imposing its conditions on it. He  said such reasoning is not correct because there are constants  and each Arab side seeks just and comprehensive peace. He  added: No final peace treaties before each track solves issues  related to it. He said what has been achieved on the Jordanian  track supports the Palestinian track, stressing accumulative  achievements on each track constitute support for the other  tracks.    Mr. 'Abd-al-Rahim explained that achieving progress on the  Jordanian track would generate further breakthroughs on the  Palestinian track and would push the Syrian and Lebanese track  forward. The Palestinian official said the progress on the  Jordanian track spurred underway international efforts for  scoring progress on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. He paid  tribute to Jordan's support of the Palestinian side in the field  of deepening the Palestinian track and crystallizing the  Palestinian identity.</p>

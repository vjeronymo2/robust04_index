			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EAST WARY OF WEST GERMAN AID OFFER  </P> <P> East German newspapers today appeared to dismiss West Germany's offer of  massive financial aid, and Mikhail S. Gorbachev reaffirmed his opposition to  German reunification and sharply criticized Westerners who suggest that  socialism has failed.  </P> <P> Activity on the western side of the Brandenburg Gate at dawn suggested that an  early opening of the symbol of German unity as an East-West crossing point was  likely.  </P> <P> But there were no signs of construction work on the eastern side of the Berlin  Wall, and West German police said their East German colleagues had told them  not to expect an opening during the course of the day.  </P> <P> Opening the Brandenburg Gate is clearly a sensitive one for East Germany, given  the symbolism of the six-column Grecian arch, scene of Prussian and Nazi  triumphal parades.  </P> <P> Diplomatic sources said the Soviets are likely to be playing a significant role  in East-West negotiations about opening the gate, which spans the main trunk  road through the heart of Berlin.  </P> <P> Economist Karl-Heinz Arnold told the Communist Party newspaper Berliner Zeitung  that East Germany can manage its own economic recovery, an indication that  Bonn's conditional aid offer may be rejected.  </P> <P> "I don't see any need to dramatize the internal or external financial  situation" of East Germany, Arnold said.  </P> <P> The government newspaper Bauern Echo, aimed at East Germany's farmers, warned  of becoming too greatly influenced by West Germany.  </P> <P> "Yes to unrestricted travel. No to an East German sellout," the paper declared.  "Yes to meeting again, no to reunification. The two German states are  politically and economically too diverse."  </P> <P> There was no official response from the government to West Germany's offer,  which would require East Germany's ruling Communists to fundamentally reform  their centrally planned economy. Communist officials have made it clear that  they do not favor a full free-market system.  </P> <P> Gorbachev for the second day warned Westerners not to expect German  reunification.  </P> <P> "Talking about reunification would mean interference in the affairs of West  Germany and of the German Democratic Republic," Gorbachev said in a speech to a  student meeting.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said Westerners who claim the changes in the East signify the failure  of socialism are engaging in "wishful thinking." He did not say who he was  referring to. "We are expanding the potential of the socialist social system,"  he said.  </P></p>

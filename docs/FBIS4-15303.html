			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Turkey Supplies Ammunition To the Azeri Army" -- ARAGIL </F> headline]    [Text] Stepanakert ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 04/06/94 --  The situation at the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh]  fronts is unchanged. As on previous days, the sides refrained  from active military operations. Nevertheless, in spite of some  pressure decrease, the Azeri units continue shelling the  Armenian positions.    According to the RMK Defense Army headquarters, in the  evening of April 4 and April 5 night the enemy units, stationed  at the villages of Akhmedbeyli, Kerimbeyli (Berinbeyli (?)  "AZG") and Arayatli in the Fizulinskiy district, shelled the  Karabakh guardpoints at the villages of Mirzajamali and  Karakhanbeyli. No casualties are reported. During the night  and in the morning of April 5 the Azeri soldiers in the villages  of Bashkervend, Afatli and Chemenli in the Agdamskiy district  shelled, using mortars and large caliber machine- guns, the  Karabakh defense positions at the villages of Geoytepe, Maksudlu  and Seyidli. Again, no casualties are reported. The Karabakh  side refrained from retaliating. Later in the afternoon on  April 5 the enemy troops, stationed in the northern section of  the Mardakertskiy district, which is currently controlled by the  Azeris, particularly from the villages of Hasangaya, Karmiravan  and Seisulan (Heyzalagh "AZG"), shelled, using different kinds  of weaponry, the villages of Matagis, Magavuz and Aghabekalend.  No casualties are reported.    According to the RMK military reconnaissance, active  movements of the enemy manpower and military equipment is  reported at several sections of the front. The specialists  believe, these probably mean enemy's preparation to a new  large-scale offensive.    According to a representative of the RMK Defense Army Rudolf  Martirosyan, the shells recently launched by the Azeris in the  Agdamskiy district have mostly been made in 1990 in Turkey.  This is not the first case when the Azeri troops used  Turkish-made weaponry in military operations. Mr. Martirosyan  mentioned the recent events in Kelbadzharskiy in this regard:  the Armenian soldiers found large ammunition stores containing  Turkish-made shells and mines. In addition to this, the same  sources report, some 200 "Grey Wolves" are currently fighting at  some sections of the front. According to Mr. Martirosyan,  Turkey's active military, political and financial aid to  Azerbaijan shows once again that Turkey is going to continue  interfering in the internal affairs of CIS countries.</p>

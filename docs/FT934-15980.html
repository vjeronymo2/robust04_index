			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Clarke Nickolls Clarke, Nickolls &amp; Coombs, the property group, returned to the black in the six months to June 30 with Pounds 141,000 pre-tax. The outcome compared with losses of Pounds 218,000 at the same stage of 1992 and Pounds 47,000 for the full year. The pre-tax line was struck after an exceptional provision of Pounds 25,000 (Pounds 126,000) against properties held for resale. A charge of Pounds 346,000 covering withdrawal from property development activities was taken below the line: it will be taken at the operating level in the full year figures. Earnings per share emerged at 0.68p (losses of 1.02p).</p>

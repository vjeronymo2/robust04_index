			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Cutting the cost of conveyancing - Helga Drummond provides a 'good service' checklist for those planning to move home TIMES MAY be hard in the property market, but the vast majority of people still leave conveyancing to the professionals in spite of the cost. Most believe it is worth the expense of 'getting it all done properly through a solicitor' in spite of reports of the shoddy service clients sometimes receive. Although it pays to shop around for competitive quotes, fees can be a poor guide to quality. Expensive firms are not necessarily the best and cheap ones are not necessarily the worst. In the absence of a reliable recommendation, how should you choose which solicitors' firm to act for you? Large firms have the advantage of modern technology and a streamlined service. However, your money rarely buys the attention of a partner and sometimes not even an assistant solicitor. Large firms, moreover, are extremely profit-conscious which may be reflected in a hard-nosed attitude towards clients. Working practices and standards are designed to be cost effective which means you stand to get the bare minimum. The smaller high street practices provide a more personal service, but before instructing one, ask what proportion of their work is conveyancing and whether there is a conveyancing partner. Be wary of firms which deal predominantly with crime, matrimonial and personal injury matters. Such firms often do conveyancing because the money is useful, but, since it forms such a small proportion of their work, their systems may not be properly geared for it. The work may be delegated to an unsupervised clerk who is expected to fit conveyancing round everything else. This caveat applies particularly to firms deriving a large proportion of their income from Legal Aid work. Legal Aid work is only profitable if done in volume, and volume can create administrative burdens sufficient to defeat small practices. If something goes wrong, the senior partner may not care that much - after all, it is not as if the firm has a sterling reputation in conveyancing to lose. Even if you are promised the attention of a partner or an assistant solicitor, beware. Solicitors in high street practices spend a lot of their time in court. Where will yours be when you need him or her? These caveats are becoming increasingly relevant as conveyancing is no longer a source of easy money for solicitors. The firm that gave a good service five years ago may now have different priorities. The best choice may be the old-fashioned family solicitor. Such firms deal almost exclusively with domestic conveyancing and probate. Your money therefore is likely to buy the personal attention of the principal or a partner. With some firms clients are ideally never seen and seldom heard, but the old-fashioned solicitor will ask you 'to kindly attend this office' where he (it is usually a he) will 'take down the particulars'. The chances of a mistake being made are low. Conveyancing and probate practitioners are typically schooled in a tradition of meticulous attention to detail supplemented by decades of experience. The same goes for their support staff. Further, long-established practitioners have the advantage of knowing the local property market. They know which parts of town are prone to subsidence, which properties sell easily and which ones habitually stick. They may even know the antecedents and boundaries of your proposed purchase. The 'after sales' service provided by traditional practices is likely to be superior to that of large firms. Turnover in large firms is high so that if a query arises later, the person who dealt with the conveyance may have left, whereas the old fashioned solicitor is likely to still be around. There are disadvantages in instructing an old fashioned firm. Many practitioners qualified when deeds were still hand written and solicitors travelled to each other's offices in order to exchange contracts. The technology and working practices of some firms continues to reflect a bygone era. They are the least likely to invest in a fax machine, for example. This could prove a problem if you need to move swiftly. Another drawback is that many conveyancing and probate solicitors are sole practitioners. Some mortgage lenders will not deal with them because of the risk of fraud. Before instructing a firm, you should visit it and trust the evidence of your own eyes - if part of the lettering on the nameplate is missing, then maybe the solicitor has lost interest in the practice, for example. Some firms employ a partner to act as a 'front' man or woman. Insist upon meeting the person you will actually be dealing with. What is their status in the firm? What are their qualifications and experience? Do they inspire confidence? The second purpose of a visit is to negotiate the fee. Although some firms use rigid scales, others, especially smaller ones, base the quotation partly upon an assessment of what they think they can wring out of a particular client. The minimum commercially viable fee for small practices is about Pounds 250. That means any quotation above this figure is potentially negotiable. Some firms quote a range, such as Pounds 800 to Pounds 950. The aim is to entice the client by pitching the lower of the two figures but with every intention of charging the larger sum. Turn the tactic against them by saying you will accept a firm quote of Pounds 800. Even the larger firms may be open to persuasion. As they well know, the work involved in the conveyance of a Pounds 150,000 town house is about the same as that entailed in the conveyance of a Pounds 28,000 'back to back'. Although Pounds 1,000 in fees is preferable from the firm's standpoint, Pounds 900 may be preferable to losing the instructions. Check the level of service on offer and if appropriate negotiate on that too. All solicitors will say, 'Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any doubts or queries.' But what does that mean? Is the solicitor prepared to visit the property if the boundaries are unclear? What if the conveyance raises a difficult point of planning law or buildings regulations - is that included in the fee? Is the solicitor willing to organise for simultaneous exchange and completion if required? What will the charges be the the deal collapses? The benefits of negotiation go beyond the financial. Even the most sophisticated clients are sometimes in awe of the legal profession, a fact which some solicitors are not above exploiting. Your questions will teach the solicitor respect, the factor most likely to 'assure you of the best of attention at all times'.

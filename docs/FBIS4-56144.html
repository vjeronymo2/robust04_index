			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 26 May (MTI) -- "The next government --  whether a coalition or not -- should strive to create social  peace, which can best be done if balanced power relations evolve  as a result of the parliamentary elections," Gabor Fodor, ranked  second on the national election list of the Alliance of Free  Democrats (SZDSZ), told a news conference in Budapest on  Thursday.    The SZDSZ does not approve of a single party determining the  work of the next parliament instead of a sensible compromise  between various political parties, as compromises always have  greater social support than the decisions of one party, Fodor  said.    SZDSZ campaign chief Balint Magyar stated that electors will  determine what coalition opportunities exist after the second  round of voting on May 29, and whether the balance of different  political forces will be ensured within the new government.    The SZDSZ is aware that the country needs a balanced  government which is able to put an end to social division.  During coalition talks after the run-off elections, the Free  Democrats will strive to help the emergence of a new government  with a large social following, ready to deal with economic  questions instead of ideological debates.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As you know, Jaba Ioseliani [head of Georgian  delegation at Abkhaz-Georgian negotiations] has been in the  United States for several days. A few minutes ago, we phoned  him in Washington. Mr. Ioseliani said that he has had very  important meetings in the UN Security Council, chiefly  pertaining to a peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian problem.  Asked whether the United Nations will be sending peacekeeping  forces to Abkhazia, Ioseliani said:    [Begin Ioseliani recording] I have just been to the Security  Council. It is not a simple thing for America and neither is it  for others. It must be clear why and for what reasons. It  should be decided whether America and other Western countries  will participate in this action. It costs 100 million [currency  not specified] to carry out this operation. No one wants to  spend this amount. Why should I spend this money and send you  troops if you fail to manage your own business and the United  Nations does not have that money? Deputies, members of  parliaments, congressmen are against this. But this time the  attitude is a little bit different and if Shevardnadze's visit  influences congressmen and others, especially senators, whose  concern this allotment of funds is, then everything will be all  right. [end recording]    We regret that the quality was poor due to the telephone  line.    Finally, an official document about the UN peacekeeping  forces can be received but, according to the United Nations,  these forces will comprise Russian servicemen only. Today, at  the Security Council, there will be a discussion pertaining to  the extension of a peace mandate for the UN observers in  Abkhazia. Jaba Ioseliani has been planning to make a speech on  recent developments in Gali rayon.    Asked what significance is attached to Eduard Shevardnadze's  visit to the United States, Jaba Ioseliani said that  Shevardnadze's authority could have a decisive influence on the  handling of the issue of sending UN peacekeeping forces to  Abkhazia. During these very days, it will possibly be decided  whether the United States and the European countries will take  an active part in the handling of current processes in the  Caucasian region.</p>

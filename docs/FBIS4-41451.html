			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has signed an  agreement on partnership and cooperation between Russia and the  EU on the Greek island of Corfu. Our special correspondent Ilya  Kapelevich reports:    The agreement defines the conditions and stages for the  development of economic cooperation between Russia and greater  Europe. Over a year and a half were needed to draw it up. The  signing of the document was postponed twice. Now it looks as if  partnership between Russia and the European Union is becoming a  reality. What does it promise for our country?    [Begin Yeltsin recording] We benefit from this agreement. We  are entering free trade with Europe on equal terms without any  of the discriminatory measures that existed in the past and  which still exist in other countries outside Europe. Therefore,  this is a wise and strong step by the European Community, all of  its leaders and heads of states. I think that a historic step  has been made today that will prevent an economic cold war. [end  recording]    The treaty encompasses not only various aspects of relations  at inter-state level, but also opens up new possibilities for  ordinary citizens and enterprises. In accordance with the  treaty, the European Union countries will remove all the  discriminatory measures against Russian citizens seeking  employment in Europe. The procedure for getting visas for those  who obtained work illegally will be simplified. Europeans in  Russia will enjoy the same rights.    Russian banks now have the full right to work in European  countries, while the restrictions on the work of foreign banks  in Russia will be preserved for the next two years.    The point of the treaty protecting the activities of  European  entrepreneurs in Russia against unforseeable changes in  legislation, which happens quite often in our country, is  extremely important for European entrepreneurs. The newly  introduced restrictions will not affect them for three years  from the time they are brought into force.    The agreement envisages the development of a political  dialogue at all levels. This will enable the interested parties  to maintain permanent contact and to consult on major problems  regarding European security.</p>

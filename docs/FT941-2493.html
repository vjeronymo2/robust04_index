			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Blacklist may help stamp out EU's agriculture fraud: Deborah Hargreaves finds some countries more willing than others to crack down Mr Rene Steichen, European agriculture commissioner, says he will soon propose a 'blacklist' of people and companies which have fraudulently got hold of European Union farm funds. Mr Steichen's plan follows a report last month by the European Court of Auditors, the EU's financial watchdog, which was highly critical of the Commission and member countries for not doing enough to stamp out fraud in the Ecu36bn (Pounds 27.2bn) agriculture budget. The EU could be losing over Ecu200m a year from agricultural fraud, according to some estimates. But the complexities of the Common Agricultural Policy also mean companies can manipulate the system quite legally. 'It is such a labyrinthine muddle of regulations that anyone with a keen mind can quite easily work out how to exploit the system legally or illegally with little risk,' said Mr Brian Gardner, director of EPA Associates, an agriculture consultancy. The complicated regulations governing the CAP also make it difficult to track down fraud. The court's report cited 5,775 reported cases of fraud and irregularities uncovered by the Commission since 1972. Those cases had cost the union Ecu725m, but the Commission and member countries had managed to recover only Ecu77.7m of the funds lost. The Commission has to rely largely on member countries to police abuses of the system and some are more diligent than others. Farmers themselves receive about a third of the agricultural budget directly. The rest of the money is spent on buying up and disposing of EU food mountains with funds being paid to exporting companies and other operators. The auditors point to the payment of export refunds, which subsidise the sale of surplus produce outside the EU, as an area where exploitation has been rife. Export subsidies account for around a third of agricultural spending. Some of the abuse is caused by negligence on the part of government authorities, but some companies are plainly profiteering from agricultural pay-outs. The Commission is reluctant to release names of companies or individuals involved in fraud because of pending civil actions in member countries. But investigations conducted by the Commission show the scope for abuse. For example, Commission officials investigating a tip-off from British government inspectors found that high quality beef was on sale in the UK and Italy at prices lower than the market rate. These sales involved beef that had been released from EU intervention stores which buy up surplus produce. It was destined for export as food aid to Russia. However, some exporters had substituted lower quality meat to send to Moscow and were selling off the high quality beef at knock-down prices. A Commission official points out that the mechanisms for recovering money lost in cases like this are complex and can take a long time to pursue. But a 'blacklist' of offenders should crack down on fraud in future. 'Anyone on the 'blacklist' would not be eligible to apply for EU aid for several years - on a sliding scale depending on the degree of error or fraud,' a Commission spokesman said. Mr Steichen has outlined his proposals to a budgetary committee of the European Parliament, but he will need the approval of farm ministers before a list can be drawn up. The Commission is responsible for investigating fraud, but member countries generally administer punishments and recover monies lost. Procedures for doing this can vary widely from country to country. The court of auditors stressed that the process of tracking down offenders is further complicated by the fact that member countries do not even have a common definition of what constitutes fraud. The Commission has stepped up its fight against farm fraud and last year sent out 50 missions of its inspectors to look into deception involving Ecu400m. Irregularities often arise because of a lack of adequate records kept by member governments. Commission examiners made 150 applications to check member countries' own records last year with the result that some big revisions were made. In Italy, inspectors found 250,000 tonnes of durum wheat missing from EU stores. One major investigation recently involved the inspection of olive oil stocks in Italy which had been purchased by that country's intervention board. However, the Commission inspectors found that one-third of the stocks were not of a high enough quality to qualify for intervention. Of the remainder, 60 per cent was of a lower quality than the Commission had already paid some Ecu35m for. Companies can often exploit loopholes in regulations and lack of adequate monitoring to make a profit from EU business. But some operators go to elaborate lengths to defraud the EU. The court's report picks out the payment of export refunds as a particular problem area because the complexity of the system for claiming subsidies leaves it open to abuse. The auditors' report tells the tale of 10,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder destined for export to Algeria. The powder was produced in various member countries and loaded on to seven ships in the Netherlands. The ships, however, never left the German port of Emden but the exporter, Dutch company with subsidiaries in the UK and Switzerland, claimed Ecu15m of export subsidies. It proved difficult to pursue the perpetrators of the fraud because applications for licences and subsidies had been made in several member countries. That is the problem for the Commission in stepping up its fight against fraud - it needs co-operation from member governments and some are more willing than others to crack down.</p>

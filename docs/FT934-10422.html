			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pay is not decided by the market Sir, The articles on performance-related pay (Management: 'Rewards for the top performers', November 3) pose the question of why PRP seems unstoppable even though there is little or no evidence that it has any positive effect on motivation. Two reasons for the popularity of PRP can be suggested. First, with PRP each individual can be rewarded differently, even though employees' actual output on specific activities may be the same. This is unlike other types of individual performance pay, in particular payment by results (PBR), typified by piece rates. Being based on appraisals rather than just measures of output, PRP can take account of factors that are not easily quantifiable, such as commitment and initiative. At the same time this makes it difficult for workers to get together to fix their output and pay in the way that they were able to do with piece rates, which were once the basis of shop stewards' strength in industries such as car assembly. Second, government patronage of PRP probably owes something to a naive belief that PRP embodies principles derived from free market economic models that can be applied to management. But the view that 'the market' decides practically everything that is not decided by government leaves no role for management. In fact, as anyone who receives PRP must be aware, their level of pay is not decided by 'the market' but by the subjective judgments of the manager who appraises them.

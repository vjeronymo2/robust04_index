During a press conference, Molina was more explicit, stating  that the drug traffic has infiltrated not only the police ranks  in Chihuahua, but also the banks, through money laundering, as  well as the real estate business, concealing wealth produced by  drug sales through the purchase of residences.    He also remarked that the Attorney General's Office Internal  Affairs Department will expand its action, including in its  investigations socioeconomic studies of State Judicial Police  agents, as well as of agents and experts from the Public  Prosecutor's Office.    He stressed that, after the audits to assess the integrity  of  the personnel and their performance in the administration of  justice, an attempt will be made to prevent suspicious  procedures or the drawing up of records that do not coincide  with the facts.    He noted that, in the investigation to be conducted of all  members of the PJE, there must be consistency between what they  earn and the circumstances under which they live. Their  socioeconomic level will be observed, including the cost of  their homes, cars, and assets in general.    Returning to the topic of the drug traffic's infiltration,  he  commented: "It has affected various structures, and we cannot  claim that this evil has been eliminated here, because it still  persists."    Finally, he admitted that, although Chihuahua is not a  trafficking site, it is, unfortunately, one used for drug  growing and production.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> BRENDA RUSSELL GOES SLUMMING AT THE STRAND  </P> <P> What is Brenda Russell doing singing stupid songs like "Stupid Love"? She's not  Paula Adbul. Such bouncy pop-funk fluff is beneath her.  </P> <P> At the Strand on Sunday, the singer-songwriter's set was punctuated with  danceable throwaways that had commercialism written all over them. These songs,  like "All-American," are from her latest album, "Kiss Me With the Wind."  Russell is obviously hit-hunting, which is quite understandable. But she missed  the mark with these up-tempo songs.  </P> <P> This kind of material doesn't suit the dignified, elegant Russell, and she  didn't really immerse herself in those get-down, funky songs. She seemed  distant from them -- as if she were slumming.  </P> <P> Russell is noted for intimate story songs -- "Dinner With Gershwin," "Night  Train to Leningrad," her big hit "Piano in the Dark" -- that are filled with  insightful observations and clever lyric touches. She might have been very  successful earlier in the century, back when Porter and the Gershwins were  active.  </P> <P> With her high, rich voice backed by an instrumental quintet and three support  singers, Russell scored on dramatic, emotion-drenched ballads. She has a strong  sense for this kind of material and knows how to interpret it most effectively.  Clearly, she felt comfortable with the ballads.  </P> <P> Now if she'd just choose her up-tempo material more carefully.DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

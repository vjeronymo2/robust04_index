			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Markets: Eager buyers ignore vote of no-confidence - Wall Street WHO WOULD have thought it? Just as Wall Street was settling down for its annual summer slumber, and the red braces brigade were dreamily contemplating a month of quiet weekdays and long lazy weekends in the Hamptons, share prices took off this week in a frenzied orgy of buying not seen since the first days of the year. In just two days, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped almost 100 points while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, the broadest measure of the market's performance, rocketed to an all-time high. And, after more than a week of light trading turnover - when it seemed many institutional investors had all but closed their books for the summer holidays - volume roared to extremely high levels as investors rushed into the market in the hope of catching the rapidly rising tide of prices. Oddly enough, the spark that lit the fire under stocks was a report of a sharp drop in consumer confidence. On Tuesday morning, the Conference Board announced that its index of consumer confidence plunged 11.6 points in July to 61.0, a decline that stunned analysts who had been expecting little change. The stock market did not respond directly to the confidence numbers but, rather, to the reaction the figures triggered in the bond market. After months of refusing to push long-term bond yields lower because of fears about the outlook for inflation and concern about the size of the budget deficit, Treasury investors reacted to the consumer confidence report as if they had been struck by a mini-earthquake. Amid heavy buying of longer-dated government securities, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond finally dropped below 7.5 per cent after six months of hovering between 7.75 and 8. By yesterday, the 30-year was yielding just over 7.4 and still heading south. In a moment, the bond market's inflation and deficit worries seemed to have disappeared. It might seem premature to pass such a judgment after only a two-day rally, but Treasury market analysts claim that after the dreadful June employment report, a series of weak economic indicators out last month, and now the plunge in consumer confidence, investors suddenly have realised that inflation may not pose a threat to the value of their fixed-income assets for at least another year. Equity investors were delighted at this sudden turnaround in Treasury market sentiment. For most of this year, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the White House, Wall Street economists, and almost anybody else with an opinion, have been complaining that stubbornly high long-term interest rates were one of the main reasons why the economic recovery was so sluggish. The reasoning among those who were rushing into stocks this week was that if long rates are now finally coming down (and, more importantly, staying down), there is a compelling new reason to buy equities. This assumes, of course, that substantially cheaper long-term credit will prove to be the effective economic stimulant the Fed and the White House have said, all along, it would. Lower long rates should stimulate all interest rate-sensitive investment, further ease the burden on corporations and consumers for their debt repayments, and bring down mortgage rates. The economy is certainly in need of fresh life, judging by the latest gross domestic product figures released this week which put second-quarter GDP growth at 1.4 per cent, half the pace of the first three months and well below the growth rate seen traditionally after a recession. While the economy stuttered in the second quarter, some of the country's biggest corporations fared better. The giant car manufacturers began releasing their latest results this week, and the news was good. Chrysler kicked off on Tuesday with net earnings for the April-to-June period of Dollars 178m - not much of a return on sales and revenues of Dollars 9.3bn but a big improvement on the Dollars 212m loss incurred at the same stage last year. Ford followed the next day with a similar rebound, reporting net earnings of Dollars 502m compared to a year-ago loss of Dollars 324m. The market greeted both sets of figures warmly, pushing Chrysler's stock Dollars 2 1/4 higher to Dollars 21 1/2 and Ford Dollars 1 5/8 higher to Dollars 45 5/8 over the week. General Motors' stock also rose in sympathy, and the final of the big three should be releasing its second-quarter earnings within the next week or so. Monday     3282.20 -  3.51 Tuesday    3334.07 + 51.87 Wednesday  3379.19 + 45.12 Thursday   3391.78 + 12.70 Friday     3393.78 +  1.89</p>

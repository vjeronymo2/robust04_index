			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Ministers refuse fax explanation Ministers last night refused to explain a delay of nearly six months in initiating action against The Guardian newspaper for using a fake parliamentary fax to investigate the stay by Mr Jonathan Aitken, Treasury chief secretary, at the Ritz hotel in Paris. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, rejected attempts by Labour back benchers to block a Commons probe. They had claimed that any inquiry should have been initiated as soon as the government was made aware of the doctored fax. MPs approved by a majority of 275 (313-38) a motion which ensures that Mr Peter Preston, the editor of The Guardian, will have to appear before the privileges committee. Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, said there was a suspicion that the government had hoped to secure a political advantage by not taking action in May when it first knew of the 'forged letter'. He suggested that ministers took the view that 'in extremis' their knowledge of the forged letter would keep The Guardian quiet about asking all sorts of questions about other matters. Mr Norman Godman, Labour MP for Greenock and Port Glasgow, said the delay was unacceptable'. He added: 'I believe there is some kind of cover up.' Labour's frontbench team joined the government and voted in favour of the issue being referred to the committee. Mr David Wilshire, Conservative MP for Spelthorne, who led the demands for an inquiry by the privileges committee, said the methods used by The Guardian were at best 'ethically flawed'. At worst they were 'downright criminal' and amounted to a flagrant abuse of the Commons. Mr Wilshire attacked Mr Preston for failing to offer a proper apology. To cheers from Tory back benchers, he said: 'Over the past few days the nation has been treated to the mocking of decency and honesty and the attempted justification of deceit.' Mr Ian Bruce, Tory MP for South Dorset, described what had happened as a 'conspiracy by Mr Preston to try to hide the fact that he was working with a blackmailer in trying to bring down this government'. Mr Roger Gale, Tory MP for Thanet North and chairman of his party's backbench media committee, hoped that Mr Preston would be subject to criminal charges. He had written to the board of The Guardian to ask whether Mr Preston retained its confidence. Mr Alex Carlile, Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomery, supported the reference to the committee, but insisted that The Guardian should be congratulated for highlighting the behaviour of MPs when it was a legitimate matter of public interest.</p>

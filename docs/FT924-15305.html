			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: Quebecor in bid for three French printing plants QUEBECOR, North America's second biggest commercial printer, says it is negotiating to buy three printing plants in France, including one formerly owned by Maxwell Communication. Mr Pierre Peladeau, Quebecor chairman whose holding company includes Canada's second largest circulation daily newspaper, said the plants would form a base for a big foray into European printing. He said Quebecor had already made a bid for Imprimerie Cina Del Duca, of Blois, a magazine printer with annual sales of around USDollars 150m (Pounds 87.2m). If the deal goes through, production at the Blois plant would be rationalised. Mr Peladeau said he is also looking at a UK printing business with a view to a purchase. Quebecor acquired Maxwell Communication's US printing business two years ago for USDollars 510m. The company now operates 57 plants in North America, including Mexico. Printing accounts for half the group's annual sales of around USDollars 2bn. Inco is meeting union officials at its Sudbury and Thompson nickel mines and processing plants today to announce cost-cutting moves to offset declining metal prices. The unions say Inco will cut the work week from five to four days, but insisted they offered alternatives. Extended Christmas shutdowns are also possible.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Letter (4): Time to decide how Europe might be better managed Sir, The furore raised in the media about the negative Danish vote on the Maastricht Treaty is difficult to understand. With regard to the most important part of the treaty, it could hardly have been anticipated, even if ratification by all member states were assured, that convergence of economic performance would have permitted their inclusion in the initial EMU which is likely to be formed by 1997. It is to be remembered that four convergence criteria have to be satisfied (Article 109 of the Treaty). On this basis, the likelihood of Greece, Italy and Portugal qualifying seems remote, and given the Belgian public debt of well over 100 per cent of GDP, its prospects as a partner are not exactly brilliant, despite the Belgian government's urging that the Maastricht timetable be respected. If, therefore, Denmark stands on the sidelines for the time being as far as the Maastricht economic proposals are concerned, it will not be alone and the 'variable geometry' factor will be present whether that particular country is in or out. A Magnus, Avenue Boulogne Billancourt 70, 1330 Rixensart, Belgium</p>

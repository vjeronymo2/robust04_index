			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mahir Shmaytilli] </F>   [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 30 (AFP) -- Northern forces  battled their way to within two kilometres (a mile) of the  besieged city of Aden Thursday [30 June], as three civilians  were killed and eight wounded queuing for water during the night.    Military officials said northern troops loyal to President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih were just outside the suburb of Dar Sa'd on  Thursday morning after heavy fighting overnight.    Dar Sa'd is virtually deserted as residents have fled the  suburb in recent days after it suffered sustained shelling and  rocket fire.    Hospital officials said the three civilians were killed as  they queued during the night at one of the city's wells in the  western suburb of Mansurah.    Northern forces were also within five kilometers of  Mansurah,  according to southern officials loyal to Salih's former vice  president and southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid.    But in Moscow the two sides were said to be close to signing  a ceasefire later Thursday after talks with Russian Foreign  Minister Andrei Kozyrev, the ITAR-TASS agency reported.    The news came only hours after the UN Security Council  adopted a second resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire  and the start of talks.    After the vote, UN officials said a southern Yemen  representative pledged that Aden would observe a 48-hour  ceasefire starting Thursday to allow the delivery of relief  supplies.    Two explosions rocked the city early Thursday, causing  casualties, officials at the Al-Jumhuriyah hospital said,  without giving details.    More than 424 civilians have been killed and 1,170 wounded  since the north began its assault on the city on June 11.    Northern warplanes and artillery pounded the port on  Wednesday in a day of intense bombardments which killed 20  civilians and wounded 96.    Humanitarian workers have warned that Aden is on the edge of  a "catastrophe" stripped of water and fuel supplies.    Northern troops have cut off the south's access to its oil  refinery, destroyed the water pumping station and intense  battles have raged at Hiswah, 10 kilometres (six miles) from the  city where Aden's main power station is based.    Southern forces have dug in on the edge of Aden erecting  sand  barriers and hollowing out trenches to repel the north's advance.    The Security Council also authorized Secretary General  Butrus  Butrus-Ghali to study ways to supervise a ceasefire at its  meeting in UN headquarters in New York.    The resolution also denounced the civilian casualties and  destruction resulting from the assault on Aden, in what was seen  as a condemnation of northern Yemen.    But US Ambassador Madeleine Albright said after the vote  that  any ceasefire mechanism should be handled by neighboring states  for financial and other reasons.    Kozyrev held a series of private and joint meetings  Wednesday  with Yemen Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah and Salim Salih  Muhammad, a representative from the breakaway Democratic  Republic of Yemen.    ITAR-TASS said some technical details still remained to be  resolved but described the accord as an "important step" towards  resolving the conflict on the Arabian peninsula.    For nearly 25 years, prior to the reunification of North and  South Yemen in 1990, South Yemen was an ally of the former  Soviet Union.    War broke out on May 5 and al-Bid declared a separate state  two weeks later, shattering a fragile four-year union between  the former Marxist South Yemen and conservative tribal North  Yemen.</p>

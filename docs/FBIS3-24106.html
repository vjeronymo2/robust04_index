			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by an unidentified KAZTAG correspondent: "Western </F> Observers Disagree With Assessment of Organization and Conduct  of Elections in Kazakhstan"]    [Text] Elections in Kazakhstan were accompanied by numerous  gross violations of the procedure of expressing citizens' free  will. This was the conclusion, for instance, of observers from  the delegation of the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly, the  International Electoral Systems Foundation, and a number of  far-abroad countries that monitored the course of the election  campaign and elections in the republic.    In their opinion, violations mainly boil down to 10 points.  First and foremost, the republic's current system of candidate  registration is complex. They note vagueness and a lack of  concrete points in the programs of many contenders for deputy  mandates, and their poor coverage in the local mass media. Among  shortcomings impermissible for pluralistic democratic elections  they also named one person voting for himself and relatives,  bringing ballot boxes home to some voters, and the absence of  guards at some election precincts.    Foreign representatives also complained that they were not  permitted to visit a number of restricted-access election  precincts. From which it follows, according to them, that this  provided an opportunity for various forgeries and machinations.    To find out the reaction of the Central Electoral Commission  [CEC], we turned to its chairman, Karatay Turysov, and asked him  to comment on these and other allegations of foreign observers.  The answer was: They are all being carefully checked out now and  appropriate explanations on this subject are forthcoming.    I personally, noted K. Turysov, am not inclined to overly  dramatize the situation. We have to base the assessment of  elections on current realities in Kazakhstan; to ignore them is  to take a deliberately biased position. Take, for instance,  voting by a state list. This procedure is built into the  Electoral Code, which had been adopted by the self-disbanded  Supreme Council, and ignoring it would be a direct violation of  the current law. The same could be said about elections in some  military units. Existing security procedures for protection of  state secrets do not permit letting foreign observers enter  special secret defense installations. But voting there was  conducted under the personal supervision of members of district  electoral commissions.    By the way, many other foreign observers, who take a more  realistic position, are well aware of this. In particular, those  from France, Russia, Turkmenistan, and a number of other  countries. For instance, the French Ambassador Plenipotentiary  and Extraordinary Bertrand Fessard de Foukalt in a personal  conversation with me characterized the organization and the  initial results of elections as a clear success of the young  Kazakh democracy.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY INSTITUTES DRUG TEST POLICY FOR EMPLOYEES  </P> <P> A tough new drug and alcohol policy will be used to discipline and fire city  employees who engage in substance abuse on the job, San Diego city officials  said Thursday.  </P> <P> According to the policy, which takes effect today, a worker will be required to  undergo a "compulsory" drug and alcohol test when a supervisor has "reasonable  suspicion" that the employee is abusing either substance.  </P> <P> Robert Ferrier, the city's labor relations manager, insisted that the  compulsory tests will be voluntary. "But, if they refuse to take the test, it  will be treated as insubordination, and we will take disciplinary action,"  Ferrier said.  </P> <P> The written policy states that it is not the city's intention "of intruding  into the private lives of its employees," but the plan also calls for  disciplinary action to be taken against employees who drink after work while  wearing a city worker's uniform.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for unions that represent some of the city's estimated 8,000  employees could not be reached for comment late Thursday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> White-Collar Workers  </P> <P> Safety personnel such as police officers, firefighters and blue-collar workers  are prohibited from drinking alcohol at work or during lunch breaks. However,  the rules are not as stringent for some white-collar employees, who were told  in the 14-page written policy that they are "strongly discouraged" from  drinking during lunch breaks and not at all at work.  </P> <P> The plan also has a nine-step procedure for urine testing, which does not give  employees the option of taking blood or breath tests. City employees who are  ordered to take urine tests will do so while being observed by "medical  assistants" under contract to the city.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the policy deals with a supervisor's  "reasonable suspicion," which will be enough to trigger an investigation of an  employee suspected of drug use. The policy does not require employees to be  caught in the act before they take a drug test. Instead, the policy says that  reasonable suspicion could be raised solely on "reliable information" that may  be given to a supervisor.  </P> <P> The policy does not say whether employees accused of drug abuse will be allowed  to question their accuser.  </P> <P> "Supervisors will be trained to recognize individuals under the influence of  alcohol or controlled substances," read the policy. They will be taught to be  on the lookout for symptoms that suggest drug or alcohol abuse such as "watery  eyes, unsteady gait and inattention to personal hygiene."  </P> <P> Another feature of the policy calls for disciplinary action to be taken against  employees who fail to inform their supervisors that they are taking medication  -- whether it be a prescription or over-the-counter medicine -- that might  impair their ability to do a job safely.  </P> <P> The new policy also calls for mandatory drug tests for any employee involved in  an accident while operating a city-owned vehicle or power equipment.  </P> <P> Employees who have substance-abuse problems are also encouraged to seek  voluntary treatment through the city's Employee Assistance Program.  </P></p>

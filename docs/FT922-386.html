			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / International Company News: Consortium launches DM1bn bid for control of Adidas RENE Jaggi, chief executive of Adidas, is heading a consortium of European investors in a DM1bn (Dollars 648m) bid to buy control of the German sporting goods group from Bernard Tapie, the controversial French businessman and politician. In a brief statement Mr Jaggi, who recently announced his resignation from Adidas if Mr Tapie stayed in charge, said the deal was being put together by Botts, a small London-based investment bank. The offer, which is believed to divide the DM1bn investment between the purchase price for Mr Tapie's 55 per cent stake and a capital injection, has a deadline of next Tuesday. Mr Jaggi, Adidas's chief executive for some four years, was not available for comment yesterday. But Pentland Holdings, the UK consumer products company which last year bought a 20 per cent stake in Adidas and has pre-emptive rights over Mr Tapie's holding, said it doubted the validity of Mr Jaggi's offer. Mr Frank Farrant, Pentland's finance director, said Pentland, which has long declared its interest in controlling Adidas, had not been informed about the bid. Under the terms of last year's deal, Mr Tapie is not allowed to sell his shares in Adidas unless the offer is extended - at the same price - to Pentland and the financial institutions that hold the remaining shares. Pentland is also entitled, according to Mr Farrant, to be given 'a respectable period of time' to decide whether or not to exercise its pre-emption rights. As a result, he said, if Mr Jaggi's offer expires on Tuesday, it would 'not be valid'. Mr Jaggi's announcement comes at a critical time for Mr Tapie, who has been struggling to repay the debt incurred in his acquisition of Adidas two years ago and who recently resigned from the French cabinet because of his involvement in a fraud case. Earlier this month Mr Tapie announced that Bernard Tapie Finances (BTF), his holding company, would make a FFr730m payment due on August 6, by the end of June. However, BTF, which had its shares suspended yesterday in Paris, has since run into problems with a number of proposed disposals. Adidas recently disclosed profits of DM44m for 1991, down from DM90m in 1990, on turnover of DM3.5bn.</p>

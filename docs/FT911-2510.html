			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / The Lex Column: British Gas On the face of it, British Gas has accepted a much harsher pricing regime than the market was expecting. Yet the shares barely moved, so perhaps the Ofgas review was in the price after all. That probably under-estimates the company's efforts yesterday to limit the damage. In admitting the scale of available efficiency gains, British Gas gives a hint why it was so keen to avoid referring the proposals to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Accepting the Ofgas formulae on domestic pricing and cost pass-through may have been a risk; but presumably it seemed a lesser one than exposing the company's remaining layers of post-privatisation fat to the official scalpel. The question is whether the review leaves British Gas less able to deliver real earnings and dividend growth. Even allowing for the gas industry's heady expansion, the company's medium-term rate of annual earnings growth may have halved to around 5 per cent. Anything more will largely depend on the success of the cost-cutting programme. As for dividend prospects, the water and electricity sectors look far more stable. British Gasshares have steadily under-performed the market this year; in relative terms, they are not far off where they were three years ago. The prospective yield of 6.7 per cent is justified until the company proves the case for a better rating - assuming, of course, that the regulator does not further tighten his grip.</p>

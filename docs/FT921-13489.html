			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / 30,000 job losses forecast in financial services THERE COULD be up to 30,000 job losses by the end of the year in the financial services sector, according to a Confederation of British Industry survey published yesterday. This could include a decline in employment among building societies for the first time since the quarterly survey started in December 1989. Companies in the financial services sector suffered a sharp decline in business confidence and falling volumes in the final quarter of last year, the survey found. The survey, conducted by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm, shows little prospect of early recovery in the sector, with overall optimism down by an average of 27 per cent over the previous three months. Of the companies questioned, 21 per cent said they expected the volume of business to rise over the next three months, while 33 per cent expected its value to rise. Those that thought both volume and value would remain the same made up 52 per cent. Building societies showed the sharpest decline in confidence, with 80 per cent predicting they would reduce staff numbers over the next three months, and 5 per cent expecting to increase employment. Banks and fund managers were also more pessimistic than in the previous quarter. Mr Angus Hislop, a partner in Coopers responsible for financial services consulting, said a perception that there would be no further decline of interest rates and the belief that house prices would not rise until next year had contributed to the negative attitude of building societies. Mr Sudhir Janankar, deputy director of economic trends at the CBI, said: 'There is a downturn in employment at a pretty rapid rate. There is a general restructuring in financial services now like the one that shook out manufacturing industry 10 years ago.' He stressed that there were positive signs. About 55 per cent of companies said they would invest more in information technology over this year, than in the previous 12 months. And average operating costs per transaction over the next three months would decline for 26 per cent of companies, implying efficiency was rising. 'It's a bit of light and shade,' he said. 'Companies will be in a good position to take advantage when the economy turns round.' First Data Resources, the credit-card processing offshoot of American Express, is to shed 420 of the 2,900 employees at its Southend and Basildon plants in Essex, David Barchard writes. The move is part of a shake-up inside the operation - previously known as Access, The Joint Credit Card Company - since it was bought by FDR from the four member banks of the Access credit card consortium in July for Pounds 146m. FDR cut 166 posts in October. Since then it has introduced new technology requiring a smaller workforce and the recession has meant there are fewer transactions.

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hampden Homecare Hampden Homecare, which operates Texas Homecare stores in Ireland, almost made a full recovery in 1991 after the setback of the previous year. Pre-tax profit of this USM-quoted group surged from Pounds 506,000 to Pounds 1.3m on turnover of Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 22.7m). The previous year was hit by an extraordinary Pounds 1.8m provision thought necessary following refusal of planning permission for a new store. Earnings per share rose to 6.37p (2p). The final dividend is 1.8p for a total of 2p (0.2p). In Northern Ireland margins moved ahead significantly. With the exception of Ballymena, all stores increased sales and profits. The flagship Sprucefield store re-opened in October 1991, following a fire. Mr Peter Goldstone is retiring as chairman and will be replaced by Mr Stratton Mills.</p>

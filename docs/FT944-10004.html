			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The night of the salesmen - David Spark only wanted three new windows . . . We decided to seek a couple of quotes for double-glazing as our 70-year-old front windows let in the cold and dust. We thought the quotes should take about half an hour each. So we arranged for one glassman to come at 7pm, the other at 8.30pm, which would allow us to have supper in between. We were mistaken. Our seminar in double-glazing lasted until 12.30 the next morning. We first got worried when Nath (not his real name), our 7pm visitor, did not go straight to measure the windows. Armed with a lawyer's voluminous brief case and a flipchart kit in black plastic, he made for the kitchen table, returning from time to time to his car boot for more ammunition. We had to have the full treatment, he said, in case we were inspectors. He was a pleasantly spoken Asian from east Africa, with grey-tinged hair and a smart grey suit, and he told us about his well-established employer, Company A, still with the founders in charge and selling glazing that bristled with locking bolts and British Standards. It was placed in its steel-reinforced frames from the inside, which made it harder for a housebreaker to remove. The white PVC frames would not go yellow, unlike Company C's. Special glass on the inside reflected heat back into the room. By this time it was 7.50pm, the potatoes were burning, and my wife was worried about the ham and leeks au gratin. Satisfied that he had said everything there was to say, and more, Nath measured the three windows. Then he produced some tables which turned measurements into quotes, allowing for the windows that had to open and the fact that we wanted to match the style of the road. The quote was around Pounds 7,500, and this was a special favour since it should have been Pounds 8,000 - the price had gone up that day. However, there were discounts which brought it down to Pounds 5,600. But we had to decide there and then. 'Say you'll think it over,' said my son Ian, himself a salesman. We said we would think it over. Nath asked if he could ring his boss. That brought a further Pounds 280 discount. But we said we would get in touch. Dave from Company B, subsidiary of a noted PLC, arrived just as Nath was leaving. He was a bubbly east Londoner who had sold double glazing for 12 years, ever since he realised he was too short for professional goalkeeping. He had sold glazing to himself and his grandmother. He married the wrong woman first time round, or perhaps she did not like the hours he worked. He had parted company with his gall bladder. My wife went to eat her ham, leeks and scorched potatoes while I listened to Dave's spiel. We now knew the form. His flipchart was not as elegant as Nath's but his PVC, he said, stayed whiter in the sunshine. It had this miracle ingredient, guaranteed for 10 years. Company A's windows might bristle with locking bolts but a thief could knock them out with a Black and Decker drill. His glass was put in from the outside and sealed with a tough beading. Thieves could loosen inside-mounted glass by gouging out the rubber piping. His windows had this special finish which repelled the dirt. He shook up dirty water in a glass bottle to prove it. After measuring, Dave kept his cards close to his chest. No showing of the price list, just a quote of Pounds 8,000. But it was possible, he said, that ours could be a showhouse. We would have a lot of points: a fair amount of passing traffic, 400 yards from the tube station, shops and school, and a house on which his glazing would look great. He would ring his boss. 'I bet he's on commission only,' said Ian. The phone call led him to furious pumping of figures into his calculator. Eventually he said we could have Pounds 1,230 off if we let them take before-and-after photographs. Displaying a small placard for four weeks was worth Pounds 1,000, and letting him show four customers the house from the outside another Pounds 1,000. That brought it down to Pounds 4,770 but there was a snag. 'I have to add VAT,' said Dave. That put him back up to Nath's price. We said we would think it over and let him know. 'What would it take to get you to decide tonight?' he asked. We refused to be drawn. There might just be a bit of budget going, he said. He would ring the boss. He came back with an offer of Pounds 4,450 including VAT and we decided to take it. It was 11.30 and I went for my supper. I need not have rushed. Form-filling took a further 45 minutes. Nath, when I told him the bad news next day, was understandably miffed. 'You rushed me,' he said, 'or I would have mentioned a showhouse.' A few minutes later he rang back. 'Here's my last shot,' he said, 'Pounds 4,100.'</p>

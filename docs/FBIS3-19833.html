But, because the rumor seems to be based on  a firm foundation of truth, the first intrigues and maneuvers  have already started. The path of "Jean-Luc who" to Jacques  Delors's seat is still long and sown with many ambushes.  [passage omitted]    Formally the appointment of a new Commission president is  the  privilege of the council of heads of government and heads of  state. However, there is no fixed procedure. Consequently the  appointment is preceded by a long bout of shadowboxing, in which  no one can get round France and Germany if they have made an  agreement between themselves.    The new president's profile is a broad one. A vision of  Europe is less important than the candidate's geographical and,  to a lesser degree, ideological origin. It is a little like the  appointment of the Swiss president.    Because the present Commission president is French and a  socialist, his successor may not be the former and preferably  not the latter either. This virtually rules out Denmark and  Spain, where socialist governments are in power. There is  little chance that they will put forward a candidate from their  opposition.    Italy has little chance, because every candidate there risks  being in a prison cell at the time when the call comes from  Brussels. With Gaston Thorn, Luxembourg provided the Commission  president before Delors.    Portugal has the ideal candidate in Prime Minister Cavaco  Silva, who is actually a Christian Democrat, but whose party is  simultaneously called "social democratic" and belongs to the  European liberals. However, Lisbon did not put forward any  claims. Ireland apparently gave up hope after former  Commissioner Peter Sutherland went to the GATT.  <H5>  Campaign </H5>   At present there are four known candidates to succeed  Delors.  Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, who is to resign after  the parliamentary elections of 12 May in his country; his  Belgian colleague Jean-Luc Dehaene; his predecessor Wilfried  Martens, now president of the European Christian Democrats, and  the British EU Commissioner Leon Brittan, once a minister under  Margaret Thatcher. [passage omitted]    Martens is better known abroad than his successor, who was  described by a journalist in THE TIMES last week as "Jean-Luc  who?" But Dehaene could well be able to count on the support of  Kohl and Mitterrand.    In addition there are even more political complications on  the agenda in Belgium. Belgium's representative at the  Commission is one of the portfolios which are divided on the  basis of a proportional system when a new government is formed.  If current Commissioner Karel Van Miert [Flemish Socialist  Party] has to make way for Martens or Dehaene, then compensation  must be provided. Senate Chairman Frank Swaelen's future is once  again uncertain.    It is still early in the appointment race. It is presumably  Helmut Kohl who is holding the finish flag. In addition it is  unclear whether the agreement which he and Mitterrand made 10  years ago when Delors was appointed, first a Frenchman, then a  German, still applies. It is even more intriguing that Kohl, in  a year when the German electorate will get rid of many CDU  [Christian Democratic Union] politicians, has not yet put  forward his own candidate.    Perhaps, because Germany has become so big and important in  Europe, he will chose a non-German representative, which would  explain why Kohl does not want Lubbers. Or has Dehaene been  floated as a candidate to undercut Lubbers, the favorite? After  which the latter flew Martens as a kite to trip up Dehaene? In  any case, this story will continue.</p>

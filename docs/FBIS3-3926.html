			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by WEN WEI PO news team: "Central Authorities Seek </F> To Maintain Stability, Decide To Postpone Some Reforms"]    [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (WEN WEI PO) -- As disclosed by an  authoritative source here, a senior CPC leader said a few days  ago: The central authorities have made it clear that future  reforms will be carried out in the light of overall benefits and  tolerance. This year, except for the financial structural  reforms in taxation, pricing, banking, foreign trade,  investment, and so on, which must be put into effect, other  reforms may be postponed for the time being after consultation,  if people really have misgivings about them. However, the  authoritative source did not give details about which reforms  would be put off.    According to the source, this is the latest guideline from  the CPC hierarchy on reform issues this year, after listening to  opinions from various quarters including deputies to the  National People's Congress, Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference committee members, and so on, in order  to maintain a stable situation wherein everybody has peace of  mind. The source quoted the senior CPC leader as saying: When  discussing the reforms for this year, in view of the fact that  the reform measures will be more vigorous and the reform content  more comprehensive, the central authorities are worried about  the issue of tolerance and, accordingly, have set out this  principle: All reform measures which can be introduced should  be put into practice as soon as possible but the risks from  should be assessed and those measures lacking the confidence of  success can be postponed for the time being.    The senior leader stressed that the financial structural  reforms in taxation, pricing, banking, foreign trade,  investment, and so on should be carried out this year.  Otherwise, reforms will never be accomplished. Since China now  wants to establish a market economy, these issues must be  settled sooner or later. As to how to get things done in a  safer way, we must be very careful indeed, in handling the  issues. Regarding those issues which people are really worried  about, these can be put off for the time being after  consultation. The central authorities have clarified the point  that, in future, the following two principles relating to reform  and opening up should be adhered to: 1) the people as a whole  should receive benefits, which means that the introduction of  any reform measure must bring benefits rather than losses to the  majority of the masses; and 2) taken as a whole, all reform  measures must be tolerable for the masses and, if they are  intolerable, they must not be introduced even though they are  correct. The question of when they should be introduced should  be decided in accordance with actual conditions.    The CPC leader maintained that the guiding ideology for  reforms this year is to exercise prudence in introducing reform  measures. If reform measures adopted this years are successfully  implemented, that will be a very important advance toward the  establishment of the market economy. Although we must be on the  alert against a number of issues, some of them being  comparatively serious, the central authorities are still  optimistic that reforms will meet with success. First, the  central leadership is relatively sober-minded as it has kept a  constant watch on the issue of overall benefits and tolerance.  Secondly, the current conditions are different from those in  1988, as there are more commodities in the markets and the  tolerance of the masses is also much greater. Thirdly, the  leading cadres in localities have preparations, aspirations, and  demands for accelerating in-depth reforms, so that some tough  reform problems can be tackled effectively together with the  central authorities with concerted efforts. The central  authorities call on leading cadres at all levels to be prepared  for danger in times of peace despite the exceptionally favorable  situation.</p>

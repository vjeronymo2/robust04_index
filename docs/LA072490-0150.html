			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> LOCAL ARCHITECTS HONOR SCHOOL DESIGNS, 'ON-THE-BOARDS' PROJECTS  </P> <P> The Orange County chapter of the American Institute of Architects has honored  projects conceived by local architects that are still "on the boards" --  designs that are not yet built. Of the eight awards (in "honor," "merit" and  "honorable mention" categories) bestowed at AIA's meeting Friday, three were  for educational buildings.  </P> <P> The UC Irvine Science Library -- designed by James Stirling, Michael Willford  &amp; Associates of London and the IBI Group of Newport Beach -- won an honor  award. Lawrence W. Speck, professor of architecture at the University of Texas  at Austin and spokesman for the four-member jury, called the circular edifice  with massive vertical wings "a monumental building of great presence" and  further praised its "beautifully functioning" interior with private study. He  said jury members were "a little concerned," however, about the folded glass on  the facade.  </P> <P> Speck added that the jury was "surprised" to learn that the library was  designed in association with Stirling, the eminent British architect: "We just  liked it because we liked it." Working drawings are being completed for the  project, and bidding on the construction is scheduled in October.  </P> <P> New Elementary School, Wood Ranch Site in the Simi Valley, by the Blurock  Partnership of Newport Beach, also won an honor award. "No one deserves good  architecture better than little kids," Speck said, singling out the project's  "strong, clear concept" and "well-developed plan" in which diverse elements are  unified "under a simple, broad roof." Construction is expected to begin next  spring, pending design approval by the school board.  </P> <P> Chapman Hills Elementary School in Orange, designed by Dougherty &amp;  Dougherty of Newport Beach, won a merit award. Speck said the organization of  the plan -- small groups of classrooms under an expansive roof -- gives the  building the feeling of a big, community-embracing "house." Construction has  begun, and the project is scheduled to be completed in February.  </P> <P> Designed by Mark H. Singer &amp; Associates of Laguna Beach, the Singer  Residence -- the architect's own house in Laguna Beach -- won an honor award  for "very experimental, personal expression" and the "sensual quality of space  and materials." The concrete walls were inspired by the materials of the house  in which Singer's wife, Myriam, lived in her native Peru. The house is under  construction.  </P> <P> Another award of merit was given to Valley Telecommunications Headquarters in  Van Nuys, designed by Leason Pomeroy Associates of Irvine, for "the ability to  make a vernacular industrial remnant into a very sophisticated and humanized  environment" in which even the tower serves as a visual symbol for  telecommunications. Groundbreaking is scheduled for January.  </P> <P> Honorable mentions went to Mark A. Keller &amp; Associates of Huntington Beach  for a budget-minded solution to low-income housing on a multi-use site -- the  Rugby Senior Apartments in Huntington Park -- and to Wimberly Allison Tong  &amp; Goo of Newport Beach for a renovation scheme for the Ritz-Carlton  Huntington in Pasadena.  </P> <P> The "People's Choice" award -- voted by passers-by who saw renderings of the 85  entries in South Coast Plaza's Jewel Court last week -- went to St. Paul's  Greek Orthodox Church, designed by Grillias Pirc Rosier Alves of Irvine.  </P> <P> During introductory remarks, Speck noted dryly that the jury had been  "intrigued by the 'Mission-ization' of Orange County. We saw more red-tile  roofs . . . " The audience of 500 architects and guests roared with laughter.  </P> <P> The Newport Harbor Art Museum's recent decision to fire internationally  renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano, and to replace him with Kohn Pedersen  Fox &amp; Associates of New York, didn't pass without comment.  </P> <P> "They've traded Ingmar Bergman for Steven Spielberg," lamented one local  architect, even though he said he had serious reservations about the  effectiveness of Piano's design because of its heavy dependence on  state-of-the-art technology.  </P> <P> Another architect expressed surprise at his colleague's quip: "Spielberg? Oh, I  would have said someone with a lot less artistry than that."  </P> <P> The jury also included James A. Murphy, profession and industry editor of  Progressive Architecture magazine; William Turnbull Jr., director of William  Turnbull &amp; Associates in San Francisco; and Peter Walker of Peter Walker  Associates, a San Francisco landscape architecture firm.  </P></p>

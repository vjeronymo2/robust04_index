			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The president of the Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF], Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, held a news conference  yesterday which focused on our country's current situation. He  answered journalists' questions on the cause of the resumption  of hostilities -- after a cease-fire which was announced by the  RPF and subsequently violated by government troops -- the  credibility of the negotiations, the continuing massacres in our  country, and on the politicians who are responsible for the  atrocities. [passage omitted] By announcing the cease-fire, the  RPF showed its predisposition for peace, but the war will always  be inevitable as long as its causes are not removed. This is a  condition for any other cease-fire.    In fact, the RPF president went on, the international  community first should solve the causes of the war before  pushing the RPF to negotiate. Saying that the war should stop  is not enough. If the international community had the will to  take measures against our war's causes, notably by energetically  condemning and actively opposing the continuing massacres in our  country, then the international community would have a right to  tell the RPF to stop fighting the (?government) forces.  Therefore, it is not honorable for the international community  to keep silent in the face of these horrible massacres, whose  perpetrators pursue survivors inside hospitals and finish them  off. The dishonorable attitude of the international community  contradicts the need for the cessation of hostilities.    If foreign nationals and UN employees were evacuated by  their  troops during the first hours of the massacres, why then should  the RPF not do the same for Rwandans who have been abandoned by  those same foreign troops [words indistinct]?    That is a question the international community should ask  itself, before making declarations on keeping the RPF from  fighting those criminals who launched themselves to power in our  country. [passage omitted]    Concerning war news, the RPF president recalled that the  fighting was turning in favor of the Rwandan Patriotic Army on  all fronts. The prefectures of Byumba and Kibungo are entirely  under the control of the RPF, as well as most of the prefectures  of Ruhengeri -- not to mention several communes in rural Kigali  and important strategic positions in the capital.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry issued a statement today  regarding developments in the situation around the Bosnian town  of Gorazde. The statement recalls the Bulgarian viewpoint  stated on 12 April 1994, which expressed alarm regarding the  possible development of a chain reaction of military actions and  an escalation of the conflict. Unfortunately, this chain  reaction is now a fact.    The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry once again appeals to the  warring parties to halt their military actions and show greater  flexibility and realism in the search for solutions. A  compromise on Bosnia-Herzegovina's present and future can be  found only at the negotiating table, only within a broader  European framework, with active cooperation and coordination  between the United States, the European Union, and Russia, and  with the assistance of the United Nations.    Bulgaria is ready to play an active part in the discussion  of  any international plan leading to the attainment of these goals;  it is also ready to make its diplomatic and political  contribution toward halting the bloodshed.    The Foreign Ministry is glad to welcome the initiative for a  summit meeting of representatives of the Russia, the United  States, and the European Union on the situation in Bosnia, and  hopes that a solution to this conflict may be found within the  framework of this meeting. The holding of such a meeting in a  country in the region in the immediate vicinity of the conflict  will constitute a clear signal that the participants in the  meeting are ready to commit themselves to an even greater extent  to restoring stability, security, and cooperation in the  Balkans, the Foreign Ministry statement says in conclusion.</p>

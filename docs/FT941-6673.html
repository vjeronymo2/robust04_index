			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / OFT to investigate warranties The Office of Fair Trading is to investigate the sale of extended warranties by retailers, after allegations that consumers are paying too much. The warranties provide protection on products - commonly electrical goods - after one-year guarantees have expired. The OFT was asked to carry out preliminary research into warranties sales in January by Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister. Mr Hamilton's decision came in response to a written question from Labour's consumer affairs spokesman Mr Nigel Griffiths, who claimed some retailers were selling extended warranties for more than twice what manufacturers charged. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said yesterday that his inquiries had revealed a 'wide range of prices for extended warranties on the same goods coupled with a lack of information about the choice of cover available to consumers'. The OFT would be consulting retailers, manufacturers and consumer groups to consider whether greater 'transparency' was needed in the market, and how to attain it. The investigation may have important implications for electrical retailers, particularly the market leaders Dixons, which also owns the Currys chain, and Comet, part of the Kingfisher group. Sales of warranties are thought to account for less than 10 per cent of Dixons' sales, but some analysts believe they account for a large part of the group's operating profits. About a third of customers take out extended warranties. Mr Griffiths claims that the electrical retailers, by failing to tell their customers that cheaper alternatives are available, are 'profiteering at their customers' expense'. Retailers claim their warranties cost more because they cover all parts and labour, as well as accidental damage, while manufacturers' warranties often cover only failure of parts. Retailers can also exchange products immediately with new ones if they are not repairable, or replace them with another manufacturer's product. The Radio, Electrical and Television Retailers' Association said it believed the majority of retailers' warranties offered 'good value for money'.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: No escape from nominee accounts Sir, When the third tranche of British Telecom shares was offered to the public, priority was given to those investing through a Share Shop. Those who purchased BT3 in this way (perhaps to augment their holdings in BT1 and BT2), found themselves locked into a separate nominee share account from which there is no escape. To sell shares acquired in this way would involve loss of the share bonus. The Share Shops offered Pep facilities for BT3 shares without initial charges, but even the maximum number possible allocated to an individual hardly made the exercise worthwhile in view of subsequent charges. The new offer of the remaining electricity generators' shares is through Share Shops only. Hence, existing holders of National Power and PowerGen shares (as well as new investors) will find themselves lumbered with holdings in two unwanted nominee share accounts from which, again, there will be no escape.

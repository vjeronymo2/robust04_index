			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> LENNON FAMILY TO STAR IN VENICE BACK-YARD SPIKER TOURNEY  </P> <P> Lennon-family watchers, whether fans of show business, boxing or volleyball,  will have plenty to do during the seventh annual Venice Backyard Volleyball  Championships from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sept. 10.  </P> <P> The Lennon sisters -- Diane, Peggy, Janet and Kathy -- will sing the national  anthem before the championship final.  </P> <P> Veteran boxing announcer Jimmy Lennon will introduce the tournament's king and  queen in his usual orotund voice if health permits. If Lennon, who had heart  surgery, cannot perform, Jimmy Lennon Jr. will pinch-hit for him -- in the same  pear-shaped tones.  </P> <P> Among players expected to take part are Denny and Tony Lennon, who won the  tournament in 1986; 1987 winners Mike Lennon and Mike Sanders and Shaun Davis  and Kevin Lennon, defending champions.  </P> <P> The tournament began with 12 teams in 1983 behind the home of Bob and Jeanette  Lennon, 932 Harding Ave., referred to as "The Backyard Volleyball Capital of  the World." Its principal organizers were Denny Lennon (one of Bob's sons), Ray  Castro and Mike Boehle, a Lennon cousin and a professional on the beach  volleyball tour.  </P> <P> The competition has expanded to four back yards and more than 40 two-player  teams. Top players such as Boehle are randomly matched with those of lesser  ability to keep the matches relatively even, and the result has been fierce  competition.  </P> <P> Boehle, for instance, and a teammate have finished second twice and third once,  but he managed to win only once, with partner Gary Conley in 1983.  </P> <P> Other champions were Brett Palmer-Ivan Smulovitz in 1984 and Mark  Carrillo-Linda Nelson in 1985.  </P> <P> The other back yards are at 944 Harding, home of Elizabeth (Sis) Lennon, whose  daughters used to sing on Laurence Welk's television show; 919 Harding, where  Mary Lennon Blaser and husband Bill live, and at 850 Coeur D'Alene Ave., home  of Pat and Darlene Bible.  </P> <P> Tournament organizers don't seem to be beating the bushes to round up players,  but they have provided a phone number so that prospective players can leave  their name and phone number: (213) 823-0941. Calling that number, organizers  warn, is no guarantee that anyone will play. The entry fee is $12.  </P> <P> If you can't play in the back-yard championships, you are still welcome as a  spectator. Admission is free.  </P></p>

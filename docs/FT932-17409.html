			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Job subsidy pioneer hits at schemes THE ECONOMICS professor who inspired the government experiment to pay subsidies to employers which take on the long-term unemployed has sharply criticised the way pilot subsidy schemes are being introduced. Professor Dennis Snower, of Birkbeck College, London University, is particularly angered by what he believes are inadequate measures to prevent employers sacking existing workers in order to hire those who carry the subsidy. Two of the four pilot schemes, in Tyneside and east Kent, will each cover 250 people unemployed for at least two years. The other two, in Devon and Cornwall and south London, will each involve 250 people unemployed for more than four years. The scheme will be voluntary and employers will receive Pounds 60 a week for each person hired for the first six months and Pounds 30 for the following six months. The Department of Employment said employers would have to give an undertaking that they would not displace existing employees and that no final decision had yet been made on how to ensure that displacement does not happen. Prof Snower said that if there is widespread displacement the scheme will not be cost-effective, as it is based on the idea that the government will save on benefits for the unemployed which are, in effect, transferred to employers in the shape of job subsidies. 'If the pilots turn out to be costly and ineffective in reducing unemployment they will probably be deemed a failure and plans for the national adoption of the policy may well be scrapped. Then, in my opinion, we will have missed a unique opportunity to revive the British labour market,' Prof Snower said.</p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> QUINCE STREET BRIDGE, 1905 LANDMARK, REOPENS  </P> <P> The historic Quince Street footbridge, ravaged by termites and time, reopened  Tuesday after a two-year closure and a $250,000 restoration.  </P> <P> About 2 dozen people attended a brief ribbon-cutting ceremony at the pedestrian  bridge across Maple Canyon between 3rd and 4th avenues in Hillcrest.  </P> <P> Built in 1905 for $805, the wooden trestle bridge was renovated in 1974 and  1981 and closed in 1987 after city engineers discovered that termites and dry  rot had weakened the 236-foot structure, rendering it unsafe.  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council hired a consultant who recommended tearing down the  bridge and either not replacing it or constructing a steel structure in its  place.  </P> <P> But area residents, headed by Elinor Meadows, had the bridge designated a city  landmark and persuaded councilmen to restore it to its original appearance.  </P> <P> Eighth District Councilman Bob Filner presented Meadows with a public service  award for her effort to save the bridge.  </P> <P> "This (award) should go to everyone," Meadows said. "A lot of people worked  very hard on this (project). I only triggered it."  </P> <P> The renovation, which took three months, was done by the local consulting  engineering firm of Atkinson, Johnson &amp; Spurrier. The handrails were  painted Friday, and workers finished cleaning up Monday.  </P> <P> About 70% of the bridge was replaced with pressure-treated Douglas fir,  including most of the support beams, decking and handrails, said R. Lee  Biggers, one of the company's structural engineers.  </P> <P> The bridge, which is 6 feet wide and 60 feet high, will need minimal  maintenance, primarily periodic repainting of the handrails, said Frank Belock,  deputy director of engineering design division of the city's Department of  Engineering and Development.  </P> <P> Belock said the bridge, whose steps are designed to support 100 pounds per  square foot and the span 85 pounds per square foot, will last several decades  before any more restoration will be needed.  </P> <P> The bridge, situated near Balboa Park, was heavily used by pedestrians for  several decades, but a 1987 survey showed that fewer than 60 people used it a  day.  </P> <P> Filner said the bridge has invaluable historic significance. There was little  opposition to the city spending $250,000 from its capital improvements budget  once the bridge was declared a historic landmark, and 1,000 people signed a  petition and urged the council to save the structure, Filner added.  </P> <P> "You can't measure its worth. It represents a different pace of life that used  to be," Filner said, adding that the bridge symbolizes the period before the  automobile, when walking was more common.  </P> <P> Filner said the figure of 60 users a day was an underestimate and that use  would increase when the public learns the structure has been reinforced.  </P> <P> After the ribbon-cutting, people walked to the bridge's center and admired the  view of the winding canyon, which is filled with cactus, palms, bamboo and  scrub brush and dotted with litter. A utility road cuts through the middle.  Homeless people camp in the canyon brush. A small part of the San Diego Bay is  visible to the west.  </P> <P> When the bridge closed in 1987, Meadows, 75, a retired teacher whose home is at  the canyon's edge, hung large cardboard tears from the trestle to symbolize  people's sentimental ties with the structure and their concern for its destiny.  For Tuesday's ceremony, she hung a giant cardboard smile on the bridge.  </P> <P> "I didn't think I would see this day," said the native San Diegan. "It is old,  but it is useful, and it would have been a shame to tear it down."  </P> <P> The Quince Street footbridge is one of the city's few remaining wooden  pedestrian bridges. The Vermont Street footbridge, which spanned Washington  Street in Hillcrest and led to the former site of Sears, was torn down in 1980.  </P> <P> Still standing is the Spruce Street Suspension Bridge, a steel cable and  support structure built in 1922 and renovated in 1986.  </P> <P> The Quince Street footbridge, designed by city engineer George A. d'Hemecourt  in 1905, was built at the request of residents who wanted better access to the  trolley line that ran on 4th Avenue.  </P></p>

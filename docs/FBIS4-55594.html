			<p>BFN     [Text] At the news conference of the Croatian National  Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina, officials announced the founding  of a commission for overseeing the implementation of the  Washington and Vienna agreements between the Croatian and  Bosniak peoples. This is currently the most important issue.  The task of the commission will be constantly to meet to  supervise the implementation of these Agreements' provisions.    Ivo Komsic, president of the council and member of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, spoke about other issues at the  conference. He stressed that among the Croatian people there is  a consensus on the implementation of the Constitution of the  Federation. However, the problem lies elsewhere, in the  interpretation of the essence of the Federation, Komsic said,  immediately answering the question on what the Croatian National  Council considers the essence of the Federation's organization  and establishment: The Federation is not some final state of  affairs set by the Croats and the Bosniaks in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, but is primarily a [word indistinct] or a  path toward the reintegration of all the occupied territories of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croatian National Council of  Bosnia-Herzegovina will continue to interprete the Federation in  this way, Komsic said.    On behalf of the council, Komsic invited the Serbian people  in Bosnia-Herzegovina to join in with the agreements on  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a common homeland, stressing that the  Serbian Civil Council is the true representative of these  people. He also repeated the view of the Croatian National  Council, namely that the council opposes the corridor through  Bosanska Posavina [in the Brcko region], because the corridor is  not in the interest of the Croatian people as a whole.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dragoljub Vukovic: "Montenegrinhood Virus </F> Activated"]    [Text] At the recent extraordinary session of the Peoples'  Party of Montenegro in Kotor, the amendment to the statute,  which was supposed to emphasize the Serbian dimension of the  party, was not passed. In connection with this precise  amendment, a senior party official, Vice President Dr. Bozidar  Bojovic, remarked that the excessive display of Serbian  sentiments has done more harm than good to the party. Not long  after this, a split within the Serbian Radical Party [SRS] of  Montenegro, the second strongest Serbian party in the republic,  unexpectedly took place when a group of three federal deputies  (Dusan Boskovic, Radovan Vukcevic, and Slavoljub Scekic)  renounced their loyalty to Dr. Vojislav Seselj [head of the SRS  in Serbia] and opposed the decision to make the SRS "unitarian,"  thus negating the autonomy of the Radicals in Montenegro. This  opposition has been portrayed as defense of "the honorable state  of Montenegro," to which the untouchable leader of the Serbian  Radicals responded with an accusation that those who were until  recently his assistants have verged toward "Montenegrin  separatists."    Under the leadership of Dr. Novak Kilibarda, who has proved  to be a much more skillful politician than many thought, the  Peoples' Party of Montenegro has been suspected of  insufficiently emphasizing its Serbian nature and not showing  enough concern for Serbian interests on several occasions. It  has transpired, however, that those who left the party because  of these suspicions and formed new ones, have done a service to  Dr. Kilibarda and his "populists [members of the Peoples'  party]" and condemned themselves to the political wilderness.  Without abandoning the realm of the national, Dr. Kilibarda,  with the support of younger and more emancipated people around  him, has tried (and to a great extent succeeded) to spare the  Peoples' Party of being the exporter of Serbianity to  Montenegro. Unlike some others, "the populists," have realized  that there is no great number of Serbs in Montenegro who would,  in place of their Montenegrin caps, stick a Serbian cap  [sajkaca] on their heads. Even though they do not accept the  Montenegrins as a separate nation, their support for the  preservation of the Montenegrin state's integrity within the  federal association with Serbia (and other Serbian lands) makes  them a potential partner of those political forces in Montenegro  that care about this statehood, too, but add national autonomy  of the Montenegrins to it. The very fact that the Peoples'  Party of Montenegro does not question Montenegro being a state  ("with Serbia always, under Serbia never") points to the  acknowledgement of a special Montenegrin political subjectivity,  independently of whether a clear idea about this exists with  "the populists" or not. For the Serbian nationalists, prone to  unitarist ideas and amalgamation, such a Peoples' Party is  potentially "separatist" and their side uses the slightest hint  of proximity between "the populists" and the Liberal Alliance to  produce direct or indirect accusations in this sense.    Speaking of the Peoples' Party of Montenegro attempts to  emancipate itself from romantic and rudimentary nationalism and  emphasize its democratic and civic traits, it is also worth  bearing in mind that its leaders wish to place the party within  the framework of Western political culture. "Gentlemen, there  is an association of the democratic parties of the world, or  rather of the Euro-American civilization, and many parties tried  to profile themselves so that they could enter this association  in as inconspicuous a manner as possible. Because when one  joins, you know, one wins many favors," Dr. Kilibarda emphasized  at the party convention in Kotor.    Unlike the Peoples' Party, which had the hallmark of an  authentic Montenegrin display of Serbian sentiments from the  outset, the SRS entered Montenegrin territory as an echo of  Seselj's nationalist and chauvinist uproar, and has more or less  remained at this political level.    Suddenly, the unexpected unity has given way to discord,  while the loyalty to Dr. Vojislav Seselj has transformed itself  into accusations about dictatorship and the like. When Milika  Dacevic, better known as Ceko, whom Seselj had made a war lord  and then stripped him of the function, introduced him to the  Federal Parliament and then chased him out, says: "We are not  peasant Serbs from Serbia, we are Serbs from Montenegro," then  it is not improper to conclude that the incubation period of the  Montenegrinhood virus is over even among some Radicals. It may  be true what Vojislav Seselj has been saying about Boskovic,  Vukcevic, and Scekic, namely, that they turned against him  because he dismissed them as not capable enough; however, the  seriousness of the warnings by Dusan Boskovic about the risks of  a policy that ignores Montenegro's specific status cannot be  overlooked.    Departing from the assumption that one can equally display  Montenegrin and Serbian sentiments in Montenegro, based on the  example of the Peoples' Party and the SRS, one can conclude that  it is more difficult for the Serbian political parties to  resolve this paradox than for the Montenegrin ones. The  political parties that do not question the ethnic specifics of  the Montenegrins naturally also appear as the firmest guarantors  of Montengrin statehood. Their dilemma can only be: Should the  state be independent or integrated in a sort of border  community. The Serbian political parties, however, are torn  between Serbian integrationist tendencies and a Montenegrin  specificity that they cannot circumvent. Their defense of  statehood can be sincere, but it lacks sufficient basis, while  their blatant negation of this statehood is plunging them from  the heights of Mt. Lovcen among "the common" Serbs, to which  most of them would agree only with difficulty. However, by  staying at these heights, regardless of the fact that they might  nationally feel Serbian, they are subconsciously becoming  Montenegrins in a political sense.</p>

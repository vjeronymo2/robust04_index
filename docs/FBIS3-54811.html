			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "To ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Readers"] </F>   [Text] The appearance of the first issue of the new year  is always an occasion for celebration for journalists. Today  for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, this celebration is threefold.    First, the number of subscribers to our newspaper has  increased by a factor of 12 and its print run has hit 600,000.  This makes ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI one of the country's most popular  publications, and puts it among the top five Russian newspapers.    Second, you see before you the first 16-page issue -- the  next stage in the development of our newspaper, which is  constantly expanding its topics and volume.    Third, this is one of the first issues of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  in its capacity as a publication independent of the organs of  power. We needed three years to acquire freedom. We  consistently upheld the idea that the press in a democratic  state cannot be a "tool" of government, but that it must be an  instrument of society's monitoring of all branches of power.  Our move is not a strategic maneuver, nor is it an attempt to  stand in opposition to the government, which has enough  opponents today without that. On the contrary, we will fairly  and thoroughly report the government's efforts to reform the  national economy, promptly inform readers of the essence of the  decisions being adopted by it, and publish the most important  decrees and commentaries on them. We want to help our readers  to evaluate government actions correctly.    Once again we stress: The topic of power, the topic of the  formation of the Russian state will remain paramount in our  newspaper. We deem our most important task to be to provide  information about the processes under way in society, and to  expose political "machinations," and the mechanism for adopting  decisions.    Other of our readers' diverse interests will be satisfied by  the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI sections which are offered in this issue.    DELO and DENGI are addressed to entrepreneurs.    PROMYSHLENNAYA GAZETA is aimed at producers.    VEKHI is a newspaper for the independent intelligentsia.    RETSEPT is a supplement for those interested in health.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI is an important source of information for  workers in the system of executive power, jurists, and  economists. Our KURYER and DOKUMENTY sections are aimed at this  group of readers, promptly publishing edicts and directives from  the president, government decrees, and normative acts by  ministries and departments, which come into force only after  publication in our newspaper.    The new year poses a difficult task for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI --  to live up to its name, to become a newspaper reporting  extensively on the life of the regions, the Russian heartland.  To this end, our correspondent network in the localities is  constantly growing.    As of now ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI already has 18 own  correspondents  within the country, and one abroad. The number of correspondent  offices is set to increase further.    We will strive to ensure that ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reaches  readers in good time, and without delays. To this end, we are  printing it not only in Moscow, but also in 16 other cities  around the country.    We will try to maintain a reasonable price for our  newspaper.  To this end, the editorial office is expanding its commercial  activity, increasing the volume of advertisements published.    The reader's opinion is pivotal in the newspaper. We are  therefore publishing a page of readers' leaders in this issue:  lively, "undiluted" letters. Permanent dialogue with readers is  one of our immutable creative principles.    Analytical centers, in which the country's leading  scientists  are working, are being set up under the editorial office and a  powerful information service is being formed. We have already  concluded a contract with REUTER, the world's leading news  agency, from which we will obtain news and photographs. It is  planned to set up a fitness center under the editorial office,  where leading Russian doctors, the authors of our RETSEPT  section, will be able to give you a consultation.    We will only be able to implement all these plans with your  support, dear readers. It is with a hope for this support and  mutual understanding that we are beginning our dialogue in the  new year.</p>

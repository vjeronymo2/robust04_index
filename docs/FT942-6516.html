			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Advanced banking Sir, While it is encouraging to read of the progress in electronic banking in Moscow ('Russian banking jumps the queue', May 24), I don't think it is accurate to suggest that its system is ahead of the west. We have had real-time banking in Ireland for about 10 years, allowing counter (card + PIN) and automated teller machine (ATM) transactions to be updated instantly. Irish ATMs are fluent in five languages (though not Russian, yet) and many have colour displays. The banking systems in several other EU member states are similarly advanced.

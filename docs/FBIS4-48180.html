			<p>BFN     [Text] President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire has been meeting  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] officials to discuss the  unilateral cease-fire document that has been signed by the  illegitimate government in Rwanda. The RPF officials, Titus  Rutaremara and Dr. Butera Jean Bosco, refused to countersign the  document because, though the document had been signed by army  officers, they have signed it on behalf of the Government of  Rwanda, which the RPF does not recognize.    The unilateral cease-fire document by the Rwandese  Government  was signed by Army officers on behalf of the government, because  President Mobutu had refused the government officials themselves  to sign the agreement, knowing that the RPF would not accept it.    After the RPF officials refused to countersign the  cease-fire  document, President Mobutu suggested that a new document be  prepared in which the part to be signed by the Rwandese  Government was to be replaced by a part that will be signed by  the Army officers of the Rwandese Government forces.    The RPF officials accepted these proposals of a cease-fire  arrangement between the RPF and the Rwandese Government forces.  The RPF has always rejected any talks with the illegitimate  government in Rwanda, but the front has always invited the  Rwandese Government forces for talks aimed at stopping the  military hostilities between the two sides.</p>

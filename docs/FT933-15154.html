			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Talks over Cyprus thrown into doubt: The surprise departure of the Turkish Cypriot leader TALKS to settle the Cyprus problem have been thrown into doubt after Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said he would no longer negotiate on behalf of his community. Mr Denktash's surprise announcement this week follows a formal rebuke from the United Nations secretary general's office about the breakdown of the latest round of UN-sponsored talks at the end of May. Mr Denktash, who for 30 years has headed the Turkish Cypriot community, says his position has become untenable following repeated challenges at home from his prime minister Mr Dervis Eroglu. Mr Denktash says Mr Eroglu has blocked territorial concessions and opposes UN plans for a federal solution to end the island's 19-year-old division. But western diplomats in Ankara suspect Mr Denktash has deeper misgivings about the progress of the New York negotiations and is using his dispute with Mr Eroglu to stonewall the talks. The man who once campaigned under the slogan 'partition or death' remains, in the eyes of the UK and other permanent members of the UN Security Council, the main obstacle to a settlement. Since Turkey's occupation of the northern third of the island in 1974, the UN and the international community have continued to see the Greek south as the legitimate government of the island - the Turkish Cypriot republic is recognised only by Turkey. In Ankara, the Turkish generals continue to support Mr Denktash's cause. For two decades now, the Turkish Cypriot leader has favoured serving and retired officers with some of the island's best villas, many of them originally Greek properties. Turkish Cypriot businessmen have also exploited the island's anomalous legal status of favourable local tax and auditing conditions, and are equally unenthusiastic about a solution which would withdraw these privileges. At the latest round of New York talks, the UN suggested the handover of the Greek resort of Varosha, now deserted and under Turkish control, in exchange for re-opening Nicosia's international airport. Both steps would be taken under UN administration. Abandoned in 1974 when Greeks fled the Turkish advance, Varosha, with its hotel blocks and deserted beaches, remains a poignant symbol of the current stalemate and division. Re-opening the international airport would be a further confidence-building measure, and give a considerable boost to tourist arrivals in the north, all of whom currently have to arrive via the Turkish mainland. Leaving the talks in New York, Mr Denktash appeared to back the plan, so much so that Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel, never one to force the hand of the Turkish Cypriots, publicly endorsed the idea. However, the maverick Mr Denktash - accompanied by Mr Eroglu - hen travelled to Ankara, where he received a standing ovation from parliament, in rejecting the UN plan. Cyprus is still a national cause in Turkey but in Ankara impatience is growing with the lack of progress. Even Turkey's instinctively nationalist press is starting to question the open-ended commitment to Mr Denktash. Cyprus has long been a big obstacle in Turkey's negotiations with the European Community and Ankara expects increased US pressure for a settlement. Moreover, Turkey is overstretched in a range of foreign policy areas from the Balkans, through the Caucasus to the unresolved situation in North Iraq. For their part, the Greek Cypriots' fear is that the longer the issue remains unresolved, the more likely one of the European countries will step out of line and recognise the Turkish state. If that happens, the Greeks fear this would encourage further intransigence on the Turkish side. In retrospect, the Turks may have missed a chance to push their case for recognition in the wake of Turkey's robust support of the coalition against Baghdad. Much will depend on Mrs Tansu Ciller, the new Turkish prime minister. She has still to indicate her choice as minister in charge of Cyprus, a key job with a budget of Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) to disburse, a considerable lever of patronage. Under the previous cabinet, the job was given to a former soldier more familiar to the Greeks as one of the Turkish commanders of the 1974 invasion force.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Lion Nathan expands in Australia LION NATHAN, New Zealand's biggest brewer, is to buy the 50 per cent it does not own in National Brewing Holdings, Australia's second biggest brewer and formerly Bond Brewing, from Australian Consolidated Investments (ACIL) for ADollars 425m.( USDollars 319.5m) The purchase was announced jointly in Sydney yesterday by Lion and ACIL, formerly Bell Resources. They said the deal was part of a 'fall-back' arrangement following the scrapping of an earlier deal to merge Lion and ACIL. This planned merger, announced in October last year, was a complex arrangement conditional on agreement from Swiss bondholders in ACIL to swap their scrip for new bonds issued by Lion. But ACIL said yesterday it had been informed by Swiss Bank Corporation - as paying agent for the Swiss franc bonds - that the proposed bond exchange was against Swiss law. 'In addition, Schroders Australia Ltd was retained by ACIL to provide an independent assessment of the terms and conditions of the bond exchange,' ACIL said. 'Notwithstanding that Lion Nathan was willing to increase the face value of the capital notes from ADollars 356m to Dollars 424m, Schroders has advised that on the basis of existing conditions it would be unable to give an opinion that the bond exchange would be fair and reasonable to ACIL bondholders.' ACIL reiterated that its shareholders had agreed to a put and call arrangement which approved the sale of the remaining half of the company's brewery business to Lion Nathan, should the larger merger proposal not proceed. 'Lion Nathan has advised ACIL that it will exercise the call option,' ACIL said. 'Lion Nathan will acquire the interest from ACIL for ADollars 425m plus 50 per cent of National Brewing Holdings' 12-month earnings to June 30 1992. The consideration will consist of ADollars 300m of Lion Nathan junior capital stock with the balance consisting of cash and Lion Nathan ordinary shares.' The deal means that Lion, which bought half of National Brewing Holdings from ACIL for ADollars 350m last year, will emerge with control of about 40 per cent of the Australian beer market. National controls brands including XXXX, Tooheys and Swan.</p>

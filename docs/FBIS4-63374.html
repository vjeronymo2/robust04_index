			<p>BFN     [Text] In the meantime, Vladimir Shumeyko, the head of the  Upper Chamber of the Federal Assembly, has left for a tour of  five South American countries. Though the chairman of the  Federation Council has enough invitations to keep him travelling  for a whole year, he has decided to rediscover for Russia the  far-away Latin American continent. Speaking to our  correspondent Vyacheslav Osipov before the tour, the speaker of  the Upper Chamber said that Russia has stopped dividing  countries into Third World states and developing states, and  added in the way of explanation:    [Begin Shumeyko recording] Russia's international policy has  this underlying principle: We are not looking for  ideologically- close friends any more. Today we are choosing  partners on the basis of mutual advantage, so that our relations  could contribute to our mutual development, primarily in  economic terms. One thing that should be very closely  monitored, first of all, is Russia's interests, which should  take precedence. As for partners, we will be able to find them  anywhere. [end recording]    Continuing the conversation, our correspondent said that  Georgadze, Podgornyy, and Vorotnikov [leaders of the Brezhnev  period] had made lengthy tours of Latin America -- but it would  be an overstatement to say that this had contributed to  expanding mutual contacts. So, what is the objective of the  visit to Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, and Ecuador? Is  Shumeyko hoping to use the experience of those countries in  reforming the Russian social and economic life?    [Begin Shumeyko recording] Yes, no Soviet and, later,  Russian  leader has visited those states since 1982, which was a long  time ago. Take Argentina, for example, which has gone through a  stage very similar to the one we are going though now. That  country managed to reach a political consensus at a certain  stage, there are two parties now and the country is developing.  They adopted a normal civic code -- a very good one, in fact,  which allows Argentina to develop a market economy and  democracy. We keep looking for some outstanding examples --  like the United States, or Japan, or some place else. My  preliminary acquaintance with the South American continent has  shown that today the Russian state has no right to ignore it.  We can learn a lot from them in terms of our economic  development. If we want to integrate our relationships, our  legislative systems should be brought closer to each other. We  should start by studying, to a degree, their existing laws and  experience. We are expecting good results from this trip. I do  not want to be compared to Georgadze, Vorotnikov, and the like  -- but you will see for yourselves. [end recording]</p>

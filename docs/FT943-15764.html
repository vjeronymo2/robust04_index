			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Voluntary code on derivatives sought by SEC The US Securities and Exchange Commission is hoping that a voluntary agreement among the big Wall Street firms to accept closer regulation of their derivatives activities will head off Congress' attempts to seek tougher regulation of the Dollars 1,000bn derivatives market. The SEC, the US financial markets watchdog, said yesterday that it had been in talks with the six biggest derivatives dealers on Wall Street - CS First Boston, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley - about voluntary standards for several areas of the business. The SEC hopes the firms will reveal more about the extent and nature of their derivatives business, and the amount of capital they have to support their derivatives trades. The agency wants to know more about the dealers' derivatives clients. It has become increasingly concerned about Wall Street selling derivatives products to companies or financial institutions which do not inform investors or shareholders of their activities. The SEC has told the country's money-market funds - which are sold as highly conservative, secure forms of investment - to stop using complex, risky derivative products. The SEC believes if the dealers accept voluntary oversight, legislators in Washington will be dissuaded from passing new laws requiring the agency to regulate the derivatives activities of securities firms, and insurance companies. The derivatives activities of banks are subject to formal regulation, but Wall Street firms operate through separately capitalised subsidiaries out of reach from regulation. Congress is sufficiently concerned about this to propose legislative reform. This week, congressman Edward Markey, chairman of the House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, said legislation was needed to 'close the regulatory black hole which allows derivatives dealers affiliated with securities or insurance firms to largely escape any federal regulation'.</p>

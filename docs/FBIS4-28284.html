			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Separatist's Boloney Against Reunification" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam  of South Korea in an interview with the U.S. NEWSWEEK on May 31  took exception to the DPRK's proposal for founding the  Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo [DCRK]. He told the  NEWSWEEK that the "Yemen-style reunification based on  confederacy" would "only result in a tragedy as illustrated by  the situation in Yemen" and that "we should achieve durable  reunification".    The traitor Kim Yong-sam's comment on the "Yemen-style  reunification based on confederation" without any knowledge of  the domestic situation of Yemen is meant to connect the DPRK's  DCRK founding proposal with the Yemen situation in a far-fetched  manner in a bid to sling mud at the proposal, a NODONG SINMUN  analyst today says, and goes on:    His opposition to the North's DCRK founding proposal means,  in the final analysis, denying a peaceful reunification of the  country.    The DPRK's confederacy formula based on one nation, one  state, two systems and two governments has enjoyed widespread  support and sympathy of not only the entire Korean people in the  North and the South and abroad but of the world's progressive  people for its validity, reasonableness and feasibility.    Much upset by the enormous vitality of the DPRK's  confederacy  formula, the Kim Yong-sam group has resorted to all the  demagogy, calling it a "strategy of reunification through  communization" and saying it would result in a "tragedy", in an  effort to keep its influence from spreading far and wide in  South Korea rapidly and dampen the ever mounting peaceful  reunification sentiments of the people.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam is a heinous separatist who has  opposed national reunification, the supreme task of the nation,  saying "the concept of hasty reunification is a daydream" and  "reunification without liberal democracy and market economy is  no better than division".    The "three-stage reunification formula" brought forward by  him by reenacting his preceding dictators' permanent national  division proposal with only slight paint on it is a replica of  the "institutional reunification" doctrine that presupposes  confrontation and war between the fellow countrymen. It will  only heighten distrust and confrontation and, furthermore,  result in a conflict and irretrievable national disasters.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam's talk about "durable  reunification"  is, in the final analysis, meant to realize the ambition of  northward invasion and reunification by "strength", maintaining  the reactionary colonial system of South Korea and extending it  even to the North.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Argentina opens oil group sale ARGENTINA this week launched the campaign to sell 35 per cent of YPF, the state-owned oil group, with forecasts of robust growth for the company. The government hopes to raise up to Dollars 2.5bn. Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF president, said the company, which had undergone a radical restructuring since his appointment in 1990, expected to earn net income of more than Dollars 600m in 1993, against Dollars 259m in 1992 and Dollars 255m in 1991. He forecast sales growth of more than 6 per cent, from Dollars 3.9bn in 1992. YPF's sales should continue growing at more than 6 per cent a year in the medium term, he added. Mr Daniel Marx, the government's chief financial negotiator, said the profits jump was due to depressed earnings in previous years. These were blamed on heavy restructuring charges. Last week Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said YPF would be floated on the Buenos Aires, New York and possibly London markets on July 8, with a maximum of 35 per cent of the shares marked for the investment community. Up to 24 per cent will be set aside for holders of government debt consolidation bonds, held by pensioners and government suppliers. Reaction in Buenos Aires to the first presentation was generally positive. On banker said: 'My gut feeling is that this is going to sell, although we are still at the slightly messy stage where there is not much information.' The US Securities and Exchange Commission is processing YPF's application for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, and until that is complete full information on YPF is being withheld. Most analysts agree a final decision on YPF can only be made once the price has been established. The government's advisers - Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston - have completed the book building and pricing exercise at the end of June. Bankers say political factors were forcing Mr Cavallo to accept a relatively low price for YPF. With congressional elections due in October, the government cannot afford the embarrassment of the share flotation failing due to excessive pricing. Mr Cavallo said YPF's price would be set at between Dollars 17 and Dollars 20 per share, valuing the company at Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7.06bn. He said the government was aiming at a price/earnings multiple of about 10, roughly the same level as oil stocks quoted on the Buenos Aires exchange. The government has promised that YPF's statutes will ensure it would be managed as a private company, even though the unions and government shareholders would retain at least 41 per cent.</p>

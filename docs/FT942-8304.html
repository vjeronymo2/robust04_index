			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (14): Cash flow is the problem - Prospects for the construction industry have rarely looked brighter Drive south from Athens on a road that switches without warning from six-lane motorway to dusty construction site and you have a picture of the problems faced by Greek contractors. Prospects for the construction industry have rarely looked brighter, with the government due to start drawing down funds later this year from the European Union's new structural package for poorer member-states. EU co-financing for infrastructure projects in Greece should amount to Ecu7bn over the next five years, in some cases covering as much as 80 per cent of project cost. However, companies bidding for EU-backed projects need to raise substantial amounts of working capital, as well as funds to buy new equipment. 'These are very big projects by Greek standards and companies need to adapt quickly,' says Mr Andrew Rizopoulos of Mechaniki, a large contractor. Maintaining cash flow has been a serious problem even for big companies. With interest rates on working capital averaging more than 25 per cent for the past three years, contractors often preferred to finance projects out of their own funds. The market is highly fragmented, adding to constraints on financing. Contracts for road projects, for example, may be awarded in segments of as little as 10 kilometres each, rather than to a single bidder, because of regulations that set ceilings on participation in tenders. Even the largest construction companies cannot submit bids valued at more than Dr4.5bn (Dollars 18.25m). This makes joint ventures essential for carrying out sizeable projects, and prevents the emergence of contractors that can compete with construction companies from elsewhere in the EU to build complex projects. Fierce competition for public sector contracts, which account for at least 50 per cent of overall investment in construction, means that companies offer deep discounts to win bids, paring profit margins to a minimum. The solution for contractors has been to raise funds through the Athens stock exchange. Since November, the number of construction listings has risen from four to 11, while 12 more applications are under way. The total amount raised so far through public offerings and rights issues exceeds Dr40bn. Demand for shares in construction companies is strong: so far, every issue has been oversubscribed and some recently listed companies are already planning rights issues. The government is allocating a sizeable amount of EU funding to road improvements. Completion of the Egnatia highway, linking Igoumenitsa in north-western Greece with the Turkish border in Thrace at a cost of almost Dr400bn, is considered a priority. The port at Igoumenitsa is being expanded to handle increased traffic. More Greek exporters now ship goods through Italy as the main overland route to western Europe was closed by the conflict in former Yugoslavia. For the same reason, tourists travelling by car from northern Europe now use the Adriatic ferry crossing. The road from Patras in western Greece to Athens and Thessaloniki, a distance of 800km, is being upgraded to motorway standard at a cost of Dr350bn. However, several projects are being undertaken on a BOT - build-operate-transfer - basis. These include the new Dollars 1.5bn Athens airport to be built at Spata, the Dr90bn Thessaloniki city metro, and a Dr150bn suspension bridge across the eastern end of the Corinth Gulf. While these projects will include some grant aid from the EU package, most financing will be raised privately. Though Greek companies hold small stakes in the international consortia bidding for these projects, their participation involves a financial commitment. Mr Loukas Kyriacopoulos of Helleniki Technodomiki, which raised Dr3.2bn through a listing last month, says: 'We'll use 60 per cent of funds raised for working capital and the rest for equipment purchases and reorganising. For the self-financed projects, we need much more capital behind us.' Earlier this year, Mechaniki, listed on the Athens exchange several years ago, raised Dr9.2bn in a rights issue intended to cover project financing needs. In addition to participating in consortia bidding for the Athens airport and Thessaloniki metro projects, the company has undertaken the first BOT project in Greece, a Dr2bn underground car park and shopping mall in central Athens on a site owned by the Athens municipality. The company is a member of international consortia tendering for road projects in Albania and Hungary. It has also acquired a metal construction company and a pipe manufacturer. Mr Rizopoulos says: 'There are too many companies chasing contracts, so we decided to start diversifying and go abroad - where the next stage of growth will be.'</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSOLIDATE CALIFORNIA SPRAWL BY REGIONAL, RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: 72 AGENCIES ISSUE ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS AND REGULATIONS.  TOO MANY COMPETING JURISDICTIONS DO TOO LITTLE GOOD.  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown has upped the ante. By introducing a bill that  would reorganize local government to create a means for regional action on  regional problems, Brown adds Sacramento prestige and clout to an issue of  critical importance to all Californians.  </P> <P> The 2000 Partnership and its predecessor, the Los Angeles 2000 Committee, have  long believed that an improved system of regional governance, with increased  public and private investment, is essential to the creation of livable  communities throughout the state.  </P> <P> That problems have outpaced our political and financial will to solve them is  evident, leading to a widespread perception that our quality of life is  declining.  </P> <P> This perception has some basis in fact. Transportation planners document  increased congestion on our freeways and report that this trend will continue.  </P> <P> Housing experts lament the current shortfall in affordable housing and project  a regionwide demand of 1 million new low- and moderate-cost units between now  and 2010.  </P> <P> We are running out of places to put our waste. Our public school system does  not have enough money to construct new schools or expand existing ones.  </P> <P> And, despite adopting the most stringent air-quality plan in the country, we  are still unlikely to meet federal standards.  </P> <P> These problems are solvable if, first, we understand their causes, and second,  we are willing to make some fundamental changes in the way we plan for, shape  and finance our man-made and natural environment.  </P> <P> Three factors contribute to current and projected problems:  </P> <P> First, the number of people and jobs will continue to increase. This growth is  caused by powerful economic and social forces; it will not be stopped. For  example, two-thirds of the projected population increase in Southern California  will be home-grown -- births among people already living here. Even the most  Draconian restrictions on foreign and domestic immigration would not prevent a  population growth of more than 3 million during the next 20 years. Economists  project close to 3 million new jobs, fueled by international trade and growth  in business services. Other new jobs will grow out of the need to provide goods  and services for an expanding population.  </P> <P> Second, our problems are the result of declining federal, state and local  investment. Federal support for affordable housing, nationwide, shrank from $26  billion in 1981 to $7.5 billion in 1987, while federal tax policy sharply  curtailed incentives to build apartments. Because of decreasing state  investment in transportation, California now ranks 50th among 50 states in  per-capita spending on highways. The Bush Administration's new transportation  policy reduces federal participation in most transit and highway funds. This  means state and local government will be expected to raise billions more for  transportation.  </P> <P> Third, Californians have an anachronistic collective image of the ideal  metropolitan area. Anthony Downs of the Brookings Institution articulates this  ideal vision: ownership of a detached, single-family home on a spacious lot;  unlimited personal use of a private automobile; suburban workplaces with ample  free parking, and strong local governments to control police power, land use,  public schools and other amenities. We have clung to this image despite the  obvious fact that Los Angeles has become one of the world's major metropolitan  centers.  </P> <P> Understanding a problem is key to its solution. In the study of these issues,  we have come to several important conclusions:  </P> <P> Growth is both inevitable and from most perspectives, desirable. That growth,  however, must be planned and managed.  </P> <P> Current investment is critical to future improvements.  </P> <P> The ideal of a low-density, sprawling, semiurban landscape -- and the lifestyle  it implies -- is already inappropriate.  </P> <P> If growth must be planned and managed, then who will do it? Transportation and  environmental-quality issues transcend city-county boundaries; critically  needed regional facilities are often rejected at the local level -- "not in my  back yard." Because their authority and responsibility is limited by geographic  boundaries, cities and counties cannot always be expected to act responsibly on  broader regional needs. (There are 86 municipalities in Los Angeles County  alone.)  </P> <P> Nor can special-purpose agencies plan for and manage these issues. There are  now 72 federal, state and local agencies issuing environmental decisions and  regulations in Southern California; 69 of them are either single-purpose bodies  or fragmented functions of general-purpose governments. These agencies are  limited in scope and not generally accountable to -- or representative of --  the electorate. Single-purpose agencies, like the South Coast Air Quality  Management District, do not have the capacity or representation to balance  properly all the region's legitimate but competing interests.  </P> <P> It is time to restructure the decision- making process so that decision-makers  can understand how one proposed solution to one problem impacts other issues.  What are the socioeconomic consequences of implementing environmental  regulations? What are the consequences of waste-disposal decisions on air and  water quality?  </P> <P> The 2000 Partnership advocates consolidating current fragmented and ineffective  regional planning so that citizens can understand the process and hold elected  officials accountable. We believe comprehensive planning is necessary.  </P> <P> We recommend consideration of a regional agency that would determine goals and  incentives but minimize regulations imposed regionwide; site critically needed  regional infrastructure in cases of impasse or inaction at the local or  subregional level, and act as trustee for making and implementing policies when  a city, county or special district fails to meet regional objectives over a  period of years. This agency would also play a role in ensuring that the region  has sufficient revenues from Sacramento to implement its decisions.  </P> <P> In our view, existing single-purpose regional agencies should operate  consistent with policies adopted by the regional planning body. Conflict  resolution would occur through subregional mechanisms and, ultimately, at the  regional level. The regional agency would be governed by a mixed board -- some  directly elected representatives and some selected from among elected local  government officials.  </P> <P> Any regional entity must properly reflect the region's diverse population; its  board must comply with constitutional standards for proportional  representation. Both principles are largely ignored by existing regional  entities.  </P> <P> An essential ingredient in this prescription for the future is creation of a  reliable funding base for infrastructure improvement and enhancement. Without  more public investment our region will deteriorate.  </P> <P> By themselves, governance changes and policy changes will not be enough. For a  decade and a half, politicians have assumed that California voters are  unwilling to invest in their own future.  </P> <P> There are recent indications of a shift in public mood. Gov. George Deukmejian,  along with a coalition of legislative leaders and diverse interest groups,  placed Propositions 108 and 111 on the June ballot to raise money for  transportation. We need it -- a step in the right direction.  </P> <P> Speaker Brown is also moving in the right direction. His bill, AB 4242,  provides the framework for the necessary debate on these issues -- the first  step in a process that could give us 21st-Century governance to manage present  and future problems.  </P> <P> Consolidating existing agencies will make the political process more  intelligible and elected officials more accountable. With better governance and  greater investment, California can hold promise and hope for all citizens.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F> Sa'id Sunbul in New York on 20 April]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Sunbul] To be honest with  you, the public in the Arab and Islamic worlds in particular was  under the impression that the UN secretary general would play a  more effective role in ending the war in Bosnia. However, the  war there rages on. It has not ended despite the passage of two  years. What are the reasons?    [Butrus-Ghali] I would like to clarify one important fact  which many might have missed. This fact is that I, in my  capacity as UN secretary general, do not command a combat army  that I can use to intervene and end all wars raging around the  world. I also do not have the power to impose peace on a  conflict between two countries. What I can do is intervene to  end wars and conflicts and convince the warring parties to stop  their wars and accept peace.    I am sad and sorry about what is happening in Bosnia. I have  done all I can in the past two years to defend the Bosnian  people and protect them from Serbian aggression. However, the  issue is not in my hands as much as it is in the hands of the  member countries, in particular the big powers.    Over the past two years, I have not stopped my contacts with  the various countries to recruit more forces to send to Bosnia  to protect the people there. I have also visited many donor  countries in an attempt to convince them to provide more aid to  the international forces in Bosnia. The mission of these forces  is to protect the Bosnian people.    In June last year, I asked the countries to increase the  number of international forces in Bosnia. However, they did not  respond to my request. I am still making this demand.    The United Nations might realize some successes in some  areas  and failures in others. This success or failure does not depend  on the United Nations itself as an organ, but on the member  countries, and in particular the countries influential in  decisionmaking. The United Nations is merely a mirror  reflecting the stand of its member countries.    To this fact, we must add another fact, which is that the  United Nations is made up of 184 members representing various  economic, political, and geographic groupings. Despite this  fact, decisionmaking within this international organization  continues to be restricted to a very limited sphere. The  remaining member countries, with all their potentials and  resources put together, were not able to influence this sphere  or infiltrate it. This, certainly, weakens the United Nations  and the secretary general. If some countries had wanted to,  they would have been able to change the course of events during  the past two years. Unfortunately, they did not want to.    I am not saying this in order to remove the blame from the  United Nations or its secretary general. My objective is to  make some countries take action, in particular those countries  that have potential, resources, and political and diplomatic  expertise in order to enlarge the decisionmaking base. Thus,  international justice can be achieved and decisions will become  democratic. [passage omitted]    [Sunbul] It has been noticed that the current UN secretary  general is being subjected to a strong campaign of criticism,  unlike any previous UN secretary general. How do you explain  this phenomenon?    [Butrus-Ghali] (laughing) This is true, and the reason, in  my  opinion, is that conditions around the world currently are very  different from what they were before, during the Cold War years.    During the Cold War, there were two superpowers, the United  States and the Soviet Union. They controlled all the strings.  They used to make the final decisions on all stands and crises.  Given this, the role of the United Nations was a secondary one.    After the Cold War, the whole picture and the situation  changed. The world entered a new age, the post-Cold War age. In  view of these new conditions, the United Nations acquired a more  effective role. In these post-Cold War times, numerous racial  and regional conflicts erupted. All eyes focused on the United  Nations asking for its help. In the past, the UN peacekeeping  forces were concentrated in two countries. Now, they are spread  out in 17 countries. The United Nations has become a party in  many conflicts. Thus, some parties are happy and others are  angry. This is why the secretary general is being criticized  more fiercely. In actual fact, it is criticism directed at the  United Nations as an international organ more than at the  secretary general as a person.    [Sunbul] I have one last question to ask you. I would like  to go back to the subject of Bosnia and ask you what the  solution is.    [Butrus-Ghali] There is no way out unless the big powers,  headed by the United States, want to intervene and use their  power and potential as they did during the crisis between Iraq  and Kuwait.    So long as the big powers are not ready to enter the battle,  and so long as the countries that have the potential do not want  to intervene and are satisfied with mere expressions of anger,  the difficult situation in Bosnia will, unfortunately, continue  and increase.</p>

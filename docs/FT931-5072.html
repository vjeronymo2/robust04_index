			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / BT plans for US services face tough market access talks BRITISH TELECOM is planning this week to apply to the US regulatory authorities for permission to operate domestic and international telephone services in the US. If approval is given, it will clear the way for BT to become the first international telecommunications 'one-stop shop', offering multinational customers a broad range of voice, data and video services between the US and the UK. The application is expected to face stiff opposition from BT's US competitors, AT&amp;T, Sprint and MCI, who are likely to argue that US carriers do not enjoy a similar freedom to operate in the UK, according to the journal Communications Week International in an analysis published today. The outcome of BT's application will therefore depend on discussions over reciprocal market access between the US Federal Communications Commission and Britain's Department of Trade and Industry. Talks between the two agencies have been going on for some time but the outcome remains unclear. Mr Gary Bond, BT's director of services development, said yesterday that he expected the UK would have to make concessions to the US carriers before BT's application could be granted. The advantage to customers of one-stop shopping for inter-national telecommunications lies in dealing with a single organisation for network management and billing, in contrast to the multiple regulatory and billing organisations a company has to deal with currently. BT's large customers could expect substantial discounts on their telecommunications bills as a result, Mr Bond said. BT's request for a common carrier licence in the US is an important part of its plans to be one of a handful of global 'supercarriers' by 2000. Access to the US market is essential to the success of its billion dollar-plus plan to build a global network offering multinational customers a wide range of services, including the transmission of data and image made possible by new technology. Codenamed 'Cyclone' within the organisation, the BT plan involves the establishment of new switching centres in some 20 international cities to handle the volume of traffic. For this it will need the agreement of national authorities in each country. The FCC is actively considering changes in its rules which would allow foreign telecoms companies to operate in the US. French and German telecommunications agencies, however, are liberalising their regimes at a slower pace in spite of encouragement from the European Commission.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Japanese puts EC steel plan to the sword: Mr Hayao Nakamura, the chief of Ilva, talks to Haig Simonian MR Hayao Nakamura, the former Nippon Steel executive now managing Italy's loss-making Ilva state steel group, yesterday questioned the authority of the European Commission to dictate future capacity cuts. 'If competition policy means fair trade, that's fine. But if by competition they mean acting as judges, then that's not acceptable,' he said. 'We have to establish what are the rules of the game.' Mr Nakamura called for a 'gentleman's agreement' between European steel producers to combat the industry's crisis by raising prices and agreeing production cuts, in line with Japanese practice, rather than have the Commission impose plant closures. 'Everyone knows there's overcapacity of airline seats across the Atlantic and Lufthansa is losing more money than any other airline. But no one has called on the Germans to scrap half their jumbo jets. It's the same thing with steel,' he argued. Mr Nakamura, in his first newspaper interview since taking over at Ilva, was reacting to a letter earlier this week from Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, to Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, outlining problems with Ilva's latest restructuring plan. The plan, presented to the Commission last month, involves the creation of a new Italian state steel producer, based on Ilva's big Taranto integrated steelworks, and the transfer of other plant and about L2,500bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in debt to Iri, the state holding company which controls Ilva. In his letter to Mr Savona, Mr Van Miert argued that the Ilva plan involves substantial state aid and might have to be accompanied by up to 3m tonnes of capacity cuts if it were to go along with the EC steel plan. Mr Nakamura questions both the Commission's interpretation of state aid and its right to intervene. 'Iri is no longer a state entity but a joint stock company. If Van Miert says it's aid, we're starting off at odds and there is no point in carrying on,' said Mr Nakamura. The comments illustrate the Italians' belief that the Commission's attitude towards Ilva is one-sided and based on pressure from leading north European steel producers, principally the Germans. 'I want to be a good partner to other European steelmakers. But they are our colleagues, not our controllers,' he said. Mr Nakamura, who took over the top job at Ilva in January, claimed it could not be accused of overcapacity or of dumping. Ilva exported only 16 per cent of its output and exports were widely diffused rather than concentrated in just a handful of markets, he argued. He implied that the Commission's approach reflected the desire of some big north European steelmakers to eliminate capacity from southern competitors to gain market share. 'They want to send advisers into our plant to supervise capacity but I won't let them in,' he said. Ilva, which made a net loss of more than L2,300bn last year, has only 43 per cent of the Italian steel market, which is Europe's second biggest. 'We could sell 100 per cent of our production in Italy, so why should we cut output? For the sake of the Italian public, or for the sake of the German public? What harm do we do to other producers?' Mr Nakamura said that Ilva would be prepared to make production cuts to its current output of about 8m tonnes, but only in return for aid from the government. As the Italian government has refused to provide funds, large cuts were out of the question, he implied. He said that the company, which he forecast would make a net loss of about L1,700bn this year, would close the remaining steel facilities at its Bagnoli plant in Naples independently of any Community agreement.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sonia Carneiro] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- Pressured by the threat of a rift, PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] President Tasso Jereissati  ordered a nationwide survey -- which should be ready in one week  -- on the feasibility of the alliance with the PFL [Liberal  Front Party] from an electoral viewpoint. Under his  coordination, and with the help of Ceara Deputy Sergio Machado,  the PSDB national board will make a chart showing the prospects  for regional alliances, which are essential for the success of  the presidential candidacy of former Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso. Based on the result, the alliance will be  either strengthened or discarded.    "If the incompatibility index is very high, the alliance  with  the PFL will not be worthwhile," Jereissati said. He added that,  based on the survey results, a decision will be made as to  whether PFL Bahia Deputy Luis Eduardo Magalhaes has the most  appropriate profile for running as vice president on Fernando  Henrique Cardoso's ticket. "There is still a long way to go," he  added.    The survey will not break the negotiations over a common  government program, which the two parties will begin studying on  11 April. Jereissati added that the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party]  and the PP [Popular Party] -- which also might join the alliance  -- will be called to debate the common program. He ruled out the  possibility of creating another Democratic Alliance -- an  agreement between the PFL and the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party] that sponsored the candidacy of Tancredo Neves  in 1984 and the government of Jose Sarney.    For example, in order to harmonize the situation in Bahia,  Neves gave two ministerial posts to the divergent movements,  Antonio Carlos Magalhaes for the communications portfolio and  Waldir Pires for social security. "It was the time to come out  of the dictatorship, but the situation is different now," Deputy  Sigmaringa Seixas said with dissatisfaction. "How will I explain  to my grass roots the alliance with Antonio Carlos Magalhaes?"  To this Jereissati replied by saying: "Protests always come  from the same people." In Jereissati's opinion, "convincing  political adversaries" reflects democratic progress.    There might be more than 14 states in which the PSDB  leadership considers the alliance with the PFL is impossible.  Bahia, Piaui, Maranhao, Rondonia, Roraima, Santa Catarina, Rio  Grande do Sul, Ceara, Paraiba, Sao Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul,  Goias, Parana, and Rio Grande do Norte are considered the most  difficult cases. Negotiations are under way in Pernambuco, Sao  Paulo, and Amazonas.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 4 Jan (MENA)--The Consultative Council  meeting today was the scene of heated discussions about  democracy in Egypt. The members were discussing a special  committee report on President Husni Mubarak's statement to a  joint People's Assembly and Consultative Council session on 12  November when the new parliamentary term began.    Independent deputy Muhammad 'Abd-al-Shafi voiced opposition  to the committee's report and to the restoration of the system  of appointing village heads and mukhtars. He urged the  government to permit the rotation of power.    Dr. Muhammad Zaki Abu-'Amir, minister of state for People's  Assembly and Consultative Council Affairs, commented on this by  saying: No one could have imagined that a parliamentarian would  speak of the rotation of power without also noting that this is  done via the ballot box, not by a government decision.    He explained that political party activity does not only  mean  congresses held in public squares. He added that certain public  and security circumstances might bar holding such congresses,  even in the case of the majority party [ruling Democratic  National Party].    On the appointment of village heads and mukhtars, Dr.  Abu-'Amir said the pertinent bill will be submitted to the  People's Assembly which will then decide whether these officials  will be elected or appointed.    Regarding a comment by Consultative Council Deputy Speaker  Tharwat Abazah about the rising price of printing material  because of higher tariffs, Dr. Abu-'Amir said that this decision  will be studied again in light of recommendations made by the  People's Assembly's Industry and Culture Committees.    Consultative Council Speaker Dr. Mustafa Kamal Hilmi  commented on the point raised by deputy 'Abd-al-Shafi, saying:  You describe our democracy as marginal. Now President Mubarak  never said we have reached the apex of democracy. He said we  are seeking to entrench democracy.    Dr. Hilmi urged the members to be fair and just, pointing  out  that during President Mubarak's term opposition newspapers could  say no to his reelection without feeling insecure. The  president accepted this broadmindedly and has met with those who  said yes and those who said no.</p>

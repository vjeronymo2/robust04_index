			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Profits slip by 22% at The Gap THE GAP, the San Francisco-based specialty retailer which until recently was one of Wall Street's darling stocks, yesterday reported a 22 per cent decline in fourth-quarter profits. The company, which operates over 1,300 stores under The Gap, Banana Republic and GapKids names, said after-tax profits in the 13 weeks to January 30, fell from Dollars 83.8m to Dollars 65.7m. Sales increased from Dollars 803.5m to Dollars 930.2m. The final quarter's figures leave The Gap's profits for the year at Dollars 210.7m after tax, down from Dollars 229.9m in the previous 12 months. Sales totalled Dollars 2.96bn, compared with Dollars 2.52bn. Mr Donald Fisher, The Gap's chairman, blamed the downturn, which was concentrated in the core domestic Gap division, on 'the effect on merchandise margins of lower retail prices and higher occupancy expenses'. He noted that GapKids and Banana Republic outlets, with the company's overseas stores, all posted higher profits. Part of The Gap's problems stem from intense competition in the domestic market from rival retailers of basic items like jeans, T-shirts and sweaters. As a result, the San Francisco company cut its denim prices last year, affecting its gross margins.</p>

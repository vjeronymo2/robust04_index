			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CRIMES PETTY, BUT NOT HIS WARRANT BILL  </P> <P> When San Diego police officers caught up with 23-year-old Antonio Anthony  Simpson, they were planning to give him a routine misdemeanor citation on  suspicion of breaking into a change box at a downtown parking lot.  </P> <P> But, after running a records check on the transient Monday morning, police  wasted no time in taking him to County Jail.  </P> <P> The police computer worked for more than an hour and a half churning out  information showing that Simpson was wanted on 45 outstanding misdemeanor  warrants for failing to appear in court -- a bail bill that totaled $182,990,  police spokesman Dave Cohen said.  </P> <P> Simpson's prior warrants, all issued within the past couple of years, included  citations for petty theft, public drunkenness, possession of narcotics  paraphernalia and a slew of other misdemeanors, police spokesman Bill Robinson  said.  </P> <P> Simpson had been cited on suspicion of a similar petty theft just last week,  Robinson said.  </P> <P> Rather than being carted off to jail, people suspected of misdemeanors are  usually cited, much as if they had been stopped for speeding. They must sign a  ticket promising to appear in court.  </P> <P> But police and the city attorney's office say there is another reason Simpson  has been able to elude jail.  </P> <P> "Overcrowding is the real reason Simpson is not in jail," Robinson said. "It  has to be a felony to be booked into the County Jail."  </P> <P> The city attorney's office, which prosecutes misdemeanors, said cases involving  people with a backlog of failure-to-appear warrants are not out of the  ordinary. Simpson's number was unusually high, however.  </P> <P> Meagan Beale, a senior screening and arraignment deputy for the city attorney's  office, estimated that only 25% of the people scheduled to appear in court for  misdemeanors ever do. When a person fails to appear, an arrest warrant is  issued.  </P> <P> "In practical matters, nothing will happen after (they don't show up in court),  because the officers are so busy with felonies," Beale said. "Even if they did  arrest you, they wouldn't have anywhere to keep you anyway."  </P></p>

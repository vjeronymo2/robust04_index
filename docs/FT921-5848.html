			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / International Company News: Swedish banks to buy Fermenta unit A CONSORTIUM of Swedish banks has agreed to buy Independent, the financial subsidiary of Fermenta, the Swedish industrial group, for SKr1. The proposed deal will enable Fermenta to continue its other business activities in health care and property. The preliminary agreement ends two weeks of intensive negotiations between Fermenta and the banks. The talks were the result of Independent suffering heavier-than-expected losses last year which halved its share capital. Under the deal, Fermenta has also agreed to buy for SKr350m (Dollars 59.3m) Independent's 99 per cent stake in Elector, the Swedish property company, and its 13 per cent stake in the Spanish real estate company AFISA, as well as Independent's outstanding loans to Elector. For its part, Independent is selling its shares and options in Independent Estates, its English property company, for SKr1 and at the same time relinquishing its remaining claims on Estates which has a book value of around SKr111m. Through its acquisition of Elector, Fermenta will acquire properties valued at around SKr700m, although the company said there may have to be a downward adjustment of their assets by between 10 and 20 per cent this year. Both sides said they hoped the agreement would provide the financial conditions for Fermenta to carry on. The biotechnology company has had a troubled history since it was founded in 1986 by Mr Refaat El-Sayed, who was convicted of fraud and sent to prison. In November 1989, it launched a bid to become a large finance company when it merged its subsidiary Independent with Infina in a deal worth SKr1.8bn. For a time it seemed to have thrown off the stigma of financial scandal with a 128 per cent rise in profits in 1989 to SKr251m. But by the autumn of 1990 it was being hit badly by the growing troubles in Sweden's finance sector caused by a liquidity squeeze. Last September, Fermenta's chairman and chief executive were forced to resign after failing to report certain share transactions to the Fermenta board and a bank consortium agreed to provide Independent with a SKr4bn credit line until April 1993.</p>

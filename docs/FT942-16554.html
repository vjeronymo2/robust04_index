			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: Regina's warring sides call for help Things are buzzing at Regina, the USM-quoted royal jelly maker that has numbered Lady Thatcher, Dame Barbara Cartland, Cliff Richard and Millwall Football Club among its customers. Mr Shiraz Malik-Noor, the former chairman and chief executive who was hived off in a coup last month, has requisitioned an extraordinary meeting on April 25 to get himself reappointed to the board. Mr Malik-Noor remains the largest shareholder, with 5.4 per cent of the company. Croxley Holdings, his family trust, has 18.9 per cent. Yesterday the current board - comprising Mr Paul Geoghegan, chairman, and Mr Tony Shakesby, finance director - sent a stinging letter to the company's shareholders urging them to oppose Mr Malik-Noor's reappointment. The letter points out to more than 4,000 shareholders that the company has notched up cumulative losses of more than Pounds 1.4m in the past two financial years. Mr Malik-Noor's salary, his sister's salary and other benefits and expenses have reached Pounds 450,000 since he joined the company in early 1991. Sales fell by 60 per cent to Pounds 2.05m for the year to end-August 1993, and have continued to decline in the first half. Mr Geoghegan said at the company's Finchley head office that he had every confidence of winning at the EGM, judging from telephone calls. However, Mr Malik-Noor is expecting the support not only of his family trust, but of a further 15 per cent held by friends and supporters, giving him about 40 per cent. 'I don't feel I can fold my tent and just walk away,' he said yesterday. He pointed out that he and associates had put more than Pounds 1.5m into the company in the last three years. Mr Geoghegan blames the falling sales on 'inappropriate marketing expenditure to support the brand'.</p>

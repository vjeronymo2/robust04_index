			<p>BFN     [Text] In Rwanda, very violent fighting broke out in the  capital, Kigali, this morning. There were exchanges of  artillery, mortar, and machine-gun fire between the government  army and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebels. The UN  soldiers on the spot were forced to suspend the evacuation of  civilians trapped by the fighting. Talks on a cease-fire were  expected to resume today.    In the capital, Kigali, eyewitnesses say that there is  hand-to-hand fighting in the city centre. The RPF has in any  case taken control of the Sainte Famille Church. Earlier, a  shell hit the church, injuring 40 people. It was in this church  that 60 adolescents took refuge and from which they were  abducted [on Tuesday] and probably massacred by Hutu militiamen.</p>

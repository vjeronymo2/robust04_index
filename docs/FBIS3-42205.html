Full Details of  the Story of the File that Killed al-Ma'ayitah"]    [Excerpts] The assassination of the Jordanian diplomat in  Beirut, Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, has opened the door wide for  speculation. Our sources assert, however, that there is much  more to it than meets the eye.    Our information indicates that the martyr was not just an  ordinary employee who had specific duties at our embassy in  Beirut, and that he had worked there for only nine months,  indeed a year, as was previously announced. He had performed  similar duties at our embassy in Cairo.    Observers in the know link the assassination to domestic and  foreign developments that have to do with the peace process and  Jordan's strained relations with several radical movements,  specifically allied with the Islamic Republic of Iran.    Interviewed by AL-BILAD, al-Ma'ayitah's relatives told the  paper al-Ma'ayitah had a very sharp mind. He was a man who  belonged to his homeland and nation, his brother Najib  al-Ma'ayitah said.    This gives an indication, one of the ministers told us, of  the nature of the special national tasks performed by the martyr  in the Lebanese arena. This is especially true since  al-Ma'ayitah's killers stole a very important file the martyr  was carrying with him, and not in his briefcase, immediately  after the assassination.    Our sources link this file to problems that arose recently  between the government and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The  sources recall His Majesty King Husayn's remarks a month ago  about considering taking official measures regarding diplomatic  relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran.    The sources further say that a Jordanian decision was made  last Thursday [27 January] according to which the Iranian side  was told to reduce its diplomatic mission in Amman, which has 33  people. Our sources say that the security agencies believe most  of them are Iranian security officers.    Active Iranian sources in Amman told AL-BILAD the Jordanian  ambassador in Tehran was the target of several attacks by  Iranian groups last month. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry,  however, chose not to go public about the attacks, although it  addressed official memorandums to its Iranian counterpart in  this regard.    These sources say that Amman has recently witnessed more  activities by extremist groups that previously operated in Syria  and Lebanon and visited Iran.    The sources assert that the Jordanian security agencies have  arrested and interrogated many members of those groups, and that  some of them are still detained, following the explosion that  occurred at the Cinema Rivoli in downtown Amman.    The security organs had received word about a small bomb  that  went off almost a month ago at the same theater. The explosion  was followed by private calls explaining that it was a  light-caliber message. Jordanian security services kept a tight  lid on the second explosion last Wednesday, before locating the  detonator. [passage omitted]    Jordanian Foreign Ministry sources say the Ministry has sent  a special fact-finding committee to Lebanon to investigate the  sinful operation and find out who is behind it.    Security reports began to link the assassination attempt to  the group of Abu-Nidal, Sabri al-Banna. Lebanese sources told  Jordanian security officers that they suspect al-Banna is  involved in the operation. Consequently, our information says,  the Jordanian security men left immediately for Lebanon.    Lebanese security agencies currently regard the Abu-Nidal  group as the second suspect in the operation, especially since  it is rumored that five leaders of the group are jailed in  Jordan. Our government denies the five are in Jordan, despite  the fact that it has released some of the movement's cadres  after being detained for two months.    Our informed sources, however, confirm that the Jordanian  agencies have recently received a thank-you note from Abu-Nidal  after releasing the movement's sequestered property in Amman,  which includes documents, offices, furniture, and other items.  The note also demanded that the movement's five leaders be  released. The Jordanian Government denies it is holding them.    Security sources do not rule out a possible connection  between Abu-Nidal and the operation. The sources, however,  think most likely there is a joint operation in which the  pro-Iran groups drew on Abu-Nidal's experience, since he has a  rich record of involvement in liquidating Jordanian diplomats  over the past 10 years. Abu-Nidal is trying to break the tight  siege imposed by our security agencies on his activities in  Jordan, since he has repeatedly tried to create a main theater  of operations in Jordan by contacting figures that cooperated  with him to use him as a pressure card against the Palestinian  leadership when the negotiating process faces any impasse.    Expressing his movement's domestic crisis in light of the  negotiating process, Abu-Nidal issued a statement on 29 November  in which he threatened to take action against the interests of  Arab regimes. The statement emphasized Jordan, since it is the  second party, after the Palestinians, that is directly concerned  with the peace process.    The Iranian side, which rejects the negotiating process, has  incited its subsidiary Islamic and Palestinian movements,  drawing their attention to the serious Jordanian role in this  context. This is especially true since Jordan and the PLO have  signed an agreement and the fact that the Iranians have lost the  Syrian card, which was also lost by the anti-'Arafat Palestinian  movements. Those movements are now looking for an objective and  geographical alternative to Syria to express their rejection of  the negotiations. [passage omitted]</p>

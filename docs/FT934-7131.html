			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Oh, yes it is] - it's panto time again / Brush up your hisses and boos BRUSH UP your hisses; perfect your boos, panto time is almost upon us. Obituaries for pantomime can be delayed for yet another Christmas. This is one British institution that seems to survive the myriad changes in the entertainment industry, probably because adults imagine the perfect panto of their childhood and drag along their kids to perpetuate a folk myth. Of course panto has changed, but it was changing in late Victorian times when music hall stars started to assume Dick Whittington's tights and the Ugly Sisters' false bosoms. Thirty years ago pop stars and television personalities began to stretch their talents in panto, often to breaking point. Now it is sports heroes. Gareth Chilcott, the rugby player, has switched from propping up England to roughing up Cinderella as the Broker's man at the Mayflower, Southampton. This production also marks the panto debut of Gloria Hunniford, one of nature's Fairy Godmothers. At the Theatre Royal, Bath, Ian Botham will be whiling away his retirement in Dick Whittington and Annabel Croft is serving it up in Cinderella at the Grand Opera House, York. All these productions come courtesy of Paul Elliott, who is supplying pantos to 20 theatres this Christmas. Out from the warehouse come the same old sets, the costumes, and, too often, the scripts, but since familiarity is one of the joys of the genre this is not too disturbing. Each year there is a brand new production, costing Pounds 250,000, which over time will traverse the nation. It always starts at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, and this year it is a new Jack &amp; the Beanstalk. Like many pantos, one of its attractions is the oddball collection of stars tempted to disrupt their Christmas for two shows daily. This Jack embraces Rolf Harris, Bonnie Langford, and Dame Hilda Brackett. Another quaint trio takes the stage in the Birmingham Hippodrome's Dick Whittington - the sexually voracious Lesley Joseph from TV's Birds of a Feather; the winsome Rosemarie Ford from Come Dancing; and the leaping Wayne Sleep, while the dressers for Aladdin at the New Victoria, Woking, will have to cope with the costumes of both Danny La Rue and Britt Ekland. Advance bookings around the country are substantially higher so far this year - except in central London. Once again the West End is a panto free zone, mainly because the natural venue, the Palladium, is still host to Joseph. But Londoners should be well served at Richmond, which always mounts a lavish, traditional, production. This Christmas veterans Kate O'Mara and Bernard Cribbens are headliners in Dick Whittington. A mile or so away Wimbledon gets a northern invasion from Little &amp; Large in Jack &amp; the Beanstalk while Bromley is fielding Ronnie Corbett in Cinderella, and Lewisham catches the full blast of the latest television trend with Saracen and Scorpio from Gladiators. Pantomime has survived because it absorbs these fads of popular culture. It even looks abroad. Marion Ramsey, a stalwart of the Hollywood Police Academy movie series, finds herself in Cinderella in Hayes, which must come as a double shock to her system. But while embracing the new, panto also finds work for the old, and many stars whose salad days are long over enjoy a seasonal re-birth. So there is Vince Hill in Birmingham, Charlie Cairoli in Newcastle, and both Gerald Harper and the veteran Dame Jack Tripp in Babes in the Wood at the Bournemouth Pavilion. And there are the stars who shine brightest at Christmas, notably Ken Dodd, still enmeshed in Diddy Men (and Susan Maughan) at the Manchester Palace's Dick Whittington, and John Inman, a permanent Dame, in Mother Goose at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham. Bournemouth also fields Roy Hudd, who is thoroughly steeped in pantomine history, so steeped in fact that he combines appearing in Bournemouth with writing and directing the Watford panto. Some other artistes are equally elastic. Bobby Davro actually manages to wow them in Goldilocks at both Newcastle and Leeds. The secret is that old show biz one, timing. The panto season does not reach Leeds until February when the Theatre Royal, Newcastle, production arrives at the Grand. Of course there are theatres that try and ring the changes by offering seasonal alternatives. Among the more interesting are the Birmingham Rep's adaptation of the Raymond Briggs's modern classic, The Snowman; a speedy revival at the Albery of Roald Dahl's Big Friendly Giant; and the appearance of a Victorian Christmas Circus in the renovated Great Hall at Blackheath Concert Halls. But mainly it is panto as usual, which these days means pantos sponsored by Cadbury's. Over 40 of this season's pantomimes are backed by the confectionery firm which should ensure that the front stalls are battered by sweeties.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (1): Slowly burns the fuse - Two years after the Peking massacre, democratic reform is still a potent and unresolved issue. And in the fog surrounding the demise of the Communist Old Guard the only certainty is China's growing sense of insecurity in a changing world PEKING is a city with an earthquake waiting to happen. Last month, it was a-buzz with seismologists reporting that the earth's crust in north China had been immobile for too long. This portended a catastrophic tremor like that of 1976 which killed around a quarter of a million people in the nearby city of Tangshan and - as it seemed to traditionally-minded folk - foretold the death of Chairman Mao Zedong a few weeks later. As it happened, there was an earthquake this March, but it was several hundred miles from Peking and has so far not rocked the leadership. The octogenarian patriarchs who, though mostly without official posts, effectively rule China, cling grimly to life, according to Peking stories, by means of monthly blood transfusions and the attentions of China's most famous 'Qigong' (traditional deep-breathing) masters. Their relatives, retainers and vassals circle like vultures, awaiting a death which will shift the balance in the divided leadership between the aged reformist Deng Xiaoping and the conservatives headed by Chen Yun. Though the present jockeying depends more on personal ties than policy, how far to permit reform is still a potent issue. The current balance between reformers and hard-liners is nicely illustrated by the appointment at the recent National People's Congress of two new Vice-premiers, Zhu Rongji, mayor of Shanghai (reformist), and Zou Jiahua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission (hard-liner). But it also illustrates the near-unfathomable inter-connections between personalities and policies. Zou Jiahua is brother-in-law to reformist Ye Xuanping, governor of Guangdong province. Ye, powerful son of China's now-dead head of state and Long March general, Ye Jianying, was also appointed to a post in Peking (though a purely formal one), apparently to remove him from his freewheeling fief in south China where he was resisting Peking's interference. But who is doing what to whom by these moves? Has Ye increased his power in moving to the centre or lost it now that he's away from his home support? Are Ye and Zou at daggers drawn because of politics because of family relationships? If it was a loss of power for Ye to be posted to Peking, is it not the same for Mayor Zhu Rongji? Do these appointments mean that the reformers have gained, or the hard-liners? The one certainty in the political fog is the growing stress on security, particularly in Peking. Many provincial cities are relaxed and a fair number of the reform policies of the mid-1980s continue, if sporadically. But in the Chinese capital, police and video cameras are thick on the streets. Particularly monitored, by video cameras, bugs or simple tailing, are local Chinese contacts with foreigners. In March, a new top level security committee was set up under Qiao Shi, Number Three in China's party leadership and a lifelong policeman. Its first meeting was held just two days after the People's Daily published a poem which, when read diagonally, contained this hidden message: 'Li Peng (the hard-line premier who masterminded the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989) must be removed from power to assuage popular indignation'. Reports from Hong Kong last week said the editor responsible was later arrested trying to flee the country. The leadership has reason to feel insecure. Xu Jiatun, a senior party member and, till last year the head of the Xinhua news agency in Hong Kong, China's de facto embassy, has defected to the US. Provincial leaders such as Ye Xuanping are strong enough to defy the central government over issues such as taxation. Disaffection is rife in China's border territories of Tibet, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. While China has no problem marshalling the force to deal with this (demonstrations have been ruthlessly put down), it fears the growing influence in the outside world of Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and the effects on its other minorities of Islamic fundamentalism and growing democracy in the former Soviet empire. The leadership is watching the Soviet Union anxiously, backing President Gorbachev because, unlike Boris Yeltsin, he is resisting independence for the republics. Alarmed by Washington's military might as displayed in the Gulf, Peking is looking for new weaponry and hopes to buy some of the relatively advanced Su 27 Soviet combat aircraft in the next few months. The deal is likely to figure prominently in the visit of Jiang Zemin, China's party leader, to Moscow next month. Peking has seen its relations with the US slide since it put down the student demonstrators of Tiananmen in 1989. While the economic sanctions applied thereafter were gradually repealed last year and China regained some standing by supporting Kuwait rather than Iraq in the Gulf crisis, its arms sales in the Middle East have earned it American fury. This, plus its brutal handling of Tibetan and Chinese demonstrators since and its flood of cheap exports to the US are making the re-confirmation of its access to Most Favoured Nation treatment an uncertainty for the second year running. If Washington takes MFN away, Sino-US relations will nose-dive to levels not seen for nearly two decades. Sino-British relations are cool in the wake of the dispute over Hong Kong's proposed new airport. Germany, previously in keen pursuit of trade and investment with China, is preoccupied with the problems in its eastern half. Japan, once dazzled by the size and proximity of the Chinese market, is being actively courted by the USSR as potential fairy god-mother to Siberia. China, for over a decade a favourite with western governments, is in danger of being left on the shelf as the world regroups after the collapse of Soviet communism and the Gulf war. This comes at a time when Peking faces serious domestic economic problems. Food shortages, inflation and unemployment are all possible flash points for urban unrest. In the inevitable grim comparison with the Soviet bloc, the economy is thriving, but this is probably temporary. China has had record harvests two years running, which have boosted light industry and food markets, but a harvest downturn is now threatened because of damaging drought in many parts of China. On top of that, Peking's inability to deal with serious price distortions is now coming home to roost. In industry, the collective and private sector is booming but the state sector - the backbone of China's heavy industry - is a disaster area. More than a third of state enterprises last year made a loss, and subsidies to featherbed industrial workers (by maintaining jobs and cheap food) came to nearly RMB yuan 100bn, almost a third of the state's budget expenditure. The alternative to subsidies is to close factories and raise food prices, which the party leadership believes would enrage the urban population. Reluctantly the hard-liners in the leadership have had to agree to some reform as the lesser of two evils. Two small stock exchanges, plus half a dozen centres where grain prices have been freed, a proper income tax system and a move to give state factory managers more independence are all currently on test. The most hopeful sign in China today is that many young officials (educated, they'll sometimes tell you, on courses in unlikely places like Bath, in south-west England) long to try these on a wider scale. If China can surmount its present difficulties, they might get the chance. But not a lot is likely to change until the present gruesome stalemate is resolved over who in the top leadership dies first, and when.</p>

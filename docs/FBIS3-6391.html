"It's impossible to do what is  impossible even if U.S. Trade Representative (Mickey) Kantor  cries out," the source said.    Kantor, speaking before the House Trade Subcommittee on  Tuesday, pointed to a need for government guarantees to ensure  that the planned steps by the auto industry are effective in  boosting purchases of U.S. auto parts.    Japanese trade officials dismissed Kantor's remark, saying  the government cannot control business activities as doing so  runs counter to the government policy of deregulation.</p>

Scalfaro, who will designate the next head of government  following the landslide victory by a right-wing bloc headed by  media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, said in a statement to the  press that the new administration "was entitled to work in  peace."    He hailed the climate of "tranquility and normality" in  which  the election had been conducted despite a complex new electoral  law.    Scalfaro is to convene a meeting on April 15 of the new  chambers of Italy's 12th legislature since World War II.</p>

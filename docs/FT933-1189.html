			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (35): Fingers crossed for soft landing - China / Alexander Nicoll sees positive signs in the country's reform programme IN THE 15 years since Mr Deng Xiaoping launched China's economic reforms, the country has repeatedly lurched from boom to bust and back again. Each burst of reform has let loose economic forces which have run riot because it is impossible simply to replace one system of control with another. The old central planning machinery cannot cope with the market forces unleashed by reform, but new methods of macroeconomic control suited to a market economy are still missing. Periodic bouts of austerity - and political setbacks for reformers - have been the inevitable result. This time, however, many fingers are crossed that it will be different. The government has since the middle of the year been seeking to restrain growth after another extraordinary boom caused evident over-heating, with inflation and the trade deficit rising, the currency declining on unofficial markets and spending on new fixed assets running out of control. Officials who strongly back reform, instead of being forced to take responsibility for faster inflation and shortages of goods as in the past, have managed to remain in charge of the economy's slowdown. So far - it is still too early to make a reliable judgment - the signs are positive. Mr Zhu Rongji, the vice-premier in charge of the economy, may be able to achieve a soft landing while at the same time advancing the cause of reform. He has curbed activities which were causing speculative and inflationary bubbles - property, construction, stock markets - by exerting much tighter control over finance. Rather than stopping reforms he has taken the opportunity to begin significant changes to the financial system. Success in this very difficult task would be a step forward of inestimable value for China. It would narrow the wild fluctuations in economic growth which cause disruption and hardship for many Chinese. It would also lay the foundation for the country to become an economic superpower. China's progress so far is becoming a familiar story. It averaged 9 per cent annual growth in the 1980s even after two bouts of austerity. Reform resumed quietly soon after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, and was given a shove forward by Mr Deng's visit in early 1992 to southern China, which has seen the fastest growth. Economic growth last year was 12.8 per cent and is likely to be around the same this year. Last year alone, China contracted for foreign investment worth Dollars 58bn and actually used Dollars 11bn, according to official figures. Even allowing for exaggeration in official figures, this represents a substantial inflow which has come largely from ethnic Chinese businesses outside the mainland - though many western companies are also keenly interested. Investment from Hong Kong and Taiwan has led to the term greater China being applied to the tri-partite area, though the three territories remain politically and economically separate. Hong Kong and Taiwan companies have been seeking to transfer manufacturing capacity on to the mainland to take advantage of cheap labour. China is keen to welcome the investment both for commercial reasons, and with its aim for political re-unification in mind. Hong Kong, which reverts from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 though it will retain economic autonomy, is increasingly linked to the mainland by two-way investment and trade. Foreign companies are attracted to China by its huge potential both as a low-cost producer and as a market for goods. Increasingly, they have confidence that the opening of the economy will be durable and will go further. China's industrial growth is being generated mainly by the non-state sector, chiefly involved in lighter industries. It has been assisted by relaxation of most price controls, greater mobility and availability of labour, freedom to deal directly with foreigners and in foreign currencies, and a host of other reforms. However, this is taking place when a great deal of the economy is still subject to old constraints. State-owned enterprises still depend largely on central control and financing by state-owned banks. The budget deficit is large and rising because of public sector spending and the need for sweeping tax reform. The financial system is struggling to learn disciplines which were unnecessary when it existed simply to bankroll the state system. One of the chief challenges facing the Chinese government is to introduce new means for macroeconomic control without backtracking on reform. This is what Mr Zhu is attempting. Backed by advice from the World Bank, he identified the central bank as the best place to start and took over as its governor in July with the aim of beginning a complete overhaul of the banking system. He has raised interest rates and demanded that banks call in speculative real estate loans. Mr Zhu has acted to close down thousands of areas designated by local authorities as development zones. These were sucking in huge amounts of fixed asset investment - contributing to heavy demand for goods such as steel - as well as weakening the state's financing by avoiding taxation, and enriching local officials. Fixed asset investment increased 70 per cent in the first seven months of 1993, compared with the same period of 1992, and Mr Zhu has announced that it should be restricted to important infrastructural projects. Even assuming that the measures to cool the excesses of the boom are successful, much remains to be done. The government has begun the social reforms needed to separate state-owned enterprises from their obligation to provide an iron rice bowl to employees and their families. The enterprises need to learn management and marketing skills, and the haemorrhage of their finances has to be stopped. Though China's reformers do not have to answer to an electorate, their whole agenda is fraught with political uncertainty. A power struggle will loom when the frail, 89-year-old Mr Deng departs the scene. Mr Zhu is a forceful man with an evident grasp of the economic requirements, but his own political position could come into question, particularly if Mr Deng were to die soon.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        THE ASIAN OUTLOOK IN 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Real GDP   Inflation  Prime rate*    Current     Exchange                growth           %       (% pa)    account         rate**                     %                          (% of GDP)   (% change)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- China            13.9        12.2         na        0.2        -11.3 Hong Kong         6.3        10.3         6.8         0.3          0.0 India             5.4         6.6        16.0        -2.4        -26.9 Indonesia         6.6         7.8        13.5        -0.8         -3.5 South Korea       5.4         5.3        11.5        -0.8         -3.1 Malaysia          7.2         3.9         7.8        -0.2         -2.7 Philippines       2.1         7.8        13.5        -2.2        -11.0 Singapore         6.9         2.2         5.9         4.4         +0.9 Taiwan            6.9         3.8         8.8         2.2         -1.4 Thailand          7.6         3.8        10.8        -6.1         -0.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Year-end rates; 12-month deposit rates in case of Indonesia and government bond yields; **(+) appreciation, (-) depreciation against the US dollar  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Merrill Lynch  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

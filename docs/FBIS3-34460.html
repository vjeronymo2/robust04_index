			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Here is an analysis of the address made by the  head of state, Liamine Zeroual, with colleagues Hocine Chaiche  and Chaaban Lounaka.    [First unidentified speaker] The essential idea in the head  of state's address was his announcement that Algeria had a  specific policy and a clear plan to deal with the political  crisis, and that it was in control of that process and firm in  implementing the policy. This means that we have moved from the  stage of diagnosis to the stage of treatment, and that the  latter no longer needs further explanation. However,  explanations will be made within the framework of the dialogue  process which remains a firm option.    [Second unidentified speaker] It is true that the head of  state's address included the aforementioned policy. It seems  that the policy is based on an essential idea, namely that the  new authority is convinced that the political crisis could only  be resolved through dialogue and the participation of all the  national political forces, without exception. This statement  restores hope after the effective parties' boycott of the  national conference, the possible effects of which on the  authority's position was feared by many people. However, it has  become clear now that the political line declared by the head of  state when he was only defense minister represents a strong and  firm non-circumstantial conviction. This means now is the time  for serious and real work with the parties. We now have to wait  for the reactions of political forces.    [First speaker] That is clear from the head of state's  mention of the parties to the dialogue which boycotted the  conference, describing them as hesitant. This means that he was  careful to maintain the dialogue bridges with those parties. He  also gave assurance regarding the future of the dialogue when he  said: We are determined to continue the dialogue in earnest, and  earnest dialogue will inevitably be rewarded. The head of state  made a commitment to returning to a democratic electoral path.    [Second speaker] As it is known, one of the fundamental  issues in the dialogue generally is the participation of the  dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. We are aware that  before the address, officials confirmed that contacts made with  the FIS to achieve that aim produced positive and encouraging  results. The speech confirmed officially but indirectly that  that group was interested in serious dialogue as much as other  parties when Zeroual talked about national political forces  without exception.    We note that the head of state used the term political  forces  instead of political parties, maybe to remove obstacles in the  way of the expected dialogue. Naturally, the serious dialogue  mentioned by the head of state and demanded by the political  forces would require a host of measures.    [First speaker] Although the head of state did not announce  them in his address as most people expected, we conclude that  these measures would inevitably be adopted within the overall  framework of the dialogue. Generally, these measures will  concern the state of emergency and the concurrent events and the  aftermath of the security situation.    Naturally, holding a dialogue without exceptions and linking  it to the previously announced contacts with effective figures  representing the FIS, will necessarily lead to adopting measures  regarding that tendency. The constitution authorizes the head  of state to make appropriate decisions to ensure the success of  the defined policy and the clear plan in dealing with the  political crisis which Zeroual stressed in his address. Without  doubt, the sooner all the sides work for the restoration of  security, stability and peace of mind the sooner the  aforementioned measures would be adopted and the crisis would be  resolved. [passage omitted]    [Second speaker] The new head of state is now pledging to  make efforts to implement the economic reforms and carry them  out in practice. The result expected from the reforms is to rid  the economy of administrative and other obstacles, remove the  monopolies exercised by the state over the economic process and  provide opportunity to public and private sector economic  initiatives. Indeed, we shall find that many people would say  that there is nothing new in this and that it has been repeated  since the debate on economic reforms began but the same problems  still exist. This is absolutely true and the reason is very  simple, namely the reforms have never been carried out. [passage  omitted]</p>

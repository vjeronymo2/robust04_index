			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: Confusion over contracts - Draft legislation threatens another row in the UK The UK's Department of Trade and Industry finds itself under fire again over plans for implementing another piece of European legislation: this time, on consumer contracts. The row comes just as the dust is beginning to settle after eleventh-hour changes were made to the UK commercial agency rules, which left British companies only 10 days to renegotiate their agency agreements. The European Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, which must be incorporated into UK law by the end of 1994, is designed to extend the protection of consumers against unfair attempts by suppliers of goods and services to exclude, or limit their liability to, areas not covered by current UK legislation. The extension of the unfair contract terms regime to insurance and financial services contracts, and to contracts for land in particular, will force businesses in those sectors to make a time-consuming and possibly expensive review of all their standard terms and conditions. Consultation on the draft regulations, which will bring UK law into line with Europe, ended last Friday. In theory this should leave the DTI sufficient leeway to produce a final draft in time for businesses to carry out an orderly review of their consumer contracts before implementation. But lawyers and consumer organisations fear that the draft regulations are so flawed and in need of clarification that another fiasco, similar to that over the commercial agency regulations, cannot be ruled out. At a general level there is concern that, rather than replacing the rules in the 1977 Unfair Contract Terms Act (UCTA), the new regulations will run alongside the current regime. Ms Samantha Mobley, a solicitor with the City law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie, says the wisdom of this approach is questionable. 'At a time when the government's buzz-word is deregulation, it makes no sense to impose an additional layer of regulation to existing legislation,' she says. Consumer organisations agree. Ms Rebecca Evans, the Consumers' Association's consumer lawyer, says having two regimes running side-by-side will confuse traders and consumers. The law will have to be consolidated at some stage, but it is now clear that the government cannot introduce primary legislation to replace the 1977 act in time to meet the December 31 deadline. Consumer organisations are also concerned that the DTI proposes to ignore enforcement measures set out in the directive. The directive requires European Union member states to ensure that 'adequate and effective means' exist for the control of the use of unfair terms in consumer contracts. Those means must include the granting of legal rights to persons or organisations with a legitimate interest in protecting consumers - in other words, consumer organisations must be allowed to bring representative actions in the courts on behalf of consumers. This is a dilemma for the DTI, as representative actions are contrary to the English law principle of privity of contract. The DTI's solution to this problem is to opt out of this part of the directive. But, again, lawyers cast doubt on the wisdom of this approach. The Consumers' Association, the Office of Fair Trading and the National Consumers Council have all pointed out to the DTI that, because of the supremacy of EU law over national law, the government cannot ignore part of a directive that is mandatory. The European Commission in Brussels has told the Consumers' Association that, if the UK government fails to provide for representative action in the regulations, it will take infraction proceedings against the UK at the European Court in Luxembourg. According to Ms Evans, consumers need the remedy of representative action. UCTA has been little used, she says, because consumers are deterred by the risk and expense of taking court action. 'There should be a power for consumer organisations to take up the cudgels on behalf of all consumers.' The other concerns with the draft regulations centre on lack of clarity. They will, for example, introduce the concept of 'unfairness' into the English law of contract for the first time. UCTA imposes a general requirement that exclusion clauses are only valid if 'reasonable'. According to Ms Mobley, lawyers assume the English courts will interpret the concept of unfairness as equating with reasonableness under UCTA, but this is not certain. She and other lawyers feel the DTI should make this issue clear by spelling it out in the regulations so that businesses, particularly those with consumer contracts that have hitherto been exempt from unfair contract terms rules, will know what standard they are measuring their contract conditions against when they review them. In other respects the draft regulations appear to go beyond what the directive requires. The directive states that it covers terms in contracts for the supply of goods or services between the supplier and the consumer. But according to Mr Norman Starritt, a partner of London solicitors Charles Russell, the DTI's draft regulations do not expressly require that the goods and services are supplied to the consumer. The regulations would therefore appear to apply the fairness test not just to contracts for the supply of goods and services, but also to certain ancillary contracts. These could include the terms of any standard bank guarantee by a wife of a bank loan to her husband's business, or a parent's guarantee of a finance lease for a young person to buy a car. But it is in the extension of the unfair contract terms regime to sectors currently exempt, such as contracts for land, insurance and financial services, that these uncertainties and flaws in the draft regulations are likely to cause the biggest headache. The extension of the regime to the financial services industry represents a substantial departure from the current position under UCTA, where contracts for the creation or transfer of securities or of any right or interest in securities are exempted from regulation. Mr Peter Richards-Carpenter, a partner of Baker &amp; McKenzie, says it is clear the DTI does not intend the regulations to apply to the creation or issue of financial securities, as the issuer of a financial security is neither selling goods nor supplying a service; the security is simply evidence of indebtedness. But the regulations will apply to the secondary market and to relations with brokers, to the retail products market and to all other transactions that manifestly involve the sale or supply of goods, such as contracts for the issue of commodity futures and options. The extension of the concept of unfairness to such contracts threatens a period of uncertainty for the industry. There is bound to be confusion in a number of instances on what is meant by an unfair term in relation to financial services contracts, Mr Richards-Carpenter says. The draft regulations, for example, state that a term will be regarded as unfair and therefore unenforceable if it causes a 'significant imbalance' in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract to the detriment of the consumer. It is not clear whether taking a security over assets would be regarded as unfair, because it gives a right to the provider on non-performance of the contract by the consumer but no similar right to the consumer for non-performance by the supplier. Such matters will have to be tested, he says. Amid all this uncertainty, one thing is clear: the DTI will have to work hard to iron out these difficulties if another embarrassing row with business is to be avoided.</p>

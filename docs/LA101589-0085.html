			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS BOBBLES THE DEBT  </P> <P> An uncommon burst of good sense gripped leaders of the U.S. Senate the other  day and they agreed to strip all the extraneous non-essential items from the  budget bill, including consideration of a capital-gains tax cut and a variety  of outrageous special-interest provisions. Still, the action came too late to  avoid what Washington has dreaded ever since 1985: imposition of  across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction act on  Monday. Without similar action from the House, the broad ax of the law will  fall on $16 billion in expenditures, half from the defense budget and half from  domestic programs.  </P> <P> The Gramm-Rudman cuts have been the hammer that forced Congress in recent years  to meet specific deficit-reduction targets. Doing so involved making painful  choices -- along with considerable sleight-of-hand -- but those choices were  not as painful as the threat of deeper, mindless reductions under Gramm-Rudman.  This year, however, the budget process got delayed by President Bush's proposal  to cut the capital gains tax and his opposition to any tax increase -- both  promises from his election campaign.  </P> <P> So finally, the Gramm-Rudman budget doomsday will arrive on Monday. Will the  Capitol evaporate in smoke? Will the Washington Monument fall? Will the Mint's  money presses grind to a halt? Of course not. No one needs to worry about the  Gramm-Rudman curse because Congress already had decided to make that relatively  painless, too. Leaders made it clear well in advance that if the Gramm-Rudman  cuts actually went into effect, they would be restored just as soon as the  budget reconciliation bill finally passed. In this case, Gramm-Rudman turns out  to be a paper tiger after all.  </P> <P> The problem is that both Bush and congressional leaders decided back in the  spring to fudge the deficit issue this year and attempt to forge a major  deficit compromise in 1990. The implication was that Congress then could  persuade the Administration to go along with a tax increase after giving the  President one year of grace on his campaign pledge. But by deciding to just  slide by in 1989, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) of the House Ways and  Means Committee said in a newspaper column Friday that the nation lost its best  opportunity to achieve some real progress against the deficit since it was a  year of clean slates with a new President, a new Congress and no congressional  election.  </P> <P> The offshoot of Friday's action is that the capital gains tax will be  considered in separate legislation in coming weeks. And it appeared that Bush  was ready to accede to Democrats' demands that there also be a restoration of  the tax deduction for funds invested in individual retirement accounts. Such  deals cost the Treasury money, of course, and it will be interesting to see  where the revenue is to come from to pay for them (the capital gains reduction  would earn new revenue for three years and then become a deficit-producer).  </P> <P> Almost certainly the plan will make permanent the 3% federal excise tax on  telephone service and cancel a scheduled reduction in the 8% tax on airline  tickets. Thus the consumer will bear much of the burden, on top of the high  interest rates he is paying as a result of the nation's staggering, and  growing, debt. Anyone surprised?  </P></p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Algerian cycle of violence THE REACTION of the Algerian regime to the assassination yesterday of its nominal leader, Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, is easy to predict. No one will doubt that the assassins are members of an Islamic group, and the blame will be put on the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), whose leaders Mr Abbasi Madani and Mr Ali Ben Hadj went on trial on Saturday, facing charges that carry the death penalty. The regime will argue that Mr Boudiaf's tragic death proves - if further proof is needed - that the FIS and its supporters are men of violence, and that the decision to cancel the elections last January in which the FIS was about to come to power was amply justified. The crackdown on Islamic militants of all sorts will be reinforced. That reaction cannot alter the fact that Mr Boudiaf's death is a severe blow to the regime's credibility. For by far its strongest claim to support, whether from foreign creditors or from the Algerian public, was its promise to restore public order and maintain stability. It was continuing, though not as fast or decisively as its western well-wishers would like, on the path of economic reform begun under President Chadli Bendjedid. But political stability was an essential pre-requisite for economic success. Thus what had been particularly welcome to the International Monetary Fund, and even more so to European governments which have a big stake in stability on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, was that the decision 10 days ago to halve subsidies on bread, semolina and milk, and to remove completely those on all other basic foodstuffs, was not followed by any immediate public disturbances. Any comfort to be drawn from that has now been more than cancelled out. One should of course be cautious about taking an assassination as in itself evidence of widespread discontent. But the murder of the head of state during a public meeting does call in question, about as radically as anything can, the regime's ability to maintain order. All the more so when the fatal shot is fired by a man wearing the uniform of an elite unit of the security forces: this suggests that sympathy for the Islamic opposition has penetrated close to the heart of the state. Mr Boudiaf himself was an honourable man. A hero of the struggle against France, he fell out with President Ahmed Ben Bella soon after independence and went into exile, where he remained for 28 years, thereby avoiding any association with the dictatorial methods, economic mismanagement and corruption of the former ruling party, the Front de Liberation National. It was precisely for that reason that the army asked him to take over as head of state when it intervened to depose President Chadli and cancel the elections last January. Mr Boudiaf's intentions were good. He made real efforts to root out corruption, and was no doubt sincere in his desire to make a new attempt at introducing democracy once the situation was under control and the FIS neutralised. But the fact remained that his only mandate to govern came from the guns of the men who had put him there, and this weakens the regime's moral case against those who committed yesterday's crime. It was entirely understandable that westernised middle-class Algerians were reluctant to entrust their country's fate to the FIS, some of whose leaders had openly declared that multiparty democracy is incompatible with Islam. Army officers may well have felt that President Chadli had shown gross incompetence in choosing a single-member-constituency electoral system which allowed the FIS to win an overwhelming majority of seats on a minority of votes, and that he would not be strong enough, whatever his constitutional powers, to prevent a FIS government from establishing permanent control of the state. But having cancelled the elections, they were unable, even with Mr Boudiaf's help, to formulate any clear new direction for the country. Without him, their power will be more blatantly than ever based on force alone, unless they can establish a dialogue with the opposition whose leaders are now on trial, leading to national reconciliation with an agreed procedure and timetable for new elections.</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Craxi may be tried for insurance carve-up Milan magistrates yesterday asked that Mr Bettino Craxi, former leader of the Socialist party, be sent for trial along with 12 others on corruption charges related to an L17bn (Pounds 6.77m) insurance deal. The deal was for a carve-up of the lucrative insurance business covering the 130,000 employees of Eni, the state oil concern, in favour of Sai, an insurance company controlled by Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the Milan construction magnate. Mr Craxi, along with Mr Severino Citaristi, former treasurer of the Christian Democrat party, was described as instigator of the arrangement that also envisaged subsequent inclusion of Salomon Brothers in any insurance business. Mr Ligresti, known as the 'king of Milan concrete', was also one of those to be sent for trial. Others included Mr Rinaldo Petrignani, former Italian ambassador in Washington who was working for Salomon Brothers, Mr Alberto Grotti, former deputy chairman of Eni, and Mr Sergio Cusani, consultant close to Socialists standing trial in Milan on separate corruption charges. Last week Mr Craxi admitted he was fully aware of illicit financing of political parties while giving evidence during the Cusani trial that centres on illicit political contributions by Ferruzzi-Montedison. But Mr Craxi denied taking any money himself or receiving money on behalf of his party from businessmen. Yesterday, Milan magistrates said they would be asking him to return to the witness box. In a separate development, it emerged yesterday that the Vatican had responded to Milan magistrates' requests for information surrounding L92bn in treasury bills that were cashed by the IOR, the Holy See's bank. The treasury bills formed part of the bribe paid by Ferruzzi-Montedison to the political parties to ensure the group extricated itself from its Enimont joint chemical's venture with Eni. The European Commission yesterday gave the go-ahead to the acquisition by Pilkington, the British glassmaker, and Techint Finanziaria of Italy, of Societa Italiana Vetro. The Commission said it had completed its investigation under the merger control regulation and decided not to oppose the transaction. Arrangements have been made to complete the acquisition later this week.</p>

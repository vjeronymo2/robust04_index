			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Top team at Lloyd's is reinforced Lloyd's of London yesterday moved to reinforce its senior management team by appointing Sir Alan Hardcastle, the former head of the government's accountancy service, to take charge of regulation at the insurance market. Sir Alan will become chairman of Lloyd's regulatory board and deputy chairman of its governing council, succeeding Mr Brian Garraway, who died in September. Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, said: 'His wealth of experience will be invaluable in continuing to develop the new regulatory environment at Lloyd's' A former senior partner of Peat Marwick, Mitchell (now KPMG Peat Marwick), Sir Alan, aged 60, became head of the government accountancy service in 1989. Separately it emerged yesterday that Mr Rowland and Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, have persuaded many of Lloyd's largest agencies to make voluntary donations to help settle out of court legal actions by 17,000 loss-making Names - individuals whose assets support the market. The contributions vary from less than Pounds 100,000 for smaller agents to more than Pounds 1.5m for some of the largest, with the total collected amounting to at least Pounds 25m. Lloyd's hopes to finance the bulk of its settlement offer to Names from two other sources: between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m from errors and omissions insurers, which cover Lloyd's agents against awards for negligence and a contribution; and possibly about Pounds 400m from the Lloyd's central fund, which meets claims when Names are unable to fulfil their obligations. Names will be offered a 'bespoke' settlement depending on which loss-making syndicates they belong to, with the amount of compensation offered reflecting the chances of success of their separate legal actions and a series of other factors. The agents' voluntary contribution, however, has stretched the resources of the total of more than 100 agents who have been trading at the market. Many have seen their income shrink following recent losses. One chairman conceded that his agency had been forced to borrow to finance the payment and some smaller agents could be forced into insolvency. One managing director said: 'There are agents who are being asked for sums which will kill them. It is an extremely emotional issue.' Donations were calculated according to a complex formula which reflects the deductibles on agents' errors and omissions policies (the amount of each claim paid by the policyholder) as well as the exposure of agents to legal actions.

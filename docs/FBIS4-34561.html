			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 21 Jun (EFE) -- The Front for  Haiti's Advance and Progress (FRAPH) announced today that it  would start a general strike next Friday, 24 June, to protest  U.S. policies against Haiti and to practice voodoo to exorcise  the invasion.    FRAPH leader Emmanuel Constant confirmed that the group  changed its name to People's Armed Revolutionary Front this  Tuesday, and he criticized what he called was the  Clinton-Aristide-Gray policy. Constant was referring to U.S.  President Bill Clinton; Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the Haitian  president who was toppled in September 1991; and William Gray,  the U.S. President's adviser for the Haitian crisis.    Constant, however, clarified at a news conference this  afternoon, that the name, People's Armed Revolutionary Front,  does not mean the organization will take up arms due to U.S.  military intervention threats. He explained that the members of  the organization are to be relief personnel who will be deployed  to strategic areas and await the Armed Forces' requests.    Constant commented that the Front's members will have  machetes and will use magic, voodoo, and the "Ouanga" (object  used in voodoo practices to show special powers). The  right-wing leader indicated that they will use those powers to  protect the country from a foreign invasion.    Louis Jodell Chamblain, who was not allowed to speak on  behalf of the FRAPH on 11 June after he said "nobody is safe in  Haiti" and he reported that he had been attacked, was also  present at the news conference. Chamblain's presence at the  FRAPH locale in Delmas, near Port-au-Prince, surprised reporters  who attended the event because they thought there had been a  split in the group when Chamblain made those statements after he  was allegedly attacked.    A voodoo ceremony is also being held at the Haitian National  Pantheon Museum, near the National Palace, this afternoon.  Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde; Emmanuele  Menard, the director of the museum and of the national  television station; and Army officers are participating in this  ceremony. The ceremony, in which flower offerings have been  made, is organized by a cultural association that was founded by  Deputy Lionel Bouzi. According to several of the participants,  the ceremony is being held to honor the country's forefathers.</p>

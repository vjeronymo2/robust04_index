			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DANIELS DENIES HE'S 'SIMPLE'  </P> <P> Country rock musician Charlie Daniels says he isn't the hidebound, simplistic  person whose views are presented in the song "Simple Man."  </P> <P> But Daniels has sympathy for him. The song's lyrics advocate the lynching of  anybody involved in drugs and call for a slow death for child abusers by  leaving them for alligators and rattlesnakes.  </P> <P> "When I say I'm a simple man, it's simple attitudes," Daniels said. "Obviously,  I'm being facetious with the song. I certainly don't think we should string  anybody up from a tree or leave people out in the swamp."  </P></p>

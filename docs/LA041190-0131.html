			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'CRAZY PEOPLE': SOME LAUGHS BUT A GOOD IDEA GOES TO WASTE  </P> <P> The satiric idea behind "Crazy People" (citywide) deserves a better movie.  Dudley Moore, looking a bit haggard and bored, pays Emory Leeson, an ad exec  who, on deadline pressure, has a brainstorm.  </P> <P> Ad men lie for a living, he reasons, so why not cleanse the air and level with  consumers? Emory's resulting "truth in advertising" binge lands him in a loony  bin, but, by accident, his brutally frank prototype ads are printed up and  widely circulated. In the wake of their success, he's hailed as a marketing  genius.  </P> <P> The satire pretty much stops right there, which is a shame. In fact, things get  progressively gooier. Ensconced in his pastoral sanitarium, Emory, along with a  bevy of fellow oddballs, is enlisted by the ad agency's heartless president  (J.T. Walsh) to concoct new "truth" ads -- as uncompensated occupational  therapy. Away from the fast track, Emory learns to appreciate life's simple  pleasures, which include making the cozy acquaintance of a fellow patient  played by the resplendent Daryl Hannah. Going crazy has its compensations.  </P> <P> Mitch Markowitz, who also wrote "Good Morning Vietnam," has come up with some  sharp jabs at Madison Avenue, but the film itself is an example of ad-promo  hard-sell disguised as soft soap. Tony Bill's direction lacks zip -- the  malingering maudlin moments periodically dissolve the screen into a glob of  oleaginous mush. In the scenes with Emory and his cohorts, the filmmakers  promote sentimentality as strenuously as the "heartfelt" commercials they're  satirizing.  </P> <P> Basically, "Crazy People" is yet another variation on the  we're-all-sane-in-here-they're-all-crazy-out-there game plan of, say, "One Flew  Over the Cuckoo's Nest" or, more recently, "The Dream Team." There's something  emotionally satisfying in this sort of set-up no matter how many times it's  played out -- the role reversal confirms a widespread fantasy that we're saner  than the nuts running the show -- but it's also a rigged scenario. It coddles  the mentally ill by turning them into saintly truth-tellers.  </P> <P> Maybe this is why the crazy people in "Crazy People" (rated R for strong  language) are remarkably undifferentiated; they sport their eccentricities, but  since they're basically in the movie for a quick heart tug and a laugh, they  never have a chance to become full-fledged characters. One oldster thinks he's  a TV sitcom writer, another obsesses about Saabs, a black man thinks he's a  macho Latino, and so on. These characters are all set-up and punch-line.  </P> <P> Only Dick Paymer's George, a lost soul who limits his conversations pretty much  to the word hello, registers with any real poignancy. Still, I could easily  have lived without the end-credit sing-along of George's "The Hello Song."  Also, when he's finally airlifted to sanity, anyone wanna guess what word  George blurts out to the big bad doctors?  </P> <P> A number of actual corporate logos are used in the film, and I suppose one  should be grateful that, for a change, the logos aren't employed as the usual  product plugs that routinely garnish our movies. (The ad line for the United  Airlines spot says: "Most of our passengers get there alive.") But the "daring"  of this approach doesn't jibe with the film's overall gloppiness. And the film  doesn't advance its satire by implying that "truth" advertising may actually be  another kind of con, in the same manner as the current "reality" TV. The  filmmakers' attitudes are hopelessly confused, but the confusion is purest  Hollywood, where sincerity and the hard-sell are as twinned as Tweedledee and  Tweedledum.  </P> <P> We're supposed to applaud Emory and his gang for leveling with consumers and  exposing the hypocrisy of advertising. But the aims of their own ad campaigns  are just as mercenary. After all, their ads exist to sell merchandise too. The  sequences where the buying public are shown clamoring to buy the products are  far more cynical than the moviemakers seem to realize. We're meant to be happy  for the new-found admen, those happy-go-lucky band of screwloose innocents, but  the real message seems to be that, in today's media-wise culture, the best way  to put one over on the buying public is to be crazy -- like a fox.  </P> <P> 'CRAZY PEOPLE'  </P> <P> A Paramount Pictures release.

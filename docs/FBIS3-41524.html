			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The German federal government set the targets --  three towns now want to meet them. The towns of Wuppertal,  Remscheid and Solingen have joined forces in a unique  association to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 25 to 30  percent by the year 2005. They intend to develop a CO2  reduction plan jointly at regional level. The project will be  financed largely by the Construction and Housing Ministry of the  land of North Rhine-Westphalia.    The most important sources have been known to science for a  long time: industry, traffic and households. CO2 is also  released when electricity is generated from fossil fuels such as  coal and oil. So energy consumption must be reduced and made  much more efficient. Improved thermal insulation of buildings is  one way of saving energy. Today's modern household appliances  use a lot less power than at the start of the 1970's. Moreover,  using local public transport instead of the car also helps to  cut CO2 emissions.    The three towns' activities will in the future be  coordinated  in a regional office. Initiative, a willingness to talk, and  motivation are now required to bring about a consensus of those  involved in authorities, associations and firms. The project  will show its first results by 1995. Then it will also be clear  where the universe of actions, set by the European Union,  Federal Government, and laender, must be changed to achieve the  great objective of CO2 reduction.    Wuppertal chief executive Joachim Cornelius says: ``The very  fact that this forward-looking project is being tackled in the  three large towns makes me optimistic and can only be of  advantage.'' Many citizens are already wanting to take part.</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. POP BEAT: 'COLD HARD FACTS' JOLT COUNTRY RULES;  </P> <P> ALBUMS: CHRIS GAFFNEY OF COSTA MESA CHALLENGES NASHVILLE CONVENTIONS WITH SONGS  THAT GIVE A TWIST TO WHAT NORMALLY SELLS ON RADIO. AS A RESULT, HE'S PAYINGA  PRICE.  </P> <P> Trying to be different in the world of country music is like trying to be  different in the average schoolyard: As the price of individuality, you might  have to take some lumps.  </P> <P> Chris Gaffney, a singer and bandleader from Costa Mesa, likes to add his own  twists of style and imagination to the usual country sound -- which makes him  suspect in the eyes of Nashville Establishment types looking for music that  conforms to familiar, ready-to-market patterns. In fact, Gaffney has a memo of  rejection from Nashville to prove it.  </P> <P> The memo came last month from a talent scout for one of the major country  labels, who listened to Gaffney's new album at the behest of some of the  singer's West Coast boosters in the music business.  </P> <P> "He needs to get together with some writers that have more commercial writing  experience," the scout opined in a note that Gaffney, who maintains a wry sense  of humor about himself, decided to keep for his personal archives.  </P> <P> "Please remember that in country music we depend ENTIRELY on country radio to  sell our product. If the music isn't commercial enough to be played on radio,  it doesn't do anybody any good."  </P> <P> The memo says a lot about the shriveled artistic ambitions and the smug,  play-it-safe attitude that dog the music industry. It says nothing about the  quality of Gaffney's excellent album.  </P> <P> Issued in January by ROM Records, a small Los Angeles label, "Chris Gaffney  &amp; the Cold Hard Facts" is a vibrant album full of catchy, eminently  hummable songs. Gaffney's music burrows into honky-tonk traditions, then veers  into such stylistic byways as Louisiana zydeco and Mexican folk music, both of  which afford a forum for the singer's sprightly accordion playing. All of this  comes across with an uncommon zest of performance and freshness of lyrical  style.  </P> <P> The difference between Gaffney's songs and the output of the more "commercial"  songwriters laboring in Nashville's hit factories is that nearly everything the  so-called professionals produce is a variation on something we've already heard  before. Gaffney's music is full of detailed, personal observations and offbeat,  challenging phrasings that can take a few hearings to sink in fully. Listening  to it must have been a bewildering experience for a memo-writing music mogul  focusing narrowly on the status quo.  </P> <P> Gaffney and his longtime musical partner, keyboards player Wyman Reese, sounded  undaunted by the kiss-off missive from Nashville during a recent interview at  Gaffney's house in a quiet Costa Mesa subdivision.  </P> <P> "It just thickens your skin a bit," said Gaffney, 39, who has worked in a  Newport Beach boatyard by day for the last nine years while trying to gain a  foothold by night as a honky-tonk contender.  </P> <P> "I think what we do is fairly right-down-the-pipe country, but if you (mess)  around with the lyrics any, they think you're a smartass. Maybe we just have to  hammer them over the head with it for a couple years. We're getting more  acceptance (since the album's release). Now that things have started poppin' a  bit, everything is possible."  </P> <P> Gaffney is a wiry man with tousled hair, a goatee and sharply angled eyebrows  that give his face an ironic cast. As he speaks in a laconic, drawling voice,  the penchant for wordplay evident in his song lyrics spills into his  conversation. Like the boxers he loves to watch on TV, he is always looking for  an opening for a wry verbal jab.  </P> <P> His best verbal sallies come out in such songs as "Glass House," a sad  honky-tonk ballad that is an open tribute to George Jones. Gaffney -- a  flexible singer whose voice can sometimes bear a resemblance to Levon Helm of  the Band -- assumes the distinctive high nasal twang and heartbroken  plaintiveness of Jones' style as he tells the story of a relationship on the  rocks.  </P> <P> "Now my life barely imitates art," muses the song's bereft protagonist, in one  of those wonderful, double-take lines that spins off all sorts of meanings.  </P> <P> On one level, the verse is a nice inside joke for country aficionados: After  all, the entire song is an open imitation of the art of George Jones, whom  Gaffney lists as a key influence, alongside Bob Wills and Ray Price.  </P> <P> On another level, it raises interesting questions about the relationship  between country music and its audience. So much country music is art imitating  life, with songs focusing on what goes on in barrooms, bedrooms, truck stops  and other down-to-earth, everyday situations. Yet many listeners, in a case of  life imitating art, will measure their own experience against the stories and  emotions they glean from a favorite song.  </P> <P> In any case, Gaffney conceded, a line about life barely imitating art isn't  what you'd expect to find in a typically transparent country lyric.  </P> <P> "I don't know if George (Jones) would ever sing something that cerebral,"  Gaffney said. "He might look at 'life barely imitates art' and say, 'What the  hell is this?' "  </P> <P> Not that Gaffney can't tell a straightforward story when he wants to. "The  Gardens" is an effective evocation of a Latino neighborhood living in fear of  drive-by gang shootings (Gaffney said the song is taken straight from a slice  of violent street life he witnessed while living in Hawaiian Gardens). Such  familiar country characters as divorced daddies, jilted lovers and furtive  adulterers also weave their way through the album, brought to life by Gaffney's  gift for the telling, offbeat detail.  </P> <P> Gaffney's wife, Julie, has one complaint: "He won't write a song about me. I've  asked him, I've begged him. I've gotten down on my knees."  </P> <P> But if Gaffney finds no songwriting inspiration from his marriage, that may be  for the best. His songs tend to spring from life's trials and embarrassments  (albeit with an eye toward the humor in those situations), rather than from its  moments of bliss.  </P> <P> "I just never write songs like that," Gaffney said of his wife's request for a  commemorative song of love and devotion. "Am I that gruesome? I'm not really a  professor of doom."  </P> <P> Gaffney was born in Vienna, where his father, a career Army pilot, was  stationed. He did most of his growing up in Arizona and Orange County,  graduating from Western High School in Anaheim, where he split time between  playing in rock bands and devoting himself to track, football and Golden Gloves  boxing.  </P> <P> During his early 20s, he got involved with country musicians during a stay in  Canada and began playing music in the tradition of Wills, Price and Jones. By  25, he was writing songs of his own.  </P> <P> Aside from a brief flirtation with the idea of becoming a high school history  teacher, Gaffney said: "I never thought of anything other than making it in  music. Every other job I've had has been a means to get by" while devoting  himself to writing songs and playing in bands.  </P> <P> Gaffney said his first serious band was the Phantom Herd, which he and Reese  formed after they met in 1977. That band fizzled after a time of popularity on  the club circuit in Newport Beach; Gaffney and Reese resurfaced with the Cold  Hard Facts in 1984. The band -- which also includes Gaffney's brother, Chris,  on bass, drummer Tucker Fleming and guitarists Danny Ott and Rick Shea -- has  had little presence in Orange County, playing mainly in Los Angeles clubs like  the Palomino and the Music Machine.  </P> <P> Gaffney &amp; the Cold Hard Facts began reaching out to the wider world in 1987  with "Road to Indio," a mini-album on their own custom label, Cactus Club  Records. "Chris Gaffney &amp; the Cold Hard Facts" gives them a fine calling  card for major label attention, no matter what Gaffney's memo from Nashville  may say. In what figures to be the band's most important show to date, it will  travel to Austin, Tex., to play March 17 at the South By Southwest Conference,  a music-business gathering where bands can bid for the attention of  journalists, radio programmers and record companies.  </P> <P> "We're just hoping to get somebody bigger interested," Reese said. "It's the  next step. Radio doesn't seem to know it, but people are ready to accept  anything if it's good."  </P> <P> Chris Gaffney &amp; the Cold Hard Facts and Jim Lauderdale play Friday at 10  p.m. at the Breakaway, 11970 Venice Blvd., Los Angeles. Admission: $5.  Information: (213) 397-5078.  </P> <P> </P></p>

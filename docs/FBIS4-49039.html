			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 2 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese  Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said here today that China's economic  development since the policy of reform and opening-up was  adopted in 1979 has drawn worldwide attention and it is  optimistic about its economic performance in both short and long  run.    Speaking at a gathering in Washington D.C. at the invitation  of the U.S.-China Business Council, Zou briefed leaders of the  U.S. business community on China's reform, opening-up and  economic development as they show strong enthusiasm and  expectations for closer economic cooperation with China.    Zhou said that through its efforts for nearly half a  century,  China has established a fairly independent and complete economic  structure. Its economic success, especially since 1979 has  drawn the attention of the world. Compared with 1978, its GDP  in 1993 was nearly 4 times as large, showing an average annual  growth rate of 9.3 percent over the period, making China one of  the fastest growing economies of the world.    After outlining a three-step strategy for China's  modernization drive formulated in the early 80s, Zou described  1993 as a year which saw China's reform, opening-up and  modernization drive move forward vigorously. The gross domestic  product of the year was up by 13.4 percent over the previous  year in comparable prices and it was the highest annual increase  since 1985. High growth has driven reform and opening-up to  speed up, two way trade to expand and overseas investment in  China to soar. In 1992, overseas investment actually used  increased by 160 percent and the figure in 1993 was up by 91.5  percent over 1992. By the end of 1993, China had approved  174,000 overseas invested projects with a contractual value of  217.216 billion U.S. dollars, of which 60.042 billion have been  actually invested. The total volume of China's imports and  exports in 1993 reached 195.8 billion U.S. dollars, of which  imports accounted for about 100 billion dollars.    Zou told the gathering that China is speeding up the  construction of the Pudong New District in Shanghai in order to  turn the city into an international economic, trade, and  financial center and at the same time continuing to stress  agriculture, basic industries, pillar industries and  export-oriented industries and undertaking such large projects  as the three gorges hydropower complex. "These no doubt will  mean more and better investment opportunities for American  businessmen," he said.    The basic goal of China's economic restructuring as decided  at the Chinese Communist Party's 14th National Congress is to  establish a socialist market economy and this is a far-reaching  step in the history of China's reform, he stressed.    The Chinese vice-premier then turned to the major reform  measures of the day, i.e., to transform the operational  mechanisms of state- owned enterprises, nurture and develop a  market system which will play a basic role of allocating  resources under macro-regulation of the state, establish a  network of macro-regulation taking indirect regulation as the  principal means, and institute a multi-tiered social security  system.    He assured the American businessmen that China will keep  unswervingly to the policy of opening-up to the outside world.  He quoted Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform,  as saying that "China's open policy will not change for this  century, nor the first or second 50 years of the next century.  It is hard for anyone to attempt at a change. China's door is  sure to open even wider and we will do a better job."    An all-directional pattern of openness linking the coast  with  the hinterland across China is taking shape, Zou said, and "we  are ready to develop economic and technological cooperation and  exchanges with all friendly countries and people from all walks  of life on the basis of equality and mutual benefit."    Cooperation can take many forms, he continued. "Trade with  us is certainly welcome. But we also hope to see more business  people with acumen come to China to invest and set up their own  factories, to enter into partnership with Chinese enterprises,  or to transfer technology and explore China's market."    He listed energy, transportation, telecommunications,  agriculture and water conservancy as the areas where China would  like to see more investors put their money now and in the years  to come.    Referring to the problems which were created along with the  economic boom, Zou stated that the Chinese Government introduced  last June a series of measures aimed at tightening and improving  macro-regulation. These timely measures yielded quick and  positive results. The financial order and the order in the  field of circulation improved markedly and the signs of an  economic overheating have been brought under control.    "At the present, our market is steady, society stable and  people contented. We are convinced that with our efforts,  socialist market economy will take root in our country and our  economy will continue to enjoy a high and healthy growth for a  considerably long time to come," he said.</p>

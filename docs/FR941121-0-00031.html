For example, stating ``one month's dividends'' is permissible, whether the credit union assesses 30 days' dividends during the month of April, or selects a time period between 28 and 31 days for calculating the dividends for all early withdrawals regardless of when the penalty is assessed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(6)(iv) Renewal Policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Rollover term share accounts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Credit unions are not required to provide a grace period, to pay dividends during the grace period, or to disclose whether or not dividends will be paid during the grace period. Credit unions offering a grace period on term share accounts must give the length of the grace period.

If the minimum balance or time requirement is otherwise required to be disclosed, credit unions need not duplicate the disclosure for purposes of this paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(8) Nature of Dividends  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dividends are not payable until declared and unless sufficient current and undivided earnings are available after required transfers to reserves at the close of a dividend period. A disclosure explaining dividends educates members and protects credit unions in the event that a prospective dividend cannot be paid, or is not properly payable. This disclosure is required for all dividend-bearing share accounts. Term share accounts need not include a statement regarding the nature of dividends.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> State-chartered credit unions with interest-bearing deposit accounts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> State law controls the nature of accounts (i.e., whether an account is a share account or a deposit account). If a member of a state-chartered credit union is opening only an interest-bearing deposit account, or is requesting account disclosures only for an interest-bearing deposit account (if state law requires the depositor to hold a share account), the disclosures must generally include the following information on any dividend-bearing share portion of the account (e.g., membership share): the par value of a share; a statement that the portion of the deposit that represents the par value of the membership share will earn dividends, and that dividends are paid from current income and available earnings after required transfers to reserves. Further additional disclosures, such as a separate dividend rate and annual percentage yield for the membership share, are not required (if the additional disclosures would agree with the remainder of the account which is invested in an interest-bearing deposit).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Notice to Existing Accountholders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Only members who receive periodic statements (provided regularly at least four times per year) and who hold accounts of the type offered by the credit union as of the compliance date of part 707 (generally January 1, 1995) must receive the notice. If following receipt of the notice members request disclosures, credit unions have twenty calendar days from receipt of the request to provide the disclosures. Rate and annual percentage yield information in such disclosures must conform to that required for disclosures upon request. As an alternative to including the notice in or on the periodic statement, the final rule permits credit unions to send the account disclosures themselves, as long as they are sent at the same time as the periodic statement (the disclosures may be mailed either with the periodic statement or separately).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Form of the notice.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The notice may be included on the periodic statement, in a member newsletter, or on a statement stuffer or other insert, if it is clear and conspicuous. The notice cannot be sent in a separate mailing from the periodic statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Timing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The notice may accompany the first periodic statement after the compliance date for part 707, or the periodic statement for the first cycle beginning after that date. For example, a credit union's statement cycle is December 15, 1994-January 14, 1995. The statement is mailed on January 15, The next cycle is January 15, 1995 through February 14, 1995, and the statement for that cycle is mailed on February 15. The credit union may provide the notice either on or with the January 15 statement or on or with the February 15 statement, as it covers the first cycle after January 1, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Early compliance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Credit unions that provide the notice to existing members prior to the compliance date of part 707, must be prepared to provide accurate and timely disclosures when, following receipt of the notice, members ask for account disclosures. Such disclosures must be provided even if they are requested before the compliance date of part 707. Credit unions who provide early notice to existing members need to comply with other aspects of part 707, but need not provide disclosures already provided in compliance with part 707.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Section 707.5_Subsequent Disclosures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Change in Terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)(1) Advance Notice required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / De Klerk tries for special deal with Buthelezi THE South African government was last night struggling to persuade Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, to return to constitutional negotiations after a three-month absence. President F W de Klerk and most of his cabinet met Chief Buthelezi and senior officials of Inkatha and the KwaZulu black homeland whose government Chief Buthelezi leads. Government officials said they would offer the Inkatha leader special powers for Natal province, his political base, including control of an autonomous police force as well as possibly a limited military force or home guard. Natal may be allowed to adopt its own regional constitution before national elections next year, though this document would have to conform to the national constitution now under debate in multi-party democracy talks. Government officials believe it is essential that Chief Buthelezi accept the constitutional deal which will eventually emerge from these talks. This could be achieved without his party returning to the multi-party table. The Inkatha leader has recently returned from Germany and the UK where he came under heavy pressure to moderate his demand for autonomy in Natal. Officials played down expectations of a breakthrough at last night's talks, but said they hoped to lay the basis for an eventual deal. Meanwhile an official of the African National Congress said the ANC president, Mr Nelson Mandela, would ask the United Nations to remove sanctions against South Africa when he addresses the General Assembly next week. Mr Stanley Mabizela said Mr Mandela would call for the repeal of all remaining sanctions except those against arms sales. Previously, ANC officials had insisted that the international oil embargo must also remain. Parliament yesterday began debate on the first of four transition laws that will give blacks a share of power for the first time.</p>

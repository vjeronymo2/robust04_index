			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hector Adorno Ruiz] </F>   [Excerpts] The "capo" of the drug traffic in Mexico, Miguel  Angel Felix Gallardo, was found guilty of the murders of DEA  [Drug Enforcement Administration] agent Enrique Camarena Salazar  and the Mexican pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, of crimes against  health in the form of cocaine trafficking, and of illegal  deprivation of freedom. He was sentenced to the maximum term of  40 years in prison by the fourth district judge of criminal  proceedings of the National Supreme Court, assigned to  Guadalajara, Jalisco.    In his decision, the administrator of justice in the federal  jurisdiction found Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo to have acted  with the aggravating circumstances of premeditation and  advantage in the kidnapping and murder of the DEA agent,  Camarena Salazar, and the Mexican aviator-pilot, Alfredo Zavala  Avelar.    At the conclusion of the criminal proceedings lasting nine  years, the federal judge also found the implicated subject,  considered the "czar of cocaine in Mexico" and the "drug traffic  `capo' in Mexico" before his arrest in April 1989, guilty of  crimes against health. The latter were in the forms of  clandestine entry, illegal export, collection, purchase and  sale, and storage of large amounts of cocaine. Hence, he decided  to impose the maximum penalty stipulated in the Federal Code of  Criminal Procedures at the time that the federal social  representative brought penal action against him.    Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo was informed of the sentence  associated with proceedings 82/85 inside the Federal Maximum  Security Center where he has been confined since 1992. He was  transferred there from the Southern Crime Prevention Prison,  where he had been held since 1989, following his arrest at a  residence in the Chapalita subdivision of Guadalajara, Jalisco.    The notification procedure was carried out based on letters  requisitorial from the Jalisco federal judge sent to his  counterpart in Mexico State, so that the hearing might be  established and held in the federal maximum security prison.  [passage omitted]    If the sentence should be appealed, the trial against the  implicated subject will be continued in the pertinent court with  several judges, and the magistrates who are members of that body  will be the ones to issue the pertinent decision, with which  both parties may also express dissent.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CONNORS STARTS FAST, BUT IS FINISHED OFF  </P> <P> In the end, Jimmy Connors acted his age.  </P> <P> Teen-ager Jim Courier defeated Connors, a last-minute replacement for ailing  Stefan Edberg of Sweden, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, Thursday in the first round of the  $154,000 Hamlet Challenge Cup at Jericho, N.Y.  </P> <P> For Connors, whose record 107 victories include five U.S. Opens, it was his  first match since Wimbledon.  </P> <P> "I felt I hit the ball pretty well considering I haven't played in a while," he  said. "I'm in pretty good physical shape and I just want three or four more  days of practice before the Open next week and I'll be ready."  </P> <P> Connors, No. 15 in world rankings, replaced Edberg, ranked third, when Edberg  withdrew because of hives.  </P> <P> The 19-year-old Courier wasn't born when Connors, who turns 37 next week,  played in his first U.S. Open.  </P> <P> "He was the greatest player in the game when I started getting interested in  tennis," Courier said. "I try to emulate his 'never-say-die' attitude in a  match."  </P> <P> Courier won the first four games of the second set to get back into the match,  then won the last four games of the final set as Connors ran out of gas.  </P> <P> In other matches, unseeded Jonas Svensson of Sweden upset eighth-seeded Yannick  Noah of France, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (8-6); Robert Seguso needed just 56 minutes to  defeat Carl Uwe-Steeb of West Germany, 6-2, 6-4, and sixth-seeded Andrei  Chesnokov of the Soviet Union beat Jimmy Arias, 7-5, 6-4.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Martina Navratilova beat No. 9 Helen Kelesi, 6-3, 6-3, and  second-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina beat Barbara Paulus, 7-5, 6-0, and  advanced to the quarterfinals of the Canadian Women's Open at Toronto.  </P> <P> In other matches, Nana Miyagi of Japan upset No. 12 Radka Zrubatova of  Czechoslovakia, 3-6, 7-5, 7-5; fifth-seeded Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia  routed Donna Faber, 6-0, 6-0; No. 15 Sylvia Hanika of West Germany defeated  Jana Pospisilova of Czechoslovakia, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5); Anne Minter of  Australia beat Catherine Suire of France, 6-2, 6-2; No. 10 Nathalie Tauziat of  France beat Ann Grossman, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, and fourth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez of  Spain eliminated Louise Field of Australia, 6-1, 6-2.  </P></p>

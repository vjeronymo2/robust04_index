			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cristiane Ribeiro in Rio de Janeiro] </F>   [Text] President Itamar Franco said the approval of the URV  [Real Value Unit] Provisional Measure will allow the government  to continue its program to combat inflation. Upon leaving the  Gloria Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, President Itamar Franco said  national congressmen demonstrated maturity by approving  Provisional Measure No. 482, which creates the URV, on 18 May.  According to the president, it was an important step forward for  the Brazilian economy's stabilization. Itamar Franco said this  economic plan has not been imposed from top to bottom but was  debated by the whole society, especially with the national  Congress, which suggested almost 50 amendments. This is why the  provisional measure will yield what we all want: curbing  inflation.    [Begin Franco recording] It would be very easy for my  administration, or the end of my administration, to abandon our  efforts to curb inflation. It would be very easy to let the next  president carry out this work. We still want to combat inflation  during this administration. Congress' approval, last night, was  very important and very significant. [end recording]    The president did not want to comment on Congress' dismissal  of Deputy Ibsen Pinheiro during the same Congress session that  approved Provisional Measure No. 482. According to the  president, this subject pertains only to Congress.</p>

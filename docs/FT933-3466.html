			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / London Tecs ranked as worst performers TRAINING and enterprise councils in London have been ranked among the worst performers of the 75 Tecs in England. The results come in the first published league tables on the employer-led bodies' relative performance. Essex Tec was the worst performing. The tables do not cover the full range of Tec activities and group the Tecs into four tables, or quartiles, to show how effectively they have spent the Pounds 1.7bn provided by the government for training schemes in 1992-93. The Tecs are judged by seven criteria of cost and performance. The government hopes that publication of the tables will encourage directors and staff in the worst-performing Tecs to achieve the performance of the best. Significant variations between Tecs have been highlighted. Dorset Tec appeared in the top quartile for six out of seven of the tables covering cost-effectiveness and quality of provision for Youth Training and Employment Training, the scheme for unemployed adults, and the number of companies committed to Investors in People, a scheme to improve the training of people in work. Other high-performing Tecs included Barnsley and Doncaster, Metrotec in Wigan and Camtec in Cambridge. Essex Tec was alone in appearing in the bottom group of all seven tables, closely followed by those from London. Tecs, while welcoming publication of the indicators, said they should be treated with caution, not least because they did not reflect areas of enterprise and economic development. The Department of Employment has admitted that the league tables are only a rough guide, as they have not been weighted to reflect local unemployment rates or the impact of the recession on the south of England. In addition some of the measures are not very precise. However, the department said that the tables did give some indication of the quality of management in Tecs with similar labour markets. It is understood to have dismissed a ranking of one to 75 as inaccurate. Miss Ann Widdecombe, the employment minister, said: 'Exhaustive comparisons are not possible from these tables. For example, they do not measure value added, and they are not adjusted to take into account comparative labour markets.' Tecs in Wales and their Scottish equivalents - Local Enterprise Companies - have not been included.  ---------------------------------         The top 10 Tecs  --------------------------------- Barnsley and Doncaster Camtec (Cambridge) Dorset Gloucestershire Hawtec (Hereford &amp; Worcester) Lincolnshire Metrotec (Wigan) South and East Cheshire Sussex Wiltshire  ---------------------------------</p>

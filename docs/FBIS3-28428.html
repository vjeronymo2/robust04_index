This is a brazen interference in the internal affairs of our  country and an intolerable insult to the socialist system of our  style centering on the popular masses.    The DPRK Government, which regards it as its immovable  policy to value man and respect his rights, substantially  provides genuine freedom and rights to all citizens and  creditably ensures their abundant and happy life.    The United States came out with the fiction of "violation of  human rights in North Korea", blatantly distorting the stark  reality. This is a crafty ruse to impair the image of our  republic and isolate us.    This clearly proves that the United States is intensifying  the propaganda offensive in every way to slander our republic,  while laying artificial hurdles in the way of the DPRK-USA talks  for a fundamental solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula and rendering the situation extremely strained.    If one wants to talk about the chief violator of human  rights and the barren land of human rights, he must cite the  United States and South Korea.    If the United States, keeping silent about this, attempts to  decry the advantages and invincible might of the socialist  system of our style centering on the popular masses with a  silly talk, it is a mistake.    The United States must immediately stop its anti-DPRK and  anti-socialist propaganda over the "human rights issue" of the  DPRK, a disgusting product of its reactionary strategy.</p>

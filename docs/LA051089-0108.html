			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEACH RETURNS TO RANGERS AFTER 24-HOUR ABSENCE  </P> <P> Rick Leach returned to the Texas Rangers Tuesday night after a 24-hour absence,  during which he was issued a summons for possessing a small amount of  marijuana.  </P> <P> Leach refused to answer specific questions about his disappearance, his second  in three seasons.  </P> <P> "Basically, right now it's a personal problem that will be handled between me  and the team," Leach said before the Rangers' game against the New York  Yankees. "That's all I have to say about it. I don't feel good about it. I  talked to the players on the team and that was a tough thing to do."  </P> <P> Leach contacted the team at about 2:30 p.m. Tuesday and arrived at Yankee  Stadium about five hours later, minutes before game time. He did not start, but  was in uniform and on the bench.  </P> <P> A missing persons report had been filed Tuesday for Leach.  </P> <P> "We're very happy Rick Leach is OK, but we're disappointed he missed a game,"  Ranger General Manager Tom Grieve said. "That's a problem and there will be  disciplinary action."  </P> <P> The criminal summons was issued to Leach after police and security personnel at  the Grand Hyatt Hotel found a package of marijuana when they searched his room  for clues as to his whereabouts, police spokesman Sgt. John Clifford said. The  package contained less than an ounce of marijuana and appeared to be for  personal use, Clifford said.  </P> <P> While a member of the Toronto Blue Jays, Leach disappeared in Seattle from Aug.  25-27, 1987, after having an argument with his wife Angie.  </P></p>

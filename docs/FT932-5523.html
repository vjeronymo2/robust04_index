			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Gone bananas THE EUROPEAN Community's single market was supposed to bring lower prices and greater competition. But for one commodity - bananas - the programme is going wrong. Unless challenges to the new banana regime - by Germany in the European Court and by Latin American countries in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - succeed, European consumers will end up paying far more than is necessary for their bananas. Germany, the EC's largest consumer of bananas, estimates that prices will be 70 per cent above free-market levels. The regime, due to come into effect at the start of July, uses a tangle of protectionist instruments: tight quotas for imports of cheap bananas from Latin America, a share-out of quotas among importers, and punitive tariffs on imports in excess of quotas. The aim of the regime, promoted in particular by the UK, France and Spain, is to protect their traditional suppliers in former colonies such as the Windward Islands and Jamaica, and in overseas territories such as Martinique, Guadeloupe and the Canary Islands. These growers of 'Eurobananas' sell their crop for almost twice the price of Latin American growers of 'dollar-bananas'. Bananas are currently protected by a patchwork of national restrictions, doomed by the single market. There were fears that Eurobanana growers would be driven out of business, without the protection provided by the new EC-wide regime. But the EC is committed to protecting banana producers under its Lome convention with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. Forget, for a moment, that the new regime makes a mockery of the single market programme. Forget also that, in trying to help one group of developing countries, the policy will harm another. Even on its stated goal of helping traditional suppliers, the regime is defective. It encourages continued dependency on a crop where they have no long-term viability, because they will only receive support if they produce bananas. Moreover, only a small fraction of the extra money paid by consumers will go to banana growers, with the lion's share inflating the profits of banana importers. The right policy would be to encourage growers of Eurobananas to diversify. Prices in EC markets should be lowered towards world market levels. Meanwhile, growers of Eurobananas should be compensated for the difference between the prices they can expect under the EC plan and world prices, irrespective of whether they produce bananas. Ideally, the money would be raised through general taxes. An alternative would be a low tariff on all banana sales. Such a policy would be in the long-term interests of Eurobanana growers. It would also open up the market to dollar-banana growers and drive down prices paid by Europe's banana eaters.</p>

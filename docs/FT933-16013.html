			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Creighton's improves 7% to Pounds 1m PROFITS of Creighton's Naturally, the USM-quoted creator and maker of natural health and beauty products, rose from Pounds 934,000 to Pounds 1m pre-tax for the year to end-March. The shares responded via a 14p rise to 170p. The 7 per cent profits improvement was scored in spite a fall in turnover to Pounds 8.52m (Pounds 10.2m). The directors blamed the sales fall on the depressed domestic market. However, expansion overseas resulted in exports to the US exceeding Pounds 1m. More than of a quarter of group production is now exported. Earnings rose to 13.9p (13.1p) and a proposed rise in the final dividend to 5.2p makes a 7.3p (7p) total.</p>

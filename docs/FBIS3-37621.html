			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baku, February 21 (TURAN) -- The situation in  eastern Georgia for the Azeri population has become aggravated.  According to the Georgian correspondent for TURAN, conditions  vis-a-vis Georgia's Azeri population worsened following a  January 30, 1994 incident when armed Armenian terrorists killed  three Azeris in the Tezekend village in the Bolnisskiy region of  Georgia which borders Armenia.    According to the same source, last week bandits attacked and  robbed the home of Mamed Guliyev, a resident in the Gyzyl-Hajyly  village.    Around the same time, unknown individuals fired at two buses  riding along the Baku-Marneulinskiy route from a bridge over the  Khrami River in the Marneulinskiy region of Georgia.    The society, "Ozan", supporting the interests of the Azeri  community in Georgia, demanded that local authorities punish the  criminals. Judging by the political and social conditions in  Georgia, this appeal, like the previous ones, will not likely be  answered.</p>

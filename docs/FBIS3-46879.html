			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["News Conference" held by President Kim Yong-sam with </F> foreign and domestic reporters at the Chongwadae presidential  offices in Seoul -- live]    [Text] [President Kim] Now I am pleased to receive  questions from you reporters.    [Choe Kyu-sik, HANGUK ILBO reporter] I have learned that  during recent negotiations with the United States, North Korea  said that it would only accept one inspection of its seven  nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA]. Can you clearly explain what actual progress has been  made in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and whether we  conceded to the North on our side's earlier demands for  North-South mutual nuclear inspections?    [President Kim] Concerning the North Korean nuclear issue at  this point, I would like to clearly state that the issue of the  ROK's security and North Korea's nuclear issue were discussed  intensively last July with U.S. President Clinton. In  particular, they were discussed in depth during last November's  summit, and the two nations have reached complete agreement on  these issues.    Since that time, 24-hour-long contacts, including telephone  calls with President Clinton to discuss problems, have been  constantly maintained throughout ongoing negotiations between  North Korea and the United States. Even before the United  States began dialogue with North Korea, it exchanged views with  the ROK, and it has kept us informed of results since the  dialogue began. I especially want to clarify at this point the  fact that the United States is completely respecting ROK will.    You mentioned a one-time nuclear inspection. The issue of  nuclear inspections is not an issue between the United States  and North Korea but a matter of discussion between the IAEA and  North Korea. Because of the delicacy of this issue, I will  refrain from providing further details such as what issues were  discussed between the two sides. The only thing I can tell you  is that discussions will be held in Vienna between a North  Korean ambassador and the IAEA. Negotiations have yet to begin,  however, as the North Korean side claims that it has yet to  receive precise directives.    In conclusion, the ROK and the United States are in  agreement  that ultimately, mutual inspections between the North and the  South should be conducted. I believe that these inspections  will be realized without fail.    You reporters talk as though North-South dialogue has been  ignored. This is not true. I want you, reporters, to know that  the United States and the ROK agree that inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, and the North-South  dialogue must take place simultaneously, without fail.    [Kim Hong, KBS reporter] In recent contacts between the  United States and North Korea, the North Korean side put forward  a package deal proposal. People are under the impression that  the United States was dragged into the North Korean side's plan  to settle the nuclear problem, establishment of diplomatic  relations between the United States and North Korea, and the  issue of the Team Spirit exercise in a package deal.    Could you explain the government's position on the issue of  the establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea  and the United States and between North Korea and Japan?    [President Kim] The package deal solution phrase was not  used by the United States, but by the North Korean side.    As for the issue of Team Spirit, it is very sensitive, so I  will refrain from talking on this issue at this time. While I  will not elaborate on this issue as negotiations are ongoing, I  would like to clearly state that by all means, this is an issue  that the ROK will decide.    North Korea's establishment of diplomatic relations with the  United States and Japan was agreed upon between the ROK and the  United States in discussions with President Clinton last  November. Since there is plenty of time, and establishment of  diplomatic relations is not an issue that should be hastily  discussed, I think we had better not discuss this issue in  detail here.    [Cho Chong-min, MBC reporter] Let me continue the  question. My question is about North-South relations. I  remember it was on 27 December last year. During lunch with  reporters that day, you said that North-South relations would  improve considerably this year [1994]. However, North Korea's  President Kim Il-song did not mention North-South relations in  his New Year's address. Moreover, North Korea's denunciation of  our government and president has increased recently. What are  your prospects for North-South relations, including North-South  summit talks? Do you see any likelihood for actual progress in  North-South relations this year?    [President Kim] You should know that North Korea is not  always consistent in what it says. North Korea said previously  that it would never contact the United States and called for the  withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea. Nevertheless, North  Korea is now holding dialogue with the United States. North  Korea tends never to announce anything that may be detrimental  to it. For instance, as you know, when announcing the results  of U.S.-North Korean negotiations, North Korea deleted many  portions and did not mention North-South relations. If you knew  these facts, you would know not to accept everything North Korea  says at face value.    Regarding North-South summit talks, however, I think it is  necessary for us to abort our past way of thinking. In other  words, I want to stress that we should not hold summit talks  with North Korea only for the sake of holding summit talks. I  have held summit talks on numerous occasions with foreign heads  of state. Last year alone, I held summit talks with leaders of  foreign countries on 20 occasions. So there is no reason for me  not to be able to hold summit talks with North Korea's President  Kim Il-song. In order to hold summit talks, however, some  problems should be solved. Let me repeat again that I will not  hold summit talks only to hold summit talks. In the past,  people thought that summit talks would solve everything. You  are aware of the problems that we have pointed out. I will not  make concessions on these issues for summit talks with North  Korea.    [Yun Chang-chun, SEGYE ILBO reporter] When you reshuffled  the cabinet and major positions in the ruling party last year,  some people criticized your choice of so many of your close  confidants. Former Minister of Political Affairs Kim Tok-yong,  one of your close confidants, has stepped down and has no  official post now. What is your opinion on the assessment of  former Minister for Political Affairs Kim Tok-yong by political  circles? Also, what do you say to criticism that you have  chosen many close confidants?    [President Kim] That's a tough question. [laughs] The  criteria I used in the reshuffle of personnel were the person's  will to achieve reforms, clean and honest character, and  ability. No matter how able one may be, one should be clean and  honest and diligent. Ability is not everything. When one has  the firm will to serve the country and the nation, one can  demonstrate one's ability. Of course, some of the appointees to  cabinet and party posts shared arduous and protracted political  lives with me as part of the opposition. However, I am well  aware of their character and ability. I have chosen them  because I believe that they are exceedingly able to work hard,  have the firm will for reforms, and have a clean and honest  character. Regarding your question about Assemblyman Kim  Tok-yong, I have been in contact with and known him for over 25  years. We were together in extremely arduous times. There is no  change in my affection for him.    Lawmaker Kim Tok-yong held the position of minister of  state for political affairs. However, I believe that it will be  good for him to rest for a while. Also, I believe that from  various aspects, he will be able to sufficiently carry out the  role of executive member of our Democratic Liberal Party [DLP].  I believe this will be of help to him. There is no change in  my affection for him.    [Song Yong-on, TONG-A ILBO reporter] Mr. President, you have  stated that Seoul will not be divided for the upcoming election  of heads of regional administrative offices. However, I believe  that problems remain in relegating the central government's  direct control over special cities to provinces, dividing  Kyonggi Province, and integrating cities and counties. What is  your position on this?    [President Kim] I asked that since an election will be held  one and a half years from now, we avoid talking about this issue  if possible. I would like to point out that I don't feel any  need to talk about this matter now. As I said in response to  your questions on many previous occasions, I will walk the right  path. We do not have to think that elections will be carried  out by dividing regions. Elections will be carried out in a  fair way.    [Kim Song-su, YONHAP reporter] There is still time before  the DLP's national convention which is slated for May.  Following the reorganization of the party's administration, the  leadership system now centers around Executive Chairman Kim  Chong-pil. Will there be any change in this leadership system  before May? Can you give us your view on this matter?    [President Kim] Contrary to newpaper reports, I have not  commented on this matter to date. Ten months have passed since  the inauguration of the civilian-led government. Of my five  years in office, this year will be the only one without  elections. Thus, this is the year when various work must be  conducted to resolve difficult issues. We must revive the  economy, structurally improve and save the farms, and win in  world competition.    As you all know, I have been a politician for a long time. A  lot of money and manpower must be spent in order to hold a  national party convention or meeting to reorganize district  party chapters. The United States, one of the advanced countries  and the world's most powerful country, holds a national party  convention every four years when it designates a presidential  candidate.    Slated for May, our DLP national convention is convened by  the party president. So, if necessary, the president has the  right to ask the standing committee to change the timing of the  national party convention. If the standing committee adopts  this request, the national party convention may not be held.    If the national party convention is to be held in May, the  district party chapter must be reorganized in February, the  provincial party convention must be held in March, and the  national party convention must be held in May. Tens of  thousands of people have to be gathered together. Is there a  real need to hold such a political event this year? I believe  that we should consider this matter deeply for our nation's  future.    If we hold a national party convention, we will have to once  again reshuffle the executive members of the party who were  appointed just a few days ago. Do you think it is appropriate  to reorganize important party positions in under four months?    I do not think this is possible. I think that Executive  Chairman Kim Chong-pil, in assuming actual power, has managed  the party well so far. I hope Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil  will assume strong leadership to responsibly lead the party.    I have told all the ministers of the cabinet to unite around  the prime minister. I have told each ministry of the cabinet to  stop pursuing only its own interests. I have also told the  prime minister that he must responsibly supervise each ministry.    I have entrusted Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil with every  right and responsibility.    [CHOSON ILBO reporter Kim Chang-ki] Many people have pointed  out that you, Mr. President, rely too heavily on private  channels, instead of official channels, in deciding on major  policies, selecting government officials, and tapping public  opinion. Would you comment on this?    [President Kim] I listen to the opinion of various people.  I listen to people's opinions through both private and official  channels. I also receive reports from various government  offices. When selecting people for government offices, I fully  examine candidates. I do not expect to get a perfect score each  time. Not everybody is satisfied with what I have done. I  don't think that you should be too concernced about this matter,  though.    The presidency is a lonely and painful job. A president must  make resolute decisions on numerous issues. Many people even  tell me that while I smiled frequently and appeared bright  before becoming president, I now appear grim. I may have  overexerted myself worrying about the hazards of cold weather  this summer and floods from heavy rainfall. Everyday, I worry  about numerous things. I hope you understand that I appear grim  for this reason. I also hope you understand that I do not make  hasty decisions. My decisions are made after extensive  deliberation.    [Unidentified foreign reporter, in English] At the last  press conference, you said that the DPRK's nuclear development  was the biggest obstacle to inter-Korean confidence. So if the  nuclear problem is solved, do you think that trust can be built  between the North and South? And, what concrete measures will  your government take to improve bilateral relations? Thank you.    [President Kim] I have various plans in mind. We are  mapping out plans now. Since negotiations are now being held on  this matter, however, I think not elaborating on this issue now  will benefit negotiations. I hope you understand.    [Kim Hyon-il, CHUNGANG ILBO reporter] There are many  people, except those from the so-called Democratic Faction, who  say that you, the president, are a tough person [musopta]. What  do you think about this?    In addition, I hear that there are indications that the  party  congress may not be held in May. Will you please explain your  idea of intraparty harmony in relation to the continuation of  Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil's system?    [President Kim] It seems that people are inclined to  describe me as a tough man because I carried out many tough  things during the era of confrontation between democratic and  antidemocratic forces.    I am not a tough but a soft man.    Since very capable officials, including Executive Chairman  Kim Chong-pil, were elected recently to key party positions, I  am confident of the satisfactory and harmonious operation of the  party in future, as well.    [Kim Chung-il, KYONGHYANG SINMUN reporter] Mr. President,  you said that you would go anywhere in the world for the nation.  Yet, you have not visited the three neighboring countries.  Will you elaborate on plans to visit foreign countries like  these three countries and what work will you conduct during your  visits?    [President Kim] As I stated in my opening remarks, when  Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa visited our country some time  ago, he extended an official invitation for me to visit. At the  time, I pledged that I would visit Japan within this year  without fail.    Were the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] summit not  held last year, I would not have gone overseas. However, since  an important APEC summit was held, and considering the great  significance of such a summit, I went overseas and also held a  ROK-U.S. summit during the visit.    I will fulfill the pledge I made to Prime Minister Hosokawa.  After discussing an appropriate time through diplomatic  channels, I will decide on a time for the visit.    I think it would be better not to elaborate on visits to  other countries at this time.    [Edward Paisley, FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW reporter] Mr.  President, high wages in South Korea are one of the problems  facing Korea's international competitiveness. The Korean Trade  Union congress, which represents hundreds of thousands of  workers but it is still illegal in Korea, has offered to lower  its wages and benefit demands in exchange for recognition and  non-wage concessions from management. Your government has  rejected this approach in 1993. Will you reconsider this in  1994 in light of wage growth of 13 percent in 1993?    [President Kim] As I stated earlier, the most important goal  this year is to enhance international competitiveness. Facing  an era of internationalization, we should win in the economic  war without fail. The most important factor to winning is  cooperation between management and workers. I want to emphasize  this point.    Of course, as mentioned earlier, there are various  organizations under labor unions. Also, there are many people  who give priority to the interest of the nation, which must be  highly considered even at this moment. I attended the New  Year's ceremony held by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry on  5 January and had dialogues with businessmen. There I met many  businessmen from the thirty large enterprises since the  financial real-name transaction system was adopted last year and  said to them: Changes have taken place in our business circles'  past habits. For example, frankly speaking, the businessmen  gave money to rulers in the past, but I, during my tenure, will  never accept money, not even a penny, from anyone. Therefore,  the businessmen must use the money they want to give me to  promote investment in enterprises, to improve technology, and to  enhance workers' welfare.    In the second half of last year, our enterprises made  all-out  efforts to gain a trade surplus. The correct statistics  regarding this issue can be announced around next month, but, as  of today, this surplus amount is estimated to be approximately  $2.0 billion, and the current account surplus approximately $200  million. For the first time in four years, we could gain this  surplus.    Regarding the wage issue, as mentioned earlier, I believe  that this issue can be satisfactorily resolved between  consultations between workers and owners this year as well.    In raising international competitiveness this year, most  important is to improve technology, to achieve harmony between  workers and owners, and to expand social indirect capital. It  is also important to boldly lift various restrictions that block  the development of the country. By doing so, we are going to  seek the revitalization of the economy. The issue of harmony  between workers and owners is very important in revitalizing the  economy. Because of this, I told businessmen to hold dialogues  with workers from now on regarding the labor issue in stead of  holding dialogues with them when the issue becomes serious as  was done in last year. As a result, dialogues between workers  and owners are now very active.    There are some people who worry over the labor dispute this  year, but I believe that this issue can be resolved through  dialogues. I believe, therefore, that it is possible to resolve  the issue when we concentrate all efforts and wisdom on its  settlement.    [Unidentified Japanese reporter] I have a question for you  regarding the nuclear issue. I feel that you seem to avoid  giving concrete answers regarding the nuclear issue by saying  that it is now under discussion or it is a delicate issue. I  believe that many countries are interested in and keep an eye on  the nuclear issue. Your Excellency President Kim said that a  sign of changes have been shown in North Korea even now while  you are delivering your speech. We wonder, however, if changes  are really taking place in North Korea. You also said that you  can not accept President Kim Il-song's speech as it is, and that  one should see things behind the contents. I would appreciate  it if you could specifically explain what kinds of changes are  taking place in North Korea and where the source came from.    [President Kim] Thank you. I repeat to you once again. As  of this moment, for example, as of this morning, various  negotiations between the United States and North Korea are  underway. As I stated before, I would like to stress, however,  that this does not mean that the ROK is excluded from  negotiations, and that its intentions are respected. After  consulting with the ROK, the United States is holding dialogues  with North Korea. Even North Korea knows it. North Korea does  not think that the United States holds dialogue with it,  ignoring the ROK's intentions. North Korea knows that the  United States holds dialogue with it after consulting with the  ROK. I believe that the contents of negotiations, which were  held as of this morning, must not be disclosed. Therefore, I  hope for your understanding. I will say, however, progress is  being made in negotiations.    [Kim Song-pok, KOREA TIMES reporter] Recently, in  connection with easing regulations in the economic field, the  economic circle is saying that regulations must be completely  abolished. What is your view on this matter?    [President Kim] Our government's policy is to ease  regulations to the utmost so that the people can freely carry  out business activities. We will work to ease regulations to  the utmost.    [Adrian Edwards, BBC News reporter] About the North Korean  nuclear situation again. It appears we are moving toward a  stage of some limited nuclear inspections being accepted by  North Korea. Would you view limited inspection as a resolution  of the issue or would it have to go much further?    [President Kim] As I have said before, the nuclear  inspection issue is an issue to be resolved between North Korea  and the IAEA. IAEA's position on this matter is very strong. I  as well as the IAEA think that holding inspection superficially  has little significance. Therefore, I believe that we cannot  reach a conclusion on this matter at this stage.    [Chon Yong-hak, Seoul Broadcasting Service reporter] A price  hike centered on public utility charges is notable from the  beginning of this year. Amid this kind of price instability, do  you think that the economy can be activated and that there will  be no labor-management dispute?    [President Kim] Our public utility charge is the most  inexpensive in the world. There are many problems because we  did not raise the public utility charge for a long time. One of  the most important goals in our policy for this year is to  achieve price stability. If there is no price stability,  nothing can be achieved. I have already ordered that work be  carried out to stabilize prices. Each matter regarding price  stability will be worked out in detail. I believe that achieving  price stability is an important yardstick in reviving the  economy this year.    [Kim Se-hyong, MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN reporter] Recently,  there are moves to reduce the organization at some ministries.  Is this related with the plan to form a small government which  you talked about during the presidential election? Also, to  what degree will this be extended? Can you give us your view on  this matter?    [President Kim] What is most important for us is to adapt to  change. If we follow work that was carried out 20-30 years ago,  this will be a great problem. As the world changes, we must  also change. We will never be able to win in an era of  unlimited competition if we remain unchanged. Therefore, we  must prudently examine this matter and decide on how we will  deal with it after viewing what is truly good for the people and  what is efficient.    [Ko To-won, CHUNGANG KYONGJE SINMUN reporter] Whenever you  had the opportunity you said that if North Korea's nuclear issue  is resolved you will promote South-North economic cooperation.  In your speech today, you said that if the nuclear issue is  resolved, practical South-North relations will be promoted  rapidly. Can you give us your concrete plan?    [President Kim] I believe that it is correct to talk about  this matter after the nuclear issue is resolved. Frankly  speaking, North Korea is currently listening to everything we  are saying. I don't think talking about this matter at this  time will be helpful with the ongoing negotiations. I hope that  you will understand the situation and be patient.    [Ko To-won, CHUNGANG KYONGJE SINMUN reporter] Mr.  President, you have powerfully carried out changes and reform in  many fields of our society since the new government came to  office. As a result, you have won great applause from the  people. However, people say that while this was of much concern  to people in the past, no noteworthy changes and reforms have  been undertaken in the educational domain. The education  minister is present here. People expressed both interest and  concern upon her appointment. Can you explain your ideas for  future educational reform in more detail?    [President Kim] I think that of all reforms, education  reform is most important. All work in our society is conducted  by people. And people are formed by education. Thus, education  is, at the same time, the most difficult work.    All successive governments in the past carried out various  educational policies, from a system of school entrance  examinations to educational reform drives, in an excessively  improvisational manner, thus causing great confusion among the  people.    As the result of this, our education system has failed to  advance and has instead regressed. Taking the example of  foreign educational systems, I think early education of people  is desirable. With early education, people will be able to  learn many things promptly.    Our examination system is too complicated. Our people are  greatly confused over this aspect of our educational system. We  must carefully review this issue. I have already discussed it  with the education minister. I plan to form an Education Reform  Committee so as to fully discuss these problems in this  committee. I believe that the new education minister has a  number of ideas on educational reform and will excel in  implementing them.    [Yi Kum-hyon, reporter for THE ECONOMIST] I would like to  ask questions about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula  and the decision of the South Korean government to give up  nuclear development.    Mr. President, in your speech this morning, you said that  each nation will make maximum efforts to protect its own  interests. I wonder if you, Mr. President, believe that the ROK  Government's decision to abandon nuclear development will  benefit the national interests of South Korea today and of a  reunified ROK nation?    Second, will you explain whether the decision to abandon  nuclear development may change according to changes in the  surrounding conditions and to each nation's situation?    [President Kim] Thank you. The ROK people truly love peace.  We were always attacked by other people. Never have we attacked  others. This will not change in the future. Our defense of the  Armistice Line and the Team Spirit exercise is aimed at  defending ourselves, not at attacking others.    South Korea will never develop nuclear weapons in the  future.  I make it clear South Korea will never develop fearful nuclear  weapons because this will absolutely threaten peace on the  Korean peninsula, bring dire misfortunes to the lives of the 70  million fellow countrymen, result in building a big powder  magazine in Northeast Asia, and is not beneficial to peace in  the world.    Now, I wish to conclude the news conference now. Thank you.</p>

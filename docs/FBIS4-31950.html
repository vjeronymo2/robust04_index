			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["I.V."-initialed commentary: "Krajisnik: Affirmation of </F> the Struggle for the State"]    [Text] According to the information of the Serbian news  agency SRNA, the day before yesterday, Chairman of the Serbian  Republic People's Assembly Momcilo Krajisnik received a  delegation of the initiative committee for the preparation of  the republican assembly of the Association of the World War II  Chetnik Veterans from Ravna Gora. "The Chetniks were great  patriots and they fought for the Serbian national question,"  Krajisnik emphasized on that occasion, emphasizing that the  current struggle of the Serbian people for freedom and national  state "can be compared to the struggle of the Chetniks during  World War II."    "Our state and political leadership and the Serbian  Democratic Party [SDS] are determined to create national  reconciliation and affirm the patriotic struggle for the  creation of the Serbian state in the years 1941 to 1945 to the  utmost, even nowadays when a struggle for the final solution to  the national question is being fought," Krajisnik specified,  voicing his personal sympathy for the Ravna Gora movement. The  president of the Serbian Republic Assembly also emphasized that  the memory and the continuation of traditions will always exist  within the affirmation of the Chetnik movement, adding that the  state should regulate the celebration of all significant events  from that period with legal acts. "If somebody will turn  against the SDS now only because we are reaffirming the  Chetniks, then let him," Krajisnik concluded.    The representatives of the initiative committee demanded  from  Krajisnik that the movement of General Draza Mihajlovic's Ravna  Gora Chetniks be legally rehabilitated and that the  association's constituent assembly at the republican level be  held in the shortest possible time. After the meeting with  Krajisnik, the initiative committee held a session on the  premises of the Serbian Republic Presidency at which it was  concluded to "wait for the reply of the Assembly until 15 July,  and afterward hold the founding assembly of the association in  Pale or Ilidza."    President of the Serbian Radical Party Vojislav Seselj, who  has in the meantime dissolved his Serbian Chetnik movement, says  that members of the Serbian Radical Party and the SDS took part  in the organization of the new association, however, not as  party representatives, but as veterans. Adding that the  initiative for the creation of the association originates  precisely from the ranks of the Serbian Radicals in the Serbian  Republic, Seselj says that he fully supports any action aimed at  rehabilitation of the Chetnik movement.    The Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] is very surprised by the  Bosnian Serbian leadership steering into Ravna Gora waters,  especially, when one recalls that, until yesterday, even General  Mladic himself would be taking cockades off the soldiers' caps.  Milan Komnenic emphasizes that the Ravna Gora movement never  propagated, and even less carried out, ethnic cleansing, nor did  it propagate that the Serbs could live by themselves. "There  were some people on the fringe of the Ravna Gora movement who  had committed crimes and behaved aggressively and we are worried  by Krajisnik's promotion of his own ideas about the Ravna Gora  movement that have no connection whatsoever with this movement."</p>

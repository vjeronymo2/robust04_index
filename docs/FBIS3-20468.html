To commemorate the event, this article examines  some of the issues relating to the northeast volunteer army in  Xinjiang.    1. Entry Of Northeast Volunteer Army Into Xinjiang: How It  Happened    After the 18 September incident, the Nanjing government  adopted a "zero resistance" policy and ordered Chinese troops in  the northeast to retreat to behind Shanhaiguan. It was not long  before our beloved motherland between Bai Shan and Heilongjiang  fell into the hands of Japanese imperialism. Disregarding Chiang  Kai-shek's [Jiang Jieshi] strict order and unafraid of  sacrifice, the masses in the northeast and some patriotic  officers and men in the northeast volunteer army were determined  to resist the aggression of Japanese bandits. At one point  volunteer forces across the land numbered in the hundreds of  thousands, even as many as one million, hitting the Japanese  imperialists hard. However, the anti-Japanese units each fought  on their own and received no tangible aid from the Nanjing  government. By the winter of 1992, therefore, some had been  annihilated by the enemy. Others, reeling from heavy losses and  short on arms and food, found themselves in dire straits.  Subsequently, a small number of volunteers joined the allied  forces fighting Japan under the leadership of the CPC and firmly  continued the war of resistance in the northeast under the most  difficult conditions. Some volunteers overcame the enemy's  successive lines of blockade and made their way to the Great  Wall where they continued to defy the Japanese. Volunteer forces  under Su Bingwen [5685 3521 2429] (a former Hulun Buir garrison  commander and a former Hai-man railway protection commander who  subsequently became commander-in-chief of the northeast people's  save-the-nation army) and Ma Zhanshan [7456 0594 1472] (formerly  Heilongjiang garrison commander, later acting chairman of  Heilongjiang Province and concurrently deputy commander of  northeast frontier forces stationed in Heilongjiang), which were  the backbone of the volunteer army, ran out of ammunition and  food supplies and retreated into Soviet territory on 4 December  1932. (Footnote 1: There have always been conflicting claims  that Su Bingwen and others retreated into the Soviet Union on 3,  4, 5, or 7 December 1932. A telegram sent by Zheng Runcheng  [6774 3387 1004] and Su Guo [5685 0948] to Chairman Lin Sen  [2651 2773], Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, and Deputy  Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xueliang [1728 1331 5328] of the  Nanjing government on 9 April 1933 read, "Having finally run out  of ammunition and with no aid in sight, we retreated into Soviet  territory in the evening on 4 December in Year 21, enduring  humiliation in order to survive." We can conclude that "4" was  the right date. The telegram is now stored in the archives of  the autonomous region.) The units under Li Du [2621 2629]  (formerly Yilan garrison commander and subsequently Jilin  self-defense army commander in chief) retreated into Soviet  territory near Hulin in January 1933.    After retreating into Soviet territory, the northeast  volunteer army immediately turned over its weapons and equipment  to the Soviet authorities in accordance with international  practice. Following negotiations between the Nanjing government  and the Soviet Union, the latter agreed to let the northeast  volunteer army cross Siberia and enter Chinese territory at the  Tacheng border checkpoint. It would then be handed over to the  Xinjiang government.    After working out this deal with the Soviet authorities, the  Nanjing government immediately sent a telegram to the Xinjiang  provincial government ordering it to prepare to take over the  volunteer forces. Jin Shuren [6855 2885 0088], then chairman of  Xinjiang provincial government and superintendent of border  defense, appointed Lu Xiaozu [7627 2400 4371], a former  secretary general of the provincial government, as Tacheng  administrative director and named two attaches, Sun Guohua [1327  0948 5478] (an assistant director at the meteorological  observatory) and Han Xun [7281 8113], a former county chief. On  3 January 1933 they were despatched to Tacheng to take charge of  the hand-over of the northeast volunteer army. The Nanjing  government also ordered Guang Lu [1639 4389], its consul in  Zaisang in the Soviet Union, to take part in this operation by  facilitating contacts with the Soviet authorities. Concerned  that the northeast volunteer army would be hard to control, Jin  Shuren only took over the rank-and-file officers and men while  keeping senior officers out of Xinjiang. As a result,  high-ranking officers like Su Bingwen, Ma Zhanshan, and Wu Delin  [0702 1795 2651] (commander of the 2d Infantry Regiment under Su  Bingwen) had no choice but to leave their forces and return to  China by boat via Europe. Instead, Zheng Runcheng, commander of  the 9th Brigade of the 2d Infantry Regiment, became acting  regimental commander and led the forces into Xinjiang along with  Su Guo, chief of staff of the 2d Infantry Regiment.    On 14 February 1933, the northeast volunteer army left its  camp at Tuomusike [phonetic] and boarded a train on the  Trans-Siberian Railway. It got off at the Ayagusi [phonetic]  station and headed for Tacheng on foot. In the evening on 25  February, the first batch of northeast volunteers entered  Tacheng under the command of Zhao Zhuxun [6392 2885 8113] to the  warm welcome of the local people of all nationalities.    They were followed by a steady stream of other volunteers  entering Xinjiang through the Tacheng checkpoint. They stayed at  Tacheng briefly for rest and reorganization before moving in  groups onto Urumqi and other sites where troops were stationed.  The first batch led by Zheng Runcheng arrived in Urumqi on 27  March. (Footnote 2: According to the telegram sent by Lu Xiaozu,  Tacheng administrative director, to Jin Shuren on 26 February  1933, "The first batch of 500 men arrived at Tacheng in the  evening on 25th." Most of the more recent accounts suggest that  the first batch of northeast volunteers entered Xinjiang in the  latter half of March 1933, a discrepancy probably caused by  confusing the time they arrived in Urumqi with the time they  entered Xinjiang.) Reception points had been set up along the  way between Tacheng and Urumqi to provide lodging and food for  the volunteers. Some locals even prepared sumptuous meals for  the soldiers on their own initiative. People of all  nationalities welcomed the volunteers most warmly. Many shops  put up posters offering special treatments for them. Both  officers and men were deeply moved.    How many northeast volunteers entered Xinjiang from the  Soviet Union? Widely divergent figures were given by a host of  historical accounts. Most put the number at more than 30,000, a  report submitted on 17 August 1945 to Wu Zhongxin [0702 1813  0207], then chairman of the provincial government, by the social  department of Xinjiang Province said, "Anti-Japanese northeast  volunteer forces retreated into Xinjiang on order from the  central government in Years 22 and 23 of the Republic. A count  conducted at the time yielded more than 20,000 people, including  officers, men, and their families." On 4 December 1945, a  telegram from the finance department of Xinjiang provincial  government to the Executive Yuan of the KMT regime read,  "Anti-Japanese northeast forces entered Xinjiang between Year 22  and Year 23 of the Republic after taking a roundabout route on  order from the central government. At the time we counted over  20,000 officers, men, and their families." While these two  documents were less than detailed, they were reliable since they  were based on some kind of "count." Documents currently in the  archives of the autonomous region give the sizes of the five  batches of northeast volunteers in the regiment under Zheng  Runcheng's command who entered Xinjiang as follows: 500, 476,  532, 449, and 457, for a total of 2,414. These numbers should be  quite accurate. Unfortunately, we have no way of determining how  many people were in the other units of the northeast army which  also entered Xinjiang. But one thing is sure, namely that  suggestions that 30,000 and 40,000 northeast volunteers entered  Xinjiang are less than reliable.    As the anti-Japanese northeast volunteer army headed for  Xinjiang by way of the Soviet Union, their plan was to return to  the front to fight the Japanese. But the Nanjing government then  sent a telegram to the Xinjiang provincial government ordering  it to "settle the northeast volunteers where they are." Because  the telegram was not made public for a long time, the volunteers  at the time and even a number of researchers after the  revolution thought that Sheng Shicai [4141 0013 2088] did not  allow them to enter Shanhaiguan, a perception that was not in  line with historical facts.    The route mapped out by the Nanjing government for the  re-entry into China of the volunteer army indicated that the  Nanjing government never wanted the volunteers to return to the  front of the war of resistance against Japan. For the northeast  volunteers who had retreated to the Soviet Union, the shortest  and most convenient way to return to the interior would be to go  by ship from Vladivostok, which was how the one thousand plus  injured volunteers and their families who had retreated into the  Soviet Union with Su Bingwen found their way back to China. To  cross Siberia and come home by boat via Europe covered a vast  distance and was time-consuming, but at least the land and  shipping routes were clear. In comparison, the most inconvenient  route was to re-enter China through Xinjiang. Tacheng and Gansu  are separated by the Gobi Desert stretching thousands of li.  Crossing the sparsely populated desert on foot posed enormous  difficulties. The Nanjing government picked this route precisely  because it wanted the volunteers to settle down in Xinjiang so  that they would not "make any more trouble."    In July 1933 the Nanjing government despatched Wang Ziyao  [3769 1311 5069], aide-de-camp to Li Du, formerly  commander-in-chief of the Jilin self-defense army, to Urumqi by  air and issued an order under which all northeast volunteers,  officers and men, who had entered Xinjiang would be reorganized  as Xinjiang units. With that the hopes of the northeast  volunteers that they would return to the anti-Japanese front  were completely dashed.    2. Major Activities of Northeast Volunteers in Xinjiang    While they were in Xinjiang, the northeast volunteers took  part in many local political and military activities, notably  the following:    a. Participated in fighting to defend Urumqi.    The entry of the northeast volunteer army into Xinjiang  coincided with the siege of Urumqi by the forces of Ma Shiming  [7456 0013 2494], who was under the command of Ma Zhongying  [7456 0112 5391], a Gansu warlord. The provincial forces under  Jin Shuren received "absolutely no training in peacetime and are  utterly useless in battle. Martial discipline have broken down  and bad habits are deeply entrenched. The troops are an uneven  mix, some old, some strong. They are dressed in rags, so the  people of Xinjiang call them a `beggar army.'" These forces were  simply incapable of putting up any resistance to the advancing  Ma Zhongying forces. The fall of Urumqi appeared imminent. After  the northeast volunteers entered Tacheng, Jin Shuren pasted  notices all over town announcing that the Nanjing government had  "sent 15,000 crack troops to Xinjiang by way of Russia equipped  with big runs, tanks, and airplanes" in order to calm the  people. At the same time, he sent an emergency telegram to Lu  Xiaozu ordering the northeast army to rush to the province to  save the day. The northeast volunteers arrived in Urumqi,  reluctant to participate in the civil war. So the various  leaders sent a letter to Ma Shiming tactfully asking him to  agree to stop fighting. (Footnote 3: A History of the  Development of the Western Regions by China, by Ceng Wenwu  [258 0795 0710], p 604) Figuring that Urumqi was about to fall  any minute, the Ma Shiming forces ignored the diplomatic  gesture, giving the volunteer army no choice but to join the  battle in defense of the city. The northeast volunteers in Zheng  Runcheng's brigade were well-trained regular troops. In no time  they defeated the Ma Shiming forces and forced them to raise the  siege.    b. Participated in Xinjiang's 12 April coup d'etat.    On 12 April 1933, Chen Zhong [7115 0022], Tao Mingyue [7118  2494 2887], and Li Xiaotian [2621 4562 1131], known as the  "three young Turks" of Xinjiang, staged a coup d'etat, largely  relying upon the "converted army" headed by Bapinggute [1572  1627 0657 3676] and the northeast volunteer army under the  command of Zheng Runcheng.    In the early afternoon on 12 April, the "converted army"  launched a surprise attack on the provincial government of  Xinjiang. Jin Shuren fled. In the evening on the same day the  provincial army unleashed an all-out counteroffensive.  Outnumbered, the "converted army" was ready to evacuate Urumqi  with the soldiers' families. At this critical juncture the  northeast volunteers joined the fighting and instantly turned  the military tide. Seeing that the situation was beyond salvage,  Jin Shuren fled to Changji on 14 April and published an open  telegram in Tacheng on 24 April announcing his decision to give  up power.    At a meeting of the provisional maintenance committee in the  evening on the day of the coup, Liu Wenlong [0491 2429 7893],  director of the department of education, was elected chairman of  the provisional provincial government. A decision was made to  abolish the supervised office system and set up a provisional  military committee headed by Zheng Runcheng, one of the generals  of the northeast volunteer army. Zheng Runcheng was still with  the volunteer army outside the city and did not attend the  meeting. When informed of this decision by someone despatched by  the organizers of the meeting, Zheng Runcheng said that the  northeast army was only passing through Xinjiang on its way to  fight the Japanese and had no interest in involving itself in  Xinjiang politics. Only after repeatedly turning down the  position did he agree to be the chairman temporarily. When the  provisional maintenance committee next met on 14 April, however,  Bapinggute, leader of the converted army, proposed that the  governor system be retained and that Sheng Shicai be the new  governor. Zheng Runcheng, the only person in a position to  oppose the proposal, felt that it was beyond his power to sort  out the mess in Xinjiang, on the one hand, and still harbored  some unrealistic dreams about Sheng Shicai, a fellow provincial  (Sheng Shicai was from Liaoning), on the other. The lack of  strong opposition from Zheng Runcheng enabled Sheng Shicai to  successfully ascend the throne of governor.    c. Helped Sheng Shicai destroy miscellaneous political  enemies.    In the summer of 1933, Ma Zhongying again marched into  Xinjiang from Gansu with his troops. After capturing Hami and  three other towns (Mulei, Jitai, and Fuyuan), he was practically  knocking on the door of Fukang, barely 60 kilometers from the  provincial capital of Urumqi. Sheng Shicai put himself at the  head of the northeast volunteers and the converted army under  the command of Zheng Runcheng and Bapinggute, respectively, and  arrived at Fukang to meet the approaching enemy head on. In  mid-June, fierce fighting broke out between the two armies at  Zineiquan 40 kilometers to the east of Fukang. At the beginning  the Ma Zhongying forces had the edge and Sheng Shicai was almost  taken prisoner. Fortunately, valiant fighting by the northeast  volunteers and the converted army turned the situation around.  In July the same year, with Ma Zhongying closing in on Urumqi  from the south, the northeast volunteers led by divisional  commander Liu Wankui [0491 8001 7608] again took on the enemy.  Liu Wankui was seriously wounded in the battle of Shuixigou and  died. The office of the governor of Xinjiang organized a solemn  memorial service for Liu Wankui and promoted him to lieutenant  general in the army posthumously .    To attack Urumqi jointly with Ma Zhongying, Zhang Peiyuan  [1728 1014 0337], who headed the unit in Ili responsible for  putting soldiers to work to develop wasteland and concurrently  commander of the 8th Division of Xinjiang, sent Yang Zhengzhong  [2799 2973 0022], a regimental commander, to advance to the east  in the winter of 1933. He promptly captured Jinghe and Wusu and  was closing in on Suilai (now Manasi). Liu Bin [0491 2430],  chairman of the joint chiefs of staff at the governor's office  and a general in the northeast volunteer army, led troops to  take on the enemy. He wiped out Yang Zhengzhong at one fell  swoop at Sandahezi, thus ending the vulnerability of the  province to enemy attack from both front and rear.    With the siege of Urumqi broken, the northeast army along  with the converted army and other troops from the province again  headed south in March 1934 in pursuit of Ma Zhongying. Meanwhile  Liu Bin crossed Tianshan from Ili and directly made for the key  town of Akesu in southern Xinjiang. After capturing Akesu in  late March 1934, Liu Bin linked up with the main forces and  continued their southerly push. By then Ma Zhongying's forces  were in utter disarray and he fled to the Soviet Union on 14  July. Deputy divisional commander Ma Hushan [7456 5706 1472],  who was married to Ma Zhongying's older sister, took over the  remnants of his forces and retreated to Hetian where he pledged  allegiance to the provincial government. Only then was Sheng  Shicai able to consolidate his rule over the whole province.    3. Sheng Shicai Broke Up, Massacred Northeast Volunteers in  Xinjiang    In the summer of 1934, his military campaign against Ma  Zhongying largely over, Sheng Shicai set up the "Xinjiang army  reorganization committee" as part of the governor's office.  Under the guidance of Soviet advisers, the committee proceeded  to reorganize all the armed forces in the province. As a result  of this exercise, the northeast volunteer army was disbanded as  a separate unit, its officers and men being incorporated into  newly organized military units and stationed all over the  province under the watchful eye of Sheng Shicai himself. The  training unit stationed in Urumqi consisted mostly of northeast  volunteers who had entered Xinjiang but was headed by Wang  Hongzao [3076 7703 5679], an in-law of Sheng Shicai's. Northeast  volunteers also made up a majority of the officers and men in  the unit in Ili responsible for wasteland development and at Ili  garrison headquarters as well. Yet the officer in charge of the  wasteland development unit and commander of the Ili garrison  headquarters was Qiu Zongjun [6726 1350 3182], Sheng Shicai's  father-in-law. A number of senior and middle-ranking officers in  the northeast volunteer army who had received formal military  education were stripped of military power and sent to military  schools as instructors.    After regaining control over Xinjiang in 1944, the KMT  carried out yet another round of reorganization in the northeast  volunteer army in Xinjiang, redistributing them among the 2d  Cavalry Division, the 12th Cavalry Division, the 1st Division,  and the 128th Division. Divisional commanders and some  regimental commanders were appointed separately by KMT military  authorities. Most former members of the northeast volunteer  army, both officers and men, found themselves excluded.    After the victory of the war of resistance against Japan,  the  KMT regime sent 1,500 volunteer officers and men and their  families back to their native villages. Because of  transportation breakdowns and poor organization, some personnel  ended up wandering about destitute in places like Lanzhou and  Xian, while others returned to a northeast plagued by fighting,  could not find any means of livelihood there, and were forced to  return to Xinjiang.    Although the northeast volunteer army did much to bring  about  and consolidate the regime of Sheng Shicai after it entered  Xinjiang, many of its officers and men were massacred brutally  by him. There are varying accounts of many of the issues  involved. Here we will look at some of them.    In the past, a number of people have written that the  northeast volunteer army "fled on the eve" of a battle with Ma  Zhongying at Dabancheng and secretly corresponded with the  enemy. This, it was said, left Sheng Shicai no choice but to  have some northeast volunteers arrested and killed. But was this  really what happened?    According to trial records at the time, Sheng Shicai had  Zheng Runcheng, Su Guo, Yang Yaojun [2799 5069 6874], Ying  Zhanbin [2019 0594 2430], Xu Guoguang [1776 0948 0342], and Li  Zhi [2621 1807] arrested in the evening on 20 November 1933. The  next day Yan Lian [7346 1670] (formerly commander of the 20th  Regiment of the Jilin save-the-nation army and leader of the  corps of bodyguards of the provincial government at the time)  was arrested, so were Gao Lingyun [7559 0407 0061], chief of  staff of the 4th Brigade of the Jilin save-the-nation army, and  Wang Xiaozhi [3769 1321 0037], a former commander of the 673d  Regiment of the 26th Division of the Jilin self-defense army  and, after coming to Xinjiang, chief of staff of the Ili unit in  charge of putting soldiers to work to open up wasteland, on 9  May 1934. The charges cooked up by Sheng Shicai against them  were: Plotting to overthrow the existing regime and murder the  governor. According to Sheng Shicai, this was the elaborate plot  they had hatched: Externally, Ma Zhongying and Zhang Peiyuan  were to attack Urumqi simultaneously from two sides and,  internally, the northeast army and the converted army were to  join forces and stage an uprising, with the bodyguards of the  governor's mansion led by Yan Lian trying to assassinate Sheng  Shicai. Liu Wenlong [0491 2429 7893] was allegedly the  mastermind of this plot, yet Sheng Shicai did not have him  arrested, merely putting him under house arrest. (Footnote 4:  See archives of the autonomous region, under Police Chapter  1-2-103)    Let us now go back to the defeat at Dabancheng and try to  set  the record straight and pinpoint responsibility. After their  arrest, leaders of the northeast volunteer army, including Zheng  Runcheng, were "unanimous in their emphasis on Sheng Shicai's  errors as a commander, noting that he issued the wrong orders.  Not for a second did they admit that they deserted or were  engaged in conspiratorial activities." (Footnote 5: "Seven  Decades of Turmoil in Xinjiang," by Zhang Dajun [1728 1129  6511], p 3349) Their assertions were consistent with what Jin  Guozhen [6855 0948 3791] remembered. Jin Guozhen, who took part  in the fighting as deputy commander of the 1st Cavalry Regiment  of the mixed brigade under Sheng Shicai's direct command, said,  "The day after the assault on Dabancheng, just as we were making  headway, we suddenly received an order to withdraw. Taking  advantage of the opportunity, over 100 mounted troops from the  forces of Ma Zhongying came in hot pursuit of us. Their frontal  attack on the provincial forces sent the latter into total  disarray. However, when Ma Zhongying's troops saw that the  cavalry units of the province were retreating on both flanks,  they assumed, wrongly, that they had fallen into an ambush and  immediately fled to their base. After retreating a dozen li, Jin  Guozhen ran into Sheng Shicai who there and then personally  ordered the 1st Cavalry Regiment to take in the skirmishers and  await order to return to Urumqi. Only a little over 100 mounted  troops charged head on toward us and, wrongly believing that  they had fallen into an ambush, soon withdrew in panic. For  these reasons, they could not possibly have inflicted extensive  losses on the provincial forces." (Only four soldiers from the  1st Cavalry Regiment were killed in this battle.) Judging from  the fact that Sheng Shicai calmly and unhurriedly ordered the  1st Cavalry Regiment to take in the skirmishers and return to  Urumqi, not only did Sheng Shicai realize that his forces did  not suffer heavy casualties but he also calculated that Ma  Zhongying was not about to launch a major offensive. In the same  article of recollections, Jin Guozhen also touched upon the real  reason why the battle of Dabancheng was lost. Ma Zhongying had  written a confidential letter to each of the four generals of  the northeast volunteer army--Zheng Runcheng, Guo Yingkui [6753  2019 1145], Ying Zhanbin [2019 0594 2430], and Yang Yaojun, but  the messenger was captured by Sheng Shicai's forces. Sheng  Shicai got suspicious after reading the letters and immediately  ordered a withdrawal. According to Sheng Shicai's aide-de-camp,  Zhao Jianfeng [6392 0494 6912], this was the gist of the  letters: You are all heroes of the war of resisting the Japanese  and saving the nation. To preserve your reputation, you should  return to the interior and continue to fight the Japanese,  instead of getting involved in local wars in Xinjiang. Since  these four confidential letters were never delivered into the  hands of Zheng Runcheng and other leaders of the northeast  volunteer army, we have no way of determining what their  attitude to them would have been. Perhaps this was a ploy by Ma  Zhongying to drive a wedge between Sheng Shicai and the  northeast volunteers. Perhaps this was precisely the pretext  Sheng Shicai had prayed for. (Footnote 6: "The True Story of the  Several Battles I Took Part In," by Jin Guozhen, in "Selected  Readings in Xinjiang Literature and History," Volume 14,  Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe, 1983)    What then made Sheng Shicai murder the leaders of the  northeast volunteer army so brutally? To establish separatist  rule in Xinjiang, Sheng Shicai must first gain control over the  armed forces in the province. There were three armies in  Xinjiang at the time: the provincial army, the northeast  volunteer army, and the converted army. The converted army  consisted mostly of veteran soldiers who had taken part in World  War I and were opposed to the October Revolution. They had a  wealth of combat experience but there were not too many of them,  just 2,000 or so. The provincial army was large in size but  corrupt, with absolutely no combat capability. Moreover, it was  scattered throughout north and south Xinjiang. Then there was  the northeast volunteer army. Not only did it have a formidable  combat capability, but it also outnumbered the other two armies.  To subjugate Xinjiang, Sheng Shicai must first control the  northeast volunteer army. To control the northeast volunteer  army, he must get rid of its leaders.    Sheng Shicai might make use of the leaders of the northeast  army but there always came a point when he had to have them  killed. As soon as he entered Ili, Liu Bin, a former commander  of the 5th Army of the northeast people save-the-nation army,  was appointed Ili garrison headquarters commander by Sheng  Shicai. After leading troops into south Xinjiang, he was named  Kashi garrison headquarters commander by Sheng Shicai in June  1934. In Xinjiang, Ili and Kashi are the most important  strategic points after Urumqi. In 1937 Sheng Shicai stripped Liu  Bin of all his military positions and put him in charge of gold  mines. Soon afterwards he accused him of "plotting a rebellion"  and had him murdered along with Ha Yuliang [0761 3768 5328]  (acting chief of staff at the headquarters of the Jilin  self-defense army) and Niu Yuting [6873 3768 1656], (deputy  commander of the regiment of officers of the 2d Brigade under  the northeast people save-the-nation army). Jiang Youfen [5592  2589 5358], who succeeded Liu Bin as commander of Kashi garrison  headquarters, was subsequently killed as well.    When the northeast volunteer army entered Xinjiang, it  included a company of military recruits made up of young  students. Upon the completion of training in August 1933, the  trainees were distributed among the units and were quickly  promoted to positions at the brigade and battalion levels,  becoming the backbone of the Xinjiang armed forces. And the  prime targets of Sheng Shicai's assassination squads. Of the 97  people in the company of military trainees who actually entered  Xinjiang, 44 were massacred by Sheng Shicai. (Footnote 7:  From Bai Shan and Heilongjiang to the Foot of  Tianshan, by Gu Menglin [6253 1125 2651], see  Selected Readings in Urumqi Literature and History,  Volume 5, Xinjiang Qingnian Chubanshe, 1983) Cui Rongchang [1508  2837 2490], a platoon leader in the company of recruits, held a  number of positions after entering Xinjiang, including leader of  the military officers' school and commander of Kashi garrison  headquarters. In March 1941 he was arrested by Sheng Shicai for  involvement in the "conspiratorial clique" case. By October the  same year as many as 124 people had been arrested in connection  with the Cui Rongchang case, most of them young military  officers from the northeast volunteer army. (Footnote 8:  "Statistical Table on Convicts in the Cui Rongchang Case,"  Xinjiang Provincial Public Security Management Department, 18  October 1941) After their arrest, some were executed in secret,  while others died from a variety of cruel tortures. There were  few survivors.    There has never been a formal count of the number of  officers  and men from the northeast volunteer army killed by Sheng  Shicai. Most of the figures now available are exaggerations. For  instance, Zhang Fengyi [1728 7685 0308], a northeast volunteer  army leader who entered Xinjiang in the latter period, said,  "After the northeast volunteer army entered Xinjiang, only 5,000  men were killed in fighting with Ma Zhongying or did from  diseases or old age. In contrast, over 10,000 of them were  arrested and massacred by Sheng Shicai in the past decade."  (Footnote 9: "The Experiences of the Northeast Anti-Japanese  Army In the Decade After It Entered Xinjiang," by Zhang Fengyi,  in Selected Readings in Urumqi Literature and  History, Volume 23, Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe, 1991) After  Sheng Shicai was transferred to Chongqing as minister of  agriculture and forestry in 1944, the chief justice of the local  court in Urumqi, Liu E [0491 6948], and others made the  following charge before the special tribunal sent to Xinjiang by  the military commission of the KMT specifically to sort out  long-standing criminal cases: "The most tragic case involved the  20,000 people and more in the northeast army... For over 10  years they were brutally murdered until they were almost  completely wiped out. A mere 10 officers or so and fewer than  1,000 old and weak soldiers survived." (Footnote 10: Seven  Decades of Turmoil in Xinjiang, pp 6035-6036) Let us  analyze this matter.    After the reorganization of 1934, Xinjiang's armed forces  were reduced to 12,000 people. Of the 18 units above the  regimental level, the three garrison commands of Hami, Ashan  (now Aletai), and Yan Qi, the 9th Cavalry Regiment, the 7th  Infantry Division, and other units were all composed either  mainly or entirely of minority officers and men. The 6th Cavalry  Regiment, on the other hand, resulted from the reorganization of  the converted army. Only in nine units did northeast volunteers  who had entered Xinjiang make up a majority. Based on these  data, officers and men from the northeast volunteer army who had  entered Xinjiang should make up about half or so of the  reorganized Xinjiang armed forces, that is, about 6,000 people.    After entering Xinjiang, many of the volunteers switched to  other fields one after another. In the 1930's and 1940's, you  could find a former northeast volunteer in just about every  organization, institution, or enterprise in Xinjiang. Of the 97  people in the third squadron of the company of military  trainees, 60 people were assigned to various military units  while 37 switched to other sectors: banks, transportation, and  posts and telecommunications. If over 38 percent of the people  in the military training company, the cradle of the leadership  of the armed forces, switched to other fields, the job-change  rate among other officers and men could not have been lower.  Using this percentage as a base, the number of northeast  volunteers who left the forces for other occupations must have  been at least 8,000. Also, of the 60 military trainees who  remained in the military after the military training company was  abolished, 39, or 65 percent, were massacred by Sheng Shicai. In  contrast, of the 37 who switched to local work, five people, or  13.5 percent, died in the hands of Sheng Shicai. This shows that  one's chances of being murdered by Sheng Shicai wee far smaller  if one switched to local work than if one stayed in the  military. Moreover, there were other volunteers who for a  variety of reasons voluntarily left the units in the thousands  in search of other means of livelihood.    According to these calculations, of the northeast volunteers  who entered Xinjiang, about 5,000 were killed on the battlefield  or died because of illness. About 5,000 remained in the units  and close to 10,000 changed jobs or branched out on their own.  At most 2,000 to 3,000 were murdered by Sheng Shicai. Needless  to say, these computations were not accurate, but we can say  with certainty they are closer to facts that the assertions that  Sheng Shicai murdered over 10,000 volunteers or that he  practically wiped out 20,000 volunteers. As far as the northeast  volunteers were concerned, the bottom line for Sheng Shicai was  to control and make use of them, not eliminate them.  Specifically, his overriding policy toward high-ranking officers  was to kill them off; some he made use of for a time but in the  end even these generals were murdered. In the case of  middle-ranking officers, his principal policy was to divide and  exploit, supplemented by murder, in order to ensure control. As  for low-ranking officers and the rank-and-file, his main  objective was exploitation. If all 20,000 northeast volunteers  were wiped out, what else could he depend on to continue his  rule in Xinjiang?    The main reason Sheng Shicai was able to exploit and divide  the northeast volunteer army who entered Xinjiang was the  absence of a strong leadership core. The northeast army entered  Xinjiang without its high-ranking leaders like Su Bingwen, Ma  Zhanshan, and Li Du, in other words, its most prestigious  leaders. Zheng Runcheng and others were not in a position to  hold together the entire army. Zheng Runcheng was commander of  the 9th Regiment of the 2d Infantry Brigade in the northeast  people save-the-nation army and later served as acting brigade  commander. At the time the army entered Xinjiang, he was both  regiment commander and brigade commander. The northeast  volunteer army which entered Xinjiang had a surfeit of military  officers at the army, division, and regiment levels. (In the  Jilin self-defense army and save-the-nation army, for instance,  Xing Zhanqing [0438 0594 3237] was divisional commander; Yang  Yaojun, zhonglu commander-in-chief; Ha Yuliang, headquarters  chief of staff; Yang Bingsen [0761 3768 5328], artillery  commander; and Liu Wankui [0491 8001 7608], Guo Yingkui, Ying  Zhanbin, Dan Chunlin [0830 2504 7207], Li Zhi [2621 1807], Xu  Guoguang [1776 0948 0342], and Yu Deyi [0060 1795 0001], brigade  commanders. Why did Su Bingwen and others put Zheng Runcheng  instead of somebody else in charge of the army? Mainly because  the 2d Infantry Brigade used to be the northeast army's regular  forces with a strong capability which still boasted two fairly  intact regiments consisting of 2,500 officers and men even as it  was withdrawing from the northeast. As for other generals, some  did not make their way into the Soviet Union until later and  therefore could not have joined the greater part of the forces  as they retreated into Xinjiang, while others had become  commanders without a following. (One example was Liu Bin [0491  2430], commander of the 5th Army of the northeast  save-the-nation army.) Zheng Runcheng was not qualified to  command the entire army in terms of experience, prestige, or  ability. That he was made chairman of the provisional military  committee after the 12 April coup shows that all quarters in  Xinjiang had high hopes in the northeast volunteer army. But it  turned out that Zheng Runcheng did not live up to the important  job and was quickly stripped of his military power by Sheng  Shicai.    The volunteer army was ridden with factions, each having  nothing to do with the others, even back when it was in the  northeast. This was a major reason why it lost the war of  resistance against the Japanese. Although it was nominally under  the unified command of Zheng Runcheng after entering Xinjiang,  in reality it was its same old factious self. For instance, Li  Du put divisional commander Xing Zhanqing in charge of the Jilin  self-defense army. Because the army was stationed at two places  in Xinjiang, namely Ili and Urumqi, which made centralized  command difficult, Xing Zhanqing (stationed at Ili) decided that  Yang Yaojun should be responsible for the volunteers from Jilin  now stationed at Urumqi. Needless to say, this undermined the  unified command of Zheng Runcheng. Subsequently Sheng Shicai  dared to have Zheng Runcheng and others arrested and murdered  precisely because he perceived, correctly this particular  weakness on the part of the army of volunteers and had gone to  great lengths to divide and rule beforehand. After Zheng  Runcheng and other leaders of the northeast volunteer army were  arrested, Sheng Shicai immediately promoted a number of  middle-ranking officers in the same army, thereby readily  consolidating his grip on the northeast army of volunteers.    Moreover, there was a host of officers, motivated by  self-interests, who threw in their lot with Sheng Shicai and  turned around to sell out and murder their former  comrades-in-arms. This is another reason why the northeast army  disintegrated. Typical of these officers were Li Pulin [2621  3302 7207] and Li Yingqi [2621 5391 1142]. An adopted son of Li  Du, commander-in-chief of the Jilin self-defense army, Li Pulin  was named to important jobs such as chairmanship of the secret  tribunal by Sheng Shicai because of his diligence in providing  the latter with inside intelligence about the northeast  volunteer army. He had a hand in a majority of the several  "plotting to rebel" cases fabricated by Sheng Shicai and fled  with the latter to Taiwan on the eve of liberation. A former  major and aide-de-camp in the northeast people save-the-nation  army, Li Yingqi zealously offered to serve Sheng Shicai and was  quickly promoted to such positions as section chief in the  office of the aide-de-camp in the governor's office and head of  the office of political instruction. After his appointment as  director of the provincial public security management department  in 1933, he proceeded to have many people murdered in accordance  with Sheng Shicai's wishes. For instance, he took part in  cooking up the Cui Rongchang case, whose primary goal was to  murder young military officers in the northeast army of  volunteers. He also carried out Sheng Shicai's plot to kill Chen  Tanqiu [7115 3389 4428] and Mao Zemin [3029 3419 3046]. After  the liberation, Li Yingqi was arrested and executed by a firing  squad.    4. Some Northeast Volunteers Contributed to Economic  Construction and Democratic Revolution in Xinjiang    As a result of the reorganization of 1934, many officers and  men from the northeast army of volunteers were demobilized and  assigned to all kinds of positions. At the time such people  could be found in countless organizations, enterprises, and  educational and cultural institutions all over Xinjiang. Because  they were fairly well-educated, many became the leaders and  backbone of their units. Zhang Mingpan [1728 7686 3879], for  instance, who headed the aide-de-camp's office of the northeast  save-the-nation army, led demobilized officers and men in an  arduous enterprise on the sands of Gobi Desert, building oil  refineries and turning out kerosene, gasoline, and lubricating  oil. Or take Wang Qixun [3769 7871 8113], a battalion commander  in the northeast volunteer army. After leaving the military, he  became chairman of the engineering commission in charge of  putting up several of the most well-known buildings in Urumqi at  the time. In his book, Xinjiang: The Inside Story, Xu  Lingfeng [1776 7227 7685] described the west building of the  governor's mansion, one of the commission's works, as the "best  equipped conference hall in the rear in China" and called the  "big bank" the "greatest piece of architecture" in Urumqi. In  the mid-1930's, many northeast volunteers took part in building  the 1,400-kilometer Ili-Urumqi Xingxing gap highway. Completed  and opened to traffic in early July 1937, it became one of the  key arteries of transportation in the world during the war of  resistance against Japan and played a critical role in aiding  the war effort. Most of the instructors at the Xinjiang military  officers academy were members of the northeast volunteer army  who had entered Xinjiang, while many of the political  instructors were members of the CPC and CPSU. A good number of  the officers and men at the CPC-led recruiting camp were  graduates of the academy and went on to become the backbone of  the drive to modernize the Chinese military.    Whether they stayed in the military or were demobilized and  assigned to the localities, many former members of the northeast  volunteer army were staunchly patriotic and steadfastly  progressive and participated in the democratic revolution in and  peaceful liberation of Xinjiang.    Zhang Fengyi [1728 7685 0308], a former middle-ranking  officer in the northeast army, became actively involved in the  war of resistance against Japan in the northeast after the  September 18 incident. Once in Xinjiang, he held a succession of  jobs, including brigade commander, regiment commander, and Kashi  garrison commander. After the victory of the war of resistance  against Japan, he became a lieutenant general at the northwest  field headquarters. On the eve of liberation, he was the  province's deputy commander of public security. (Provincial  chairman Bao Erhan [0545 1422 3352] was concurrently commander  of public security.) To go with the way events were unfolding,  General Tao Zhiyue [7118 1492 1471], then commander in chief at  provincial garrison headquarters, was preparing to stage an  uprising. Yet he had few troops under his direct control. Both  Ma Chengxiang [7456 0701 4382], commander of the 5th Cavalry  Army, and Ye Cheng [0673 2052], commander of the 78th Division,  were resolutely anti-communist and firmly opposed to rising up  in rebellion. Accordingly, the five regiments with close ties to  and under the control of General Zhang Fengyi (which essentially  were part of the former northeast volunteer army) became the  forces Tao Zhiyue and Bao Erhan relied on as they made  preparations for an uprising. After the liberation, Zhang Fengyi  was chief of staff for the Xinjiang military region and deputy  director of the autonomous region's department of heavy  industry, among other things, making fresh contributions to  Xinjiang's military and economic construction. Luo Zhi [5012  1807], a native of Guangdong, went to the northeast as a child.  After the September 18 incident, he joined the anti-Japanese  volunteer army. In 1938 he graduated from Xinjiang College and  became deeply involved in democratic revolutionary activities  and was one of the top leaders of the underground organization  "Combat Society." In August 1948 Luo Zhi and four three-region  revolutionary leaders, including Ahemaitijiang [7093 0678 6314  2251 3068] and Yisihakebaike [0122 2448 0761 0344 0130 0344]  were killed in a plane crash en route to Beijing by way of the  Soviet Union to take part in a CPPCC meeting. Zhao Jianfeng  served as an aide-de-camp to Sheng Shicai for a while and  enjoyed the latter's confidence. Later he became increasingly  progressive and did many good deeds for the people of Xinjiang,  constantly on the move on behalf of the peaceful liberation of  Xinjiang. After liberation, he held a string of positions,  including deputy director of the office of the Xinjiang  provincial people's government.    After the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang in September 1949,  some former northeast volunteers and officers still in the units  were reassigned to the PLA while others transferred into the  Xinjiang production and construction corps to defend the border  and help build up Xinjiang. People of all nationalities will  forever cherish the memory of former officers and men from the  northeast army who contributed to the economic construction and  democratic revolution of Xinjiang.</p>

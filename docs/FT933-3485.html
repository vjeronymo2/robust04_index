			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / W Midlands companies cut capital spending CAPITAL INVESTMENT by quoted companies in the West Midlands has fallen by 6 per cent on average in the past year, the annual report on the regional economy by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, shows. The drop was third successive annual decline as the region's industry struggles to overcome recession, said KPMG. Smaller companies - with a market value of less than Pounds 50m - were hit by low demand and cut spending by more than 25 per cent. Total cash spending on acquisitions also fell by more than 40 per cent to Pounds 557m during the year. KPMG's report was based on the latest results of the 125 quoted companies in the West Midlands. It said falling expenditure was a realistic indicator that the economy was still in recession. Although it drew some comfort from a 7 per cent increase in overall turnover and a marginal fall in pre-tax profits, down to Pounds 1.85bn compared with Pounds 1.86bn last year, KPMG said it was concerned by the inability of some sectors to exploit the signs of recovery elsewhere in the country. The worst-hit sectors were the motor industry and construction and property. Their poor performance was offset only by strong results from retailing, utility and electronics companies, the report said. Mr Terry Gateley, head of KPMG Corporate Finance in Birmingham, said: 'The region's smaller public companies bore the brunt of the recession with their turnover down 6 per cent and pre-tax profits down 24 per cent.' In spite of the gloomy results and a sharp increase in borrowing, Mr Gateley applauded the region's largest groups such as Tarmac, Cadbury Schweppes and TI, which had survived the recession.

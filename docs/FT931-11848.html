			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Arts: Small, beautiful and endangered - Architecture It should never be forgotten that 'Small is beautiful'. In the world of architectural conservation there are, at the moment, a large number of small but important buildings that are in considerable danger. As Lloyd's losses continue to mount, what is to be the future of the smaller manor houses, the more modest stately homes that many estate agents assure me are due to come on the market in the next year? The natural instinct of owners of good houses is to hang on until the last possible moment - even with the bailiffs at the door, selling up is the last resort. A great part of England's beauty comes from small scale things, and it is these that are the most fragile. The larger houses and the obvious masterpieces, while not easy to save, do attract attention; and merit usually brings protection. The sad dispersal of the contents of Pitchford Hall, in Shropshire, and the failure of the Department of National Heritage to act with other national bodies to save the house, ought to provide a lesson for the future. But what about the glorious Heveningham Hall (not small but a masterpiece) in Suffolk, which is still empty and on the market? The situation at Heveningham is entirely the responsibility of Michael Heseltine, now trade and industry secretary, who sold the house to a private owner in 1981 after it had been bought by the nation for just over Pounds 300,000 in 1970. Today the receivers are hoping for some Pounds 4m; meanwhile the house is empty, the park neglected and there seems to be little interest in its future. There seems to be a lack of will to tackle heritage problems in any logical way. In fact the leaky-umbrella government organisations such as English Heritage seem to make a point of not having a policy, and frequently react to situations only at the last minute. If there are serious problems when it comes to the protection of national monuments like Heveningham Hall, what can be the future for those subtle, small and delicate places that are the real fabric of England? Take Groombridge Place and Groombridge village in Kent - a house and settlement that still embody many of the best qualities of relatively modest architecture and landscape. Groombridge Place is a wonderfully unaltered mid-17th century house that leapt to unexpected fame as the setting for Peter Greenaway's film The Draughtsman's Contract. House and village were, until recently, one unified place. This feudal continuity was rudely interrupted and broken in 1991 when the house, farms and cottages were put on the market: because of the recession they took a long time to sell and were eventually divided between several owners. A local builder acquired 54 acres and some barns - presumably not to let the fields lie fallow. One property company owns a slice of the village, the pub and the green. Yet another owns Groombridge Place itself and the park and other lands. It is the planning application from Andrew de Candole and his company Blenheim Asset Management that has caused more than a flutter in the local dovecotes. The company has applied for permission to build an access road and car park for some 200 cars, and a coach park, on an important part of the Grade II* listed grounds. Permission is also being sought to convert some listed barns into a visitor's centre with shop and restaurant. The owners plan to open the restored gardens and the visitor's centre to the public on a regular basis, encouraging picnics and walks in areas that have enjoyed peace and privacy until now. English Heritage has objected to the siting of the car park beside the river in the important gap between the old and newer parts of the village. As its letter to the planners at Tunbridge Wells says: 'we would therefore oppose this site for the car park and, given the sensitivity of the whole of this site, are hard-pushed to suggest another one.' The site proposed also appears worrying on the grounds of road safety. It is not just the details of the Groombridge applications that are disturbing. It is the fact that this sort of proposal could undermine the rare qualities of the place. Private ownership of this sort of house and estate used to bring with it a sense of public responsibility. In the past this responsibility included leaving things alone and undisturbed. Small, beautiful places should not be commercially exploited to this extent. The outcome of the Groombridge application is uncertain at the moment and it could well go to appeal and out of the hands of the local authorities. It is a sad, unnecessary situation and will provoke a lot of opposition because it is in a part of the country where articulate neighbours will go a long way to see that their locality is preserved. The equally sad thing is that there are dozens of other houses and gardens that are empty and for sale throughout the country. The future for the small, beautiful place is looking daily more uncertain. Are vigilance and patience enough to secure their future without any official intervention?</p>

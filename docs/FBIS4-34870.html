			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 24 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Haitian Lower  Court Judge Henock Voltaire ordered two U.S. banks, which had  closed their doors to the public in view of U.S. President Bill  Clinton's decision to freeze Haitian citizens' accounts, to  reopen on 27 June.    Voltaire issued this decision following a suit filed by the  Central Bank of Haiti. This decision affects Citibank and Bank  of Boston branches, which on 22 June notified the Central Bank  governor of their decision to stop operations. After this  measure was implemented, the two banks did not open their doors  on 23 and 24 June. Many citizens went to the banks on those two  days to try to withdrew money.    Judge Voltaire maintained that these two banks cannot close  their doors due to decisions made by the United States; they are  subject to Haitian laws because they requested authorization to  operate in Haiti. He also pointed out that their arguments do  not have merit in Haiti; hence, they will have to reopen. It  was reported that the Bank of Boston will open its doors on 27  June. Meanwhile, no Citibank spokesman could be located to  respond to Judge Voltaire's decision.    Political observers believe the U.S. objective of  implementing financial sanctions to force the military regime to  relinquish power has worked against the United States because an  anti-American feeling prevails in Haiti.    Meanwhile, operations at the Scotia Bank proceeded as  normal,  but many people went to this bank to withdraw money, fearing the  bank might close its doors to the public.</p>

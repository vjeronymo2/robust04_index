			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Huda al-Husayni from London] </F>   [Text] Mas'ud Barzani, leader of the Democratic Party of  Kurdistan [DPK], has told Radio Monte Carlo that the fighting  between his party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK]  under Jalal Talabani is the result of the differences in  viewpoints on how to tackle matters, particularly how to run  Iraqi Kurdistan and settle political issues.    Barzani said that Talabani's forces occupied the Parliament  building on 3 May as coupists usually do as the first step.  Barzani denied reports that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard are  fighting on the side of his forces. He also denied that he has  asked for Iran's mediation. He said that it was Talabani who  asked Tehran to host a meeting of the leaders of the warring  Iraqi Kurdish parties.    Mas'ud Barzani also stressed that no one in Iraqi Kurdistan  has prevented Talabani, who is in Damascus, from returning to  his headquarters, and that on his request the allied forces  military coordination office placed a helicopter at his disposal  to bring him to Kurdistan. However, Talabani changed his mind.    Barzani accused the PUK forces of killing all civilian and  military prisoners who belong to the DPK.    In his interview with Radio Monte Carlo, Mas'ud Barzani  admitted that the fighting has weakened the democratic process  in Kurdistan and has not enhanced the status of Iraqi Kurds in  the eyes of the western countries. On the contrary, the  fighting has embarrassed some of these countries. He emphasized  the need to stop the fighting.</p>

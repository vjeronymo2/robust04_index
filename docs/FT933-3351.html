			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Flat year for Goodman Fielder GOODMAN Fielder, the Australian food group, yesterday reported an 8.4 per cent increase to ADollars 117.2m (USDollars 77.1m) in profits after tax but before abnormal items. After abnormals, which made a large dent in 1991-92's profits, Goodman saw a total profit of ADollars 182m, compared with ADollars 49.5m last year. However, at the trading level, progress was more muted. Operating profit advanced by 0.2 per cent to ADollars 245m on sales 1.8 per cent higher at ADollars 3.98bn. A big jump for interest charges left pre-tax profits 1.4 per cent lower at ADollars 164.1m. Most divisions showed an improvement. The fall in pre-tax profits was due to a decline in profits from Australian baking and the timing of asset sales and acquisitions, which the group claimed cost ADollars 9.4m. GIO Australia, the insurance group, saw after-tax profits fall by 11.9 per cent to ADollars 103.1m in the year ended June.</p>

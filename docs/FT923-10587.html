			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Yugoslav Prime Minister says he will return to Sarajevo to try and stop the fighting Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Panic said yesterday he would again go to Sarajevo to try to stop the fighting between the Moslem, Croat and Serb factions, Reuter reports from London. Mr Panic was speaking after meeting Mr John Major, his British counterpart. Meanwhile, leaders of Bosnia's factions agreed to set up an international committee to help organise a ceasefire, exchange prisoners of war and oversee other humanitarian relief. However, they failed to agree to any political issues in three days of peace talks in London, said EC representative Jose Cutileiro. The biggest aid convoy to reach Sarajevo by road arrived in the besieged Bosnian capital yesterday. A United Nations spokesman said 21 UN trucks had arrived carrying 170 tonnes of desperately needed food supplies. The convoy took an overland route from the Adriatic coast, which UN officials hope could replace the expensive airlift to Sarajevo.</p>

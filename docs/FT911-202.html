			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Technology: Kodak's digital double A photocopier used to be just a photocopier: but not for much longer. The industry's largest manufacturers are about to reveal machines which act as computer printers, scanners and even facsimile machines, as well as perform the traditional role of copying sheets of text. The move is based on the concept that whether you print, scan or photocopy, you are simply replicating a series of little black squiggles between paper and computer. Leading the field are US-parented companies such as Xerox and Kodak. Today Kodak, which specialises in large photocopiers, will launch a copier which replicates images digitally, rather than optically. This, the company believes, will form the base technology around which a variety of office applications can be built. 'At the moment we are using the machine just to copy,' says Mike Mansell, manager of commercial and information marketing for Kodak and head of its copy products division. 'But the interesting thing is what we do in the future.' Because the machine scans the document and digitises the information before printing out the text and pictures, that digital information could, in future, be sent over the phone. This could lead, Mansell believes, to large photocopiers being used for an even wider variety of tasks. While most of the bigger machines are used today for large print runs, in future they could handle a mixture of jobs. Further ahead they could be used in conjunction with personal computers for manipulating text and images within a document - a computer graphic, a photo and a piece of text could be incorporated in the same document. Eventually Mansell envisages a situation where the Kodak machine launched today, called the 1570, forms the hub of a company's reprographics facilities. From there it could instruct local printer/copier units, in different places around the country, or the world, to print documents.</p>

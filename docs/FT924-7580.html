			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Public and private pay rises 'level' PAY RISES in the public sector are not outstripping those in the private sector but are now rising at the same rate, according to the latest pay bulletin from the Labour Research Department. The government is restricting all public-sector pay deals over the next year to a maximum of 1.5 per cent. The average pay rise in both private and public sectors was 4.1 per cent in the three months to October, down from 4.3 per cent in the three months to September. The figures are based on more than 600 settlement groups. Bargaining Report 122. Labour Research Department, 78 Blackfriars Road, London SE1 8HF.</p>

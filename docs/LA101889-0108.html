			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD SERIES;  </P> <P> OAKLAND ATHLETICS VS. SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS;  </P> <P> EXPERIENCE AT CANDLESTICK IS ONE REPORTER WILL NOT SOON FORGET  </P> <P> There are events one never forgets.  </P> <P> Anyone who was alive in 1963 remembers where he was when President Kennedy was  assassinated.  </P> <P> And anyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night for Game 3 of the World  Series will never forget.  </P> <P> I was in a trailer just outside the stadium, about to watch the telecast when  the earthquake hit. It was shortly after the network went on the air.  </P> <P> My immediate reaction was that a jet was flying very low overhead, but soon I  knew what was happening.  </P> <P> To me, the earthquake was not as bad as the Whittier quake in October, 1987,  mainly because I was awake this time.  </P> <P> I opened the door to the trailer and looked out. The stadium was shaking and  the special concrete joint -- one of several strategically spaced around the  top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage -- was doing was it was  designed to do. It was opening and closing as if the place was made of  cardboard instead of concrete.  </P> <P> A few people were running out of the stadium, but there did not seem to be  great alarm, because the quake did not last long.  </P> <P> I walked into the stadium to interview fans. And again, I sensed little panic.  </P> <P> Most people stayed in their seats, waiting to hear whether the game would be  postponed.  </P> <P> And later, when fans started leaving en masse, the reaction of those I talked  to varied. Those who were sitting in the upper deck seemed considerably more  shaken than those in the lower levels. LARRY STEWART  </P></p>

Replying a point of order regarding a statement of the  Egyptian diplomat about the presence of some of the Egyptian  nationals in Pakistan in the National Assembly Sunday evening,  Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar said, "the government has  taken a final decision that all such people whether they belong  to Egypt, Algeria or any other country would be extradited." He  told the House that Pakistan would not allow anybody to use its  soil for terrorist activities. The minister said that they  (Arab nationals) can go anywhere they want after being expelled  from Pakistan.    "We will not allow Pakistan to be used as a stick. We will  certainly not allow Egypt to let their nationals stay here and  then label us as terrorists. We will not allow this."    The attention of the govt was drawn by PKMAP's [Pukhtun Khwa  Milli Awami Party] Mahmood Khan Achakzai who while speaking on a  point of order, referred to an interview given by Mustafa  Hanafi, Ambassador of Egypt. Achkzai informed the House that  the Ambassador had disclosed that twenty Egyptians including ten  murderers were residing in Pakistan. One of these, he said was,  living inside Islamabad.    Interior Minister added that the government was in touch  with  the Embassy of Egypt in this regard. He said the Egyptian  diplomats were apprehensive about their (Arab Nationals) return  as they would be a nuisance to the Egyptian govt. "But we have  told them clearly that they had to leave Pakistan by January 31  along with all other Arabs would be allowed to go back to  Afghanistan if they so desired.    Maulana Faziur Rehman pleaded with the government that they  should, instead, give assurances to the countries of these Arabs  and NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] that Pakistan would  control these people. He pleaded that they should not be  returned to their respective countries for possible execution  there. He added that these Arabs who were now being labelled as  murderers were those that had come to Pakistan for the Afghan  Jihad.    In the past, this very issue had been raised by the media at  the Foreign Office. They were told that there had been no such  complaints from the Egyptian Embassy here. However, the  caretaker government had also taken up the issue and put  restrictions on all Arab Non Governmental Organisations housed  in Peshawar. The caretaker government had also ordered them to  leave the country.    Meanwhile, as thousands of Afghans gathered at the Torkham  border to enter Pakistan, the interior minister reiterated  Pakistan's position on the issue.    He said Pakistan would keep its border with Afghanistan  closed as there were several peaceful areas inside Afghanistan  where the people of Kabul could take refuge. He once again  reminded the House that the jihad was over. Turning to the  continued news bulletins from the BBC which spoke about the  plight of the refugees, the minister replied, "Jalalabad airport  is open. Flights can operate to take these refugees to the  United Kingdom if they so desire."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Notes on a Northern Journey" by staff reporter Lo Ping </F> (5012 0393): "State of Deng Xiaoping's Health and Controversy  Over His Public Appearance"]    [Text]Deng Xiaoping Has Contracted Myopathy in the  Leg    "One of the purposes of Deng Xiaoping's recent trip down  south (Shanghai and other places) was to improve his bodily  functions and find a cure for his rheumatic arthritis."    That is quoted from a report in the "Notes on a Northern  Journey" in the February 1994 issue of CHENG MING.    Rheumatoid arthritis can be categorized as a "disease of the  elderly" which is common and does not pose any threat to Deng's  health.    However, through diagnosis, it was concluded that Deng  Xiaoping had contracted myopathy in the leg. That is an  uncommon disease and more troublesome than ordinary rheumatoid  arthritis. Deng will accept medical treatment in both Western  and traditional Chinese medicine.    This news had its origins with Wan Li and Liu Huaqing.  <H3>  Wan Li and Liu Huaqing Testify That Deng Has Trouble With  His Legs </H3>   When Wan Li met veteran comrades in Beijing at the Great  Hall  of the People on 5 February, he said: "Comrade Xiaoping's  health is an issue of universal concern from the top tp the  bottom in China and also overseas. All men have to take the  last leg of the journey in life.... The Central Committee has  made special arrangements for the health of Comrade Xiaoping.  After a recent consultation by experts from various  departments, all of Comrade Xiaoping's bodily orrgans were found  to be normal as was his blood pressure and pulse. Although he is  approaching 90, his train of thought remains clear, a phenomenon  which experts believe to be rare at his age. The experts  proposed that as Deng is getting on in age, it was advisable  that he should use his brain less; otherwise, it would affect  his blood pressure, especially in the evening. Recently,  Comrade Xiaoping has contracted myopathy in the leg and finds it  difficult to walk long distances. Presently, he is accepting  medical treatment in both Western and traditional Chinese  medicine."    On 6 February, when Liu Huaqing feted old generals in  Beijing  at the Jingxi Guest House, he said: Our former Central Military  Commission chairman, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is in healthy  condition. The Central Committee has proposed that Comrade  Xiaoping cut back walking when he goes out. He has contracted  myopathy in his legs and is under medical treatment now. He  still likes to stroll for an hour or so every day. The Central  Committee has decided to reduce the effects on Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's rest as best it can.  <H5>  Veteran Cadres's Minds Are Overshadowed </H5>   When veteran cadres heard the briefings of Wan Li and Liu  Huaqing, they started gossiping in private. Although both Wan  Li and Liu Huaqing made remarks to ease their minds, some of the  veteran cadres' minds were overshadowed. Many people, both in  the government and the public, hoped that Deng's trouble with  his legs would not develop further. Others found it  uncomfortable to hear the word "myopathy." If they believed in  God they would certainly pray for Deng Xiaoping.    This reporter knew nothing about the word "myopathy" and  when  some people were terrified upon hearing it, this reporter was  reminded to consult a doctor about it. A physician from a  famous hospital said, myopathy is not terrible, not  life-threatening, and will not necessarily shorten one's  lifespan. However, there is no effective cure but some of the  symptoms can be alleviated. Should the disease be found in  one's lower limbs, it will affect one's ability to walk and one  is liable to tumble; this being the case, the patient must have  the support of others when he walks. Another physician gave a  similar explanation. By inference, he believed that the reason  why some people were terrified at the mere mention of "myopathy"  was that they had learned from XINHUA News Agency's internal  reference department: A Canadian women continuously demanded  "euthanasia" because of contracting myopathy and committed  "suicide" with a doctor's aid in the end. The physician said  that such cases are rare. The physicians said that they had not  received news of Deng Xiaoping contracting myopathy; but this  reporter personally believes that, had they learned the inside  story, they would not have been worried about Deng.  <H5>  The Central Committee Suggests Deng Xiaoping Curtail Walking </H5>   It is said that Deng Xiaoping was very confident in medical  treatment in both Western and Chinese traditional medicine. The  Central Committee suggested that he curtail his walking;  however, this stubborn elderly person has insisted on doing some  exercises outdoors. In the medical treatment group comprising  the experts, opinions varied. One opinion was that he should  cut back walking as much as possible; and the other opinion was  that he could continue walking under the condition that he did  not become exhausted. Deng Xiaoping believed in the second  opinion. That was because he would not easily bow before  difficulties, including diseases; his character has decided that.    Nevertheless, Deng Xiaoping's condition is really poorer  than it was before. A CPC General Office source said that it  was on the schedule that Deng Xiaoping would visit suburban  Shanghai's Jinshang Petrochemical Industrial Works and  Fengxian's Nanqiao on 5 February and he arrived in Fengxian that  very morning. Suddenly he did not feel well and the doctor  accompanying him promptly ordered the suspension of the  inspection tour. That evening, his temperature rose to 39.2  degrees Centigrade and he had symptoms of acute pneumonia. On  the morning of 6 February, Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, Wen Jiabao,  and Li Desheng took a special plane to Shanghai to visit Deng.  Later, they got word that Deng must rest quietly but was not in  any danger; then they took a flight back to Beijing.    A source has disclosed: On 8 February, the Central Committee  made the decision that Deng Xiaoping meet leading members of  Shanghai Municipality and extend New Year greetings to the  Shanghai people at the reception hall of the guest house in  which he was being put up; however, Deng Xiaoping opposed the  decision, saying: I can still walk. He insisted on meeting the  municipality's leading members at the smaller auditorium of the  Shanghai Municipal Party Committee.  <H3>  Ding Guangeng Indicated That Allowing Deng Xiaoping To  Appear on TV in a Senile and Weak Condition Was an Inappropriate  Decision </H3>   On 9 February, the television newscast of Deng Xiaoping,  walking with the support of his two daughters on either side was  broadcast across China, instantly rousing repercussions and  anxieties. That very evening, Ding Guangeng indicated to Wang  Ruilin, CPC General Office Deng Xiaoping Office director, and Wu  Bangguo, Shanghai Municipal Party Committee secretary, that the  arrangements had been inappropriate and had resulted in bad  effects. According to a CPC General Office source, on 14  February, in the wake of relaying across China the TV newscast  of Deng Xiaoping's thin, pallid, and dull appearance while  meeting Shanghai municipal leading members to extend New Year  greetings, the Central Authorities and related departments had  received some 3,500 telegrams and letters from all departments,  localities, organizations, schools, army units, and foreign  friends, in which their concerns were shown for Deng Xiaoping's  condition, while enthusiastically wishing him good health and  longevity.  <H3>  Jiang Zemin: The Political Bureau and I should Bear Certain  Responsibility </H3>   Regarding the arrangement for the senile and weak appearance  of Deng Xiaoping on TV, Jiang Zemin examined himself in the  written instructions on a report. He indicated that criticism  had come from inside the party, the Army, and people at home,  who believed that the central authorities had made an  inappropriate decision in making those arrangements; at the same  time, Jiang acknowledged and indicated that there were problems  in the central authorities' related departments in making the  arrangements and that the Political Bureau and Jiang himself  should bear certain responsibility. Regarding the effects, to  some extent resulting from this, it was imperative to make some  assessment and have some understanding.  <H3>  Bo Yibo Gives Explanation of Deng Xiaoping's TV Appearance  on 9 February </H3>   It is learned that Deng Xiaoping arrived in Wuxi's Taihu in  early December last year, heading for Shanghai later on. During  this period of around two months, he was under medical treatment  while meeting leading members of the party, government, and the  military, conducting inspection tours at the same time. It is  learned that at a gathering with veteran cadres in Shanghai, Bo  Yibo made some explanation focusing on veteran cadres' opinions  opposing Deng Xiaoping's 9 February appearance on TV: Comrade  Deng Xiaoping was too tired; he would never stop working. He  did everything for the party's cause, offered suggestions, and  gave guidance to the new Central leadership tier.... Comrade  Xiaoping would not rest, that was determined by his party  spirit, character, and enterprising spirit. We have all  persuaded him not to overtire himself, including [Jiang] Zemin,  [Liu] Huaqing, Wan Li, [Yang] Shangkun, and Gu Mu.    It is learned that on 19 February, Deng Xiaoping left  Shanghai for Shandong's Qingdao on a special train. He talked  with Wu Bangguo and others for some 20 minutes at the railway  station; consequently, seven trains had to alter their departure  times from Shanghai station.</p>

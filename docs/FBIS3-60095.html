Gerhard S. (32) and Oswald L. (32),  both from Vienna, had offered 120 grams of the drug, worth  100,000 Austrian schillings, to an undercover investigator.    Gerhard S. had bought 400 grams of cocaine in Rio de Janeiro  for the equivalent of 60,000 schillings and smuggled the drugs  to Austria. He sold some 70 grams in Vienna and consumed  another portion of the cocaine himself. Another 148 grams were  seized during a house search in Vienna's fifth district last  year, as a result of which Gerhard S. spent three weeks in  prison.</p>

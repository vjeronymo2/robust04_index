			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOLS NOT EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH DYSLEXICS  </P> <P> Recent estimates indicate that between 10% to 15% of school-age children have  some sort of learning disability.  </P> <P> And 75% of juvenile delinquents have a reading disability. Dyslexia does not  discriminate. Rich, poor, high-I.Q., gifted athletes and nice kids can be  afflicted with this learning inconvenience, as I term it. Learning disabled  means unable. Dyslexics are able, they just learn differently.  </P> <P> Russell White (Sept. 26) is yet another product of a school system that is  inept, poorly funded, overpopulated and poorly staffed to deal with the  Specific Language Disability (dyslexic) student.  </P> <P> BRUCE KING, Costa Mesa  </P></p>

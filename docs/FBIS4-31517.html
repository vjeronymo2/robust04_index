			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded; Chretien speaks </F> in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation;]    [Text] [Announcer] Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien  visited the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] Canadian troops in  Visoko and met Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in Sarajevo today.  Nedzad Leko has the report.    [Leko] After the talks, the reporters were first addressed  by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.    [Chretien] "The prime minister and I discussed the extremely  complex situation. Everybody wants peace, but peace is hard to  achieve. The prime minister explained all the difficulties on  the road to peace: the history, the geography, the geopolitical  situation; so this has been a very useful visit for me. Not only  did I have the opportunity to meet the Canadian troops on their  peace mission, but I also visited Sarajevo."    [Leko] Asked by reporters about Canada's stance on the  lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army,  Jean Chretien said:    [Chretien] "In our view, the lifting of the embargo would  not  lead to peace."    [Leko] The reporters were interested in whether Canada would  be ready to send additional troops, especially if France decided  to withdraw.    [Chretien] "We made no commitments regarding either their  deployment or withdrawal. Of course, if a peace deal is  concluded, other countries -- Canada as well, perhaps -- will  send additional troops."    [Leko] Prime Minister Silajdzic then commented on the  contents of his talks with the Canadian prime minister.    [Silajdzic] ``The first and basic divergence of views  concerns the embargo issue. The prime minister believes that the  lifting of the arms embargo would heighten the risk of the  outbreak of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, while we believe that the  embargo is illegal [words indistinct] -- if an illness is  treated with a certain medicine for two years and the results  are disastrous, as they are, then the medicine should be changed.    ``On the other hand, [words indistinct] to achieve peace. If  we manage to achieve peace, there will be no problem. We are  asking what happens if we do not achieve peace. Of course, the  aggressor does not want peace and he is showing this perfectly  clearly.    ``Our question to the prime minister is what to do if we do  not achieve peace. Will we again disperse, as we did after the  London conference, and say no deal or will we point our finger  at the culprit and define the measures to be taken by the  international community in the event that the aggressor rejects  the peace plan.    "We believe that the supervision of our border with Serbia  and Montenegro has come two years too late; if the international  community had taken these measures two years ago, things would  not be what they are today. It is still not too late for the  international community to take serious measures for controlling  the border with Serbia and Montenegro with the aim of stopping  the aggression against our country."</p>

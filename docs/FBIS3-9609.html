			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamiz Deronjic from Brcko] </F>   [Text] [Word indistinct] enemy air force, despite the  resolutions of the UN Security Council, is constantly using the  air corridors above temporarily occupied Brcko [words  indistinct] chetnik pilots. At 1830 last night a Serbian  helicopter that was flying on the Bjeljina-Pelagicevo route  approached our positions and this [words indistinct] fire was  opened. [Words indistinct] seriously damaged it was forced to  land in temporarily occupied Brcko.    The demonstration of power of the enemy artillery on the  Brcko plain in the absence of any attempts of infantry  breakthroughs over the last few days reveals another chronic  problem of the aggressor -- lack of manpower and low morale.  According to our reliable sources, the chetnik soldiers on  temporarily occupied Brcko territory, who have long been  refusing to go to the front lines or into attacks, are now  demanding that their commanders walk in front of them, because  their commanders, infected with a feverish desire for military  rank and prestige, have been marching them across minefields to  satisfy their own ambitions.</p>

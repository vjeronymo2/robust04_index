			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 12 (BTA) -- The radiation impact of the  nuclear power plant at Kozloduy (on the Danube) is weaker than  the natural background radiation, a joint news conference of  representatives of the power engineering industry and the  Ministry of the Environment was told today.    The state of environment in Bulgaria is alarming. Last year  nearly 900,000 tonnes of sulfur dioxide were thrown up in the  air. The major source of sulfur dioxide pollution is the  Bulgarian brown coal, especially the coal mined in the  Maritsa-Iztok area. However, the power stations using brown  coal as fuel account for 31.62 percent of the electricity output  in this country, the news conference was told.    According to power producers, bringing power engineering  into  line with the Bulgarian environment legislation will cost a lot  of money--every Bulgaria will have to pay 1,500 leva a year  until 2010.    According to experts of the Ministry of the Environment, the  power engineering industry is hardly the sole air polluter.  Exhaust emissions pollute the air in the big cities with carbon  dioxide. Measurements show that exhaust emissions account for 70  percent of the air pollution in Sofia.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Bidders 'rigged PSA contracts' GROUNDS maintenance companies have been rigging prices on government contracts worth Pounds 10m a year, the Office of Fair Trading, the public-spending watchdog, said yesterday. Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, accused the companies of operating an 'unlawful' secret price-rigging and market-sharing agreement, and said he would refer it to the Restrictive Practices Court. The court has the power to ban any such agreement if it decides that it operates against the public interest. The OFT said the price rigging had been taking place 'since at least 1976' and involved 11 companies. It related to contracts granted by the Property Services Agency, the manager of central government property, for the maintenance of military bases and other government properties. The PSA alerted the OFT to the possible existence of the covert agreement in a 1990 report on investigations of tendering patterns. Sir Bryan said: 'Collusion and lack of competition between tenderers inevitably lead to higher prices and poorer services.' The OFT said the companies seemed to have been engaging in two kinds of restrictive practices. There was an agreement between 11 of them that if one wanted to keep a contract, the others would submit higher bids when the contract was put out to tender. A sub-group of four companies were said by the OFT to have agreed not to submit any bids if a contract held by one of them, which it wanted to retain, was put out to tender. Mr Ian Mitchell, chairman of Mitchell and Struthers, one of the companies accused by the OFT, said: 'I would certainly say there is no agreement as far as we are concerned.' Mr Peter Wilson, a director of JV Strong, another accused company, said: 'We are happy to confirm that the practices referred to by the OFT have not been operated by existing management and won't be in future.' The other companies accused are G Burley and Sons, Basil H Childe, Cliff Evans (Knockin), R Hewision and Sons, Landscape Maintenance, Tonrin Contractors, Turfsoil, Tyler Environmental Services, and Welbourn Sportsgrounds.</p>

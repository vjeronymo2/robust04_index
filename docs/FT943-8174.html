			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: China refines equity market rules China said this week it was refining regulations to further liberalise access to its equities markets. But foreign securities houses warned it would take time to be completed. Chinese stock regulators confirmed they were opening the way for local investors to purchase B shares, reserved for foreigners. They were also preparing guidelines to permit foreign institutions access to the A share market for local investors. China, in its efforts to bolster its equities markets, faces technical difficulties broadening access to its A and B share markets in preparation for amalgamation. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the body responsible for overseeing the markets, is grappling with the complex issues, including levels of foreign ownership. China said the new regulations would restrict foreign ownership of listed companies to 35 per cent, but securities analysts warned the task of monitoring ownership levels would present difficulties. Several companies listed in Shanghai have floated more than 35 per cent of their equity on the B share market. In the case of Dazhong Taxi, for example, B shares account for 47 per cent. The bulk is thought to be in the hands of foreign institutions. China's plans to allow Sino-foreign joint-venture fund management institutions to be established to channel funds into A shares will further complicate establishing foreign ownership levels. Access by local Chinese to B shares, under new categories of investors to be approved by China's securities authorities, would add to difficulties of assessing foreign ownership. B shares are denominated in yuan, but traded in US and Hong Kong dollars. Regulations permitting local investors access to B shares will be attached to the corporate law which came into effect on July 1 last year. B shares are being referred to in Chinese legislation as 'domestically-listed overseas-invested stocks'. China's stock regulators have considered a range of options to enliven the country's flagging markets which lost more than 80 per cent of their value between the high-water mark in early 1993 and July this year. Measures announced late in July to lift the markets, including a freeze on new listing and an injection of funds, sparked a rush in the first week of August. This resulted in the Shanghai A share index rising by more than 100 per cent in the week before slipping back. At the same time, the CSRC announced a target of UDollars 1bn in new B share listings this year. Shanghai's B share index has strengthened by about 15 per cent since mid-year, after falling 40 per cent since January.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGEL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> BICHETTE CONTINUES HOT HITTING  </P> <P> Angels Stadium was witness to another massive home run by the Angels' massive  rookie outfielder, Dante Bichette, Saturday.  </P> <P> This one, Bichette's second in as many days, was a fourth-inning grand slam off  the Seattle Mariners' Mark Langston, a feat that brought the right-field  bleacherites to their feet for a simple but rousing chorus as Bichette trotted  out to his position in the top of the fifth:  </P> <P> "Dante's Gonna Stay."  </P> <P>  Too bad baseball rosters aren't assembled by popular vote.  </P> <P> By Angel Manager Doug Rader's admission, Bichette has done everything he has  had to do this spring. Hit for average? Bichette is batting .349. Hit for  power? His four home runs lead the Angels. Drive in runs? Bichette and Devon  White share the club lead in that department with 13 runs batted in apiece.  </P> <P> Bichette is even fielding, which had been a major blemish on his scouting  report. In the sixth inning Saturday, Bichette raced back to the wall to pick  off, backhanded, a drive by Greg Briley, turning a potential double into a long  sacrifice fly.  </P> <P> All this . . . and it still might not be enough to earn him a roster spot on  opening day.  </P> <P> Ask Rader about Bichette's bid to break into the Angels' congested outfield  alignment and he'll respond with a mock grimace. "Why do you got to bring that  up?" he says.  </P> <P> Selecting an outfield was supposed to have been the least of Rader's worries.  White, Chili Davis and Claudell Washington were going to play every day. Tony  Armas, who hit 13 home runs as a reserve in 1988, was going to back them up. A  done deal.  </P> <P> Bichette, coming into camp with the one-year-away tag, has cramped Rader's  style, no doubt, but the manager continues to hold to his original line of  thinking.  </P> <P> "I'm very much against players going into spring training and making the club  out of the blue," Rader said. "Spring training is a very difficult place to  accurately appraise talent. The mistakes you can make outweigh the correct  guesses, 110-1.  </P> <P> " . . . When you look at what (Bichette) did at triple-A last year, there  certainly was no indication that he could have a spring like this. It's like  he's gone from a prospect to a can't-miss prospect overnight.  </P> <P> "I want to make it clear he's not out of the picture. But based on what he did  at Edmonton last year, he still needs to have a solid year there."  </P> <P> Last year, at age 24, Bichette batted .267 with 14 home runs and 81 RBIs in 132  games. "And that's in a hitter's league," Rader noted.  </P> <P> Bichette, not surprisingly, is not particularly keen on spending another summer  north of border and south of the major leagues.  </P> <P> "It would be a big disappointment, going back to Edmonton," Bichette said.  "That would mean I'd been at Edmonton three years in a row. It would seem like  I'm going nowhere."  </P> <P> Bichette said he would take Anaheim any day, even if it means sitting on the  bench most days. "I've looked at both sides of it and being in the big leagues  outweighs playing every day in Edmonton."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> The Angels evened their record at 8-8 with a 7-6 victory over Seattle. The  Angels totaled 10 hits, including Dante Bichette's grand slam and a two-run  home run by Devon White. White went two-for-four to raise his batting average  to .465. "He's going to be tired when this year's over," Angel Manager Doug  Rader said, "because I can't see playing anybody out there but him." . . . Tony  Armas intrepidly ventured out to first base for Round 2, after committing two  errors in one play during Round 1. Armas' Saturday line: no errors, two slick  plays, including a diving stop of a sharp grounder by Harold Reynolds. . . .  Seattle pitcher Mark Langston was forced out of the game after taking a Dick  Schofield line drive off his right ankle. Preliminary X-rays showed no fracture  and Langston limped away with a bad bruise.  </P></p>

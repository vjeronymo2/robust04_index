			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hermes rises 56% to FFr85.1m Hermes, one of France's leading luxury goods groups, yesterday announced a 56 per cent increase in interim net profits to FFr85.1m (Dollars 15.87m) in the first six months of 1994 from FFr54.6m in the same period of last year. The news of healthy first-half profits growth from Hermes, which last year ended decades of family dominance by floating on the French secondary market, continues the positive trend in the luxury goods sector. The industry was hit by the economic recession of the early 1990s but has staged a sharp resurgence since last autumn. LVMH, another famous name in French luxury goods, last week reported strong profits growth of 35 per cent to FFr1.26bn during the first half of this year. The only negative note among the large luxury groups was struck on Friday by Asprey, the London-based business specialising in super-rich clients, which issued a profits warning because customers have spent less. Hermes, which has a broader customer base at the upper end of the luxury market, was relatively resilient to the recession. Sales rose 24.3 per cent to FFr1.53bn during the interim period from FFr1.23bn at the same time last year. Operating profits increased 47.8 per cent to FFr220m from FFr148.8m. The group said it anticipated continued growth in sales and profits for the full year.</p>

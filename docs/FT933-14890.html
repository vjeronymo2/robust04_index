			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Mr Yeltsin's dwindling power RUSSIA'S President Boris Yeltsin insisted that he went to last week's summit of the Group of Seven industrial nations in Tokyo as leader of a great power. But at home, the state he represents is looking weaker by the day. Government remains gripped by debilitating, and overlapping, power struggles between president and parliament, centre and regions. Mr Yeltsin battles to gain acceptance of a complex new constitution, and in the process hands away an increasing array of powers and rights from the centre. And one by one, Russia's regions appear to be seizing their own destiny: in the past 10 days alone, the parliaments of the Far Eastern region and of Sverdlovsk in the Urals have claimed the status of republics within Russia, thus asserting greater economic independence an escalating battle between the regions and the centre for control over resources. In theory, the outcome of this process could be violent anarchy, as ever-smaller units of population or territory dispute the legitimacy or effectiveness of rule from Moscow and take matters into their own hands. In practice, it has not yet come to that. But to prevent the current mess turning into something a great deal worse, Russia obviously needs greater clarity in the relations between its multifarious centres of power. Ideally, this would be provided by a new constitution setting out in brief, general but unequivocal terms the respective rights and duties of the Russian state and its subjects. Unfortunately, this is far from what seems to be emerging from the constitutional debate which is now reaching a climax. Empty rights Russia cannot continue with its present, Soviet-era, constitution, patched up with liberal additions. Its main flaw, graphically demonstrated at succeeding Congresses of People's Deputies over the past year, is that it gave ample but empty rights to the Supreme Soviet (legislature) and made little provision for an executive president. Despite the popular mandate with which he was elected in 1991, Mr Yeltsin's attempts to run a democratic presidential republic with a communist 'parliamentary' constitution were doomed to end in confrontation. The problem is that this struggle cannot begin to be decisively resolved without adoption of a new, more legitimate constitution - and that such a constitution cannot legally be adopted without the agreement of the Supreme Soviet, a body which would thus be voting itself out of existence. Though Mr Yeltsin's hand has strengthened, especially since the endorsement of the April referendum, he is still in the position of having to act unconstitutionally in order to put the state on a democratic base - a move he has seemed prepared to make several times but from which he has always backed away. Structural problems The important question is whether the constitution as it is emerging is the right one for Russia and will stand the test of time. It is admirably dedicated to human and civil rights; underpins the right to private property; and pledges allegiance to independent judiciary and media. But it is too long on detail, some of it contradictory. It gives citizens too many economic rights like free medical care, employment and minimum wages which Russia cannot fulfil. Worst of all, it does not address the deep structural problems left behind by the Soviet state, simply accepting the Lenin-Stalin territorial division of the country into regions and 'ethno-territorial' republics and granting the latter more rights than the former. Small wonder that the regions are now seeking to redress the imbalance by declaring themselves as republics too, and that Russia's most numerically important minorities - the Caucasians, Central Asians, Balts and Ukrainians - complain they have been left without guarantees of their linguistic and other cultural rights. All this may not prevent Mr Yeltsin from forcing through his constitution in something resembling its present form. But it is hard to see such a document settling Russia's chronic constitutional uncertainties once and for all. As they promise yet more money to assist the country's political and economic transformation - and to shore up Mr Yeltsin's centre - G7 leaders would do well to remember that on both fronts, the evolution is going to be both protracted and messy. It is in no one's interest that Russia should disintegrate, but in the end no one may be able to stop it doing so.</p>

"He went down without anything to break the  fall. Then he started to get up again, like he did in our game. But then  (Sunday) he went into convulsions. I was very frightened then."  </P> <P> Gathers fainted at the free-throw line early in the second half in the December  game against Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Pimm, sitting at the opposite end of the court, did not immediately think  anything was seriously wrong with Gathers, who left the game at that point and  did not return.  </P> <P> "I thought it was the heat," Pimm said. "It was really hot in there. I was  sweating like crazy. I thought it was heat prostration."  </P> <P> But while watching a videotape of the game later that night, Pimm saw Gathers'  fall from a different perspective and got a scare.  </P> <P> "Our camera was set up on the end line, under the basket (Gathers was shooting  at)," Pimm said. "On our tape, you could see that his eyes were closed and that  he just crumpled. I was surprised that it wasn't something more than an  irregular heartbeat. I mean, the way he went down -- boom. . . . His eyes  closed, and he went down in a hump, quickly. It was frightening, like his brain  just shut off."  </P> <P> Pimm said he talked to Loyola coaches the next week and sent a note to Gathers,  who underwent a series of medical tests before returning to the lineup on Dec.  30.  </P> <P> "When I saw that he was in the hospital getting those tests, I thought to  myself, 'Good. If he does have a problem, they'll find it,' " Pimm said. "I  mean, Los Angeles is a big city and it has great medical people."  </P> <P> His thoughts now?  </P> <P> "This sure makes you think," he said. "I mean, we give kids physical exams,  monitor their food and rest. I'm sure Loyola was doing all of those things.  It's just that sometimes you don't have control. . . . I'm just really shocked,  because of the type of kid Hank was. He played so hard. He was a thoroughbred."  </P></p>

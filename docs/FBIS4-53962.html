			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 23 KYODO -- Negotiations between  senior Japanese and U.S. officials went into day four Monday for  what appeared a make-or-break session to seek a breakthrough in  the stalled "framework" trade talks between the two countries.    The talks are now at "a delicate stage," the top Japanese  Government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai,  said in Tokyo Monday.    A top official at the Japanese Foreign Ministry also  suggested that the talks in Washington have moved into a  critical stage, saying the two sides will see whether they can  "make it or not" after Monday's session.    Japanese negotiators -- headed by Deputy Foreign Minister  Sadayuki Hayashi and Vice Minister of International Trade and  Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu -- headed for the apparent showdown  on Monday after a top-level government strategy session in Tokyo.    Japanese officials said Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata met with  senior government officials on Monday morning on the trade  negotiations.    "We are vigorously trying to break an impasse in the  negotiations," Kumagai told reporters in Tokyo following the  Hata meeting.    Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa may visit the United  States, depending on the outcome of Monday's talks, Vice Foreign  Minister Kunihiko Saito said.    Monday's session came after the two sides met for one hour  Saturday in what officials said was focused on "clarifications"  on a Japanese position for resuming the trade negotiations under  the framework agreement concluded last July.    The trade talks, which are aimed at widening foreign access  to the Japanese market and paring down Japan's vast trade  surplus, broke down in February after Tokyo rejected  Washington-proposed yardsticks to gauge progress in Japanese  imports.    Among the industry sectors covered under the framework  accord  are Japanese Government procurement of medical and  telecommunications equipment, trade in autos and auto parts and  the Japanese insurance market.    Japanese officials said Eisuke Sakakibara, a senior Finance  Ministry official in charge of insurance negotiations, headed to  Washington to help with the talks.    No high-ranking officials from the Finance Ministry have  attended the talks so far.</p>

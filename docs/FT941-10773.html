			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: A question of ownership - Robert Rice asks whether financial documents attract copyright protection When Richemont, the Swiss tobacco to luxury goods group, reshuffled its assets last autumn to produce two separately focused businesses, Rothmans International and Vendome Luxury Group, copyright notices appeared on the inside cover pages of the listing particulars in the name of Compagnie Financiere Richemont AG. Mr Frederick Mostert, Richemont's intellectual property counsel, believes this is the first time that a company has openly claimed copyright protection for one of its financial documents. Richemont's move raises a question increasingly of concern to the financial community on both sides of the Atlantic. Can copyright subsist in financial documents such as prospectuses, offering circulars, listing particulars and other financial documents required for public disclosure purposes or for filing with a stock exchange? The issue has become controversial, as companies that have spent considerable time and money on developing new financial products increasingly look for ways of protecting their investment in intellectual property. Certainly copyright protection exists for intellectual products in other areas of professional services, such as architects' plans, barristers' opinions, cartographers' maps, scientists' laboratory test sheets, trade catalogues and listings. So why not for financial documents? The matter has never come before the English courts, but in the US there has been a limited amount of litigation for infringement of copyright in financial products. In 1982, in a case brought by Dow Jones, a court ruled that a list of stocks in an index was protected by copyright. In 1985 Merritt Forbes, a securities underwriter and marketer, which had registered a copyright for its reoffering circulars and supplements for tax-exempt municipal bonds, successfully sued Newman Investment Securities and others for infringing the copyright by using substantially copied documents in an offering. And last year a number of actions for infringement of copyrighted insurance forms was heard in US courts. The increasing use of trademarks and service marks for new financial products such as Lyons (Liquid Yield Option Notes), which is a trademark of Merrill Lynch, and ABC Securities, which is a registered service mark of Kidder Peabody, also points to the increasing desire of companies to protect their intellectual creations. But in spite such developments, the extent to which copyright can subsist in financial documents remains largely untested. Copyright can subsist in financial documents to the extent that they constitute original works of authorship, according to an article in the European Intellectual Property Review by Mr Christopher Morcom QC, one of the UK's leading intellectual property lawyers, Mr Roger Zissu, president of the US Copyright Society and a partner of New York law firm Weiss Dawid Fross Zelnick &amp; Lehrman, and Mr Mostert. But there are limits to the material used in financial documents which can benefit from protection. They add that, while under both English and US law financial documents generally qualify for protection as original 'literary works', the idea behind a financial product cannot be copyrighted. Protection extends only to the way that idea is expressed. As a result, to the extent that financial documents incorporate accounting methods, financial systems or legal concepts, they can be freely used by others, provided they are not slavishly copied. Facts also cannot benefit from protection, so financial data contained in balance sheets or income statements can be used freely. And there is no protection for standard wording or boiler-plate provisions in common use in the financial industry. But in all other respects, provided a financial document constitutes the expression of an original work, it will attract copyright protection whether or not it is compiled from public sources and whether or not it includes a number of standard provisions, say the authors. Infringement of copyright in financial documents will depend on the facts of each case. If there has been slavish copying of substantial parts of a document, the issue should be clear. Where the language and order of an original document have been changed, the issue may be less obvious. If the copyright owner can prove the alleged infringer has made use of the original work and, despite changing the language, has taken 'the heart or essence' of a copyrighted work, it might be possible to establish an infringement. If, on the other hand, an alleged infringer has produced a document through original work using other public material and not by copying, there will be no infringement, even if the contents are similar in some respects. According to Mr Zissu, in cases that are too close to call, the outcome is likely to be influenced by the court's sense of where the balance of fairness lies between the parties. He points out, however, that although judges may be influenced in their decision by a sense of fair play none is likely to admit to it. One of the most controversial areas of this debate is the question of ownership of the copyright in the documents and the right to use copyrighted material in subsequent documents, says Mr Mostert. As a general rule, copyright vests in the author. But what is the position when a group of companies produces a document setting out ideas for a financial reconstruction, and sends it to a merchant bank or law firm for advice and revision? The production of a derivative document should not affect the copyright in the original. The lawyer or banker would not be free to copy the original document or use its contents to prepare derivative works for other clients. But what if the derivative document is sufficiently original to merit its own copyright, or the contributions of the original compiler and the lawyer who revises the original document cannot be separated, so that the revised document becomes a work of joint authorship? Under English law, says Mr Morcom, when the work is prepared by a lawyer or a banker the usual position is that the author retains any copyright in the work, subject to an implied licence for the person for whom it was prepared to use it for the purpose for which he or she requested it. However, where the work is derived from copyright material prepared and supplied by the client and the law firm or bank is being paid for preparing it, it may be an implied term of the contract of engagement that copyright in the derivative work is assigned to the client. The position is broadly similar in the US. The authors stress, however, that each case will turn on its facts. It is this uncertainty that is beginning to concern lawyers, bankers and their corporate clients. There is no doubt that copyright in financial documents is more on people's minds, says Mr Morcom. The ease with which documents can be stored on databases and reproduced has made them consider the issue more carefully. 'In a recession where everyone is looking to cut costs, there must be a temptation to save time by taking shortcuts,' he says. So will litigation follow? 'The issue is very controversial in the financial community,' says Mr Zissu. 'Someone's going to sue for breach of copyright in financial documents in the next year or two.'</p>

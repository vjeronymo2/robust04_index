			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / UN troops kill 12 in Somalia PAKISTANI troops serving with the United Nations operation in Somalia killed at least 12 people yesterday when they opened fire on a 4,000-strong demonstration. Supporters of Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, the warlord whose forces the UN is attempting to disarm, were protesting peacefully in the centre of the capital Mogadishu. The shootings followed two nights of US-led air strikes that crippled Gen Aideed's clandestine weapons stockpiles. The operation was authorised by the UN Security Council after Aideed gunmen killed 23 Pakistani Blue Helmets last weekend. The actions of the UN forces have buried its humanitarian mission in Somalia. Mogadishu is now a city besieged by a multinational occupation army. Gen Aideed's supporters in the south of the clan-divided capital are stunned and angry. Tanks patrol the streets. Helicopters swoop down to disperse crowds. Lorry-loads of detained men, women and children are being corralled at the grounds of the former university, now a US military centre. UN tanks rolled by and ignored pleas for help from the many wounded in yesterday's shootings. On Saturday Pakistani troops fired into a crowd after stones were thrown. Their shots killed one Somali and wounded a woman and a man. The woman died later at Benadir hospital, where the injured were being operated on without anaesthetic on makeshift wooden tables swarming with flies. The heavy-handedness of the Pakistani contingent has been a leading cause of rising tension and hostility against the UN in the capital. Brigadier Ikram ul-Hasan, commander of the 4,000 Pakistani peacekeeping troops in the Somali capital, told a press conference yesterday that he was investigating yesterday's incident. 'The simple fact is that gunmen use women and children as human shields,' he said. The brigadier said he did not think his troops were an inflammatory presence. Nor did he think there had been a violation of the UN's rules of engagement. Other UN military spokesmen have refused to comment. But the French relief agency Medecins sans Frontieres, one of the few still operating in the capital, described yesterday's killings as monstrous. At the hospital, a doctor said he was sickened by the events: 'The UN has started another war in Somalia. The people are tired of war. Even if they kill Aideed, there are thousands of other Aideeds out there to take his place.' The midnight bombings were undertaken with surgical precision to avoid civilian casualties. US Cobra helicopters and slow-flying aircraft picked out three armament sites and Gen Aideed's radio station during the first strike over Mogadishu on Saturday. The bombers returned early yesterday to destroy what the UN claimed was a 'veritable fortress' containing weapons, ammunition and armoured vehicles. It belonged to Mr Osman Ato, Gen Aideed's financier. The explosion lit up the night in the blacked-out city. Later, a building held by Pakistani peacekeepers came under heavy rocket attack from Gen Aideed's gunmen. Reporters visiting the bombed site yesterday saw no evidence of burned-out ammunition stockpiles. Mr Ato claims he stored only fuel and spare parts there. Gen Aideed was also at the site. 'This is an unjust and criminal act against Somali people,' he said and called for world condemnation of the human rights violations by Pakistani troops. He said he would not hand over those responsible for the June 5 killing of Pakistani troops: 'I will remain with my people'. Mr Jonathan Howe, UN special envoy to Somalia, says the warlord still has an obligation to 'provide an explanation of who ordered and conducted the gruesome killing, mutilation and torture of Pakistani peacekeepers'. Gen Cevik Bir, the Turkish commander of the 18,300 UN forces in Somalia, said the air raids were a warning to Somalia's warlords that the UN was prepared to act firmly. 'If the principal (warlords) are eliminated the Somali people will be on our side,' he said, The military offensive against Gen Aideed risks transforming the UN into a new colonial power, and Somalia into a reluctant trustee.</p>

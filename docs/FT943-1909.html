			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Start is made on the long road to rebuild Beirut - The first contracts will soon be awarded to transform the shattered city Mr Elias Hrawi, Lebanon's president, yesterday cemented in place a symbolic foundation stone to mark the formal start to the reconstruction of Beirut, a 25-year, multi-billion-dollar project which bills itself as 'the major urban redevelopment project of the 1990s'. Mr Hrawi laid the stone near the foot of the bullet-ridden statue of the Lebanese martyrs in Place des Martyrs, where Lebanon's civil war began almost two decades ago. But as the recent transformation of that square amply demonstrates - more than 150 adjacent buildings have been razed in the last two months  - the work of rebuilding Beirut's core has, in fact, begun. According to Mr Nasser Chammaa, chairman and general manager of Solidere, the property company which owns and is to develop central Beirut, the first big contract in the redevelopment will be awarded within weeks. Mr Chammaa said the initial package was likely to be awarded to a joint venture between the local Moawad Group and Consorzio Co-operative Construzioni, the Italian construction company, which submitted the lowest of 13 bids for the first stage of the infrastructure work on the 1.8m square metres of central Beirut to be developed by Solidere. This first Dollars 63.7m contract will cover construction of ring roads around the central district, tunnels, bridges, internal roads, water and waste systems and all power and telecommunications infrastructure. Mr Chammaa said the eventual cost of the work, to be completed in two and a half years, could rise to Dollars 80m. He said demolition work in the centre was six months ahead of schedule and should be completed by February. A further 150 buildings are to be demolished and renovation work on 266 others will begin next month. He said eight contracts for restoration and some rebuilding worth more than Dollars 100m in total had already been let. 'You'll see buildings start rising in about six months, and these should be finished in the next 2 1/2 years,' he said. Mr Chammaa expects a total of Dollars 55m further to be spent on infrastructure within the Beirut central district, but an additional Dollars 350m on reclaiming a total of 608,000 square metres of landfill to extend the present corniche north of the city centre. This work, which will require at least 10 years for some of the organic waste presently making up the landfill already in place to settle, will open up land both for 290,000 square metres of development plots for Solidere and a recreational and marina complex. Bid qualification for the initial contract to provide sea protection is in progress, and the award will be made in the next two months. The Lebanese government recently agreed to extend the landfill by 150,000 square metres to the present total as a means of reimbursing Solidere in kind for the cost of infrastructure work it is undertaking in the city centre. Solidere's working capital was raised in a Dollars 1.8bn share issue to establish the company earlier this year. Meanwhile CDR, the main contracting agent responsible for redeveloping the rest of Lebanon, said more than 400 contracts were under way for power, housing, telecommunications, transport infrastructure, schools, water and waste systems, and claimed to be on course to bring total investment to more than Dollars 4.5bn in the next three years. According to Mr Boutros Labaki, CDR's vice-president, just under Dollars 2bn of this sum has already been pledged by international donors, chiefly Gulf Arab countries and the World Bank. The remainder is to come from public funds and financing packages arranged by contractors. Three of the biggest projects, a Dollars 400m airport redevelopment, more than Dollars 600m worth of work restoring and expanding existing telephone links and creating a GSM cell mobile telephone system along with a Dollars 180m project to build a new sports city have already been awarded - all to European countries. US groups remain handicapped by a state department ban on Americans visiting Lebanon. The next big project will be for the construction of two 450MW power stations in north and south Lebanon, which together will provide 40 per cent of the country's expected power needs. Mr Labaki said seven groups, including GEC Alsthom, ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Italian group Ansaldo and a partnership of John Brown Engineering of the UK and General Electric Company of the US, have entered bids for a contract likely to top Dollars 700m in total. The awards should be made later this autumn, with the first units expected to come on stream within a year and a half. Later will come the construction of a toll highway between Beirut and Damascus, a Dollars 600m build-operate-transfer project for which bids will be invited next month. A further Dollars 450m project to revive Lebanon's coastal railway line has been put on hold.</p>

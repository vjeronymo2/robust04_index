			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On Monday President Mircea Snegur issued a decree on  organizing parliamentary elections on February 27.    The government and local governing bodies together with the  Central Electoral Commission should guarantee equal  opportunities to all participants in the election campaign.    Under the decree candidates who are employed at executive  government bodies at the time of registration should resign from  their positions not later than 40 days before the elections.  Their jobs will be kept for them for the time of the election  campaign. They will take part in election meetings and appear in  the media as private individuals.    The heads of executive government bodies have no right to  campaign for or against candidates to parliament.    At a conference of top ranking officials in Chishinau on the  coming elections President Snegur has declared that the specific  conditions of the first multi-party parliamentary elections in  Moldova require that he state his attitude to the election  campaign.    He said: "Firstly, the constitution binds the president to  be  involved in the election campaign. I will bend every effort to  guarantee the best conditions for parliamentary elections. I  call the voters to cast their ballots for those who firmly stand  for strengthening the Moldovan state and independence."    "Secondly, the president went on to say, [punctuation as  received] I will continue to support political forces that  pursue a policy of strengthening Moldova as an independent and  sovereign country without any conditions or double standards.  This stand is in full accord with my program in the  presidential elections that won clear support from voters. I  favor those who strengthen the unity of the country by concrete  actions. I am going to vote for those who put forward and are  capable of carrying out concrete programs to overcome the  economic crisis, those who would guarantee stable progress and I  am going to urge voters to follow my example."    "Thirdly, every guarantee of equal participation in the  elections to all political forces will inevitably result in  irreversible democratization, a key attribute of constructing a  democratic and law-governed state".    "Fourthly, local executive bodies should organize the  election campaign strictly in keeping with the law and  presidential decree offering equal opportunities to all  candidates".    "In the fifth place, Snegur emphasized, I am confident that  the people on the left bank of the Dniester have fully realized  who wanted to separate us and why. I hope everyone has  understood what should be done to prevent the elections from  being blocked by those who do not want us to live in peace and  harmony the way we have for centuries."    The president urged the media to cover the election campaign  fully and objectively without insulting any of the participants.    The Moldovan head of state singled out the responsibility of  government bodies of all levels for taking resolute measures to  stop any attempts of any political forces or individuals to win  seats in parliament through fanning ethnic discord.    Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli thinks the early  parliamentary  elections offer a unique chance to determine the future of the  nation. At the conference in Chisinau he said the elections  should put an end to the speculations of destructive forces  operating in Moldova that are opposed to the independence of the  country and favor unification with Romania.    The prime minister urged cabinet members planning to run for  the new parliament to go on leave by January 15. He said  cabinet members and representatives of executive bodies should  run in the election campaign on equal grounds with other  candidates.    IF [INTERFAX] Note: The prime minister himself has been on  leave since Monday. He is running for parliament on the ticket  of the influential Agrarian Democratic Party along with his  deputies Nikolai Oleinik and Valentin Kunev as well as the  current speaker Pyotr Luchinsky.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (4): The bidders are gathering - British Rail sell-off will start with disposal of Red Star parcels business BY late summer the Red Star express parcels business will be under new ownership. The information memorandum giving potential purchasers a comprehensive commercial and operational insight into the business is expected to be available by the end of May. Once available the sale will be advertised inviting bids for the business. 'We expect there to be a great deal of interest in the sale,' says Dr Glyn Williams, managing director of the BR Parcels Group. 'l cannot divulge the number of companies who have so far expressed interest but it is likely to be between one dozen and three dozen.' All companies applying for the memorandum will have to sign a confidentially agreement as it will contain sensitive commercial information. Few companies have yet declared a firm interest although press reports suggest that a number of the leading road-based operators will apply for the memorandum. One definite is a management buy-out team including six existing Red Star managers. Because Rod Star does not run trains the sale does not require any enabling legislation as is the case with the privatisation of other parts of BR. Once the memorandum is issued the sale process is expected to be fairly quick. The present management team has basically over the past year or so been making Red Star a leaner and fitter organisation to increase its productivity and competitiveness. The emphasis of these changes has been on rationalisation, service improvements and increasing quality to the customer. Previously comprising four divisions, the BR Parcel Group has been reduced to two: Red Star and the Rail Express Systems. The latter handles the Pounds 40m a year contract with Royal Mail. Red Star previously consisted of domestic and international businesses. The unprofitable international traffic was chopped with the exception of some parcel traffic into Europe and a successful business to Ireland. These are now merged in with the domestic business. Track 29, a division operating a palletised service for heavier parcels was sold to the road agents which handled the collection and delivery last September because it was not making money and needed considerable investment. 'We managed to reduce our losses by massive productivity deals and we have looked very hard at every penny we spend,' explains Dr Williams. This involve the loss of some 300 jobs through the last financial year to the present 1,300 and also the number of parcel outlets has been steadily reduced over the past two years from 500 down to a core 250. These steps have considerably improved the Parcel Group's financial performance. In the 1992/93 fiscal year to the end of March, turnover amounted to Pounds 47m. In that year 'we substantially reduced the losses incurred by Red Star which for 1991/92 which are more or less on record at being Pounds 11m,' commented Dr Williams. 'I am not able to tell you the losses in 1992/93 but I can say that they were roughly half at those in 1991/92, so we are making very considerable progress.' The exact figures will be in the sale memorandum. 'This has been achieve through very substantial cost reduction,' explains Dr Williams. 'We have suffered like our competitors and the total market has gone over the last three years because of the recession and we are suffering although our market research does indicate that we are not suffering any more than anyone else. We have managed to maintain our market share of about eight per cent through the recession. 'We have had declining revenues but in the last four or five months it has been fairly flat but l cannot talk about green shoots yet,' observes Dr Williams. He is hopeful that as the economy picks up, so Red Star's business will improve. 'A one per cent improvement in the economy brings a much more than one per cent improvement in our business', he adds. Red Star's key advantage over its competitors is its same-day business, be it door-to-door or station-to-station. Dr Williams describes it enthusiastically as 'being marvellous, really really good.' Its next day services provide door-to-door options of delivery before 9am, before 10.30am and before 12 noon. There is also a next day station-to-station option. The next day services account for the largest proportion of Red Star's business but same day is the premium traffic, which probably represents a major attraction to potential purchasers. As part of preparing Red Star for the sale a train space agreement is currently being negotiated with BR to ensure the new owners access to trains, especially InterCity, the cost of access to platforms and to put into longer term tenancy agreements the already existing annual agreements for renting the shops which serve as Parcel Points. Recession has meant that customers have traded down, moving from same-day to next-day services. In a move to combat this from last October, Red Star introduced completely revised charges which included substantial reductions; increased its sales and marketing activities and introduced a completely redesigned range of corporate and sales literature. The number of area managers was reduced from 26 to Il and administration streamlined. As part of the cost cutting review the operation of some 65 road agents handling all Red Star's collection and delivery operations and accounting for 20 per cent of all costs, was reviewed. To improve quality to customers Red Star is working through BS5750 with accreditation due in July for all its sites. This is part of Red Star's total quality management programmes. Further productivity gains could be achieved if investment was made in technology to enhance its existing systems but there is a hold on such expenditure until after the sale. 'We would like to spend several million pounds on improving our current technology which would make our operations cheaper to run and on which the payback is excellent', says Dr Williams. There would also be more job cuts. Two new Parcel Points have been opened this year in Brentwood and Glasgow where business justifies them. Delegation of responsibility down the management lines has also resulted in a number of local initiatives taking advantage of niche opportunities to boost business. 'This includes a courier service in Glasgow city centre. For the future Red Star has been talking with BR's European Passenger Services about operating express parcel services using Channel Tunnel train services. There will be a limited space available but same day options at a three hour service from London to Paris or Brussels could open up a whole new business area. EPS will be marketing this space to all operators interested in using it so there will be no exclusivity. What it does highlight is the emergence of high speed rail services as a growing alternative to air and road based express carriers. With the high speed passenger network developing year by year, the range of rail-based services could develop considerably.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 FED PRESIDENTS BACK MOVE FOR ZERO INFLATION  </P> <P> Four Federal Reserve Bank presidents told Congress on Tuesday that the current  rate of inflation is too high and voiced strong support for a bill that  supports the central bank's efforts to attain zero inflation.  </P> <P> They said the benefit would outweigh the short-term economic pain that such a  move would produce.  </P> <P> "Inflation may well re-accelerate in the absence of a clear signal to the  public that Congress fully supports the Federal Reserve Board's commitment to  lower inflation," said Robert P. Black, president of the Federal Reserve Bank  of Richmond, Va.  </P> <P> Black and the three other presidents endorsed a resolution proposed by Rep.  Stephen L. Neal (D-N.C.), chairman of the House Banking monetary policy  subcommittee. If passed by Congress, it would not legally mandate the Fed to  reduce inflation to zero over the five-year period mentioned in the  legislation. Rather, the Fed would be encouraged to aim for zero inflation.  </P> <P> The resolution is also supported by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan  Greenspan, who along with other monetary policy-makers is being pressured by  the Bush Administration to stimulate economic growth through lower interest  rates.  </P> <P> But White House economic adviser Michael J. Boskin said at a news conference  Tuesday that he did not favor the bill.  </P> <P> "I do not believe that it makes sense for Congress to try to micro-manage the  Federal Reserve," said Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic  Advisers.  </P> <P> The nation's monetary policy is set mainly by the Federal Open Market  Committee, which is composed of the seven-member Federal Reserve Board in  Washington and the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks.  </P> <P> The bank presidents told Neal's subcommittee that the open market committee was  committed to an anti-inflationary policy but said it would be bolstered by a  clear vote of support from Congress.  </P> <P> Robert T. Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said  work done by his staff indicates that a recession is not necessary to bring  inflation down to zero by 1994.  </P> <P> But the unemployment rate, now at 5.3%, could rise to between 6.75% and 7.75%,  he said. At the same time, growth, as measured by the gross national product,  would have to be 1 to 2 percentage points slower than the 2.5% to 3% growth  that the bank presidents said was the fastest achievable without accelerating  inflation.  </P></p>

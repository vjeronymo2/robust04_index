			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts Had the government really been under funding pressure, it would surely have proceeded with its auction in November regardless of the Budget. The sale would have been out of the way almost a week before Budget day. So the decision not to go ahead probably reflects a large degree of funding comfort, although the Bank might also have legitimate scruples about launching a large sale just before a Budget that is widely expected to include an interest rate cut. For the time being, it matters little if recovery does not reduce the PSBR much below the original Treasury forecast of Pounds 50bn. October's auction will bring gilt sales in the current year to some Pounds 40bn. The authorities are so far ahead of the actual funding need that they can afford to take a breather. Once again they are spared the need for a long-dated issue. The strength of long-dated gilts probably owes as much to shortage of supply as to a conviction that inflation is permanently under control. Similarly, short gilts are buoyed by expectations of lower base rates, which, incidentally, should ensure the success of this month's auction. The market's benign mood could change if the chancellor pitches his budget message wrong. Balancing fiscal tightening with interest rate cuts is no easy matter when underlying inflation may be pushing on its 4 per cent ceiling next spring. A test of Mr Clarke's success may be whether the Bank feels able to slip in another auction between the Budget and Christmas.</p>

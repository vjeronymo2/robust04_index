Linkevicius met with  representatives of the parliamentary opposition.    Referring to practical endeavors which may be accomplished  prior to the adoption of a military doctrine and national  security concept, L. Linkevicius stressed that it is necessary  to begin to actually control the borders and airspace of  Lithuania. The minister said: "We should make our contribution  to the system of collective security because so far we have to a  certain degree been dependents." He did not reject the  likelihood of military formations from Lithuania taking part in  a UN peacekeeping mission, or the need for young men in service  with the army to not only take weapons and drill training but to  also study the English language.    Outlining his view of the reorganization of the DSOK  [National Volunteer Defense Service], L. Linkevicius said that  the reorganization does not amount to elimination of the DSOK,  and that under the current conditions this structure could  perform the functions of a volunteer national guard and assume  responsibility for territorial defense and security for  important state facilities. In the opinion of L. Linkevicius,  from now on only those who have been in active military service,  have been recommended by their commanders, and have impeccable  biographies should be volunteers.    Seimas member P. Tupikas asked whether L. Linkevicius feels  morally responsible for the fact that the Lithuanian Democratic  Labor Party, while in opposition, hampered A. Butkevicius in  creating a system of national defense, compromised it in every  way possible, and papers were endlessly slipped to A. Brazauskas  in the Supreme Council. L. Linkevicius answered that he did not  engage in these affairs.    Seimas member A. Patackas said that "volunteers are being  separated from their weapons," which only staff employees will  be trusted with keeping. Such employees are few; for this  reason, at many locations weapons are kept solely at command  posts. In the words of A. Patackas, in this situation the main  principle is violated: "A volunteer should always have his  weapon handy."    A. Patackas expressed concern in conjunction with the fact  that a structural reorganization is also being planned after the  certification of volunteers in the course of which, according to  his information, they rejected the services of at least  one-third of the volunteers. The member of Seimas called on the  minister to remember that volunteers are a patriotic force, too;  in turn, the minister observed that patriotism is not a  profession, and genuine patriots cannot compromise the DSOK.    Minister of National Defense L. Linkevicius said that  weapons  should be stored strictly in keeping with the rules. The  argument that the volunteers might need armaments at any moment  in order to repulse enemy attacks did not convince him. L.  Linkevicius said: "We do not have this kind of situation now,"  and repeated yet again that weapons are not toys.    The minister rejected rebukes that he did not demand  allocation of more funds from the 1994 budget for the system of  national defense. The minister of defense said: "Being a member  of the government, I cannot fail to think about education and  health care, too." In the words of L. Linkevicius, there will be  sufficient funds for military training; however, it may become  necessary to reduce the army.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Provincial Party Committee and </F> Government Call Grain Work Conference To Propose Ensuring  Production of Agricultural Produce Including Grain, Edible Oil,  and Meat; and Maintaining a Balance Between Overall Supply and  Demand, and Market Stability"]    [Text] On 3 February, the Zhejiang provincial CPC  committee and government called a provincial work conference on  grain. Participants earnestly implemented the guidelines laid  down at the national work conference on the "vegetable basket,"  grain, cotton, and edible oil; analyzed the current situation by  taking our province's reality into consideration; unified  thinking; and studied ways to enhance macroeconomic regulation  and control under the conditions of a market economy, to further  deepen reform and improve the system of grain procurement and  marketing, to protect and mobilize the enthusiasm of farmers for  production, and to ensure a balance in the overall supply and  demand of staple agricultural products including grain, edible  oil, meat, and vegetables and market stability. Participants  also advanced opinions and measures on ensuring the supply of  vegetables and farm sideline products for urban and rural  citizens. Li Zemin, secretary of the provincial CPC committee,  and Wan Xueyan, deputy secretary of the provincial CPC committee  and provincial governor, spoke at the meeting. Liu Xirong,  member of the standing committee of the provincial CPC committee  and vice governor, transmitted the guidelines laid down at the  national work conference on the "vegetable basket." Chai  Songyue, deputy secretary of the provincial CPC committee and  vice governor, presided over the meeting. Liu Feng and Lu  Zhanggong, deputy secretaries of the provincial CPC committee;  Wang Qichao, member of the standing committee of the provincial  CPC committee and secretary of the provincial commission for  discipline inspection; Li Jinming, Xu Yunhong, and Zhang Youyu,  members of the standing committee of the provincial CPC  committee; and responsible comrades from the provincial people's  congress and provincial CPPCC [Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference], attended the meeting.    Li Zemin pointed out: Under the current conditions of  developing a socialist market economy, reaching a common  understanding over agriculture, particularly over the grain  situation, is an issue of primary importance. Only by reaching  a common understanding can we possibly adopt concrete and  effective measures to deal with the new situation and problems  that have emerged in the current grain production and  distribution. It is necessary to fully affirm that the  provincial CPC committee and government have made the correct  decision to decontrol grain prices and to develop "high-yield,  high-quality, and high-efficient" farming, and that their  direction of reform is correct. At the same time, we should be  aware of the new situation and problems in the current grain  production and distribution. Seen from the development trend,  some of the problems are quite serious and worrisome. To be  sure, there are rational grounds for readjusting and reducing  grain planting acreage. What worries us is that this trend  continues to develop and expand. If grain planting acreage  continues to shrink on a large scale this year, it will surely  have a great impact, and produce serious consequences for  maintaining a balance between grain supply and demand in our  province. Weakened efforts and negligence in farming can be  observed in the following: A large number of rice fields have  been diverted for other use; agriculture has received  insufficient investment; policies and technology to support  grain production have failed to fall into place; and instability  has grown among personnel involved in agricultural technology  and management. These are ominous signs for agriculture,  particularly for grain production stability. Therefore, leaders  at various levels need to reach a common understanding and to  unify thinking in the following areas.    First, as the grain problem concerns the overall situation,  we cannot afford to make light of it at any time. People rely  on food to live. The grain issue concerns the national economy  and the people's livelihood. Comrade Xiaoping warned us long  ago that if any problems were to arise in the 1990's they would  most likely occur in agriculture. In view of present  conditions, it is of particular and important significance to  recall Comrade Xiaoping's warning. Reform and development  require stability. Agricultural stability, particularly grain  production stability, directly affect economic and social  stability. Increasing agricultural products' effective supply,  doing a good job in grain work and on the "vegetable basket"  project, and stabilizing food prices will create a good  environment for our reform and development as well as for a good  material foundation to solve various social contradictions. Our  party and government leaders at all levels must fully recognize  the importance of, and sense of urgency in doing a good job in  grain work; attach a high degree of importance to the new  situation and problems in the current grain production; and  adopt concrete measures to solve them in a down-to-earth manner.    Second, it is necessary to adhere to the policy of  "basically seeking self-sufficiency in grain production and  regulating the grain surplus and shortage" to solve the issue in  Zhejiang. Practice over the years has proved that the above  policy is in accord with Zhejiang's reality. Despite the recent  lifting of control on grain procurement, marketing, and prices,  and the development of a socialist market economy, we should  still unwaveringly persist in the aforementioned policy.  Historically, Zhejiang has been one of the provinces basically  self-sufficient in grain. Although population increases and  dwindling arable land in recent years have left a certain gap in  grain supply and demand, Zhejiang has been able to basically  maintain self-sufficiency. Our province has a huge population  with limited arable land; it is frequently hit by natural  disasters. The fact that Zhejiang's processing industry and  export trade greatly depend on agriculture makes it even more  necessary for our province to seek basic self- sufficiency in  grain. Therefore, it is hoped that people across the province  will form a consensus on this point.    Third, it is necessary to correctly handle the relationship  between regions and the entire province, and help form a concept  that the entire province is an organic whole. Maintaining a  balance in overall grain supply and demand helps maintain the  overall situation of the entire province. By balance, we do not  mean just achieving a balance in specific regions, but a balance  encompassing the entire province. Differences in natural and  geographical conditions objectively help shape a pattern that  divides regions into grain-producing and consumption regions.  For a long time, grain-producing zones have made great  contributions to ensuring the supply of grain in the province.  We still want to emphasize the need for major grain-producing  regions to take the interests of the entire province into  consideration and continue to undertake the task of supplying  commodity grain. Of course, the province will attach great  importance to protecting the benefits of grain-producing  regions, give them support in terms of policy, funds, and  materials, call on other trades and industries to support  agriculture, and try its best to encourage the enthusiasm of  farmers to grow grain. At the same time, efforts should be made  to readjust regional interests and interests between urban and  rural areas as well as to foster a closer link between  production and marketing.    Fourth, it is necessary to maintain the direction of reform  and to devote efforts to deepen reform and improve reform  measures. The province's fundamental purpose and point of  departure for implementing the reform measure of decontrolling  grain procurement and marketing prices last year, was to try  every possible means to help farmers increase their income,  which was made the basic guiding thought for rural work. We  must be firm in belief and never waver from following the  correct direction of rural reform. Reform itself did not bring  forth the current crop of problems. Those problems are,  generally speaking, ones met in the course of progress. The  major cause of those problems lays in the failure to devise an  adequate number of supplementary reform measures and is due to  the delay in working out macroeconomic regulation and control  measures. Enhancing macroeconomic regulation and control is not  only indispensable for developing a socialist market economy but  also important in deepening the current reform and improving  reform measures. Enhancing macroeconomic regulation and control  must be built on the foundation of respecting the law of value.  To deal with and solve problems, we rely on economic policy and  economic methods as much as possible. But under the present  situation, in addition to adopting economic means, we need to  rely on our political superiority and to bring this superiority  into play, as well as on adopting some necessary administrative  methods.    Li Zemin said: The national work conference on the  "vegetable basket" project, grain, cotton, and edible oil held  by the State Council is of great guiding significance to our  efforts in this year's agricultural production, and in planning  the people's life in urban and rural areas centered on the  overall situation of reform, development, and stability. We  must correctly understand and conscientiously carry out the  guidelines of the CPC Central Committee. To carry out the CPC  Central Committee guidelines, our leading cadres at all levels  must understand the guiding ideology in light of Zhejing's  actual situation and the implementation of the various tasks put  forward by last year's rural work conference convened by the  provincial party committee. We must systematically study new  situations and problems in production, circulation, consumption,  and other fields, deepen our understanding, and work out tasks  and policies for strengthening microeconomic regulation and  control.    First, we should make prompt and solid efforts from now on.  At present, all tasks are heavy and the farming season is  approaching. We must do our job ahead of the season. It is the  crucial moment right now and we must take prompt initiative as  early as possible. As long as we do a careful and solid job, we  will finish our work in time. We must see to it that the tasks  and policies are carried out around the Spring Festival so as to  help peasants strengthen the management of spring crops and  plant enough early rice.    Second, we must concentrate our efforts on production and  increase total production steadily. Our top priority is to make  sure there is enough acreage of early rice, stop the trend of  planting single-season rice in a vast area, and stabilize  multiple crop indices. We must adhere to the triple cropping  system because it tallies with the actual situation in Zhejiang,  a province with a large population and limited land, as well as  reflects Zhejiang's strong points in agriculture, especially in  the production of grain and edible oil. Of course, we must  vigorously explore new ways to implement the triple cropping  system in line with local conditions. We must pay close  attention to grain production and strive to stabilize the  production of some important agricultural products such as  cotton, vegetables, and pigs. We must develop new ways of  thinking while promoting production. While providing guidance  for tens of thousands households in developing production, we  should pay even more attention to major households, production  bases, and large-scale management. This should be the direction  of our agriculture, in which our policy should provide  preferential treatment.    Third, we should solve current problems in light of  establishing scientific and rational mechanisms, and promoting  long-term development. To stabilize the current production and  market supply, it is necessary to take some interim measures.  However, these measures should be commensurate with long-term  development, and the establishment and perfection of  operationally flexible and effective mechanisms for  macroeconomic regulation and control so that they can help  establish a socialist market economic structure. We should  focus attention on the establishment of a risk fund and storage  system for grain and other major agricultural products and  should draw up specific procedures for implementation. In  circulation, we should continue to give full play to the role of  grain, commercial, and supply and marketing departments as the  major channels for circulation, but should gradually separate  policy-oriented operations from business operations under two  different systems. Moreover, we should further cultivate and  develop markets, and strengthen the management and supervision  of agricultural product markets.    Fourth, we should make determined efforts to increase  investment in agriculture according to the principle of "first  ensuring enough food, and second, guaranteeing construction."  Now, while arranging budgets and utilizing credits, governments  at all levels must guarantee the people have enough food; they  must adopt policies favorable to grain production and the  "vegetable basket" project, and ensure this major task even at  the expense of cutting back spending in other areas.    Fifth, to maintain a basic balance between overall supply  and demand, and inject vitality into the province's work as a  whole, we should have clearly defined responsibilities and  powers, introduce a system of responsibility, and assign  macro-control and administrative responsibility to various  levels.    Li Zemin stressed: Party committees and government at all  levels must pay great attention, and top leaders must assume  overall charge and become personally involved -- herein lies the  key to the success of work related to grain and vegetable  production. Members of the party committees or government must,  first of all, unify their thinking and enhance their sense of  responsibility. Instead of merely relaying the assignments and  policy measures issued by the State Council, the provincial  party committee, and provincial government, the cities,  prefectures, and counties must, in light of their respective  realities, take firm, immediate action to implement them. They  should take organizational steps by establishing a system of  responsibility. The principal leaders of the provincial  government shall take charge at the provincial level while the  top leaders shall assume overall charge in their respective  cities, prefectures, or counties. Local party committees must  also conscientiously exercise supervision to ensure success.  The provincial party committee and government are stressing  once again: In pursuant of a directive from the central  authorities, party committees and government of the prefectures,  counties, townships, and villages must devote their main energy  to agriculture and rural work. In the future, agricultural  development and increases in peasant income will be given  greater emphasis in evaluating the performance of a locality or  a leading cadre. It is necessary to introduce some tangible,  measurable targets and introduce a system of responsibility to  ensure their implementation at different levels. Village and  township cadres and agrotechnicians should be treated equally  with others when it comes to recognition and material benefits,  so that they will feel respected politically and not  disadvantaged economically. It is necessary to change the style  of work, go deep among the grass roots, and provide specific  guidance. Leading comrades at all levels should go deep down,  hear directly what the grass roots have to say and different  views from various quarters, and have a good grasp of the real  situation. A pressing matter of the moment is to make thorough  and meticulous arrangements for the production of early rice.  While intensifying ideological education and providing  guidance, we should adopt economic, legal, or administrative  measures to prevent land from being used for single cropping of  rice. We should conscientiously publicize and implement the  "Implementation Procedures of Zhejiang Province for Land  Administration" amended and promulgated recently by the standing  committee of the provincial people's congress, and firmly  prevent farmlands from being left idle and unattended or  illegally used for other purposes. All levels should assign one  or more villages to a cadre whose job is to help the peasants  prepare for and carry out spring farming. We should organize  all trades and professions to provide support and better  services for agriculture. Government departments must -- while  transforming their functions -- continue to give top priority to  agriculture; they must not think of only their own interests and  therefore ignore providing support to agriculture. The  provincial party committee and government have instructed all  relevant departments to conduct a review of aid- agriculture  work, firmly establish the idea of "three agricultures" [san  nong si xiang 0005 6593 1835 1927], and provide good services in  a down-to-earth manner. We should correctly guide public  opinion and do a good job in publicity and providing guidance.  Newspapers, radio, and television stations, and other media  units should publicize party committee and government's plans by  providing positive examples. Their coverage of stories related  to grain, cotton, edible oil, and the "vegetable basket" should  be helpful in reassuring the urban residents and in mobilizing  the peasants' enthusiasm for production. We should, by way of  fostering positive public opinion and propaganda, guide the vast  number of cadres and people to contribute to promoting  production and stabilizing the market and society.    At the end of the meeting, Wan Xueyuan emphasized: We must  earnestly relay and implement guidelines of the national  conference on the "vegetable basket" and grain, cotton, and  edible oil, and the provincial conference on grain. In  consideration of the seasonal nature of agriculture, we must  seize the opportune moment. First of all, we should unify our  thinking, be fully aware of the importance of vegetables, grain,  and edible oil, positively grasp and implement the guidelines of  the central and provincial meetings, and pay attention to  linking up new guidelines with relevant policies adopted in the  past. We should send cadres to help the grass roots implement  policies, conduct research, and sum up and publicize the  experience of advanced units in order to advance this work on a  larger scale.    Present at the meeting were secretaries of the city and  prefectural CPC committees, mayors, prefectural commissioners;  party secretaries, mayors or heads of 29 major grain producing  counties (cities); and officials of relevant provincial  departments.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Recovery lifts Royal Insurance to Pounds 32m Royal Insurance, one of the UK's largest insurance companies, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 32m for the first three months of 1994, further underlining the recovery of the sector after its heavy losses between 1990 and 1992. The result compared with a Pounds 2m profit last year, and followed positive figures earlier this week from both General Accident and Commercial Union. Like its rivals, Royal was hit by a decline in the value of its investment in both bonds and equities over the quarter, with the group's solvency margin - which measures shareholders' funds as a percentage of non-life premium income - falling to 54 per cent (60 per cent). Also like its competitors, Royal's better operating performance mainly reflected continuing improvements in the UK, where the underwriting profit of Pounds 10m (Pounds 41m loss) was Royal's best start to the year since 1989. Excluding the reduction in its reinsurance operations, which Royal has scaled back, underlying general insurance income in the UK rose by 6 per cent. Rate increases are still being achieved in commercial lines, and pricing has been stabilised in personal lines. In the US, Royal was hit by losses from winter weather of Pounds 31m and from the Los Angeles earthquake of Pounds 17m. Overall, underwriting losses in the US climbed from Dollars 94m to Dollars 131m (Pounds 90m), with the operating ratio (claims plus expenses as a percentage of premiums) reaching 134.3 per cent (123.7 per cent). The ratio on US householders' business rose to 206.8 per cent (147.9 per cent). At group level general insurance premium income amounted to Pounds 846m (Pounds 909m). Life income was Pounds 92m (Pounds 94m). Underwriting losses were Pounds 96m (Pounds 129m). See Lex</p>

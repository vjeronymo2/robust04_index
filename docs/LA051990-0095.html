SOLARZ BARRED AS ELECTION OBSERVER  </P> <P> Myanmar's military government turned down a request by Rep. Stephen J. Solarz  (D-N.Y.) to observe next week's parliamentary elections, saying he had made  malicious attacks on the authorities and encouraged unrest. Solarz had asked to  be allowed to visit polling booths and to meet Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the  opposition National League for Democracy. She has been under house arrest since  last July and is banned from taking part in the May 27 election.  </P></p>

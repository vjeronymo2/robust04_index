Blake's mother, sister and two cousins filed suit in Sacramento  Superior Court this week, contending that the actress actually wanted to leave  her estate to them. The suit said she was talked into leaving it to the  Performing Animal Welfare Society three days before she died at age 60 in a  Sacramento hospital on Aug. 16. Blake played Miss Kitty on television's  "Gunsmoke."  </P></p>

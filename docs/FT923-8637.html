			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: Abbey National house sales plan has flawed basis, ignores realities and is likely to fuel inflation (2) Sir, Has Abbey National lost sight of the fact that houses are for living in? The days of houses simply being profit centres are gone. If the British consumer now wishes to live in his/her home for a period of years rather than months, then that is for the better. During the late 1980s we endured the peaking of a speculative bubble that had been gradually inflating since the early 1970s. Unfortunately some lenders, when given a free reign, have run riot and the 1990s will be a sombre consequence of this. The government does not ask for taxes on the profits made on residential property; is it fair, therefore, to seek credits when those profits are not realised.

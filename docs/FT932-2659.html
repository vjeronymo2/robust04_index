			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Ticino (1): Evidence of unease in gilded cage - Ticino, like most European regions, has suffered an economic downturn - although the impact has been softened by the canton's peculiar economic structure.  But beneath the relative economic calm, there is evidence of a growing unease TICINO, Switzerland's Italian-speaking canton, has become something of a bird in a gilded cage. Its gentle people enjoy a largely unearned prosperity, benefiting from the efforts of their more energetic Swiss cousins to build industry there, and from the venality of Italian institutions, which has enabled the canton to become a thriving financial haven. The Ticinese are also lucky in their geography, occupying one of Europe's strategic and truly blessed plots. An inverted triangle stretching from the highest mountains in the north to the outskirts of Milan in the south, Ticino contains no fewer than four north-south road passes and one important rail pass through the Alps. Its transit vocation is about to be significantly enhanced, thanks to the Swiss government's bold plan to build a new high-speed rail tunnel under the Gotthard pass over the next decade. The canton also packs an extraordinary variety of landscape and climate  - from glaciers to palm trees - into its less than 100km of length, and tourism now accounts for about a quarter of its estimated SFr10bn gross product. Ticino's exceptional prosperity is a recent phenomenon. Until the opening of the first rail tunnel through the Gotthard pass in 1882, it was a poor canton populated mainly by subsistence farmers. Its principal export was people. Today, the Ticinese themselves marvel at how little benefit they gained over the centuries from the heavy traffic of people and goods that crossed over the Gotthard before the rail line was built. Thereafter, it was mainly Swiss-German entrepreneurs who developed the canton's industries, concentrating on the ones - banking and tourism - that seemed most promising to them. Manufacturing industries remain underdeveloped and largely dependent on low-paid day workers coming from Italy. 'We have an economy that is structurally weak,' Mr Dick Marty, the cantonal governor, admits. Like most European regions, Ticino has suffered from an economic downturn in the past few years, but the impact has been softened by the canton's peculiar economic structure. The construction industry has been hardest hit, but job losses there have been borne largely by the so-called frontalieri who come from Italy every day to work in the canton. Their number has tumbled from 40,000 two years ago to 35,000. Meanwhile, the political turmoil in Italy has kept activity brisk in Ticinese banks. But beneath the relative economic calm, there is evidence of growing unease within the gilded cage. A new nationalist political party, the Lega dei Ticinesi, has sprung up in the past two years and become a leading force in the canton's political life. The Lega, led by a garrulous building contractor, plays effectively to Ticinese sensitivities. On the one hand, it rails at perceived slights or injustices inflicted on the canton by the country's Swiss-German majority, while on the other it displays a self-satisfied disdain for disorderly Italians. Ticinese identity has become a delicate issue in the past few years, which is hardly surprising considering its fragility. The Ticinese represent a large majority of the Italian-speaking community of Switzerland, yet the cantonal population is little more than 4 per cent of the national total. Ticino has no university and many of its bright students go to German or French language colleges north of the Alps never to return. Only a bare majority of the canton's 290,000 population has local roots. A quarter are foreign and the rest are mainly German-Swiss. More than half of the capital invested in industry is of external origin and all of the big banks are controlled from outside. As tourism is an important factor in the economy, the foreign presence often seems even larger than it is and, in some instances, becomes suffocating. In the centre of Ascona, an exquisite medieval town on Lago Maggiore, German appears to have become the dominant language, causing anxiety about a more general encroachment. 'The Swiss-Germans regard Ticino as 'our verandah'', says Mr Raffaello Ceschi, a local historian. But the Ticinese clearly prize their attachment to Switzerland and there is not a whiff of separatist sentiment in the new nationalist wind. Perhaps that is partly because they know that they get economic benefits from the federal government disproportionate to their size. Many of them are also among the more committed participants in Switzerland's militia army, unlike the French-Swiss, who tend not to take it very seriously. The Ticinese attitude to Italy is also complex. They obviously have much affection for their Italian neighbours, and recognise the value of Italy as their only source of cultural support. The television antennas in Ticino all point south. But they also seek to keep a certain distance from their neighbours to the south, whom they seem to look down upon. Most Swiss - and many Ticinese - were shocked when a majority of the canton's citizens voted last December against joining the European Economic Area (EEA), the enlarged free trade area that would have brought Switzerland closer to the European Community, including Italy. Normally, Ticino, like the French-speaking cantons of Switzerland, is understood to be pro-European because of the obvious benefits to be gained from easing contacts with EC neighbours. Ticinese leaders say the No vote, which was championed by the Lega, was largely a defensive response to the current upheavals in Italy. They feared a flood of immigrants and a lowering of their standard of living. 'If the vote had taken place at a more propitious time, it would have been positive,' Mr Claudio Generali, chairman of Banca del Gottardo, says. The Ticino government and the business community nevertheless see the canton becoming increasingly dependent on closer links with its southern neighbour. Mr Generali says the canton is luckier than other Swiss border cantons, having such a highly developed industrial region on its doorstep. Efforts are being made at the official level to institutionalise contacts with the Italian provinces of Como and Varese and a 'Regione dei Tre Laghi' (Region of the three lakes) is in embryo form. In the meantime, the canton's economic future will continue to depend largely on banking and tourism. The banking sector seems well placed, having been strengthened in the past few years by the addition of several banks which are neither Swiss nor Italian. 'We have the critical mass now to be a second-tier international financial centre,' Mr Generali says. Banking leaders are also trying to become more professional and to do whatever else is necessary to get rid of the community's image as a centre for carrying out dodgy transactions and for stashing away hot money. The outlook for tourism is less clear because the canton finds it difficult to compete with lower-cost destinations in Europe. However, even the nationalistic Lega dei Ticinesi believes in its expansion. Mr Flavio Maspoli, one of the Lega leaders, says the canton should stop setting up industrial development zones - 'there are too many industrial zones' - and concentrate on luring more tourists with casinos and golf courses. If that is the view of the nationalists, it suggests that the bird at heart still likes its gilded cage.</p>

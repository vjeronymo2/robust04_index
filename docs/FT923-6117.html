			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: USX polishes up a brighter future - The US steel and energy giant which survived intact by giving each division its own listing on the New York Stock Exchange AT THE start of last year the outlook facing USX, the huge US steel and energy group, looked bleak indeed: Mr Carl Icahn, the corporate raider, was demanding the break-up of the business. The United Steelworkers union was threatening strikes at its plants. And recession had sent US demand for steel plummeting. Eighteen months on, US steel demand remains weak, but USX's position has so improved that some bolder Wall Street analysts believe the steel part of the business could provide one of the market's better-performing investments over the next year or so. The changed perception is due in large measure to an improvement in earnings by both its steel and energy operations, but it may also be due in some measure to the unique defensive measures USX took in the spring of last year to protect itself from Mr Icahn's break-up demands. Mr Icahn, then with a 13 per cent stake in the company, argued that the separation of US Steel, the largest integrated steel manufacturer in America, and Marathon, the 11th largest oil and gas company, would create value for shareholders, since Wall Street would place a higher value on the parts of the business than the whole. USX eventually got him, and its shareholders, to agree to a less drastic plan: the group would remain one legal entity, but its stock would be divided into two separate issues, each with a quotation on the New York Stock Exchange. One would track the fortunes of the steel business and the other Marathon. USX's management argued that this would give it both the valuation benefits of a break-up and the administrative savings and tax and debt-rating advantages of a single corporate parent. The results have been mixed, but appear moderately successful. On the negative side, the two separate stocks have not performed as well as hoped. Just before the split took effect in May last year, USX shares were trading at around Dollars 28. A similar package of Marathon and US Steel shares trades today at somewhat below that level, due largely to a slump in oil stocks and the slow pace of US economic growth. There is, of course, no knowing whether the old combined shares would have done even worse than this. Mr Charles Corry, USX's chairman, says the split has clearly been a success because the two shares now move independently, based on the different influences of the steel and energy sectors. Each of the businesses had their own successful secondary offerings of shares this spring and were appealing to different groups of investors, points out Mr Tom Usher, who heads US Steel. 'Some people were excited about steel because of the cyclical play. Others felt the energy business was going to come on strong.' The split has allowed Wall Street to focus more clearly on the separate divisions. In the past USX suffered because brokers' analysts specialise in the steel sector or energy but rarely both. Mr Corry points to other benefits from not legally splitting the group. The biggest, he says, has been the advantage of filing a single tax return in a year like 1991, when steel lost money and energy produced a profit. 'Instead of one paying taxes and the other simply having a claim to carry over against future income, all the money stayed within the corporation.' He believes the unified legal entity has also saved debt financing costs. US Steel, which would have faced particularly high rates because of last year's losses, has benefited from the 'blended rates' available to the group as a whole. Why, then, has not a single other US conglomerate beaten a path to Shearson Lehman, the investment bank which devised the split, in search of the same medicine? It may be partly fashion. Wall Street's latest tricks tend to be assimilated slowly and warily by corporate managements. It may also be because the disappearance of the hostile takeover in the 1990s makes such defensive tactics less vital. Also, fund managers seem divided over the merits of the scheme, while residual doubts remain among Wall Street analysts about the finer points of the split. Nevertheless, those same analysts are growing increasingly enthusiastic about USX's business operations. The steel division, which lost Dollars 507m last year after a Dollars 402m restructuring charge, was the only integrated company to return to the black in the second quarter of this year, although it achieved that thanks to a pension credit. Among the Big Steel companies, USX seems to be one of the best placed to take advantage of any recovery in both US demand and prices. It has massively restructured the business over the past decade, slashing steel-making capacity and employment while spending heavily on plant modernisation, some of it in ventures with Japanese manufacturers. The workforce now stands at just 18,000, producing around 9.5m tons a year, compared with the 120,000 people who made 10.3m tons in 1982. Productivity at its largest plant, in Gary, Indiana, has shot up to 2.7 man hours per ton, compared with more than 7 a decade ago, and is now widely reckoned to be the best among Big Steel's plants. That said, none of the integrated manufacturers faces an easy ride over the next five to 10 years as they face increasing competition from the small, nimble mini-mills which have been taking market share for years and are now invading the last bastion of the integrateds - flat-rolled steel. But US Steel recently underlined how much better equipped it is than many other companies to wage this fight when it revealed it was considering building a flat-rolled mini-mill of its own. Marathon, for its part, is out of market favour because of the oil industry's poor earnings outlook. Yet it has one of the fastest-growing production profiles among the major US energy companies, thanks to the development of the British North Sea's East Brae field, due to start production late next year. This, and increased production in the Gulf of Mexico, promise a big hike in earnings from 1994. USX's restructuring days are not yet over. It has a string of non-steel businesses inside the steel division, including a clutch of coal mines. The group also got approval this year to follow up last year's stock split by issuing a new class of shares to track the performance of its Delhi US natural gas gathering business, which had operating income last year of Dollars 33m. It is keeping open the option of selling Delhi outright to another company. But it is possible that the first company to follow USX's stock-splitting lead will be USX itself.</p>

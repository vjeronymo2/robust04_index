			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally on news of higher rates Longer-dated US Treasury bonds surged yesterday afternoon after the Federal Reserve announced a move to lift short-term interest rates. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 9/16 higher at 101 7/16 , with the yield dropping to 7.374 per cent. The two-year note was  3/16 firmer at 99 7/8 , yielding 6.175 per cent. The initial reaction to the announcement was decidedly positive. Prices on the inflation-sensitive long bond jumped on news that the central bank had decided to push up the Federal Funds target rate by 50 basis points to 4.75 per cent and the discount rate by 50 basis points to 4 per cent. The Fed said the action was intended to contain inflation, reassuring traders about the long-term value of their fixed-rate investments. Even though the move placed more upward pressure on short-term yields, prices on shorter-term paper also improved, albeit modestly. There was general relief that the Fed had decided against lifting the Fed funds target by only 25 basis points and leaving the discount rate unchanged. The more timid approach would have immediately raised the prospect of yet another tightening, perhaps as early as next month. Yesterday the Fed said it expected its action to be 'sufficient at least for a time,' signalling a period of relative stability for the Treasury market. Still, the strength of the rally was somewhat surprising because the Fed's move was widely anticipated. After a lacklustre session on Monday, dealers had ventured back into the market yesterday morning as the Fed's policy-making arm was convening in Washington. In a change of heart, many traders had decided the market would move higher, not lower, if the Fed meeting resulted in a more restrictive monetary policy. As a consequence, dealers had spent the morning 'short-covering,' that is, replacing securities they had borrowed and resold in earlier sessions on a bet that prices would fall on the news. Yesterday's activity pushed bonds moderately higher before the news, which broke at 1.15pm, local time. The market's guess proved accurate, but its subsequent rally appeared to be fizzling out only minutes after it began in earnest. However, a second wave of buying, apparently by retail accounts, carried prices to session highs by the late afternoon. News of the rate increase in the US came too late to affect European government bond markets. Earlier in the day, price movements in Europe reflected a flight to quality as investors abandoned the high-yielding markets of Italy, Spain and Sweden for the relative safety of Germany and France. The high-yielding markets experienced losses of up to  3/4 points while Germany and France saw gains of around  1/2 point. One dealer said the flows out of the high-deficit countries underlined the view among investors that the fiscal imbalances were not going away and that the situation would only get worse in a bear market. However, volume was low across the board as traders waited for news from the Federal Reserve. In Germany, the Bundesbank's announcement that it was setting a fixed-rate repo at 4.85 per cent came as no surprise. This brings to an end the scheduled run of four fixed-rate repos which the Bundesbank put in place ahead of its summer break. The market is now waiting to see if the central bank will revert back to a variable rate. The Bundesbank is due to meet tomorrow. On Liffe, the September bund future stood 0.45 point higher in late trading at 91.96. UK gilts were also among the day's outperformers, buoyed by a smaller than expected UK Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for July and the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey, which showed no signs of rampant economic growth. On Liffe, the September long gilt future rose to 101 11/32 in modest volume of 50,100 lots.</p>

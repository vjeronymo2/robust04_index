			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Business and the Environment: Looking for a quiet life - Jamie Allen reports on measures by the Hong Kong government to reduce the colony's noise level Hong Kong has been called many mysterious and laudable things, including Fragrant Harbour and Pearl of the Orient. It has never officially been named Construction Site, although this comes closer to what it is like to live in the cramped and frenetic territory than any euphemism can manage. Walking along a footpath involves dodging jackhammers, crossing a road entails negotiating temporary wooden planks over works' sites, and living next to a new building site could well mean you never need worry about sleeping through your alarm clock. But coming to terms with the problem of noise has been a long, slow struggle in Hong Kong. Unlike Japan, which enacted its first environmental laws in 1967 and a noise regulation law the following year, Hong Kong did not enact its first comprehensive Noise Control Ordinance until 1988 and construction activities did not come under control until 1989. (They are still not fully under control). While Japan has banned the worst form of percussive piling - the diesel hammer - in Tokyo and several other cities, Hong Kong has chosen not to bring in sweeping regulations which rule out the use of specific pieces of machinery. Usually pragmatic in its dealings with industry over environmental matters, the Hong Kong Government devised legislation which contained incentives for contractors to switch from the noisiest type of percussive piling (the diesel hammer) to quieter methods of both percussive and non-percussive piling. Quieter percussive methods include the hydraulic hammer and the drop hammer, while non-percussive methods include hand-dug caissons (wells dug by hand into which reinforced concrete is put) and mechanically bored piles (hollow columns made by drills which grind and/or break the rock into which reinforcement is put). The system, which was implemented in late 1989, offers percussive piling operators three kinds of daily permits - a three-hour permit for piling operations which are unacceptably noisy (those which exceed the accepted noise level for an area by more than 10 decibels); a five-hour permit for those which are moderately noisy (those which exceed the level by between one and 10 decibels); and a full 12-hour permit for piling operations which do not exceed the acceptable noise level. An added incentive is that quiet piling methods are permitted to run all night, while the hours of operation for the three- and five-hour permits are not chosen to the convenience of the contractor, but by the Environmental Protection Department. As time costs money and as construction deadlines are tight in Hong Kong, the aim was to make noisy piling a frustrating, inefficient and uneconomic proposition. The controls have brought about some improvements in the thinking and behaviour of the construction industry in Hong Kong - it has encouraged some of the larger contractors to test quieter methods of piling and suppliers such as Daido of Japan and BSP of Britain to try to sell new and more sophisticated piling technology to the local market. According to one of the largest local suppliers of construction equipment, China Engineers, the controls have also caused the sales of new diesel hammers to dry up in the last few years. But statistics compiled by the Environmental Protection Department present something of a dilemma - the number of three-hour permits has not declined during 1990, meaning the incentive scheme is not working or at least not as quickly as it was intended to. On Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, the two most built-up parts of Hong Kong and hence the most 'noise sensitive', the combined number of three-hour permits in each quarter last year was, respectively, 60, 70, 58, 60. In the New Territories, the rural/new urban development part of Hong Kong, the permit numbers were 19, 23, 16, 12. Even more discouraging is the fact that the total number of three-hour permits (318) exceeded the total number of five-hour and 12-hour permits combined (276). But the Environmental Protection Department does not feel defeated by these statistics and believes contractors are going through a transition period. It will soon carry out a survey to ask contractors whether they are planning to use quieter methods. Andrew Kwan Siu-hei, acting principal environmental protection officer in the Noise Control Group, said many of Hong Kong's contractors are small operators who are reluctant to change their work practices and reluctant to buy new equipment. 'Maybe they (the small contractors) are used to the old technology. Better to let large contractors test new methods. I think sooner or later they will change,' said Kwan. Construction industry representatives say the issue is complicated and that the problem lies with Hong Kong's outdated building regulations. These regulations are enforced by another government department, the Buildings and Lands Department, whose record of co-operation with the Environmental Protection Department is less than good. Although the regulations are about to be revised, so far they have undermined the success of the incentive scheme. Rod Buckell, technical manager with the piling company Franki Kier and chairman of the environmental committee of the Hong Kong Construction Association, said contractors would change overnight if the financial incentive was there. The reason they did not was because an outdated formula governing pile driving in the building regulations makes it cheaper to use diesel hammers rather than hydraulic hammers, which would be given a five-hour permit under the Hong Kong system. Contractors cannot simply switch to bored piles for every job because they mostly follow tender designs drawn up by engineers and because the type of piling used depends on a number of factors, primarily cost, time, the size and type of site, and the weight of the building being erected. 'Quietness has nothing to do with the design of piling in Hong Kong. Cost is paramount,' said Buckell. There is one area, however, where the new piling controls are having a definite beneficial effect - the ability to pile all night with quiet methods. Buckell said this has made bored piling using new and sophisticated equipment more economic than it was before and has helped to loosen the hold percussive or 'driven piling' has on the industry. 'By limiting the number of hours driven can work, bored is now economic,' said Buckell. He estimates the permit system has increased the cost of driven piling (using steel piles) by about 10 to 15 per cent. But Buckell also asks, why use piles at all for the foundations of buildings? The cutting edge of foundation work these days in Hong Kong and countries such as France, Germany and Canada is a method called 'deep compaction'. The soil is compacted almost back into its rocky state by vibration using steel pokers or is pressed down under the impact of a heavy mass. It is useful for land reclamation work, of which Hong Kong will be doing a lot over the next 10 years, and at HKDollars 15 (Pounds 1) per cubic metre it costs about half the price of piling. Its main drawbacks are that it can only be done on sand - not on mud - and the height of buildings above is limited to about 11 storeys. Yet it is not hard to see that 'deep compaction' could have wide application throughout Asia, especially in countries where earthquake problems limit the height of buildings, such as in Taiwan, or in developing countries which do not need to build skyscrapers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Geoffrey Murray] </F>   [Text] Chengdu, China, April 10 KYODO -- Locals in the  western part of China's remote Sichuan Province have long  consumed Matsutake mushrooms without realizing that a highly  profitable export item for the Japanese market was growing under  noses. It took an enterprising private Japanese businessman to  stumble onto the possibility and create a highly profitable  business at 50 dollars a kilogram for an initial investment of  only 100,000 dollars.    The Matsutake processing plant is only one of a number of  Japanese business ventures that have "mushroomed" in the  economic development zones surrounding the provincial capital of  Chengdu.    With central government approval, Chengdu is now bent on  becoming the economic hub of the previously backward inland  areas of the Chinese southwest.    There are five development zones in Chengdu, each offering  special privileges and competing fiercely for foreign  investment. Some are out for the latest "cutting edge"  technology, others are more intent on creating jobs.    The Longguan Development Zone, in a prime agricultural  district alongside the Chengdu-Chongqing Expressway now under  construction, is in the latter category. Longguan plays host to  the successful Matsutake business, one of 50 foreign enterprises  now in the area.    On a more ambitious scale, the giant motorcycle manufacturer  Yamaha Motor Co., whose main operation is the Jianshe  Manufacturing Plant Chongqing, produces various engine  components in the Longguan Zone.    Another Japanese company, which Chinese officials did not  name, was said to be holding talks with a local military factory  converted to civilian use about a project to produce car and  motorcycle engines. It is part of the potential development of  Chengdu as an "automobile city," an idea floated by General  Motors of the United States, whose officials have visited the  area several times for discussions and a feasibility study.    Longguan, meanwhile, will see former military manufacturers  set up shop to work on civilian aerospace projects and produce  agricultural machinery such as tractors and car engines.    The central government has set aside 500 million yuan to  move  in a number of factories. Some 10,000 workers will transfer to  Longguan this year, and the figure will eventually climb to  100,000, creating a vast satellite city only a few kilometers  from Chengdu.    The nearby expressway, due for completion in the second half  of the year, will give the growing industrial zone easy access  to Chengdu International Airport 35 kilometers away in one  direction and Chongqing, a Chang Jiang River port, some 360  kilometers in the other.    District officials are running a major sales drive to fill  the vacant spots in the 9.94 square kilometer development zone,  and the surrounding countryside. Incentives for businesses to  relocate there include "fast track" processing of their  applications by the bureaucracy, no interference by the state as  long as no laws are broken and generous tax reductions.    In line with the central government's new "open policy,"  district officials are relaxed and pragmatic. Nothing is  impossible, they suggest, for the potential foreign investor.    For example, involvement in real estate operations is  theoretically forbidden to foreigners to prevent them from  buying and selling Chinese land. But, hint officials, why not  come in and register as something else -- say a tourism business  -- and then ask the local planning commission to extend the area  of business into real estate? Nothing could be simpler in the  new capital-oriented Chinese society.</p>

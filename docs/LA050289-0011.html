			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE SPEAKER JIM WRIGHT  </P> <P> In spite of all the news coverage of the Wright affair, there is one important  aspect which has been mostly overlooked. The Ethics Committee has been absorbed  in the investigation for the better part of a year and the evidence considered  has been voluminous. The committee membership is divided evenly between  opposite political philosophies. The subject of the investigation is not only  the man third in line to the presidency, not only a congressional colleague,  but he is the one who makes committee assignments! In essence he is the boss of  the panel members.  </P> <P> Yet after all these months the committee has been able to bring in a unanimous  consensus on 69 counts. That is a monumental tribute to the skill of the  chairman of the committee, Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles). Walking that  tightrope for so many weeks demonstrates a rare ability to maintain balance.  Although a "reason to believe" is not to be confused with a conviction, and  many more days of hearings and deliberations are yet to come, I think the  country feels better knowing that the leadership of the committee will be in  the capable hands of Dixon. We in Los Angeles -- indeed in California -- are  justifiably proud to count Julian Dixon as one of our own.  </P> <P> JAMES SCHERR  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

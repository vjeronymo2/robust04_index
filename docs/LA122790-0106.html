			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOLIDAY BOWL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> AGGIES WON'T BE RUN RAGGED  </P> <P> Texas A&amp;M's secret ingredient for Brigham Young in Saturday's Holiday Bowl  was revealed Wednesday: Extra conditioning.  </P> <P> Junior cornerback Kevin Smith, Texas A&amp;M's career interception leader and  currently tied for first on the Southwest Conference's all-time list with 18,  said at a Sea World news conference that the Aggies have been working harder  than usual in practice for the past two weeks.  </P> <P> He said the Aggies decided they needed to after facing Houston's run-and-shoot  offense Oct. 13. The Aggies lost to Houston, 36-31, and although BYU doesn't  use the run-and-shoot, Smith said the run-and-shoot is similar enough to help  in preparation.  </P> <P> "It does as far as knowing how to prepare us for conditioning," Smith said.  "After Houston, we were really tired. Personally, I needed more conditioning,  and the coaches knew (the team) did, too. . . . We've been running wind  sprints, things like that."  </P> <P> Add Smith: In becoming Texas A&amp;M's career interception leader, he passed a  fellow by the name of Lester Hayes, who held the old record of 14 and went on  to play for the Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders.  </P> <P> "It's funny, a guy told me when I first got here that I will hardly get any  interceptions in (man-to-man) coverage," Smith said. "I've been fortunate. I've  had guys force the quarterbacks into throwing bad passes. Lately, I have to  credit playing the safety position against run-and-shoot teams. When I'm at the  corner spot, teams throw away from me."  </P> <P> By Ty: Not unexpectedly, BYU quarterback Ty Detmer drew the largest crowds at  the news conference Wednesday afternoon. A few excerpted comments:  </P> <P> On last year's 50-39 Holiday Bowl loss to Penn State: "You never expect it's  going to be like that. Those things just kind of happen. . . . Seems like  things turn out weird here every year."  </P> <P> On playing a school from his native Texas: "It's exciting for me to get to play  a Texas school. I'd like to have a good performance so I can go home and not  hear about it all holidays long."  </P> <P> On seriously considering attending a Texas school instead of BYU: "I never did.  I knew I had to get out of Texas to be successful throwing the ball."  </P> <P> Family Ties: Senior Brian Mitchell, a first-team all-Western Athletic  Conference defensive back, is one of 10 BYU players from Texas. He graduated  from high school in 1987, the same year that Texas A&amp;M star running back  Darren Lewis graduated from Carter High in Dallas. Mitchell said that, although  he never played against Lewis in high school, he kept track of Lewis' progress.  </P> <P> "He was the No. 1 back coming out, and you try to keep up with the guys  graduating with you," Mitchell said. "And I keep up with A&amp;M -- they were  my favorite team growing up."  </P> <P> But Mitchell said he wasn't recruited by the Aggies.  </P> <P> "Seems like I got something to prove," he said. "Half my friends in high school  went to A&amp;M."  </P> <P> Two current Aggies were teammates of Mitchell's in Waco: linebacker Anthony  Williams and cornerback Eric Moore.  </P> <P> Freshman defensive lineman Kefa Chatham also went to the same high school, but  he was a few years behind Mitchell.  </P></p>

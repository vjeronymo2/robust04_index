			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by </F> correspondent Randah Habib in Amman -- date not given]    [Excerpts] [Habib] Mr. Minister, what is Lebanon's stand on  the settlement of the Yemeni crisis in light of the proclamation  of an independent state in the south, given that Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas has stated that most of the Arab countries will  recognize this state?    [Buwayz] In principle, we do not believe the time is  appropriate to review the map of the region. From this premise,  we as the Lebanese Government pause before adopting a final  stand on what is taking place in Yemen to give the opportunity  for initiatives to settle this problem. Our hope is that the  brothers in Yemen realize that the current Arab situation is  tragic and can do without further divisions and fragmentations  and further infringement on Arab sovereignty through the  imposition of international tutelage.    [Habib] How does Lebanon view the solution to the  Palestinian  presence on its territory following the conclusion of the  autonomy agreement between Israel and the PLO, and how many  Palestinians reside in Lebanon?    [Buwayz] In principle, there is a consensus in Lebanon among  all the parties, communities, and forces to reject any form of  resettlement on Lebanese soil. The Lebanese constitution  explicitly states its rejection of this possibility. From this  premise, Lebanon with its limited area, and sensitive structure  absolutely does not believe that it can sustain the burdens of  the resettlement of Palestinians on its land. [passage omitted]    [Habib] What about their numbers?    [Buwayz] There are no accurate statistics. Many Palestinians  have made statements implying that the Lebanese state is  carrying out specific plans, proposals, and contacts. I would  like to state here that the Lebanese state has not contacted  anyone and has not held discussions with anyone on the  Palestinian presence in Lebanon and that it is not currently  carrying out any action dealing with this Palestinian presence.  Their number ranges between 300,000 and 350,000.    [Habib] There is talk about a new tour of the region by U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Will it include Lebanon  and is there a date for holding the next session of bilateral  negotiations?    [Buwayz] What is certain is that we do not accept being  summoned to any place outside the Lebanese territory. We  welcome all those who visit us in Lebanon to discuss the  problems of the region. Lebanon is an essential part of the  Middle East equation, whether historically, politically,  economically, or culturally. We expect that Secretary  Christopher will carry out a new tour to prepare for a new round  of negotiations. I expect this. With respect to his visiting  Lebanon, we have not received, as yet, any information about  this topic. [passage omitted]    [Habib] Is there anything new with respect to the Believers  Resistance official Mustafa al-Dirani?    [Buwayz] Israel carried out an operation deep inside  Lebanese  territory. The outcome of this operation was the kidnapping of  Mr. Mustafa al-Dirani under the pretext of seeking the release  of an Israeli pilot who was arrested in Lebanon in 1986. Any  comparison between the two is rejected. Israeli pilot Ron Arad  was taken prisoner after he carried out a raid on Lebanon,  during military operations and when the Lebanese state was  absent. The Lebanese state has no information and does not know  anything about this topic. The operation against Mustafa  al-Dirani took place on Lebanese territory, without there being  any military operations and against a person who was in his  house and among his family. We view it as an aggression and as  an act of piracy with all the sense of the word. [passage  omitted]</p>

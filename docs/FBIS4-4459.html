			<p>BFN     [Text] The government held its regular meeting in Hanoi  from 30-31 March to assess its performance during the first  quarter of 1994; to discuss its work schedule for the second  quarter; to evaluate the initial results of the implementation  of directives on the movement for thrift and against  extravagance, corruption, and smuggling; and to review a number  of draft laws and regulations. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet  presided over the meeting.    On behalf of the prime minister, Minister and Director of  the  Government Office Le Xuan Trinh presented a report on the  results of the government's activities during the first quarter  of 1994 and on a number of top priority tasks for the second  quarter of the year. Interior Minister Bui Thien Ngo briefed the  participants on the situation concerning corruption and on the  results of the anticorruption campaign. Finance Minister Ho Te  presented a report on the movement for thrift. Trade Minister  Le Van Triet briefed the participants on the situation  concerning smuggling and antismuggling activities.    The participants unanimously concurred that during the first  quarter of 1994, in overseeing and managing state affairs, the  government focused its efforts on key tasks and scored many  results. Prompt efforts were made to grasp the opportunities  offered by the outside world. Continued progress was made when  it comes to balancing the state budget, mobilizing capital, and  making payments. There was no indications of unexpected price  increases. The industrial production continued to expand at a  rate of more than 10 percent. Generally speaking, the  socioeconomic development continued to bring about positive and  steady results. In the meantime, efforts were made to improve  the quality of cultural, social welfare, information, public  health, and educational services. All those achievements have  created a new momentum for the movement against social vices.  Vigorous efforts were also made to step up diplomatic and  external economic relations as well as firmly maintain political  stability and public security and order.    Prompted by a high sense of responsibility toward the people  and the implementation of the National Assembly's resolutions,  members of the government seriously examined the shortcomings  and weaknesses they displayed in handling national affairs,  especially in overseeing and directing the implementation of  resolutions and directives of the National Assembly and the  government.    The ministers analyzed difficult problems in many fields,  including the generation of capital for production promotion,  reception of foreign investment capital, financial management,  handling of budget overspending, and so forth. On pre-Tet and  Lunar New Year's Days, positive steps were taken to deal with  corruption, smuggling, and extravagance as well as encourage  everyone to practice thrift. Nonetheless, only limited results  were recorded. Extravagance remained rampant. Social vices  continued to develop to a serious degree in some areas. Slow  efforts were made to improve the administrative apparatus and  administrative procedures.    The government devoted much time to discussing and deciding  on top priority issues to be resolved in the second quarter of  1994. For example, it is necessary for ministries, sectors, and  localities to seriously implement the prime minister's  directives on a number of tasks as follows: It is important to  formulate plans to initiate the movement for thrift and against  extravagance, work out measures to establish the capital market  and draw investment capital for planned projects, make  preparations for the stock market, take steps to perfect  guidelines to the implementation of the local investment  promotion law, prepare a draft law on tax reform, renovate the  book- keeping system, apply the auditing system, regulate the  currency exchange rate system and foreign currency control  regulations, zone off targeted areas for economic development  projects and other projects involving key sectors, prepare and  adopt plans for the use of ODA[overseas development  aid]-provided funds for the 1994-95 two-year period and the  ensuing years, and accelerate the administrative reform program.  Particularly, it is necessary to take resolute and urgent  measures to improve administrative procedures.    Also during this session, the government reviewed and  adopted  a number of draft laws and draft regulations to be submitted to  the National Assembly Standing Committee. They include the  draft law on amending or supplementing the law on military  service, the regulations on the income tax to be levied against  high-income earners, and the regulations on the rights and  duties which go with the use of land in Vietnam by foreign  organizations or foreign nationals.    Speaking on this occasion, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet  emphatically said: Because of their sense of duty toward the  people and the National Assembly, all members of the government  must review the ways they handle affairs falling under their  responsibilities, intensify supervision and control workd a step  further, and discover and take timely action against violations.  It is necessary for all ministers to uphold the sense of  responsibility toward the campaign against corruption,  smuggling, and extravagance. It is important for them to exert  tight control over budget revenue and spending, practice thrift,  and renovate the financial and accounting management mechanisms  to make them consistent with the new situation. It is  imperative for all ministries and sectors to review budget  revenue and spending sources, and adopt measures to increase  budget revenue and do away with all indications of extravagance.    The prime minister urged all ministries and sectors to  remain  sensitive to market demands, work out policies and mechanisms to  stimulate production and make it appeal to the taste of local  consumers, thereby effectively contributing to getting rid of  smuggling activities.    The government stressed: As far as the second quarter of  1994 is concerned, it is necessary to focus efforts on applying  five major measures aimed at increasing budget revenue,  stabilizing currency exchange rates, attracting foreign  investment capital, carrying on the movement for thrift and  against extravagance and smuggling, intensifying the  administrative reform program a step further, and stepping up  project implementation direction and project quality control  work, thereby contributing to successfully implementing the  seven groups of major tasks that the Government has set forth  for the year 1994.</p>

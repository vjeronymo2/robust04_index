			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Polish IMF deal put in jeopardy POLAND'S hopes of negotiating a new deal with the International Monetary Fund were in doubt last night following the resignation of Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the finance minister, in protest against a parliamentary vote for higher government spending. His departure weakens the minority centre-right coalition government of Mr Jan Olszewski, prime minister, which has been put in danger of collapse by the row over budget spending. The finance minister announced his resignation after two votes in parliament failed to overturn a 1991 constitutional court ruling which bars the government from cutting public sector pensions. The resulting rise in civil servants' pay and additional pension rights could cost the government Zl 28,100bn (Pounds 1.15bn), the prime minister said. This rise threatens to overwhelm the government plans to limit this year's budget deficit to Zl 65,500bn or 5 per cent of gross domestic product. This was the limit agreed two months ago after Mr Olechowski's talks in Washington with the IMF. IMF support for the government's economic policies is essential for the resumption of payments from the total Dollars 2.5bn three-year IMF extended loan facility granted last year. Disbursements were suspended in September when targets, including those for inflation and government spending, were exceeded. An IMF team is in Warsaw for talks with the government. Mr Olechowski said he was resigning because he could 'see no way of fulfilling these new obligations'. He added that those who had voted for the spending increases should be asked how they would pay for them. The former communists, the populist KPN party and the PSL peasants' party, refused to support either government attempt to secure the disputed cuts in public sector pay. The Democratic Union, the largest party, led by Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a possible contender for the premiership if the government does collapse, voted against one of the motions. Yesterday's vote also raises the question of whether it will be possible to enforce the spending cuts of Zl 24,000bn agreed by the government to keep this year's budget within IMF-approved limits in the face of arguments that entitlements once granted by law cannot be taken away. Mr Olszewski said his government would not resign. He would try to have the draft budget accepted by parliament in two weeks. Editorial comment, Page 22</p>

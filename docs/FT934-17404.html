			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Whitehall productivity 'lagging' THE CIVIL Service has lagged behind the private sector in increasing the productivity of its staff, according to a report published today by the European Policy Forum, the independent think tank. Between 1987 and 1993, the number of civil servants fell 7.3 per cent from 597,814 to 554,212, according to the most recent government figures. The Forum contrasts these figures with productivity increases at the banks, which it says are similar, people-intensive administrative organisations. They have cut their staff numbers by more than 16 per cent in the past four years. The report will add to pressure on the government to curb Civil Service staff as part of a drive to reduce public expenditure rather than increase taxes. Much of the reduction in civil service numbers has been achieved by reclassifying civil servants to take them out of the figures, the Forum says. Examples include the transfer of 3,300 staff from the Department of Health special hospitals to a special health authority in 1990. The introduction of commercial management in the Rosyth and Devonport dockyards took out another 16,600. Excluding such changes, numbers have fallen by just 17,382 since 1987, a fall of 3.9 per cent. This contrasts with the big four banks which have cut 44,940 staff since 1989, a drop of 16 per cent. The report says that similar staffing reductions in the Civil Service could cut over 60,000 jobs, a 10 per cent reduction. It calls on ministers to set targets for 'downsizing' on this scale over the next four years. The Forum says that the failure to squeeze down numbers in many government departments has added to public expenditure and reduced the scope for improving the quality of services.

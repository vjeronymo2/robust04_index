			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agencies believe that Federal, State, and local governments should have balanced programs that use the most cost-effective strategies for decreasing crash risks from speeding. This includes: (1) Targeting enforcement where speeding has a significant impact on public safety and accompanying it with public information and education; (2) using a variety of techniques and technologies for speed control; (3) understanding who speeds, where, and why; and (4) ensuring that posted speed limits are appropriate for conditions. These efforts can be further enhanced through the development of comprehensive speed control programs which include establishment of appropriate criteria for the setting and posting of speed limits, focused attention upon roadway construction and condition, posting of appropriate roadway signs, elimination of hazards adjacent to the roadway, and establishment of research projects to further study the characteristics and consequences of speeding in order to develop improved countermeasures and guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA submitted a report to Congress in 1991 entitled  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Speed Enforcement Program Plan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to identify methods to address the speeding problem. The plan relies heavily upon programs and projects that have proven to be most effective and outlines speed control initiatives that have proven successful. The plan also stresses a law enforcement commitment to controlling speed on all public roads, using state-of-the-art equipment, with a strong emphasis on public information and education designed to increase driver compliance with speed limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Are State Speed Control Programs Effective in Reducing Crashes, Injuries, and Fatalities? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State programs that have been conducted to date demonstrate that speed control countermeasures are extremely effective in reducing deaths and injuries. For example, the New York State Police 55 mph enforcement project was successful in decreasing the number of drivers traveling at the highest rates of speed (often considered to be ``professional speeders''). While average speed declined slightly from 61.6 to 61.3 mph, the percent of drivers exceeding 70 mph declined from 6.9% to 5.1%. The percent exceeding 65 mph declined from 24.1% to 21.4%, and the percent exceeding 60 mph declined from 56.4% to 55.7%. This success is believed to have ultimately led to reductions in the number of fatal crashes, fatalities and serious injuries suffered in New York. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (12): Counting the cost / Analysis of the draft accounts for a billion-dollar sporting occasion  -Funds THE DECISION about whether Manchester's Olympics will make a profit or a loss will have as much to do with politics as the decision the IOC's decision in Septem The projected operating budget, drawn up with the help of Arthur Andersen, examined in detail by government officials and discussed with the IOC, shows a projected surplus of Dollars 92m, with Dollars 1,451m income and Dollars 1,359m expenditure. Included is a Dollars 249m allowance for contribution to capital budget, reflecting the agreement with the government that the company operating the Games will bear the cost of temporary facilities or the adaptation of permanent ones. This means Manchester will bear the full cost of the 5,000-seater judo hall to be built at Old Trafford and removed after the Games. Manchester University's sports hall will be extended to accommodate table tennis for the Games. The operating company for the Games will pay. The strategy of having new facilties built either, like the velodrome, for the government, or, like the main stadium, on a long-term design, build, operate and maintain basis with a significant private sector contribution, is designed to prevent the operating company being loaded with enormous capital costs. As the Olympic village is designed as student accommodation, the company's only contribution to its Dollars 380m-plus cost would be to pay for adapting student rooms for the Olympics. Although communications and IT shows up as the second biggest expenditure at Dollars 239m, a lot of it will come as benefits in kind from the Dollars 478m projected sponsorship. Companies with state-of-the art technology, often developed for the Olympics, are expected to offer to provide equipment, to show off to the world in general and the huge Olympic media circus in particular - for example, a telecoms company might install the press centre, or a car manufacturer provide courtesy cars. The security budget of Dollars 129m is a government estimate, including 10,000 police. The huge Dollars 402m other expenditure budget covers the volunteer programme (Dollars 45m), the Paralympics, staged immediately after the Games (Dollars 42m), a support structure for the seven years leading up to the Games (Dollars 100m) and insurance (Dollars 30m). The biggest income figure is for media rights. The IOC negotiates the rights, and estimates that a Manchester Olympics would earn Dollars 1bn, of which the operating company would keep Dollars 600m. The IOC estimate for Sydney is a net Dollars 488m, because a September Games would compete with other sports events. The Dollars 478m estimated sponsorship includes Dollars 100m share of international sponsorship negotiated by the IOC and Dollars 378m national sponsorsip and licensing, based on bringing in 10 leading players at up to Pounds 10m apiece from sectors such as banking, insurance, telecommunications, water, computer hardware, office equipment, fast food, cars, media information systems and publication systems. The estimate includes 10 medium players who would have lesser rights and a number of other suppliers whose products would be used. A measure of the sophistication in sports merchandising in the region can be gauged at Manchester United's club superstore, expected to turn over up to Pounds 5m this year, selling traditional products such as programmes, T-shirts, pens, sportswear, and even wallpaper and bed linen. The Dollars 188m estimated ticket income is gauged on a complex grid, estimating the likely attendance for every session of the Games, with a total estimated attendace of 4.8m. Mr Bill Enevoldson, finance director, says the tickets have to be affordable by local people. Ordinary athletics sessions are estimated at an average of Pounds 40 in 2000 prices (assumed equivalent of about Pounds 26 currently), with basketball at Pounds 35 and football at Pounds 15. The opening and closing ceremonies are likely to be a little less affordable, at an average of Pounds 250 in 2,000 prices. Of the Dollars 165m 'other revenue,' Dollars 70m is estimated for ancilliary media rights - TV crews turning up on the day wanting to film a particular aspect of the Games - with other income from interest (cash flow is positive, as sponsorship, ticket and television money is up front) and sale of assets after the Games. If Manchester wins the bid, a detailed budget will be thrashed out with the IOC. Much of the Games' financial success or otherwise will depend on deals done with the government and the private sector on the capital expenditure programme. Much may also depend on treasury management - the event gets much of its income in US dollars, while most of its expenditure is in pounds sterling.  -----------------------------------------------------               PROJECTED OPERATING BUDGET  ----------------------------------------------------- Revenue (Dollars m)  ----------------------------------------------------- Media rights                                    600 Sponsorship &amp; licensing                         478 Tickets                                         188 Coin &amp; Stamp programmes                          20 Other                                           165  ----------------------------------------------------- Total                                         1,451  ----------------------------------------------------- Expenditure (Dollars m)  ----------------------------------------------------- Contribution to capital budget                  249 Communications and information technology       239 Services to Olympic Family                      186 Press, radio and television                     154 Security                                        129 Other                                           402  ----------------------------------------------------- Total                                         1,359  ----------------------------------------------------- PROJECTED SURPLUS                                92  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

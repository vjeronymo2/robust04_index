			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Norway insurer gains business VITAL FORSIKRING, one of Norway's top three insurers, has won domestic corporate pension scheme business in 1992 worth additional funds of a net NKr1.16bn (Dollars 166m) and annual premium income of NKr100m. Gross new business last year reached an estimated NKr1.3bn, providing annual premium income of NKr115m. Analysts said that following last year's collapse of UNI Storebrand into the hands of government-appointed administrators, a number of domestic insurers had acquired some of UNI's business. Vital said it suffered a net outflow of reserves and funds totalling NKr70m, representing a NKr8m reduction in annual premiums. Vital Pekon, a subsidiary which administers pension schemes, had agreements with 25 funds, 13 secured last year, with NKr6bn of premiums and reserves under management and annual premiums of NKr600m. UNI Storebrand lost an estimated NKr225m in annual premium payments in 1992 on pension schemes covering NKr2.8bn, while Gjensidige, also among the top five insurers, lifted annual premium income last year by NKr100m.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAM HALL KAPLAN: BOARD IGNORES SIGNALS IN NO-TRUMP BID  </P> <P> The State Allocation Board this Wednesday will once again consider the request  by the Los Angeles Board of Education for more than $73 million to become, in  effect, developers of the Ambassador Hotel site.  </P> <P> The board has doggedly, some would say pigheadedly, pursued the 23.5-acre site  in the Mid-Wilshire District for a new senior high school since the landmark  hotel was closed two years ago.  </P> <P> The pursuit took on an added dimension earlier this year when the Donald Trump  organization bought an interest in the site and announced plans for an  ambitious commercial development there, topped by the world's tallest  skyscraper. (Happily, the scheme has since shrunk considerably.)  </P> <P> Although Trump has selected the local firm of Johnson Fain &amp; Pereira, known  for its sensitive urban design work, planning efforts to come up with an  acceptable mix and scale of uses for the site have been placed on the back  burner as the school board plays its hand.  </P> <P> The involvement of the controversial Donald Trump, and the excitement it caused  among those championing a real estate renaissance in the area, apparently has  strengthened the resolve of the board to acquire the site through condemnation  and, as they say in development circles, become a player.  </P> <P> Responding to concerns that the well-located and valuable site could be better  used to generate income to offset the acquisition cost, the board has proposed  that the high school be combined with a 30-story office tower, a retail mall  and three department stores.  </P> <P> According to the scheme yet to be made public, the commercial development would  be focused on Wilshire Boulevard, most of the educational facilities on 7th  Street, and the athletic fields and gymnasium on 8th Street, bordering the  residential district to the south.  </P> <P> A public library, police station, 120 units of housing perched on one of the  department stores and parking in a variety of structures for nearly 5,000 cars  also is included in the scheme drafted by the firm of Leidenfrost/Horowitz  &amp; Associates.  </P> <P> Although the board has declined to discuss the plans, at least with me, it has  been hawking the concept to various developers. Most are said to have viewed  the mix with apprehension, the planning and design with reserve, and the  board's entrepreneurial posture with embarrassment.  </P> <P> "Unmarketable," was the conclusion of one prominent developer. "Unfeasible,"  said another.  </P> <P> Even if the proposal was in theory marketable and feasible, there is a real  question whether the board could make it happen.  </P> <P> To do so, numerous local and state laws on school construction, allocation of  real estate taxes and public leasehold arrangements would have to be amended,  as would zoning ordinances and building and safety codes.  </P> <P> The process, no doubt, will take years. As for the children the board says it  wants to serve, they will once again be shortchanged, while the lawyers,  politicians and bureaucrats have a field day.  </P> <P> In New York City, where such combined public school, and housing and commercial  projects have been built, it took on the average six years for each to move  from concept to completion.  </P> <P> And that happened only after four years of studies and lobbying on the local  and state levels to create a special, nonprofit public benefit corporation to  carry out the task independent of the city's school bureaucracy.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles School Board last February passed a well-worded and  well-intentioned resolution to explore, among other things, the planning,  financing and legal implications of a more imaginative facilities program,  including possible multiuse developments.  </P> <P> But words do not make a program. Repeated efforts by me through the board and  through a concerned mayoral aide for education to track what was happening and  discuss possible demonstrations were to no avail. Meetings were scheduled and  canceled, then scheduled again, only to have the district's representative fail  to appear.  </P> <P> I was disappointed but not surprised, especially having witnessed the board's  insensitive attempts at land grabs over the last several years. When it comes  to planning and design, the board gets a major "F."  </P> <P> It is therefore hard to take seriously the board's proposal for the complex  multiuse development of the Ambassador site. You just know it is going to be a  boondoggle.  </P> <P> If the board in the past had not displayed so little imagination in its  construction program, be it for even the simplest addition, let alone a major  high school, perhaps the proposal could be labeled presumptuous.  </P> <P> If the board, after announcing its intentions for the site nearly two years  ago, had not heard from a bevy of local interests, or had not reviewed various  planning reports for the area, the proposal could be dismissed as simply  insensitive to community concerns.  </P> <P> If the board's draft environmental impact report for a high school on the site  had not received from the city's Planning Department a year and a half ago such  a pointed response -- the report was politely deemed inadequate -- the proposal  might be excused as poorly conceived.  </P> <P> But put in the broader perspective of the failure of the city's public  education system, as judged by test scores, class sizes, dropout rates, campus  crime and teacher and administrator ratios and salary discrepancies, the  request to allocate such an excessive sum for such a dubious project has to be  labeled irresponsible.  </P> <P> Adding all this up it becomes depressingly evident that the proposal for the  Ambassador site is a perversion of the board's condemnation powers and its  school planning and construction program.  </P> <P> And it raises the question of whether a program so vital to public education,  and therefore the future of the city, should be entrusted elsewhere.  </P> <P> There is little argument that we need new public schools to replace inadequate  and unsafe facilities, and to handle the present overcrowding and the  anticipated increase in students.  </P> <P> But this need will not be met by the board by going to the mat over the  Ambassador site. Rather, it should be met by the development of more flexible  and shared facilities, not unlike what has been done by some very successful  private schools here and experimental public schools in other cities.  </P> <P> The board should also explore the possibility of adapting commercial and  industrial spaces for classrooms and theaters for auditoriums, making better  use of present school properties, shifting administration into inexpensive  office buildings, and generally becoming more imaginative and flexible.  </P> <P> As for Trump's project, an opinion on whether it will meet the architectural,  economic, and social needs of the Wilshire District and the city must await the  unveiling of the anticipated plans. One just hopes that Trump will benefit from  the mistakes of the school board.  </P></p>

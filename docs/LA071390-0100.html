			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SMITH WORKING HARD TO BECOME THE MOST PROFESSIONAL SURFER HE CAN BE  </P> <P> The last time the Assn. of Surfing Professionals world tour came here in 1988,  Colin Smith had just graduated from San Dieguito High School.  </P> <P> Smith was a contestant then but not a regular. He was young -- 18 -- but not  terribly so by surfing standards. He had ability and experience but not enough  to challenge the best surfers in the world.  </P> <P> He was knocked out in his first qualifying heat. "I was pretty green then,"  Smith said. "I didn't know what was going on."  </P> <P> Smith knew he needed something more than raw ability to push him over the top.  He decided it would be total dedication to the sport. If he was going to make  it as a professional, he needed to become a professional.  </P> <P> And in his first full year on the world tour, Smith is as dedicated as any.  </P> <P> He was ranked 74th -- fairly high for a rookie this early in the season --  heading into this week's $112,500 Life's A Beach contest at the Oceanside Pier,  the largest summer stop on the 1990 ASP world tour.  </P> <P> Despite losing a close heat to Hawaii's John Shimooka, 71-69, in Thursday's  main event, Smith will move up in the ratings. He finished tied for 33rd and  earned $800 to raise his season total to $2,050.  </P> <P> Against Shimooka, who finished 32nd in the world last year, Smith took command  midway through their 20-minute heat and led by 3.5 points with less than 30  seconds left. But Shimooka's last ride scored an 18.0, enough to push him  ahead.  </P> <P> With three seconds left, Smith caught a last ride but could manage only a 16.5,  a mark that did not raise his total because he already had two 17.5s and two  17.0s. Shimooka scored 20.0 on his first and best wave, 14.5, 18.5 and 18.0.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Smith was nowhere near this level of competition. Oh, he surfed  every day, didn't use drugs or alcohol and stayed out of trouble. But that  wasn't enough.  </P> <P> In the early days of surfing -- and just a few years ago, for that matter --  surfers stayed in shape mainly by surfing. Smith was the same way.  </P> <P> Got a big contest coming up? Better get in the water.  </P> <P> But now, when guys are earning $100,000 a year in prize money alone, training  and health care have become essential.  </P> <P> Smith got the message soon enough and began a full-scale health and training  program.  </P> <P> He went to Coast Gym in Solana Beach and was introduced to Maylen (which he  uses as his full name), a former Mr. California in bodybuilding and a strength  coach for the Chargers for 15 years in the 1960s and '70s.  </P> <P> Maylen set up a regimen for Smith, which included lifting weights for two hours  five days a week, riding a mountain bike approximately 50 miles a week and  sticking to a rich in carbohydrates and protein and low in dairy products and  red meat.  </P> <P> Maylen said Smith's dedication and attitude rank with him with the best  athletes he has trained.  </P> <P> In addition, Smith sees a chiropractor every other week for a checkup and minor  adjustments.  </P> <P> "My body's my instrument I play," said Smith, who in addition to being one of  the best conditioned athletes on the tour is also one of the biggest at  6-feet-1, 180 pounds.  </P> <P> "I want every advantage I can get," he said. "Later in life, I don't want to  have to ask myself what if I didn't do this or that. I don't want to have any  regrets."  </P> <P> Surfing Notes  </P> <P> The Life's A Beach contest at the Oceanside Pier is new on the ASP world tour  but is already the eighth largest in terms of prize money ($112,500). Although  there is no affiliation, the contest has replaced the old Stubbies Pro, which  was a regular stop on the tour from 1984-88. . . . San Diego area surfers  advancing to today's second round of the main event included Oceanside's Mike  Lambresi in the men's division, Encinitas' Tricia Gill and San Diego's Lisa  Carulli in the women's division and Joel Tudor of Pacific Beach in  longboarding. Encinitas' Brad Gerlach, seeded 11th in the men's division,  begins surfing today against Mike Parsons of Laguna Beach. . . . Competition  begins today and Saturday at 7 a.m. Sunday's final rounds begin at 8 a.m. . . .  A shuttle bus, to help ease congestion and parking problems Saturday and  Sunday, will pick up passengers at city-owned parking lots along Pacific, Sixth  and Cleveland streets, north and east of the pier.  </P></p>

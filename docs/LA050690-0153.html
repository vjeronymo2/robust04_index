			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KERSEY IS BLAZING HOT, 107-94;  </P> <P> NBA PLAYOFFS: SPURS' ROBINSON HELD TO NINE POINTS ON THREE-OF-11 SHOOTING.  </P> <P> Jerome Kersey has been promised a raise after this season. The way he's  playing, it's going to be a big one.  </P> <P> The Portland forward scored 25 points and grabbed a playoff career-high 16  rebounds Saturday as the Trail Blazers opened the Western Conference semifinals  with a 107-94 victory over the San Antonio Spurs.  </P> <P> "I've really got confidence now," Kersey said. "My outside shot is going down  and that's really opening things up for me. It feels good."  </P> <P> Saturday's big game followed Kersey's playoff career-best 29-point effort at  Dallas Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "He's been playing well the last couple of months of the season, but the last  two games he's just shot so well," Portland Coach Rick Adelman said. "He knocks  down so many open jumpers, and that really helps when he's able to do that."  </P> <P> Clyde Drexler added 23 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds.  </P> <P> Portland fell behind by eight points early in the third quarter, rallied to  edge ahead at the end of the period, then pulled away at the finish with a 15-1  spurt in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Portland played without starting center Kevin Duckworth, who suffered a broken  right hand Tuesday night. But the Blazers still held David Robinson to nine  points on three-of-11 shooting.  </P> <P> Robinson, guarded much of the game by rookie Cliff Robinson, missed his first  eight shots and attempted only one in the second half. It was only the second  time this season that the San Antonio center didn't score in double figures.  </P> <P> "I just didn't play my own game," David Robinson said. "Usually I rebound a lot  better and position myself a lot better, but I wasn't into it."  </P></p>

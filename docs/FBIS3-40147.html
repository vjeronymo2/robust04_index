In this one year, of the nine highway contruction  projects in the National and Autonomous Region's 7th and 8th  Five-Year Plans, eight were finished and put into use, with six  of them being assessed as fine projects. This was a result of  the attention and concern of the Ministry of Transportation and  the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional People's Government, the  support of the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang, and the  hard work of tens of thousands of highway construction workers  and officers and men of the People's Armed Police Transportation  Unit.    Xinjiang is a vast territory where transportation used to be  quite backward. But as reform and opening up has developed in  depth, and China's western economic construction has taken off,  the importance of highway construction in Xinjiang has become  increasingly evident. The great northwest is a key region in  China's productive forces layout in the transition to the new  century, and a priority in China's "four border" strategic  development, as Xinjiang sits on both borders and roadways,  being located at the center of the new Eurasian land bridge,  with over 60 countries and regions having developed  "highway"-centered economic and trade exchanges, with Xinjiang  as the relay station and the Central Asian inland business and  trade center for joint development with the CIS and Eastern  Europe of the Eurasian inland market. Xinjiang highway  construction is a heavy responsibility with bright prospects,  meaning that we will have to work even harder.    We are now actively planning the construction of a superior  highway from Turpan to Urumqi to Dahuangshan. This will be  Xinjiang's largest single highway construction project since  liberation, with an estimated overall investment of 2.3 billion  yuan, including a World Bank loan of $150 million, with the  highway being 285.5 km long, divided into two sections, east and  north. The east section will start at the mouth of Grape Ravine  in Turpan on National Highway No. 312, ending at Ulabo Lake in  Urumqi, being about 178.8 km long; the north section will start  at the intersection of Xingfu Road at Dahuangshan in Fukang on  National Highway No. 216, ending at the north mouth of Hetan  Road in Urumqi, being about 107.7 km long, to be a key part of  China's northwest highway system. The highway will pass through  famous Xinjiang tourist sites such as Turpan and Tianchi,  running along Xinjiang production bases for commodities such as  coal, oil, industrial chemicals, iron and steel, and motor  vehicles. It will play an enormous driving role in speeding up  the industrial and agricultural production of these areas and in  spurring economic development throughout Xinjiang. We have made  conscientious early-stage preparations according to World Bank  loan international project procedures, with the feasibility  study report having successfully won State Planning Commission  approval through examination and appraisal, the initial project  design documents having been examined by the Ministry of  Transportation, and an evaluation of the whole project by the  World Bank Evaluation Delegation having been received. To ensure  project progress and quality, we have adopted international  bidding, with over 30 construction units having bought advance  eligibility evaluation documents, the roadside work of land  acquisition and demolition and removal already underway, and  efforts being made to begin construction in the summer or fall  of 1994. Meanwhile, we are emphasizing three highway  construction projects, such as from Tianchi to Turpan Port,  guaranteeing their total completion in 1994. While focusing our  human and financial resources on superior highway construction  project priorities, we will continue in 1994 to build highways  such as National Highway No. 312's sections from Sailimu Lake to  Qingshui River and from Hami to Barkol, in an effort to build  more and better roads for Xinjiang's economic development.    As a review of the past year shows amazing achievements, we  are looking to the future with full confidence. We will welcome  the arrival of the new year with even more outstanding  accomplishments.</p>

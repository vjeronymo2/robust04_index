			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN REACHES SEMIFINALS IN VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Second-seeded Cal State Northridge overcame a shaky start Friday night and  advanced to the semifinals of the Women's Invitational Volleyball Championships  with a 6-15, 15-5, 15-12, 15-7 victory over seventh-seeded Iowa at the  University of Tennessee.  </P> <P> The Matadors, 28-8 overall and 4-0 in pool play, will face another pool  champion, Georgia (29-13, 3-1), this afternoon.  </P> <P> The other semifinal pits Houston (22-15, 4-0) against Memphis State (30-8,  3-1). The winners will meet tonight for the championship.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Northridge swept Eastern Kentucky, 15-5, 15-8, 15-2, in  just 52 minutes.  </P> <P> Senior Kathleen Dixon led Northridge against Iowa with 18 kills, 12 digs and  seven block solos. The Matadors also received outstanding performances from  Patty Fitzsimmons (12 kills and 22 digs), Nancy Nicholls (10 kills) and  Marianne Dixon (eight kills, 13 digs and four solo blocks).  </P> <P> "Kathleen and Marianne were phenomenal again," Matador Coach Walt Ker said.  "Nancy and Patty were terrific on the outside for us as well. Having that kind  of play . . . against a top NCAA Division I program was the key to us winning."  </P> <P> Regarding Eastern Kentucky (24-21), Ker said: "I was happy to see (Northridge)  come out and perform well and beat a team that we were clearly better than."  Ker feared his team might be caught looking ahead to the Iowa match.  </P> <P> The Matadors had four players with similar kill totals. Nancy Nichols led the  way with seven, and Kathleen Dixon, Marianne Dixon and Jill Trehearne each had  six.  </P></p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: General Accident General Accident is a prime example of the way in which insurance companies have been de-rated this year. The company's net asset value has fallen by 16 per cent since the turn of the year, while the shares have fallen by 25 per cent. Gloom about the outlook for stock and bond markets - especially in North America, which accounts for half of GA's premium income - are partly to blame. Even if asset markets now calm down, though, worries about competition in insurance markets will not go away. There is little doubt that the insurance cycle is turning down in UK personal lines. Private motor premiums have already started to fall. Claims will probably become more frequent as the economy turns up. Current returns on household insurance are also unsustainable. With underwriting profits of Pounds 28 per Pounds 100 of homeowners' premium income in the first quarter, GA must have been making a pre-tax return on capital close to 100 per cent. It is little wonder that direct insurance writers are turning their attention to this line of business. Still, GA's shares now yield 60 per cent more than the market average. That valuation only makes sense on a bleak view of both asset markets and the underwriting cycle. The plunge in stock and bond markets may thus be a blessing in disguise. Having seen its solvency ratio fall by 10 percentage points to 55 per cent so far this year, GA cannot afford to lower its underwriting standards.</p>

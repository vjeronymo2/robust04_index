			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Weather wise - Typhoons, hurricanes and the threat of global warming are pushing up insurance rates 'WE GET zapped every five minutes,' says Richard Keeling, underwriter with Lloyd's syndicate 362, reviewing the impact of recent hurricanes, gales and typhoons on the London insurance market. Recent storms, each more damaging than the last, culminated in last year's hurricane Andrew, which devastated parts of Louisiana and Florida and caused losses estimated to be at least Dollars 16bn and perhaps as much as Dollars 20bn (Pounds 14bn), the United States's biggest-ever insured loss. That has triggered tough bargaining in the London insurance market and one of the hardest 'renewal' seasons, as reinsurers seek to impose big rate increases. Most significantly, in a move that could lead to higher insurance rates for many years, insurers are also beginning to ask whether recent storms are a sign of global warming or other long-term shifts in weather patterns. The question has led to an unlikely convergence with environmental pressure groups such as Greenpeace, which last month published a long report welcoming insurers' alertness to the risk. In the recent round of negotiations, brokers buying cover for US clients - who have avoided heavy increases in recent years - have found the going toughest. However, across the board, direct insurers are now paying more for their reinsurance. Keeling says that since October 1987, reinsurance rates have increased by 650 per cent for European insurers, 450 per cent for US buyers and by 1,000 per cent for Japanese companies. The increases partly reflect reinsurers' efforts to restore profitability after heavy losses from weather and from other disasters such as the 1988 Piper Alpha oil rig explosion and the Exxon Valdez oil spill the following year. Both Swiss Re and Munich Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, have seen profits dented and have been forced to draw deep into their reserves to meet claims, especially from the European storms of 1990. Many smaller reinsurers have withdrawn from the market. More than a third of Lloyd's Names and nearly half the syndicates have left the market since 1989. As competition for business has dwindled, bigger players have found it easier to force through rate increases. Underwriters are also now beginning to take a deeper look at the risk of storm damage. They recognise that denser population in potentially exposed regions, such as the south-eastern coast of the US, is partly responsible for the rise in losses. 'Windstorm' cover has also become a more common element of householders' policies over the last two decades in most countries. And increasingly many are questioning whether the recent increases in land and sea temperatures are leading to greater atmospheric instability and more frequent and intense winds. Scientists have warned for several years that gases such as carbon dioxide, emitted from burning fossil fuels, could cause global warming. The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, set up to investigate the phenomenon, has suggested the average increase could be somewhere between 1.5'C and 3.5'C over the next 100 years. However, scientists have emphasised there is still uncertainty about the processes involved - the models find it hard to take account of clouds, which could slow down warming. They also say it is impossible to conclude from recent storms and warm summers that climate change is already happening. Despite scientific uncertainty, insurers feel they need to protect themselves. Walter Kielholz, general manager of Swiss Re, one of the first insurance companies to question whether global warming could be responsible for worsening weather, agrees that 'the statistical data is too short to conclusively prove that there is a trend'. But he adds: 'It might just be a hiccup but we can't afford to wait for the long-term before taking action.' Research commissioned by Keeling and several other Lloyd's underwriters by the University of East Anglia's climatology department also concludes: 'The possibility that the trend (of more frequent gales in north-western Europe) is related to global warming cannot be rejected.' Insurers should assume that 'gale frequencies will remain at the level of the 1980s' and could rise further, the report says. In Greenpeace's recent study, the pressure group called for insurers to join the lobby for limits on the emission of 'greenhouse gases'. Keeling acknowledges: 'We have to do something constructive but the insurance industry will never be a lobby. We are too diffused.' Instead, as well as increasing rates insurers have begun to toughen the terms of storm insurance. Kielholz says that since 1990 Swiss Re has begun to isolate the risk of 'windstorm' from other exposures it underwrites. The group now likes to cover windstorm through an excess of loss reinsurance contract (in which the reinsurer covers a tranche of risk up to a pre-set limit) rather than by covering it alongside other risks as part of a proportional reinsurance deal (in which the reinsurer accepts an agreed percentage of exposure). 'Reinsurers have become more and more reluctant to include windstorm in proportional property treaties,' says Kielholz. Reinsurers are also urging direct insurers to make policyholders pay the first portion of any loss themselves, as an incentive to protect their property against storms. Householders would then be more likely to carry out essential maintenance and commercial customers to follow building codes more strictly, they argue. During Hurricane Andrew many new buildings, especially those with steel frames and metal casings, proved to be particularly vulnerable to wind damage, according to Swiss Re. Higher rates and tougher terms are the insurance industry's perhaps unsurprising response to recent storms and the potential threat of global warming. The environmental movement has shown itself reluctant to acknowledge scientific doubts about climate change, while climatologists - who might stress that uncertainty - have few reasons to get involved in debates on insurance charges. Customers may have to hope the new higher rates help preserve some of the financially weaker groups, and so preserve competition in the industry.  -----------------------------------------------------------------                    THE COST OF RECENT STORMS  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Aug 1992    US                 Cyclone Iniki      Dollars  1.4bn Aug 1992    US                 Hurricane Andrew   Dollars 20.0bn Sep 1991    Japan              Typhoon Mireille   Dollars  4.8bn Jul 1990    US                 Colorado storms    Dollars  1.0bn Feb 1990    NW Europe          Windstorm Wibke    Dollars  1.3bn Feb 1990    NW Europe          Windstorm Vivian   Dollars  3.2bn Feb 1990    NW Europe          Windstorm Herta    Dollars  1.3bn Jan 1990    NW Europe          Windstorm Daria    Dollars  4.6bn Sep 1989    US                 Hurricane Hugo     Dollars  5.8bn Oct 1987    NW Europe          Un-named windstorm Dollars  2.5bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Greenpeace  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

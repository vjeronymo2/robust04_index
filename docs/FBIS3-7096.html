In its March issue, the XIANDAI BINGQI (MODERN ARMS)  magazine  said the North Korean People's Army has 115,000 security and  border troops and some three million Red Guards comprised of  workers and peasants, in addition to the 1.1 million-strong  regular Army.    The North Korean naval fleet includes 14 Suzhou-class guided  missile fast boats, each equipped with two SSN2 ship-to-ship  missile launchers, 16 Shaoxing-class guided missile fast boats,  each armed with one SSN2 ship-to-ship missile launcher, and six  Hainan-class patrol boats having one anti-submarine rocket  launcher apiece, it said, suggesting that the boats are of  Chinese make.    North Korea's Army and air force are also armed with the  latest ground-to-ground and ground-to-air missiles, the magazine  reported. "In 1992, North Korea spent 6 billion U.S. dollars, or  30 percent of its gross national product, for defense buildup."    As for the command system of the North Korean People's Army,  it said the supreme command post is the Central Military  Commission of the Workers' Party. The Ministry of People's  Armed Forces is under the control of the Central People's  Committee and the chief of general staff is controlled directly  by the People's Armed Forces minister.    Under the chief of the general staff are the artillery,  mechanized forces, navy and air force commanders.</p>

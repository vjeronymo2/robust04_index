			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / International Company News: Banks fail to stop slide in Metallgesellschaft shares Metallgesellschaft's share price fell almost 20 per cent in Frankfurt yesterday following a turbulent session in which the loss-ridden group's shareholder banks pitted themselves against speculators. After a day's suspension to allow markets to digest revised losses of DM1.8bn (Dollars 1.1bn) last year and the call on creditor banks and shareholders for DM3.2bn in aid, the shares closed down DM52.50 on Wednesday's price at DM218. The price had fluctuated between DM202 and DM227. Traders expected more erratic movements early next week, at least until Wednesday, when creditor banks are due to respond to rescue proposals prepared by the new management and Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, the group's shareholder-cum-house banks. Analysts believed the banks would provide the necessary backing, basing their judgment on the relatively modest loss in the shares value yesterday. Traders said shareholder banks were clearly supporting the stock to make sure the planned new share issue, priced at DM250, remained practicable. Longer-term prospects for the share price were unclear, although Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the new chairman, may offer more indications of his restructuring plans at a press conference, provisionally set for late next week. Most interest is focused on a list of planned disposals from among the company's 250-odd subsidiaries of which few clear details have yet appeared. Mr Neukirchen has undertaken to reduce group payroll costs by up to DM700m a year. Mr Neukirchen has taken over a company with a potential total loss of DM3.3bn, including a possible DM1.5bn in losses which may be incurred in unwinding New York oil futures positions. His predecessor, Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, sacked just before Christmas, is under criminal investigation, it emerged yesterday. The Frankfurt public prosecutors office has taken up the case following a complaint by a small shareholder. Mr Schimmelbusch and Mr Meinhard Forster, the finance director who was fired at the same time, are being investigated for alleged breaches of the German Companies Act. The main complaint relates to their failure to report a loss which exceeded half the company's equity base. Last November the company formally announced a pre-tax deficit of DM347m for the year to the end of September.</p>

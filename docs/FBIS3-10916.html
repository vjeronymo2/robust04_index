			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Justice and Peace Commission has publicly  admonished the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] for  committing proven acts of violence against members of the  Christian Democratic Party [PDC] on 6 March in La Chorrera  District. A Justice and Peace Commission statement pointed out  that although it is encouraging that PRD leaders, as well as  members who perpetrated the acts, made apologies and rejected  violence, the Commission wishes to remind everyone that the  ethical agreement that was signed seeks to avoid and prevent  incidents of this type and reiterates to the signatories their  responsibility to honor this agreement. The Justice and Peace  Commission urged all political parties and all citizens to stop  insults and attacks and to seek together the path leading to a  consensus.    Meanwhile, the PRD issued a communique accepting and  respecting the Justice and Peace Commission's admonishment. It  also called on the PRD Court of Honor and Discipline to apply  the corresponding disciplinary measures to those members  responsible for the attack. The PRD again prompted all its  members to honor the commitments that the party made in the  Santa Maria La Antigua Ethical-Electoral Pact.</p>

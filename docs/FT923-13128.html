			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Croats precipitate refugee crisis: As thousands flee fighting, Zagreb foists problem on to international community THOUSANDS of distraught refugees are expected to gather at central European borders following Croatia's refusal to take any more people fleeing the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina, a United Nations relief official said yesterday. 'We are very concerned about the situation ..I think you could have thousands of refugees in emotional situations piling up at the borders,' said Mr Laurens Jolles, legal officer at the Belgrade branch of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. Refugees from the war in Bosnia, which has killed at least 7,500 people and left thousands more missing, have flooded into Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria and Hungary. Tens of thousands more remain trapped in Bosnia by the fighting. The UNHCR says that more than 2.2m people have been driven from their homes, with over 1.7m seeking refuge within the frontiers of the former Yugoslavia, and 500,000 distributed around other European countries. Croatia said on Monday it was on the verge of collapse, overwhelmed by the nearly 580,000 people who had sought refuge there from fighting in Bosnia and from within Croatia. It said the border with Bosnia would not be closed but that all new arrivals would be transported directly to the borders of its northern neighbours. 'Foreign countries are not willing to open their borders and want to turn Croatia into a refugee centre,' the government said. 'There is not enough understanding or help from the international community.' Croatia's inland cities and coastal resorts have been overrun by displaced people and tent settlements have sprouted in several parts of the former Yugoslav republic. The government said refugee camps would now serve only as transit centres and that the new ruling would be enforced by the interior ministry. UNHCR officials said neighbouring countries, not only Croatia and Serbia, should share the burden of the refugee exodus. Mr Peter Kessler, the UNHCR spokesman in Sarajevo, said: 'We regret the (Croatian) decision but at the same time there was literally a flood of people.' He added: 'There is still a lot of troop activity throughout Bosnia. People do not feel secure. Those who choose to stay behind find themselves facing persecution.' Serb forces, which control more than half of Bosnian territory, are driving out Moslems from eastern Bosnia in a policy of 'ethnic cleansing'. Hungary reacted last night to the Croatian decision by barring entry to Bosnians travelling through Croatia. 'The Geneva Convention says refugees should be accommodated in the neighbouring country, and the neighbouring countries in this case are Serbia and Croatia, not Hungary,' a government spokesman said. Since the start of July, about 2,000 Bosnians have arrived in Hungary, taking the refugee total from the conflict to 54,000. Many of the recent arrivals said they were forced out of their homes by Serb militiamen, given fresh Yugoslav passports and put on trains to be dumped in Hungary. The Hungarian authorities fear a new wave of refugees as the Serbian transit camp on the deportation route in Vojvodina is reported to be full. In Austria, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky urged other European countries to take refugees. Austria is giving shelter to about 50,000 refugees from the fighting. It has introduced visa requirements for fugitives from Serbia and Montenegro, but is allowing in without visas Bosnians from areas suffering from the Serbian onslaught. Mr Ivan Jarnak, of the Croatian interior ministry, plans to visit Vienna today to discuss the Croat measure. Austria is hosting a meeting of seven central European heads of government tomorrow to discuss the deteriorating refugee position. The other main host countries for the refugees are Germany, which has an estimated 200,000, Switzerland with about 40,000, and Sweden with the same number. Mr Heinz Schoni, of Switzerland's Office of the Delegate for Refugees, said there were 'tens of thousands' of displaced people from the former Yugoslavia in Switzerland but the government did not have precise figures because they do not usually apply for asylum. Normally, they join relatives already living there. About 10,000 people have asked officially for asylum, mostly ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. Switzerland has also issued 30,000 visas to citizens of the former Yugoslavia since January when visas became compulsory. Everyone from Bosnia may stay, even if their visas have expired. Croatians are supposed to return but those from badly destroyed areas have been given a temporary reprieve. Serbians are required to leave, with the exception of army deserters and ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. 'We have not closed our frontiers,' said Mr Schoni. 'We have one of the biggest groups of displaced Yugoslavs in Europe.' In Sweden, three-quarters of the refugees who have entered this year are ethnic Albanians from the province of Kosovo in Serbia, many of whom have travelled via Poland. However, half the inflow over the past month have been from Bosnia-Hercegovina. There was speculation yesterday that Croatia was directing Bosnians towards its neighbours in an effort to influence international opinion. A European diplomat in Belgrade said: 'Croatia made the move to call world attention to the crisis. There is also a tremendous problem in Serbia which will only increase with the UN sanctions.'  -----------------------------------------------------------                     IN FORMER YUGOSLAVIA  ----------------------------------------------------------- Present              From         From location            Croatia      Bosnia        Total                                Hercegovina  ----------------------------------------------------------- Croatia             267,000       310,500      577,500  ----------------------------------------------------------- UN protected areas in Croatia     69,000  ----------------------------------------------------------- Serbia              165,000       208,500      373,500  ----------------------------------------------------------- Bosnia               93,000       500,000      593,000  ----------------------------------------------------------- Montenegro            7,500        41,000       48,500  ----------------------------------------------------------- Slovenia              3,000        60,000       63,000  ----------------------------------------------------------- Macedonia             2,500        25,500       28,000  ----------------------------------------------------------- Total               607,000     1,145,500    1,752,500  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

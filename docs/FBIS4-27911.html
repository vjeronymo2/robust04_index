			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Takashi Obayashi] </F>   [Text] A situation in which "values are being influenced by  an excessive money supply" is being created in domestic  financial and capital markets. The reason is that the Bank of  Japan [BOJ] has taken a clear-cut position of monetary easing  with the objective of aiding in the recycling of capital to the  United States in conjunction with monetary tightening in that  country. Money is increasingly being traded for financial assets  such as stocks and bonds, instead of being used for capital  investments.    A change has taken place in the short-term financial markets  since the May holiday season. The noncollateralized next-day  call rate fell to a historic low of just above 2 percent and the  differential between it and the official discount rate  (currently at 1.75 percent) which in the past had been  maintained at a minimum of 0.5 percent dropped to the  0.2-percent range, providing for only a minimal differential.    Bond and stock prices have reacted with sensitivity and the  Nikkei average at one time set new highs for the year. According  to a fund manager at a major investment trust company, a change  in perspectives is emerging which says, "City banks are in a  position where they have no choice but to allocate capital  generated from call markets to investments in the stock market."    It was none other than the BOJ that caused a "drop in  short-term interest rates as seen on the eve before the cut in  the official discount rate," according to an official at a city  bank-affiliated major leasing firm.    "What will be the next step taken by the people on the  second  floor," is a question that reflects the sole concern of BOJ  watchers at city banks. The second floor is where the BOJ  Operations Bureau is located. The reason was that the position  of counselor for the Operations Bureau, whose incumbent is  responsible for directing monetary adjustments, was vacated by  Mr. Minoru Masubuchi and filled by Mr. Yoshiharu Obata formerly  deputy director of the Planning Bureau during the regular  personnel shuffle in May.    It appears that the BOJ will maintain the low interest rate  policy of the "Masuda period." Even on the 24th and 25th, the  BOJ fed funds to the short-term markets at rates which exceeded  the expectations of market sources and maintained  noncollateralized next-day call interest rates at historically  low levels.    BOJ President Yasushi Mieno states, "The economy shows signs  of bottoming and the climate in support of a recovery is  stronger than last year." If signs of an economic recovery are  visible, common sense in the past would dictate somewhat of a  tightening of the monetary supply, but one wonders why the BOJ  has resumed a policy of guiding interest rates to a lower level.    A viewpoint quietly mentioned in the markets is based on the  theory considering the value of the yen. Noboru Nagai,  International Capital-Foreign Exchange Department chief of the  Tokyo branch of the Netherlands Bank, presumes the BOJ's change  in attitude as reflecting a situation in which, "The BOJ was  asked to participate in policy coordination with the U.S.  monetary authorities who wished to avoid a further drop in the  declining dollar."    Officially, the BOJ merely repeats itself when it says, "We  do not manage interest policy for the purpose of controlling the  value of the yen." The reason given by BOJ officials is, "There  will be no limit if we were to drop interest rates in  coordination with the value of the yen," in view of the fact  that the official discount rate is at 1.75 percent, the lowest  level among the advanced nations. However, notwithstanding, the  BOJ has been forced to undertake strong market action to provide  for low market interest rates.    However, there is the viewpoint that, "A strong yen is  merely  an excuse for action to provide for the recent lowering of  interest rates. A second ulterior motive is concealed in  President Mieno's statement which says, "The balance sheets of  financial institutions require further adjustments."    Lower short-term interest rates directly lead to a reduction  in banks' capital procurement costs. "Lower interest rates  leading to higher stock prices" will enable banks to raise funds  for amortizing bad loans based on profits from stock holdings.  Soichi Hirabayashi, chief of the Funding Department of Fuji  Bank, points out, "A bottoming of the economy does not  necessarily signal a unilateral rise in market interest rates."  This is a case where the BOJ is creating an abundant money  supply.    The BOJ is following the footsteps of the U.S. Federal  Reserve Board (FRB) in terms of the latter's monetary policy  after 1990. There is a precedent in which the FRB assumed an  ultra-monetary-easing policy--in which it assumed a real  short-term interest rate of zero after deducting the anticipated  inflation rate from the nominal interest rate--for a period of  18 months in which it encouraged stock and bond prices to rise.    The creation of financial values by policy officials and the  bold disposition of bad loans despite the recording of losses  enabled U.S. banks to stage a widespread recovery from their  problems. However, complications from such an approach were also  sizeable. Although it is said that the current turbulence in  U.S. financial and stock markets are the result of monetary  tightening since February, a major factor is a reaction to the  easy money valuations.    It can be said that the BOJ is in effect being forced to  follow the footsteps of the FRB. If attention is focused only on  adjustments necessary to cope with the collapse of the bubble,  there is the definite risk that we will again invite a market  reaction.</p>

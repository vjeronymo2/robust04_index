			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Premier Group turns in improved earnings THE restructured Premier Group, the South African foods, pharmaceuticals and leisure company, improved earnings in the 13 months to the end of April. Results have been restated in an annualised form to make them comparable with 1991. Turnover rose by 93 per cent to R9.8bn while trading profit was 12 per cent higher at R420.1m (Dollars 149.4m). Attributable earnings advanced 24 per cent to R190m. The jump in turnover and the lower margins reflect the acquisition of controlling interests in Metro, Cash and Carry, Score supermarkets and Click stores, the first three chains being high turnover, low margin businesses. On an annualised basis, turnover of comparable operations rose by 13 per cent. Other transactions included the sale of 50 per cent of Bonny Bird Farms and 50 per cent of Epol Animal Feeds. The results of CNA Gallo are no longer being consolidated. Mr Peter Wrighton, chairman, said a highlight of the year's performance had been the substantial improvement in the group's gearing, with interest bearing debt down to R160.5m from R347.6m. The debt:equity ratio has improved to 10.6 per cent from 24.6 per cent. He said the low gearing, and the R80m cash in hand put the company in a good position to expand further. Mr Wrighton also stressed the turnround in the performance of Metro and Score and the more than 50 per cent improvement in earnings at Twins Pharmaceuticals following a rationalisation programme and the elimination of borrowings. Mr Wrighton also addressed the issue of food inflation which caused a public outcry when the Central Statistical Service said recently that it was running at 28.9 per cent per annum. He pointed out that 70 per cent of this inflation originated from meat, vegetables and fruit and nuts - areas in which Premier is not involved. He also dismissed as 'nonsense' claims that the country's severe drought might cause food prices to soar by as much as 45 per cent. Earnings per share were 16 per cent up at 244 cents, and the dividend was lifted to 88 cents from 70 cents per share. Mr Wrighton forecast satisfactory growth for the year ahead. Divisional contributions to turnover and attributable profits were, respectively: Cash and Carry - 40 per cent and 9.2 per cent; Food - 28.5 per cent and 59.9 per cent; Retail - 16.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent; Pharmaceuticals - 11 per cent and 15.5 per cent and Entertainment and Leisure - 4 per cent and 7.8 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Russian Information Agency] </F>   [Text] The case of cholera illness discovered in Moscow  seriously concerned the staff of the city sanitary service, said  Chief Sanitary Physician of Moscow Nikolay Filatov in a  conversation with a Russian information agency correspondent.  Some of them are switched to round-the-clock operation. All  alimentary products which may carry cholera pathogens, and this  extends to both food produced in Moscow and that brought from  other regions, will be subjected to rigorous inspection in order  to identify the cholera bacillus [sic]. Nikolay Filatov  elaborated that ``these measures do not, nevertheless, mean a  ban on food imports into the capital.''    In his opinion, the source of cholera infection is most  likely located in Moscow and calls upon everyone to observe the  rules of personal hygiene more carefully and not to consume  unwashed foodstuffs.</p>

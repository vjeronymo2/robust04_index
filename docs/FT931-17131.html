			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Survey shows US orders rising THE US manufacturing sector continued to expand in December, according to a widely watched survey of industrial buyers, George Graham writes from Washington. The National Association of Purchasing Managers index rose for the third consecutive month to 55.9 per cent, and a NAPM index of new orders climbed sharply to its highest level for three years. Separately, the Commerce Department said manufacturers' new orders declined by 0.9 per cent in November, the first drop in three months. Economists said, however, that this decline was mostly attributable to aircraft orders, which tend to fluctuate erratically. Factory shipments rose by 1.1 per cent in November.</p>

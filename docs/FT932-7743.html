			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sharp contrast in Australian bank results WESTPAC Banking Corporation and National Australia Bank, the largest Australian banking groups, yesterday revealed widely contrasting financial performances for the six months to March. The National consolidated its position as the country's most successful major bank with a 25 per cent rise in net earnings, after extraordinaries, to ADollars 507.3m (USDollars 362.3m), an interim dividend increase from 22 cents to 24 cents a share, and a 5 per cent fall in bad and doubtful debt charges to Dollars A392.1m. In contrast, Westpac reported a Dollars A204.6m loss, a halved interim dividend of 6 cents a share, large new bad and doubtful debt write-offs of almost Dollars A800m, and plans to raise a further Dollars A500m in converting preference shares to top up its capital adequacy ratios. Although still in the red, the latest Westpac result was far better than the previous corresponding half, when the bank's property and other problems first surfaced with a Dollars A2.7bn bad and doubtful debt write-off, causing a Dollars A1.7bn net loss. Property problems again bit hard into the latest Westpac result. Non-property write-offs were reduced to a manageable Dollars A275m, but revaluations of problem property assets caused a further Dollars A525m in bad debt charges. The Westpac result was also hit by abnormal losses of Dollars A178.3m (Dollars A266.6m previously), including a Dollars A137m charge for restructuring expenses. The managing director of Westpac, Mr Robert Joss, pointed yesterday to progress achieved by the bank towards recovery targets. He said operating expenses had been reduced markedly and the company's earnings before write-offs and tax had risen from Dollars A686.7m to Dollars A729.1m in the half. This reflected improved performances in the bank's Australian, New Zealand, US and European operations and a return to profits by the troubled finance offshoot, Australian Guarantee Corporation. 'The group's results will be largely influenced by the successful completion of restructures now in process to reduce operating expenses and the effect of reducing low-performing corporate assets, mainly offshore,' Mr Joss said. 'The adverse impact of non-performing loans has been diminishing.' Westpac's gross problem loan portfolio eased from Dollars A9.72bn to Dollars A8.57bn in the half. In contrast, the National's problem loans, although not strictly comparable because of differing accounting practices, grew from Dollars A4.25bn to Dollars A5.31bn. The National's result reflected higher earnings from its Australian, UK and Irish banks and a bigger contribution from New Zealand following the takeover of Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) late last year. UK and Irish banks lifted their combined contribution from Dollars A83.9m to Dollars A152.5m. The Clydesdale Bank lifted its net contribution from Dollars A37.7m to Dollars A65.8m; Northern Bank was up from Dollars A23.8m to Dollars A32.6m; Yorkshire Bank rose from Dollars A45.8m to Dollars A89m; National Irish lifted from Dollars A5.9m to Dollars A9.5m; but NAG (UK) increased its loss from Dollars A12.4m to Dollars A16m. The managing director of the National, Mr Don Argus, said the latest result had been achieved without any significant upturn in economies where the bank operates. He said profit before tax and provisions had risen by 10.3 per cent to Dollars A1.24bn. 'Gains were generated through increased productivity, successful cost containment, improved credit management and by the development of successful new banking products targeted at key segments of the market,' Mr Argus said. The National's total capital adequacy ratio was reduced from 11.7 to a still-comfortable 10.8 per cent in the half, against the required Reserve Bank minimum of 8 per cent. Westpac's corresponding ratio rose from a shaky 8.4 per cent to 10 per cent. Westpac directors yesterday approved a request by the bank's newest major shareholder, Lend Lease Corporation, to lift its Westpac stake to 15 per cent. They also invited two Lend Lease executives, Mr Stuart Hornery and Mr John Morschel, to join the Westpac board. Meanwhile, the chairman of Westpac, Mr John Uhrig, announced he would resign from the board of the bank's existing 15 per cent shareholder, the AMP Society.</p>

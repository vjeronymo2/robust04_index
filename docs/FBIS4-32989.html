			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ariel Montoya] </F>   [Text] Political leaders Alfredo Cesar, Guillermo Potoy,  and Luis Sanchez Sancho, yesterday disclosed during a news  conference at the Intercontinental Hotel, the creation of a new  political organization called the National Democratic Party  (PND) [Partido Nacional Democrata].    The PND came about after the Supreme Electoral Council  issued  a ruling in favor of the National Council of Political Parties'  decision to recognize Adolfo Jarquin as the leader of the Social  Democratic Party [PSD], thereby ratifying the ousting of Cesar  and Potoy. Now there are 25 political parties in the nation.  Cesar said that he, as well as a group of politicians who had  belonged to other parties, were forced to create one more party  given the political circumstances. "We had no other choice," he  said. The PND defined itself as center-right although its  leaders did not rule out that persons of social-democratic  ideologies could join.    Former PSD president Guillermo Potoy described this party's  past role during its 15 years of existence while he recalled  that it never surrendered to Sandinist plans in the past decade.  He added that for some years now an interest was perceived for  the PSD to change its strategy of struggle and to assume an  attitude of support and favor toward the current government.  "This decision was strengthened with the help of government  officials -- PSD members -- who for personal gain have dragged  us to the current circumstances," Potoy noted.    Meanwhile, Sanchez Sancho said he was participating in the  PND to contribute to the finding of political stability in the  country. He said that after having actively participated in the  left, he is convinced that this is not the ideological  alternative for solving Nicaragua's problems. Sanchez Sancho  said: "The left talks about progress and it generates  backwardness. It talks about rivers of milk and honey that are  of blood."</p>

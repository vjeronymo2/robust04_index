			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO-CHINA PAPER CLOSES;  </P> <P> BOYCOTT OVER STAND ON BEIJING PROTESTS DRAINS AD INCOME  </P> <P> One of the largest Chinese-language newspapers in the United States shut down  this week because of advertising losses its publisher attributed to a  passionate boycott in Los Angeles and elsewhere against its pro-Beijing  editorials.  </P> <P> In a terse, front-page announcement in Monday's issue, executives of the Centre  Daily News told readers the paper had suffered severe financial losses due to  an organized effort to undercut its advertising sales.  </P> <P> "We were losing $300,000 a month nationwide," Stephen Fu, 37, the paper's  publisher and editor said from its Monterey Park office. "The main thing is  that after the June 4 Tian An Men incident, because our paper supported  Beijing's conservative faction, that drew opposition from the Chinese  community."  </P> <P> The paper's offices in Monterey Park, Boston, New York, San Francisco and  Chicago all closed Saturday, Fu said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Newspapers Trampled  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the depth of the local Chinese community's fury at the Centre  Daily News was evident as early as June, when protesters outside the Chinese  Consulate in Los Angeles trampled copies of the newspaper.  </P> <P> "Da Dao Zhong Bao!" (Down with the Centre Daily News!) they shouted, venting  their anger against a newspaper whose editorials supported hard-line Chinese  leader Deng Xiaoping. Others urged readers and advertisers to boycott the  paper.  </P> <P> The paper, which had averaged 50 pages a day at its height, was forced to run  as few as 32 pages in recent months, Fu said. The paper also had to run some  ads free just to fill space, he said.  </P> <P> Fu declined to reveal the paper's circulation, and an industry directory, Gale  Directory of Publications, indicates that the Centre Daily News did not report  its circulation.  </P> <P> However, a former editor at the paper, widely considered to be the  second-largest of about six Chinese-language dailies nationwide, said the  Centre Daily News' circulation was at 50,000 at its best and had recently  plummeted to less than 20,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Started in New York  </P> <P> Fu said he does not know when the Centre Daily News, which he acknowledged has  had financial troubles for several years, may be revived. Fu heads the Monterey  Park office while Ya-tang Fu, his older brother and president of the company,  is based in New York. Their father, Chau-chu Fu, owns the paper, which started  in New York in 1982 and opened its Monterey Park office in 1984.  </P> <P> Many in the Chinese newspaper industry said they were not surprised by the  closure because of the paper's past financial troubles and the Chinese-American  community's intense resentment of the paper's political stance.  </P> <P> "It was going to happen sooner or later," said Cao Changqing, editor of the  Press Freedom Herald, a pro-democracy Chinese-language paper founded in  Alhambra after the Beijing crackdown.  </P> <P> Cao described Centre Daily News editorials as "absurd" and said he hopes the  paper has learned that "readers are the people they must serve, not a  government or a party."  </P> <P> Many in the Chinese community in Southern California viewed the closure as an  important gain for pro-democracy supporters who have lost the political battle  in their homeland.  </P> <P> "I was just happy they are closed," said T. C. Chen, of Ontario. "It's a great  victory for the pro-democracy movement. The community showed its solidarity."  </P> <P> A former Centre Daily News reporter in Monterey Park said Thursday that readers  were calling the newsroom to say they were elated to hear the paper was  shutting down.  </P> <P> But even some critics of the Beijing government said they were sorry the  Chinese newspaper community has lost a competing voice.  </P> <P> "In my opinion, the closure is a pity because I like to read different points  of view," said San Gabriel resident Wang Hongkai.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Perils of Partisanship  </P> <P> The fate of the Centre Daily News highlights the perils of political  partisanship in the highly competitive Chinese newspaper industry. It is a  business in which headlines, often opinionated and emotional, reflect the  political bent of the newspapers.  </P> <P> The demise of the Centre Daily News does not mark the first time a  Chinese-language newspaper has fallen victim to political sentiment.  </P> <P> In 1984, the China Times closed its San Gabriel office, citing the paper's  failure to make a profit, said Alan Yi, president of the Chinese Press Assn. of  Southern California. But others said the paper closed because it lost its  Taiwan-based financial support after giving Chinese athletes favorable coverage  at the Los Angeles Olympics.  </P> <P> In New York, the Hua Qiao Daily, which received its financial support from the  Chinese government, was forced to close July 31 after its stories criticized  the handling of the Tian An Men Square demonstrations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Resignation Announced  </P> <P> The Centre Daily News had tried earlier this year to mitigate the damage  brought on by the boycott. In the July 5 issue, owner Chau-chu Fu announced  that he was resigning as chairman of the board and managing editor.  </P> <P> But even then, Chau-chu Fu insisted that he was right. "If Beijing and overseas  protesters had followed my warnings and pleadings, I dare say that there would  not have been the bloody incident in Beijing."  </P> <P> Even the paper's staff had rebelled. After a May editorial supporting the use  of military force against Beijing protesters, half the Centre Daily News New  York staff resigned in protest.  </P> <P> Some Chinese news sources were so incensed by the paper's editorials that they  rebuffed reporters, said Min Chen, former executive editor.  </P> <P> "We are the tail of the dog," Chen said, adding that staff members had little  control over the editorials.  </P> <P> At times, Chen said, the Centre Daily News' local reports written out of  Monterey Park would contradict front-page articles and editorials composed in  New York.  </P></p>

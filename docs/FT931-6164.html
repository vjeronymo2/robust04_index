			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Relations between UK and Iran dip further THE sharp deterioration in diplomatic relations between Iran and Britain, caused mainly by the row over the author Mr Salman Rushdie, is threatening to spill over into the commercial field. The decision by Iran this week to begin charging Pounds 504 for visas for UK businessmen visiting Tehran is posing doubts over future trade missions, while the latest British restrictions on the export of sensitive material may spark further Iranian retaliation. Mr Gholamreza Ansari, the Iranian charge d'affaires, was called to the Foreign Office yesterday to be told that the Department of Trade and Industry would not approve licences for items on international lists of banned military or atomic energy equipment. Iran has strenuously denied accusations that it is seeking to build nuclear weapons, but admits it would like to acquire nuclear technology for civil purposes. It also claims its military re-equipment is much smaller than other countries in the region. The Iranian embassy in London said yesterday the decision to charge Pounds 504 for a visa, as against the Pounds 14 it levied previously, was direct retaliation for a similar rise in charges made by Britain last year. British officials insist however that the Pounds 20 charged for a visa in Tehran is in line with other European countries. The change made by Britain was to calculate the visa charge at the free market rate of exchange, instead of the old official rate. This meant that in terms of Iranian rials the cost went up from R1,200 to R50,000. A central economic reform instigated by President Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani has been to move more of Iran's foreign transactions on to the free market rate of exchange. An Iranian official said the new charge would apply to everyone applying for a visa in London, but there might eventually be exceptions. The decision is causing the London of Chamber of Commerce to reconsider a trade mission to Iran planned for May. Some 15 companies have signed up for the trip with another 25 registered as possible participants. In January, the Energy Industries Council was forced to abandon a similar mission to Iran when approval for visas failed to materialise. UK and Iranian officials say the row over visa charges is distinct from the clash over the death penalty passed by Iran on Mr Salman Rushdie over the publication of his book The Satanic Verses. The British government's decision to give greater publicity to Mr Rushdie's plight has clearly angered the Iranians. In the past fortnight, Ayatollah Ali Sayed Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, has thrown his weight behind the fatwa, or religious ruling, against Mr Rushdie and this was later supported by the Iranian parliament. The issue will be given further prominence when Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, carries out his promise to meet Mr Rushdie. Iran has been an increasingly attractive market for Britain, with exports up by 20 per cent to Dollars 840m (Pounds 577m) in the first nine months of last year. But with Iran falling further behind in paying letters of credit and oil revenues static, ministers in Tehran have warned of a cut of up to 50 per cent in imports for the financial year beginning March 21.</p>

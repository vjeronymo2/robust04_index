			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SBA firmly believes that all possible alternatives should continue to be studied and analyzed to determine the most effective means by which a true simplification of the numerical size standards, related size standard definitional provisions, and the size determination process can be achieved. After this review has been completed, a new proposal to simplify the size standards may be forthcoming with an opportunity for the public to express its views regarding such a proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the interim, however, the SBA continues to believe in the necessity of adjusting the receipts-based size standards to account for the effects of inflation since the Agency's last inflationary adjustment in 1984. This final rule adopts increases to the receipts-based size standards to reflect the effects of inflation. As discussed in the proposed rule, March 12, 1984 was the last time a general inflationary adjustment was applied to the receipts-based size standards. The proposed rule took into account available data through the first quarter of 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an effort to establish receipts-based size standard levels reflective of current market conditions, the SBA, based on the availability of the U.S. Department of Commerce's most recent inflation data, has re-calculated the inflation adjustment percentage to be applied to the receipts-based size standards. Thus, taking into account available data through the fourth quarter of 1993, SBA calculates the inflation adjustment to be 48.2 percent (as opposed to the 45.8 percent adjustment calculated in the proposed rule based on the most current data available at that time, the first quarter of 1993). As in the proposed rule, in determining the rate of inflation, SBA has utilized the U.S. Department of Commerce's published Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Implicit Price Deflator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The methodology used in determining the appropriate inflation adjustment is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Determine the base period used to establish the current size standard; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Determine the GDP deflator at the base period and at the most recent point in time for which the GDP deflator has been published; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Apply the calculated inflation adjustment percentage to the receipts-based size standard of each and every industry, not otherwise prohibited from change by statute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The inflation adjustment calculated in this final rule is based on the last index value used for the 1984 inflation adjustment and the latest available index value. The 1984 adjustment accounted for inflation up to the third quarter of 1982. For purposes of this rule, the third quarter of 1982 is, therefore, the base period for which SBA calculated the amount of inflation that has occurred since the last adjustment. The U.S. Department of Commerce's latest data show index values of 84.3 for the third quarter of 1982 and 124.9 for the fourth quarter of 1993. This change records inflation of 48.2 percent for the time between these two periods. Thus, each and every industry having a receipts-based size standard, not otherwise prohibited from change by statute, first receives an inflationary calculation percentage of 48.2 percent in this final rule. Finally, where necessary, the inflated size standards are rounded to the nearest half million dollar increment. This rounding method produces net increases to most industry size standards that are slightly above or below the calculated inflation rate of 48.2 percent. This methods is selected because it results in an increase to each size standard that is as close as possible to the calculated 48.2 percent inflationary increase, and is consistent with the settled practice of establishing size standards at $0.5 million increments. Past inflationary increases in SBA's receipt-based size standards have similarly been rounded to the nearest $0.5 million increment. See, e.g., 49 FR 5024 (February 9, 1984). The SBA believes that this rounding methodology most closely reflects the calculated inflation increase. The inflation adjustment adopted by this final rule is not intended to and can not be a precise calculation of inflation experienced within each and every industry. This is because inflation will vary from industry to industry, and measures of these cost and price increases are not generally calculated for specific industries, as represented by individual Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code designations. SBA feels that the rounding methodology is, therefore, the most reasonable application of an inflationary adjustment since the inflation measure used for this final rule measures only the general rise of prices in the whole economy over an extended period of time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three industry categories which SBA has revised since the 1984 inflation adjustment are being adjusted differently in this final rule to correctly increase those industries for inflation through 1993. These are the chicken egg production industry, SIC coded 0252; motor vehicles dealers (new and used), SIC code 5511; and the industries of computer services, SIC codes 7371 through 7379. In developing the existing size standards for these industries, SBA used data on industry revenues later than the third quarter of 1982. Thus, the existing standards take into account the effects of inflation beyond the third quarter of 1982. To avoid double-counting for the effects of inflation on these size standards, the size standards will be adjusted for inflation occurring from the year of the industry data (the base period) to the fourth quarter of 1993. The data bases the SBA relied upon to establish the size standards for these three categories reflect revenues generated during an entire calendar year. Accordingly, the average price deflator for the applicable calendar year is used as the base period's deflator value for purposes of this inflation calculation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Foo Choy Peng] </F>   [Text] In an apparent bid to support the yuan's eventual  free convertibility, China is to keep out potential foreign  investors who cannot balance their own supply and demand of  foreign currencies.    Under provisional regulations scheduled for release in the  third quarter of the year, Beijing will demand that  foreign-funded companies show proof that they can meet their  foreign currency expenses before setting up ventures on the  mainland.    If they cannot do so, their applications will be turned down  unless they receive approval from the State Administration of  Exchange Control (SAEC) to gain access to swap centres, where  foreign companies trade hard currency when it is available.    SAEC approval will be given only to foreign companies  engaged  in sectors actively promoted by the country.    At present, when a foreign investor puts in an application  to  the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation to set up  a factory or office in China, he submits a feasibility study,  which includes a report on the inflow and outflow of foreign  currencies.    Although the law also requires him to balance his hard  currency, it is not rigorously enforced.    While some foreign investors cannot balance the foreign  currency demand and supply, they are still allowed to set up in  China and may subsequently turn to the swap centres for hard  currency to meet any shortfall.    "The new regulations mean that China, as a fundamental  point,  does not want to keep bailing out foreign-funded enterprises.  It wants them to be self-sufficient in foreign currency," said  William Chan, a Price Waterhouse partner.    He said China had a trade deficit and would not want foreign  enterprises to further drain the country's foreign exchange  reserves, estimated at about U.S.$50 billion.    Last year, the trade deficit was about $12 billion.    "What they are going to tell the foreign investors is this:  we're going to look closely at your feasibility study to make  sure you can meet your own foreign currency needs," said Mr Chan.    China last year contracted investments of about $110  billion,  equivalent to the amount for the past 14 years.    "Given the record levels of investments in the last two  years, China is more confident about the inflow and feels it can  afford to be stricter," said Tsang Shu-ki, senior lecturer at  Hong Kong Baptist College's department of economics.    He added that China's economic supremo, Zhu Rongji, had said  that the country would need to build up at least $100 billion in  foreign reserves before it made the yuan fully convertible.    The new regulation, by requiring foreign enterprises to meet  their own demand and supply of hard currencies, will ensure that  there is no drain on foreign reserves.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON INSIGHT  </P> <P> SEEKING POLITICAL ADVANTAGE: Some liberal Democrats and abortion-rights  activists are gearing up for a major effort to challenge Judge David H.  Souter's nomination to the Supreme Court, but their leaders concede they will  be hard-pressed to block the appointment. Instead, they will try to create an  issue for state election campaigns.  </P> <P> While Souter has kept his personal opinions to himself, many abortion-rights  advocates assume that the New Hampshire judge's conservatism will mean trouble  for them, and plan a vigorous fight against his nomination, if only to build  political capital for campaigns for state offices and congressional seats.  </P> <P> "We want to hold him up as an example of what can happen if we're not diligent  on Election Day," one key strategist says. One potential target: the North  Carolina U.S. Senate race, pitting Republican incumbent Jesse Helms against  Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt.  </P> <P> California's Sen. Alan Cranston, for one, believes his fellow Democrats are on  the right track. "Wherever there is a reasonably close Senate race in which a  vote for Souter was cast (by the Republican incumbent), it will give an  advantage to Democrats," Cranston says.  </P> <P> BUDGET BLUES: White House budget strategists are becoming increasingly worried  that President Bush will have to order sharp cuts in federal spending, as  required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, on Oct. 1. Such a move  could eventually spark a political firestorm.  </P> <P> Despite Bush's veiled threat to keep Congress in session through late summer to  pursue efforts to reach agreement on the federal budget, Democrats showed  little sign of being able to agree among themselves on a counter offer to the  White House's opening gambit late last week -- proposals to increase taxes on  alcoholic beverages and to limit deductions on federal tax returns for state  and local taxes paid.  </P> <P> Instead, lawmakers proposed to convene budget negotiators for a few sessions  during the August congressional recess, but House Majority Leader Richard A.  Gephardt (D-Mo.) has privately expressed fear that a compromise might not be  reached before October -- too late to avoid mandatory spending cuts.  </P> <P> "The whole thing isn't going well," one budget-watcher says. "What we need here  is a crisis -- and we may not get one until it's too late."  </P> <P> MORE THAN ROUTINE: Let's Make a Deal may be the theme at the State Department  on Aug. 9 and 10, when Secretary of State James A. Baker III has his first  formal meeting with Israel's new foreign minister, David Levy.  </P> <P> Although the session is billed as a get-acquainted meeting, U.S. officials say  it is of more than routine significance. Levy, with an important domestic  political base of his own, may hold the key to jump-starting the stalled Middle  East peace process.  </P> <P> By U.S. standards, Levy is hardly a peacenik when it comes to policy toward the  Arab states, but at home he is regarded as a man who, like Baker, is willing to  compromise.  </P></p>

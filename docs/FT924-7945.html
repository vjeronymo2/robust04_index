			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Student numbers to rise by 220,000 - Education MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday an-nounced a Pounds 523m increase in government spending on education. A central feature of this funding is to increase the number of students in further education by 222,000 during the next three years. This 25 per cent rise in student numbers is intended to produce more people with technical skills in order that Britain can compete effectively in the world economy. Mr Patten said: 'Spending on education means investment in human capital. That is a vital part of the programme which the chancellor of the exchequer has announced today. 'In the toughest public expenditure round for many years the government has continued to make education a priority. Spending in 1993-94 will be Pounds 9,523m, Pounds 523m or some 6 per cent higher than equivalent expenditure in 1992-93. Spending in 1994-95 and 1995-96 will total Pounds 10,115m and Pounds 10,497m. 'Within the extra money available, we have given a special new emphasis to further education. This will be a large step towards achievement of our National Education and Training Targets. It will help to provide many more people qualified with the technical skills industry urgently needs, and should lift us towards the top of the international league table in staying-on rates for 16-19 year-olds within the next three years. 'We shall continue to raise standards by providing the funds to sustain the increasing number of grant-maintained schools. Capital spending on grant-maintained schools will top Pounds 500m over the next three years, and overall capital spending on schools should be maintained in real terms at least at this year's level, building on last year's 15 per cent increase in the programme.' 'Funding over the next three years will provide for an increase of 104,000 or 13 per cent in higher education student numbers.' He added: 'The government has given high priority to the launch of the new further education sector so as to build up the supply of those with technical and other skills. 'There are currently 342 grant-maintained schools (in England and Wales) open or approved. That number is projected to rise to some 500 by next April. The government's spending plans provide for the number of GM schools to grow to 1,500 in April 1994. The great bulk of recurrent funding for GM schools is found from within the totals for local authority expenditure. Central government expenditure on recurrent and capital grants to GM schools is planned to rise substantially over the next three years as the number of GM schools grows. 'Total central government expenditure on GM schools is planned to total Pounds 61m in 1992-93 and Pounds 157m, Pounds 294m and Pounds 446m in 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96. Capital expenditure alone will total Pounds 501m over the next three years. The funding plans include provision for the running costs of the proposed Funding Agency for Schools. 'From 1 April 1993, further education and sixth form colleges will be funded direct by the new Further Education Funding Council, set up under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. The plans provide for the launch of the newly independent sector. Total recurrent spending is planned at Pounds 2,549m, Pounds 2,734m and Pounds 2,943m in 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96. That increase in funding will allow for an assumed 25 per cent increase in student numbers between 1992-93 and 1995-96.' The number of students on full-time and sandwich courses in higher education has expanded faster than the rapid rate of growth envisaged in the government's Higher Education White Paper of May 1991, on which the government's previous expenditure plans were based. 'The government has provided substantial additional funding for further education to enable the country's needs for skills to be met. Given the need to strike a balance with the rate of expansion of further education, the government envisages a period of consolidation in higher education. The figures underlying the expenditure plans announced today accordingly assume that the proportion of young people entering higher education will remain broadly steady in the next three years, and increase to the level of one in three at the end of the decade, which has long been assumed. Total central government provision for capital expenditure on grant-maintained and LEA-maintained schools (in England and Wales) is Pounds 598m, Pounds 613m and Pounds 624m in 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96.</p>

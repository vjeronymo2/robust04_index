			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities steady in confident session THE London stock market celebrated Christmas Eve with a fresh display of confidence which melted away only as traders effectively abandoned the half-day trading session at mid-morning. Early dealings saw the FT-SE Index rise 13.2 to the day's high of 2,840.6, but the initial share gains disappeared very quickly as the Christmas spirit spread through the City of London. The final reading on the FT-SE Index, taken at 12.30pm, showed a net gain of 0.1 points at 2,827.5. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, however, maintained its early firmness to finish 6.3 points ahead at 2,848.9. The broadly ranging Mid 250 Index provided a strong lead to the stock market last week, indicating the refocusing of institutional portfolios on the second tier stocks. A more accurate picture came from the total of a mere 173.6m shares traded through the Seaq electronic network; few prices were genuinely tested, since marketmakers had no wish to take on positions over the extended holiday break. But trading in non-Footsie stocks was significantly higher than in the blue chip Footsie-listed issues. The unexpected surge in share prices since the beginning of the month kept securities analysts on the alert, however. Profits downgrades in the aerospace and pharmaceutical sectors depressed several of the market's leading names, and underlined the switch from defensive blue chips into cyclical sectors likely to lead the way towards the revival in the economy, on which the stock market is pinning its faith. In derivatives markets, the March future contract on the FT-SE Index maintained the strong premium over the underlying blue chips which has been driving equities ahead, but saw very little business. The Footsie contract had only 733 contracts traded, effectively a record low volume figure. At the best of the session, March touched 2,884, but soon settled back to 2,866 to show a final premium of 39 against cash; the fair value premium, allowing for dividend and financing flows, stood at an estimated 19 points. In traded options, volume more than halved to 6,373 contracts. Business in the Footsie fell to 2,482 lots, while Fisons headed the individual stocks list with 806 contracts traded.</p>

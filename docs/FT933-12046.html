			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / World Trade News: China planners put phones before roads - The implications of Beijing's decision to make telecoms a development priority / Foreign Investment BY THE year 2000, the Chinese government wants to install 75m phone lines in the country - equivalent to three times the British Telecommunications network and quadrupling current capacity. If it did so at the rate of 15m lines a year - this year about 5m lines will be installed - that would constitute annual demand for equipment equivalent to one and half times that of the US. Mr Jim Long, president of the Asian subsidiary of Northern Telecom (Nortel), the Canadian supplier, describes the implications as 'mind-boggling in terms of opportunities for telecommunications companies'. He says they only became apparent to him at a recent dinner to celebrate a new contract with Hebei province. The governor noted in his speech that the 'old wisdom' that China's provinces would get rich first by building roads, then putting in telephones, no longer applied. Now, he said, the reverse was true. The extensive memorandum of understanding which Nortel signed last month with China's State Planning Commission is a recognition that any supplier wanting a secure, long-term foothold needs to have local production facilities. A factory in China can take advantage of lower labour costs, foreign currency savings, and design and engineering expertise close at hand. Another attraction for local manufacturers is that imports of telephone equipment face a 25 per cent duty. The duty is waived only if the importer has access to financing, but financing becomes more difficult as volumes increase. Nortel already supplies 20 per cent of the Chinese PBX market from a venture known as Tong-Guang Nortel. It expects another joint venture to be turning out equipment for data transmission within the next 12 months. Its latest agreement is designed to extend the Toronto-based company's presence to switching equipment and large circuits, as well as a research centre for advanced telecommunications technology. The first fruits are expected to be a joint venture to produce Nortel's flagship DMS-100 digital switching system. The company declines to identify its partners, but it says that a factory, with an initial capacity of 2m lines a year, is nearing completion in Guangdong province. Plans are already being drawn up to expand capacity - possibly at a different site - to 4m lines. Profit is at the moment a secondary consideration in Nortel's drive to secure a hold in China. But Mr Long expects that earnings will have climbed by 156 per cent a year between 1990 and the end of 1993, compared with a 35 per cent rise in revenues. 'While (China) is still not as profitable as mature markets, it is nevertheless beginning to bring some return to Northern Telecom,' he says. 'We think it will continue that way to a point where eventually earnings there will be more consistent with other major markets.' The market for switches is dominated by Alcatel, the French supplier, with an estimated 40 per cent share. NEC of Japan and Siemens of Germany also supply from local factories. Ericsson and Fujitsu have carved out businesses of some size, and smaller operators, such as the telecommunications arm of Philips, the Netherlands electronics group, are also making inroads. The two leading North American suppliers, Nortel and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US operator, hope to catch up the European leaders. In March AT&amp;T signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese which one company executive said could be worth 'billions of dollars' in orders for everything from fax machines to advanced transmission equipment. Mr Long believes that the North Americans owe their advance partly to a growing Chinese demand for features such as intelligent networks, adding that 'the market is definitely moving our way in terms of buying criteria'. For their part, the European suppliers can point to contracts signed and joint ventures launched. Alcatel, believed to be the largest supplier to the Chinese market, earlier this year won contracts worth Dollars 400m (Pounds 267m) for transmission and exchange equipment to be supplied through two joint ventures. China is now Ericsson's fifth largest market. In the first quarter of this year it accounted for more than 7 per cent of sales - up from 3 per cent last year, when it was the company's ninth largest market. Three months ago, Ericsson signed its largest ever contract in China - a Dollars 300m deal to provide switching and transmission equipment for China's Guangdong Post and Telecommunications Bureau. Last month it added Dollars 60m in business from the province for central office switching equipment. It has other contracts to supply equipment to Beijing, Tianjin, Guangxi and Hebei. Philips, the Netherlands electronics group which has a growing telecommunications business, has three assembly plants in China, operated with local partners. China is the division's second largest market after Germany.</p>

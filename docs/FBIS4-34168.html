			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Highlights" of Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu's remarks </F> during one-hour meeting with reporter Emilio Cazala; place and  date not given]    [Excerpts] We have always favored the concentric circles  policy: a region, the continent, and the rest of the world. In  Uruguay, we have for many years supported a midpoint policy,  that is, agreement with our two large neighbors -- with the  active participation of Bolivia and Paraguay -- to transform the  River Plate Basin into a geopolitical structure, allowing  Uruguay to assume its role as the River Plate Basin's export  gate.    Uruguay has been described as a "hinge," a country in the  lower abdomen of South America that may be the most effective  renderer of services and may demonstrate competitive advantages  over its huge neighbors -- Brazil and Argentina.    Within the integration drive, Argentina has bilateral and  quadrilateral relations. Bilaterally, we have our economic  agreements, our political agreements on border cooperation, our  joint River Plate statute, the common River Plate seashore since  1974, our Uruguay River with its dams and bridges that involve  every aspect of integration -- physical, transportation, and  electric power integration.    This is complemented by trade integration. In our opinion,  integration involves bilateral agreements, basically through  Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. This shows that both  Uruguay and Argentina must gradually meet the other partners  within a strategy that will allow us to increase understanding  rather than misunderstanding, increase complementation rather  than disagreement, and increase competitiveness rather than  exclusion from participation in our joint efforts. This  integration involves complementation not subordination. This is  the idea we are promoting.    With this idea of bilateral projects, complemented by  quadrilateral projects and a hemispheric projection, we began to  increase the dynamics of our relationship in issues involving  common interests, especially the River Plate. Uruguay has  specifically established as a priority the dredging of the  Martin Garcia Channel. Why? Because it involves active  participation in a common river, because it increases the  dynamics of rendering services in the River Plate Basin area,  and because it confirms the legal obligations of the five  countries that make up the Waterway Treaty. This treaty has yet  to be implemented. It has been partially approved in Argentina  and Brazil. Private and public sectors are already developing a  number of initiatives and projects, clearly showing the  implementation of the enterprise.    Bearing in mind the waterway project, we consider the Martin  Garcia Channel and the reactivation of Nueva Palmira, the  waterway terminal, to be a priority.    The waterway project is not just of interest to Uruguay. It  is important and we wanted to mention it the way we explained it  to Argentina. Not just Uruguay, or Nueva Palmira, or navigation  linked to Uruguay's interests will benefit. The idea is a better  rendering of services in the field of river transportation,  involving maintenance costs, transportation costs, and enhanced  navigation security.    It involves a more effective rendering of services that will  allow increased demand, both in quantity and in quality. This  point was raised by Uruguay. Therefore, Uruguay considers the  Martin Garcia issue a priority in its geopolitical stance. We  experienced problems, comings and goings, and tense negotiations  for many months prior to the exchange of notes in June 1993 and  now the signing of notes, calling the bid and the filing of  specifications for the Martin Garcia channel dredging and the  commencement of this project by the end of the year.    We also have the management of common resources, like the  common fishing zones and everything pertaining to fishing policy  with Argentina. Uruguay is experiencing a special situation;  through a fishing agreement that was signed a few days ago it is  now forbidden to catch medium-size hake in this zone so as not  to plunder this resource which migrates south and which has been  exploited by Argentina and by the EU. All this has been raised  by Uruguay, with concern, firmly, but respectfully because these  are common resources that must be managed. We have raised these  issues at the United Nations, the EU, and at the bilateral level.    We have the river transportation system, in which we must  define how the flag system will operate in the bilateral area;  we also have the passenger transportation system, which is  important for Uruguay, for which we sought and found the  solution that was signed with Argentina on 3 June. We have a  river transportation system in which a long-standing  disagreement between two ways of thinking is going to be  resolved.    This issue is also linked to the Uruguay River's  navigability. This is another aspect of our border cooperation  policy, and we must remember that our borders with Argentina  involve rivers. The situation is not like that with Brazil, with  which we do not share any navigable rivers, and this gives rise  to other dynamics and a different situation. With Argentina, we  share a river that unites us, supplies us with resources, and  allows us to cooperate in the fields of transportation of  merchandise and passengers; tourism, which today represents  Uruguay's main source of foreign exchange; and energy production.    Salto Grande is one of the most important hydroelectric  power  plants in the region. It involves production, sale,  coordination, and cooperation in the energy field between the  two countries. The river will consolidate our cooperation and  the supply of joint services. The Uruguay River and the Salto  Grande project involve water and energy. Navigability of the  Uruguay River is important because it serves as an outlet for  distant export centers in Argentina and in Uruguay. Nueva  Palmira is the last stop along the Paraguay-Parana waterway, a  project that involves five nations. Dredging the Martin Garcia  Channel is a contribution to navigation safety and  modernization. Another joint effort involves the river  transportation of passengers using a clear flagging system.  Fishing is a very important resource for the country. The  preservation of the environment, particularly the ocean front,  concerns the entire world, not just our two countries. These  projects involve joint efforts by both countries and the search  for common elements for cooperation. These common aspects are  characteristics of a more interdependent and global world where  nationalities consolidate and project themselves into  integration and cooperation projects.    The old system of isolating nationalism is being replaced by  a dynamic nationalism involving cooperation and coordination.  The true expression of nationalism for our peoples will be  prosperity.    This prosperity should not be an expression of egoism, it  should be an expression of coordination and reciprocal  concessions for our mutual benefit.    This is the model of our relations with Argentina. We talk  about the issue at all forums when we refer to subregional or  regional aspects. But we also have a hemispheric projection.    Our geopolitical relations involve Brazil, Argentina,  Paraguay, and Chile. It is a trade integration plan that assumes  integration and openness are compatible. We suggest an  administrated openness in which Mercosur acts as the cornerstone  of production and integration. When we ask Argentina, Brazil,  and Paraguay to consolidate this effort, to respect our  obligations, and to advance, it is because we believe in the  process. It is precisely through credibility that we will  strengthen our internal relations.    We know integration in general is full of unfulfilled goals,  but we do not want this. We are sometimes confronted with  problems that place national interests against group interests.  In this case it is more important to stress the national  interest even though the group will have difficulties, because  this is the only way to maintain credibility and respectability.    Consistency, openness, and professional attitudes are the  three pillars of our foreign policies. We project them in our  bilateral relations with Argentina and we project them in our  multilateral relations through Mercosur. [passage omitted]    We also project ourselves politically into our hemisphere,  in  a world with a single world power. We have dynamic relations  with the United States. We want to integrate gradually with them  economically, through Mercosur. But we also want the United  States to become integrated into a more balanced concept of  international law, particularly in aspects that are important to  us, like the new concept of hemispheric security. Uruguay and  Argentina have expressed their desire that nonintervention, self  determination, and peaceful solutions to controversies should  become unchangeable principles. We believe these principles  should be established tenets, not because we are conservatives  but because they represent the essence of respect for countries'  identity and a valuable tool in handling political relations  between stronger and weaker nations.    Uruguay, we have always said, is geographically, militarily,  and economically a lot smaller than Argentina or Brazil. But the  principle of the sovereign equality of nations makes us as  strong as any other nation at the time of defending those  principles. We want to see great caution regarding hemispheric  security so as to avoid being the instrument of other country's  policies. This is very important because it gives us credibility  and respectability. We handle these issues with clarity and  frankness and the Argentine Government understands and accepts  our position.    All these elements show Uruguay is integrating its foreign  policy and has privileged bilateral relations with Argentina,  Brazil and Paraguay through Mercosur. Uruguay is also  integrating its policies with the Southern Cone, and naturally  with Chile.    There has been a qualitative change in our relations with  Argentina over the past few months. Difficulties are being  gradually solved with a lot of flexibility. This quality has its  maximum expression in the Argentine president and the Argentine  Foreign Ministry. They have a vision like that of former  Argentine President Juan Domingo Peron when we signed the Rio de  La Plata Borders Treaty which, beyond any doubt, contributed  greatly to the juridical security of our relations. It created  the idea that we should share a resource that belongs to both  countries, setting aside the idea that the stronger party is  always right. [passage omitted]    Integration today is the projection of the idea and the  thought that our participation is not done in detriment of our  identity, but precisely to strengthen it. The fact that we are  working on integration projects--including some project that  might have an importance beyond our borders--does not mean we  are losing our Uruguayan nationalism. Our origin, and the  effects of our culture, family, education -- and even the  strategic projection of our future -- are reflected in our  reality.    Europe, the continent that bestowed upon us a series of  positive cultural elements and even religious traditions, is  very distant when we begin to discuss trade interests.    When we defended Uruguayan interests during the GATT round  we  realized that European interests, not solidarity with Latin  America, always prevailed.    That is their legitimate right and their legitimate  position.  When we defend our positions we must place limits on our  romantic ideas and emotional reactions. This is why we view the  region and our relations with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and  Bolivia as our great priority. We are a region, a subregion,  with the same origin, feelings, and interests. These three  elements unite us. Regrettably, the intensity of these feelings  is sometimes used by groups that seek privileges. These elements  must by administered by governments, the people, and by those  interests. The short-term success of those interests usually  means the defeat of medium-term state positions and strategies.</p>

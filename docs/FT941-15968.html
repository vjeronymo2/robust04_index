			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Spirit of glasnost loses its charm / A look at the implications of the CSA wrangle The Czech Republic appears to be losing some of its enthusiasm for foreign investors. After the recent bitter dispute between the Czech government and Volkswagen over cuts in VW's investment for its Skoda joint venture, Prague is now embroiled in a growing row with Air France, the French flag carrier, which acquired a minority stake in the former Czechoslovak national airline CSA two years ago. When the partnership was formed in June 1992 with Air France and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) taking a stake of nearly 40 per cent in CSA, it was part of the Czech government's strategy of encouraging foreign investment to improve the competitive position of its national airline. This was at a time when other east European countries were seeking western partners and equipment for their flag carriers. Air France and the Caisse des Depots, the French state financial institution, paid Dollars 30m for almost 20 per cent of CSA's share capital with Air France providing training and other services to the Czech airline. The EBRD paid Dollars 30m for a similar stake in CSA, while the Czech state retained 49 per cent and the rest went to small shareholders. For CSA, the partnership was to provide an opening to new western markets as well as western expertise to modernise the airline. For Air France, the investment was part of its efforts to expand its international alliances, strengthen its global network and provide it with a platform for expansion in what was then seen as a fast growing east European air transport market. However, the relationship between CSA and Air France has turned sour as the Czech airline has plunged deeper into the red, with expected losses of Kcs1.2bn (Dollars 41m) for 1993, while Air France is facing financial and labour problems at home. The two sides are locked in bitter negotiations as the Czech government complained it had expected better and more collaboration from Air France. Last Saturday, it wrote a letter to the French airline outlining what it considered were the Czech carrier's problems and suggested that it would be best for Air France to sell back its share. Air France insisted it did not want to withdraw from CSA which it regards as a long-term investment. Instead, Air France and the EBRD are seeking a capital injection of about Kcs746m from the Czech government for what they argue was an overvaluation of the airline during the 1992 deal. This followed an independent audit by consultants Ernst and Young called for by Mr Bernard Attali, the former chairman of Air France who resigned last year when he failed to secure the backing of the French government for a sweeping restructuring programme for the French carrier. In return for injecting fresh money into the airline, the Czech government has been seeking to increase its control of CSA. But the government's stance appears to point to a broader change of mood about the role of foreign investors in large Czech companies. CSA confirmed this week that the government wanted to reduce the power of foreign shareholders on CSA's management board, by forcing changes in the powers of the general assembly and of the airline's board of directors. But these changes, which would give the Czech government a majority voice on all important decisions in the company, are being resisted by Air France. The row has led to the sacking of Mr Jiri Fiker as CSA president, and the resignation of Mr Georges Vejdovsky, one of the Air France representatives on the CSA board. Air France, which is still hoping to reach a compromise solution with the Czech government, agreed to Mr Vejdovsky's resignation as a conciliatory gesture. It has agreed in principle to a Czech proposal to reduce the number of representatives on the airline's board from 15 to 10 members. But it has insisted on retaining a blocking vote on important board decisions. The Czech government holds a majority of seats on the board but requires the vote of its foreign partners on all important issues. CSA's managers have been left in the dark as to the government's long-term intentions. Although the government claims it has two other airlines and financial institutions lined up in the wings to take over from Air France, one CSA official said: 'We were very surprised by the government's proposals. I don't know if Mr Strasky (the transport minister) knows of any managers who can turn the company around. We are also looking for some answers.' CSA's financial problems are the result of a combination of factors including an ageing fleet, costly leases on new Airbus aircraft contracted before 1992, a surplus of employees and unprofitable routes. This comes with increasingly tough international competition. The Czech government has complained of unfair competition by western European airlines. Last week, it decided unilaterally to reduce by a third the number of flights by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines between Prague and Amsterdam provoking protests from the Dutch government and KLM. The plight of CSA has raised the question whether the Czech Republic and other east European countries need their own flag carriers. One alternative is to set up in eastern Europe an airline partnership combining several national carriers similar to the Scandinavian Airlines System group.</p>

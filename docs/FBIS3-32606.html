			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Newspaper of the Airwaves" newscast] </F>   [Text] Congressman Victor Joy Way, first vice president of  the Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD], termed as correct the  CCD's decision in the dispute over jurisdiction and the  elimination of the decisive vote measure presented by  Congressman Julio Chu Meriz. Joy Way justified this decision as  protecting the lives of judges who are entrusted with special  cases like La Cantuta and will apply to other future cases.  Here is what Congressman Victor Joy Way said:    [Begin recording] [Joy Way ] There are obvious factors such  as threatening situations. This is not a matter of  jurisdiction. You know perfectly well that we as congressmen  have the obligation to somehow solve this problem. Definitely,  any ruling, any sentence by a justice is definitely influenced  by a threatening situation.    [Unidentified reporter] Do you think this decision will  prolong the outcome of the case?    [Joy Way] I believe, as far as I understand, that the  investigations being conducted under military jurisdiction have  made substantial progress. We hope that we will have a sentence  as soon as possible. [end recording]    Congressman Victor Joy Way also said President Alberto  Fujimori has the power to assess the law. Nevertheless, he said  that in this case the legislative branch acted within its rights  to perfect certain procedures that are under scrutiny.    In another turn of events, Joy Way referred to the hike in  passport prices, said that this was [word indistinct] taking  into consideration market prices for their manufacture, as  apparently these had been previously subsidized.</p>

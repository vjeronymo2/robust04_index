			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar's call of duty Trafalgar House's decision to tap shareholders for up to Pounds 400m more is a measure of the extent to which it was shaken to its very foundations in the wake of the Davy affair. It hardly reflects well on the new management to have announced yet more provisions so soon after the Pounds 100m charge unveiled in February. The cynical view is that some of the bad news was held back then for fear of breaching banking covenants. The more charitable interpretation is that it has simply taken the new management this long to uncover the size of the problem. One might expect the company's fortunes to recover, albeit slowly, from now on. But the leeway afforded by the new injection of capital is limited. As this year's profits expectations have been lowered yet again, the base for earnings and dividend growth looks disconcertingly small. Also, convertible preference shares are an expensive form of finance. Trafalgar will have to make the money sweat to produce a decent return. That may not matter to Hongkong Land, which can take a long term view. It cannot afford, however, to ignore other investors. For the time being, these have little choice but to go along with its plan. They may even find the preference shares attractive because they offer a secure yield as well as an equity link. Switching prospects probably fuelled yesterday's 12 per cent fall in Trafalgar's shares. But for the recovery plan to work, preference holders must eventually exercise their conversion rights. That will require the re-establishment of a progressive dividend. Hongkong Land must hope that the institutions' patience will last.</p>

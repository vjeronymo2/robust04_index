The NRC has previously allowed a few licensees to implement alternate steam generator repair criteria for this particular degradation mechanism on an operating cycle specific basis. This generic letter does not restrict the approval of such repair criteria to a cycle specific basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current plant technical specifications require that flawed tubes be removed from service by plugging or repaired by sleeving, if the depths of the flaws exceed the repair limit, typically 40 percent through-wall. This generic letter provides guidance on the implementation of an alternate repair criterion to be applied to ODSCC at TSP locations. This criterion does not set limits on the depth of the cracks to ensure tube integrity margins; instead, it relies on correlating the eddy current voltage amplitude from a bobbin coil probe with the more specific measurement of burst pressure and leak rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This generic letter is intended to provide relief while maintaining an acceptable level of safety for licensees having steam generators experiencing this particular degradation mechanism while the staff pursues a longer term resolution to the issue of steam generator degradation through the development of a steam generator rule. Although this generic letter allows licensees to pursue various options regarding the implementation of the voltage-based criteria (e.g., tube support place deflection analyses, probability of detection versus voltage dependence), licensees should recognize that pursuing such options could have significant scheduler implications since the NRC staff would be required to review and approve the associated information and analyses. Regarding the correlations and supporting data utilized to implement the generic letter guidance, the staff will review this information on an as-required basis to enable updated correlations and new data to be used for implementation of the generic letter guidance. The NRC staff will make publicly available an updated list of approved correlations and models on a periodic basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The thin-walled tubing of the steam generator constitutes more than half of the reactor coolant pressure boundary (RCPB). Maintenance of the structural and leakage integrity of the RCPB is a requirement under Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 50 (10 CFR 50), Appendix A. Specific requirements governing the maintenance of steam generator tube integrity are contained in the plant technical specifications and Section XI of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME Code). These include requirements for periodic inservice inspection of the tubing, flaw acceptance criteria (i.e., repair limits for plugging or sleeving), and primary-to-secondary leakage limits. These requirements coupled with the broad scope of plant operational and maintenance programs, have formed the basis for assuring adequate steam generator tube integrity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flaw acceptance criteria, termed plugging/repair limits, are specified in the plant technical specifications. The purpose of the technical specification repair limits is to ensure that tubes accepted for continued service will retain adequate structural and leakage integrity during normal operating, transient, and postulated accident conditions, consistent with General Design Criteria (GDC) 14, 15, 30, 31, and 32 of 10 CFR part 50, appendix A. Structural integrity refers to maintaining adequate margins against gross failure, rupture, and collapse of the steam generator tubing. Leakage integrity refers to limiting primary-to-secondary leakage to within acceptable limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The traditional strategy for accomplishing the objectives of the General Design Criteria related to steam generator tube integrity has been to establish a minimum wall thickness requirement in accordance with the structural criteria of Regulatory Guide 1.121, ``Bases for Plugging Degraded PWR Steam Generator Tubes.'' Development of minimum wall thickness requirements to satisfy Regulatory Guide 1.121 was governed by analyses for uniform thinning of the tube wall in the axial and circumferential directions. The assumption of uniform thinning conservatively bonds the degrading effects of all flaw types occurring in the field, and is the basis of the standard 40 percent depth-based plugging limit incorporated into the technical specifications. However, the 40 percent repair limit is conservative for highly localized flaws such as pits and short cracks. In particular, the 40 percent depth-based repair limit is conservative for outside diameter stress corrosion cracking (ODSCC) that occurs at the tube support plates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new voltage-based repair limit does not incorporate a minimum wall thickness requirement. The voltage-based repair limit allows the possibility that tubes with up to 100 percent through-wall cracks, which may develop between successive steam generator inspections, can remain in service, subject to certain restrictions. These restrictions ensure structural integrity and leakage limits consistent with the applicable GDC of 10 CFR part 50 appendix A and the limits of 10 CFR Part 100. Although the voltage-based repair limit ensures adequate structural integrity and leakage limits, the NRC staff recognizes that overall margins have been reduced when compared to the margins associated with the existing 40% depth-based repair limit. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Because of the increased likelihood of through-wall cracks developing in service, the staff has included provisions for augmented steam generator inspections and more restrictive operational tube leakage limits in the generic letter guidance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> During development of the proposed generic letter, three individual NRC staff members expressed technical concerns (including one member filing a differing professional opinion) with the NRC positions described in the generic letter. The technical concerns and differing professional opinion are publicly available in the Public Document Rooms. The NRC will consider public comments from interested parties on the technical concerns as they relate to the positions proposed in the draft generic letter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

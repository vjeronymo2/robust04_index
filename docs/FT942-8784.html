			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US optimistic over Japan trade talks A senior US official yesterday said the US is 'in a listening mode' and optimistic about the exploratory trade talks due to begin today in Washington with a Japanese negotiating team, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. 'Obviously you don't send your officials all this way if there is not something to be said,' the US official said. While not knowing what to expect from the Japanese, the US negotiators expect to build on progress achieved in bilateral talks in Marakesh when the Uruguay Round was signed. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and Vice President Al Gore then met at length with Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's new prime minister. The senior US official said progress was made on macroeconomic issues and US demands for objective indicators' to measure progress in sectoral market openings. However, there was stalemate on the US demand to set goals in the sectors for which the Japanese promise to improve access. Despite the failure in the overall 'framework talks,' Japan has succumbed to US demands in a number of sectors this year, including apples, cellular telephones, chemicals, and copper. 'We've had more agreements with the Japanese this year than in any year in our history,' the senior official said.</p>

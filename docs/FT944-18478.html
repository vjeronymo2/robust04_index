			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Trials to test the ground for information superhighways The French government is to launch trial communications and computer services in selected towns to determine whether to proceed with ambitious proposals to develop a national information superhighway linking business and households. The move reflects a growing debate within the government and France Telecom, the state telecommunications operator, about the technology and investments required. The debate has been fuelled by a report commissioned by the government from Mr Gerard Thery, former managing director of France Telecom. He favours a substantial investment over the next 15 years to connect 5m households and businesses to information networks by the the year 2000. The cost of the infrastructure, including the extension of fibre optic cables to households and businesses, is estimated at about FFr10bn (Pounds 1.2bn) each year. The scale of the project, however, worries some industry observers and France Telecom itself, which had debts totalling FFr105bn at the end of last year and would be expected to meet a significant part of the cost. France Telecom also believes the technology is still evolving and that such a large investment in fibre optic networks may be premature. 'Mr Thery's prescriptions are very bold, but potentially risky,' says one Paris analyst. 'The government is tempted by the idea of a grand, populist project, but it is also anxious to have some idea of the potential demand for services.' Behind such concerns lie the experience of the Plan Cable, a government-backed scheme of the early 1980s to develop a nationwide cable network. Despite FFr30bn of state and private investment, cable services remain relatively underdeveloped and operators continue to suffer losses. The aim of the trial services would be to ascertain the level of demand for new services, from scientific and communications databases to interactive entertainment systems.</p>

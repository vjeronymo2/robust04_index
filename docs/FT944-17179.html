			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Arts: Culture shock - Tourism is the unlikely focus of Stephen Dorrell, the new heritage secretary Arts ministers, now called heritage secretaries, fall into two categories - politicians on their way up and politicians on their way down. Only one man actually wanted the job, David Mellor, and he left after six months. History suggests that it is those politicians on their way down who serve the arts better. They enjoy themselves, kick over the traces, go native and end up fighting on behalf of every small dance troupe and community arts centre in the land. Britain's current heritage minister, Stephen Dorrell, who took up the post in July, obviously has his eyes on higher ground. As former financial secretary to the Treasury, and widely believed to have his long-term sights set on No 11 Downing Street, he comes to the department of heritage steeped in Treasury lore. This is doubly bad news for the arts. And in his first public statement on Friday, Dorrell did not disappoint the pessimists. If he is battling the Treasury hard for more money for 1994-95, he certainly gives no indication. Arts administrators, who have been told to expect frozen grants next year, should not anticipate a last-minute miracle. There is no 'Gowrie dowry', the rumoured government promise to the new Arts Council chairman, Lord Gowrie, that he could start his reign propitiously with more subsidy. What the minister may well do is shift around the money in his Pounds 1bn budget between his various responsibilities. And the surprising sector that might gain is tourism. Tourism was scarely mentioned by previous heritage secretaries. The field was consigned to the deputy heritage minister, Iain Sproat. But for some reason Dorrell thinks that tourism (along with broadcasting) is going to be the saviour of the nation's arts and heritage. Perhaps that is why, in his first action as heritage minister, he chose to ignore the invitation to the Edinburgh Festival in favour of the Commonwealth Games in Canada. Someone has drawn his attention to the fact that his rag-bag of interests - arts, heritage, broadcasting, travel, sport - collectively generate an annual turnover of Pounds 50bn. This looks an impressive sum when set against Pounds 1bn in government subsidy. Why not better exploit the Pounds 49bn to boost revenue for the arts and heritage? In practice this means encouraging more foreign tourists to visit Britain's theatres, opera, concerts, and so on, as well as national heritage monuments, thus increasing revenues and saving the taxpayer money. It would be nice, too, says Dorrell, if the British chose to spend their weekends at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival rather than on trips to Paris. This ignores the fact that the UK currently runs a Pounds 3bn tourism deficit, with foreigners put off by the expense of Britain and its unsophisticated tourist industry. It also overlooks the reality that overseas tourists are already happy to visit the West End theatre and heritage attractions like Madame Tussauds and Windsor Castle, which do not receive government subsidy and hardly constitute the cultural highlands. It will take more than the good intentions of Stephen Dorrell to divert them to the Tricycle Theatre, Kilburn, Phoenix Dance in Leeds, the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, or the hundreds of arts organisations throughout the country which are cracking under the strain of lower subsidy, reduced sponsorship and falling audiences. The minister's favourite example of tourism boosting the arts, the Tate Gallery's new satellite museum at St Ives, which almost doubled its target of visitors to over 100,000 in its first year, is a great success story for the seaside resort and for Cornwall, but it can hardly be repeated ad infinitum throughout the country. There is also the problem that if tourists do flock to visit, say, Elgar's birthplace near Worcester, their numbers might destroy the site's appeal. Looking to broadcasting for cultural regeneration is also starry- eyed. Dorrell may shortly loosen controls over media ownership which, along with advances in technology, seem certain to make broadcasting more populist and prey to American-style commercialism. There is probably a market overseas for BBC videos of Shakespeare, and certainly (unions willing) more artistic events should be captured on film for a wider audience. But any gain for the arts in the regions from such developments is not immediately obvious. Stephen Dorrell showed his colours by stressing the role of his department as a 'catalyst', which we all know means long on advice, short on money. The government's 'secret agenda' on culture and the arts is now so obvious that it can hardly be regarded as hidden. John Major confidently proclaimed last month that 'the money raised by the (national) lottery will not replace existing government spending'. Perhaps not. But in the view of the Treasury it will eliminate the need for any extra spending. That is why future grants under the three-year funding programme across the arts and heritage have been frozen, or even reduced. You can understand the Treasury's view. Here are these activities - arts, heritage, sport, the Millennium Fund and charities - which are each likely to receive Pounds 150m, rising to over Pounds 300m, a year extra from the lottery. Surely they do not need rises in their annual grants as well? But they do, if they are to provide any decent performances in the new buildings that will arise from lottery cash. It looks as if Stephen Dorrell is seeking a philosophical justification for freezing, or even reducing slightly, his department's budget. As he says: 'The DNH is not a money fountain'. In view of his rumoured long-term ambitions, his financial credentials would certainly be enhanced if he presided over the stemming of his current department's cash flow: if the department became an enabler rather than a patron. The minister has also revealed himself a populist. He is in favour of widening access to the arts but told the Financial Times that he was dead against those artists (and they do exist) who maintain that it doesn't matter if no-one is interested in their work. Dorrell's view is that if the arts cannot sell themselves to an audience, they should not look to the government for funding. This comes close to saying: 'It is fine to take risks, but only if they come off.' Dorrell is new to the job. When he has had the chance to tour the country, visiting arts centres laying on exciting work in difficult conditions; when he becomes familiar with the high quality performances at leading opera houses, theatres, and concert halls; when he realises that the arts themselves are an important industry and one of the very few in which the UK leads the world, he may show more imagination in his approach. At the moment his only concrete proposals - to reduce the red tape on the building of hotels and to promote Britain more effectively overseas  - are unlikely to raise the spirits of the currently depressed arts community, desperately seeking an inspirational lead.</p>

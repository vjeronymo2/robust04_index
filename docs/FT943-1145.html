			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Moscow fares Bus and subway fares in Moscow nearly doubled under a city order that took effect last Friday. Despite frequent fare rises, public transport has been one of the most affordable services in the Russian capital and is used heavily. But the current increases could bite into the wallets of low-income Muscovites. A monthly transit pass that cost 10,000 roubles, or about Dollars 4, on Thursday now costs 30,000 roubles, or about Dollars 13. One subway ride has gone up from 150 roubles, roughly 6 US cents, to 250 roubles, or 10 US cents, while a bus token has climbed to the same level from 130 roubles.</p>

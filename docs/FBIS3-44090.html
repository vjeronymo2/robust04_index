			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Party's [NP] list of candidates for the  coming election is virtually finalized and will be released  during the party's federal congress next week. Our political  news staff reports that at least one former member of the ANC's  [African National Congress] armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear  of the Nation], is included in the list along with several new  faces to politics. Unlike the ANC, the NP will not draw up a  consolidated national list. Each province will have a list for  the national assembly and for the provincial government.</p>

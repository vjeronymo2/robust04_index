			<p>BFN     [Text] Replying to a question by the Jordanian News Agency  on the signing ceremony of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement in  Cairo today, Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, deputy prime minister and acting  information minister, said the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  recognizes the PLO as the sole, legitimate representative of the  Palestinian people in accordance with the 1974 Rabat Arab summit  conference resolution, which was approved unanimously and upon a  Palestinian request. Hence, he added, the kingdom considers the  signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement today an  independent Palestinian affair. We support the Palestinian  people's rights and stand by their side with all our abilities.  In the meantime, he said, Jordan hopes this agreement will be a  basic step in the fraternal Palestinian people's struggle for  the establishment of their independent state on the land of  Palestine.    He added that the special, distinctive Jordanian-Palestinian  relations in the past, present, and future presume, among other  things, the continuation of the highest possible level of  cooperation and coordination for the good of the two fraternal  peoples and their joint national and pan-Arab interest.</p>

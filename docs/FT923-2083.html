			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Letter: Cause and effect of the recession Sir, I am starting a new business, with my own money. Nothing remarkable about that except that I cannot get anyone to take it. Lloyds, with whom I have banked for 30 years, flatly refuse to let me have a credit card facility because mail order is involved. Midland, where I subsequently opened a business account, cannot provide me with documentation to operate that account. The fulfilment house failed to turn up at the meeting arranged to finalise my arrangements with it and has not been heard of since. The magazine in which I wanted to advertise shows no desire to take the advertisement. A personal introduction from a senior colleague proves insufficient reason for the insurance broker to do anything in response to my calls. When these people announce their no doubt abysmal results they will blame 'the recession'. My recent experience suggests the recession is the effect, incompetence the cause. Colin P Clark, The Clark Trading Company, 17 Southbrook Road, Lee, London SE12 8LH</p>

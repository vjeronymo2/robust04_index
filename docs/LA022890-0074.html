			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CORNELIUS GUNTER, COASTERS TENOR, SLAIN IN LAS VEGAS  </P> <P> Cornelius (Cornell) Gunter, lead tenor for the Coasters during the glory days  of that Los Angeles-based doo-wop rock unit when they recorded such hits as  "Yakety Yak" and "Charlie Brown," was shot to death while traveling through  North Las Vegas, police said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Gunter, who worked regularly in the Nevada city leading an ensemble he called  Cornell Gunter and the Coasters (as opposed to nearly a dozen other Coasters  groups now touring the country), was found slumped over the steering wheel of  his car Monday, Las Vegas Police Officer Darren Flatin said. Flatin said Gunter  was in his 50s, but he did not know the singer's exact age.  </P> <P> Gunter, who began with the Coasters in 1957, two years after the original group  evolved from the L.A.-based Robins, was found about 11 a.m. at a street  intersection with two gunshot wounds in his chest.  </P> <P> "It appears he was shot through the windshield and he was dead on the scene. We  don't have a motive at this time," Police Lt. Gary Rainey said.  </P> <P> Witnesses said that Gunter's car was parked at a North Las Vegas intersection  and a thin black man was standing on the driver's side, talking to him.  </P> <P> "They apparently got into a loud argument," Rainey said. "People heard a couple  of shots. Then the car took off, went about a block, then hit a block wall."  </P> <P> Gunter and the Coasters were scheduled to perform at the Lady Luck Hotel this  weekend, said Janice Mazuroski, assistant director of advertising and public  relations at the hotel.  </P> <P> Gunter replaced tenor Young Jessie with the vocal team that became known for  its comedy and for bringing the expression "Why is everybody always picking on  me?" into the pop parlance of the day. The phrase, sung by bass Will (Dub)  Jones, was from the Coasters' 1959 hit "Charlie Brown."  </P> <P> Their first big hit had come two years earlier with "Searchin'," backed by  another success, "Young Blood."  </P> <P> The Coasters -- who took their name from their West Coast origins -- were  formed when the Robins split into two groups. The original Coasters ensemble  included Billy Guy, Carl Gardner, Leon Hughes and Bobby Nunn. Jessie replaced  Hughes in 1956, and Gunter then subbed for Jessie the following year.  </P> <P> With a flurry of other hits that included "Along Came Jones" and "Poison Ivy"  in 1959, the Coasters were the country's most popular black rock 'n' roll group  at the end of the 1950s.  </P> <P> Among their other hits were "Framed," "Idol With the Golden Head," and  "Shoppin' for Clothes." The group managed substantial album sales but generally  appealed to singles buyers.  </P> <P> Gunter left the group in the early 1960s. The Coasters' last major hit was  "Love Potion Number 9."  </P> <P> With varying personnel, Gunter continued to keep the group in concert through  the 1980s.  </P> <P> Various other Coasters -- some original and some not -- have also headed  separate groups in recent years, all billing themselves as Coasters.  </P> <P> In 1980, another member of one of those groups, Nathaniel (Buster) Wilson, was  murdered in what a Las Vegas jury adjudged was a fraud coverup.  </P> <P> Gunter was a Los Angeles native who had lived in Nevada most recently. In 1987,  he was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.  </P></p>

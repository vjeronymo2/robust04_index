			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Federation Council committee for agrarian policy  has described the situation in the Russian agro-industrial  complex in 1994 as extreme and catastrophic. In its statement  it forecasts a production slump in agricultural enterprises of  all types of ownership in 1994. It suggests that compared to  average annual figures for 1986-90, production will fall by  between 45 and 50 percent. The committee believes that in those  conditions emergency economic measures are needed to support the  agricultural sector.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE VIETNAMESE ON VIETNAM AND AMERICA;  </P> <P> HEARTS OF SORROW VIETNAMESE-AMERICAN LIVES BY JAMES M. FREEMAN (STANFORD  UNIVERSITY PRESS: $29.50; 464 PP.);  </P> <P> FALLEN LEAVES MEMOIRS OF A VIETNAMESE WOMAN FROM 1940 TO 1975 BY NGUYEN THI  THU-LAM WITH EDITH KREISLER AND SANDRA CHRISTENSON (YALE CENTER FOR INT'L.  &amp; AREA STUDIES: $9, PAPER; 224 PP.);  </P> <P> TO BE MADE OVER TALES OF SOCIALIST REEDUCATION IN VIETNAM EDITED AND TRANSLATED  BY HUYNH SANH THONG (YALE CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL AND AREA STUDIES: $12; 255  PP.)  </P> <P> "Hearts of Sorrow" is an oral history of the travails of Vietnamese emigres in  America, told through the words of 14 refugees. The author, an anthropology  professor at San Jose State University, includes as subjects many residents of  Santa Clara County, where one of the largest Vietnamese communities in the  United States is located.  </P> <P> Obviously a sympathetic observer, he devotes much of the opening chapters to  debunking common "misconceptions" about refugees, such as alleged high welfare  dependency, special treatment on the part of government authorities and  extensive gang activities.  </P> <P> The main body of the text comprises five parts in roughly chronological order,  covering narrators' recollections of childhood, war (anti-French resistance and  occupation by the Japanese in World War II, with surprisingly little space  devoted to the U.S. intervention), the aftermath of "liberation," their escapes  from Vietnam and finally the American experience.  </P> <P> In his quest for "ordinary" narrators, the author studiously avoids "leaders,  generals and other famous Vietnamese." He assembles men and women generally  drawn from what middle class existed in Vietnam before the end of the war in  1975. They are young and old, Catholics and Buddhists, Northerners and  Southerners in a variety of occupations, including a former ARVN (South  Vietnamese Army) colonel, a Buddhist nun, a schoolteacher, an automobile  mechanic and others.  </P> <P> Least known, and therefore of greatest interest, are experiences of Southerners  under the repression following "liberation." Also notable are the recollections  of an ethnic Chinese elder, which provide a rich portrait of life under  Communist rule in the North, coping with the bombing of Hanoi, and expulsion  from Vietnam following the war with China. This elderly man's final comments on  American government, lobbyists, division of power among the branches,  patriotism and the proper balance between freedom and social obligations show a  surprisingly complete understanding of American governance.  </P> <P> As a primer about what the author calls "the end of an era, a world lost, a way  of life that exists now only in memory," "Hearts of Sorrow" vividly records  ancient Vietnamese traditions and customs. Such ceremonies as family gatherings  to honor departed relatives on the anniversaries of their deaths and  celebrations of the Lunar New Year are described in rich detail.  </P> <P> As far as "documenting what (the narrators) consider their successes and  failures," the stories recount mostly failures in their American experience. No  doctors, lawyers, executives, entrepreneurs, valedictorians or Ivy League  graduates will be found here. Frustrations range from racial discrimination and  the difficulty of earning a living to children neglecting parents and ignoring  their counsel in choosing a mate.  </P> <P> Gestures of kindness also are recorded, such as a church's offer to build a new  house for a family of refugees. A former fisherman prizes his independence as a  vegetable vendor despite meager earnings. Yet the positive notes seem few and  far between.  </P> <P> A professional scholar, the author sprinkles the text with many references to  other books and articles, yet his lack of background in Vietnamese culture and  language does show. An example would be the explanation for why Southerners  call their first child "Number Two" -- plausible, yes, but no substitute for  the standard explanation taught every Vietnamese schoolboy for at least a  generation.  </P> <P> Because many translators are used, "Hearts of Sorrow's" translations are  sometimes inconsistent (for instance, "village person" and "man of the  countryside" -- both presumably nha que in Vietnamese) or incorrect ("Buddhist  canon"; more accurately "psalms"). A Vietnamese speaker, however, would  recognize with fondness the many proverbs and colorful expressions translated  word by word ("wet jackfruit" -- a whiner, or "direct train" -- sending someone  to his death).  </P> <P> "Fallen Leaves" starts in Cu Chi, famous long after the war for its tunnels dug  by Communist guerrillas, the subject of recent books by American veterans and  now a tourist attraction. Following the prologue, the book takes us through the  life of a Vietnamese woman, from her birth in 1940 to the fall of Saigon in  1975, with a short epilogue in 1982. While the historical events of this period  are well discussed in "Hearts of Sorrow," "Fallen Leaves" offers the reader a  more continuous story from a single viewpoint.  </P> <P> The book takes a surprisingly dim view of American intervention, considering  that the author prospers from doing business with the 25th Division, romances  U.S. soldiers, elopes to Las Vegas for a divorce from her Vietnamese husband,  and marries an American officer who turns out not to be Prince Charming after  all. The text emphasizes the brutality, corruption, prostitution and drug  problems that accompanied the "arrogant and rude" Americans' presence.  </P> <P> Co-authors Edith Kreisler and Sandra Christenson clearly had a hand in  inserting a wealth of information setting the historical context at strategic  intervals in the narrative -- for example, the reference to American interest  in "containment of international Communism" and the arrival in Saigon of one  "Colonel Edward G. Lansdale, USAF, working for the CIA." One wishes that they  had prevailed on Nguyen Thi Thu-Lam to use the full names of friends,  brothers-in-law and relatives so that their implied significance as political  actors could be corroborated.  </P> <P> As publications of the Council on Southeast Asia Studies, Yale Center for  Int'l. &amp; Area Studies, "Fallen Leaves" and "To Be Made Over," discussed  below, share a meticulous care in spelling Vietnamese words. With its acute and  circumflex accents, tildes and other diacriticals often used in combination,  exact spelling can be a challenge even for the native speaker. In addition to  fiction and poetry, the council also publishes research monographs and sponsors  a speaker series on a variety of topics concerning Southeast Asia.  </P> <P> Yet "Fallen Leaves" is less successful with the few French phrases that do  appear. Apologie would hardly be the preferred rendering for apology in French.  More disturbing perhaps are the occasional typographical errors in the English  text. The author also speaks to Americans, friends, business associates and  husband alike, exclusively in pidgin English, which appears in no other  context.  </P> <P> "Fallen Leaves" is an exceedingly poetic image in Vietnamese. Not only does the  title form a nice symmetry with the author's name, which means "forest in  autumn," but a common expression uses these very words in combination with  "returning to your roots." This memoir presumably served as an opportunity for  the author to reflect on her roots. It is a complete story of the war years,  with a wealth of Vietnamese proverbs and expressions, and illustrations of  customs, but one should not read the political interpretations without  skepticism, as the author discusses in a cursory fashion many events of which  she had no personal knowledge.  </P> <P> "To Be Made Over" is an anthology that lives up well to its subtitle, "Tales of  Socialist Reeducation in Vietnam." While Nhat Tien, alone among the many  authors, was a noted writer before the fall of Saigon, one can sense even  through the translation the wistful, ironic prose that is the hallmark of  contemporary Vietnamese literature. The translation is of high quality overall,  but occasionally one is reminded of the headmistress in "Lolita" observing to  Dr. Humbert that foreigners often create interesting combinations in the  English language (witness "lachrymatory theatrics").  </P> <P> The stories range from an old couple's volunteering to pull the plow to atone  for their son's desertion ("In the Footsteps of a Water Buffalo") to a cadre  scheming to extract bribes from political prisoners ("City Life"). First, the  cadre is surprised beyond belief by his cousin's lavish life in a captured  mansion in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). Returning to the isolated prison camp  where he is stationed, he laboriously plots his approach to an accomplice and  his selection of a victim. Alas, he has picked a young man no longer rich nor  with a family to return to. In this story, the author takes us through the plot  at a deliberate pace, successively exploring greed, shame, fear and suspicion  through the story of the cadre. This is but one example of how the entire  anthology's many vivid descriptions make the reader wonder whether he is  reading fact or fiction.  </P> <P> While an audience of native Vietnamese would follow the stories from "To Be  Made Over" with little difficulty, the translation fails to provide sufficient  background information for the younger Vietnamese or the English-speaking  reader. The latter would not recognize Mrs. Ngo Ba Thanh as a prominent  opponent of sundry South Vietnamese regimes, or understand that the distinctive  accent "which inverts I's and N's" is the hallmark of the southern edge of  North Vietnam.  </P> <P> Still, for its dry, ironic wit, and its uncanny ring of truth, this is the one  book among the three that should not be missed.  </P></p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / French government rule our realignment of currencies THE French government yesterday ruled out a realignment of currencies in the European monetary system, saying that there was a 'common political will' among member countries to maintain present parities. Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, said realignment was 'not on the agenda'. He also ruled out devaluation. 'If the franc did move within EMS, it would not go down, but in the opposite direction,' he said. He said the G7 countries had already taken 'technical steps' to arrest the decline of the US dollar and would continue to do so. The turmoil in the currency markets is being discussed at a meeting of G7 deputy finance ministers in Paris, ending today.</p>

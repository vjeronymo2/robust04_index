			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HE STUDIES WHY BASEBALL PLAYERS SUFFER UPON EXITING NEVER-NEVER LAND  </P> <P> Dodger great Roy Campanella once said there had to be "a lot of little boy in  you" to succeed in the major leagues. Tom House made a similar observation but  carried the thought one step further. A professional baseball player, House has  written, "is for all practical purposes terminally adolescent."  </P> <P> Campanella's combination of ability and attitude was such that he was elected  to the Hall of Fame. House's spirit was willing but his flesh was considerably  weaker. His lone contribution to the baseball shrine at Cooperstown was as an  adjunct to Henry Aaron.  </P> <P> House caught the ball that Aaron hit to surpass Babe Ruth's career home run  record and appeared in a famous photograph gleefully handing the ball to Aaron  at home plate in Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.  </P> <P> "That's the statement of my (playing) career," he said Monday night, smiling at  the memory 15 years later. A left-handed pitcher, House spent six full seasons  in the majors. Later this month he will mark his fourth anniversary as pitching  coach of the Texas Rangers.  </P> <P> What really sets House apart from former players and current pitching coaches,  other than an inquisitive mind that has antagonized traditionalists, is a  title.  </P> <P> Dwight Gooden still carries his childhood nickname of Doc. Casey Stengel used  to address everyone as doctor because it excused him from memorizing the first  names of the thousands he met. But House comes to the designation of doctor  honestly. He holds a doctorate in psychology.  </P> <P> House didn't have to venture far to find a topic for his doctoral thesis. "When  I was released as a player," he said before Monday night's game between the  Rangers and New York Yankees, "I looked around at my peer group. The divorce  rate was above average, there were bankruptcies and substance abuse of all  kinds. Even with people who were financially secure, there was an unhappiness  with the quality of their lives."  </P> <P> One former teammate he chose not to identify called him in desperation. The man  said he was holding a gun to his head. House talked him into counseling and he  has since straightened out his life.  </P> <P> But the inability to cope with demands of the real world, with "civilian"  status, led House to study terminal adolescent syndrome among professional  athletes.  </P> <P> House knew whereof he spoke. "I was losing a marriage," he said, "I did go  bankrupt and my children made no sense to me. When I was released (as a  player), my parents didn't even talk to me for a year and a half." Their status  in the community, it developed, was founded on House's athletic success.  </P> <P> Now House has taken his personal situation and observations, tested them  against the experiences of contemporaries and set the results to public  scrutiny in a volume entitled, "The Jock's Itch."  </P> <P> Published by Contemporary Books, it is a successor to the enormously successful  "Ball Four" that stops short of naming names. Instead, House chooses to  concentrate on the behavior patterns of professional athletes and the way in  which the demands and rewards of their sport inhibit their mental and emotional  growth.  </P> <P> "Athletes are Nintendo," he said. "Real world people are human computers."  Because of the special deference paid to extraordinary athletes dating to  childhood, they are not programmed to deal with everyday problems that confront  those whose skills do not inspire adoring crowds or million-dollar contracts.  </P> <P> Baseball is an extended family with its own culture, its own rules of  deportment that have little to do with the rest of society. House likened it to  the card game played by the closed family in "The Accidental Tourist,"  unintelligible to outsiders but comforting and bonding to the members.  </P> <P> He identified strongly with Jim Bouton's conclusion to "Ball Four:" "You see,"  Bouton wrote, "you spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball and in  the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time."  </P> <P> To this day, House remains in baseball's grip.  </P> <P> "It's got you for life," he said. "It got me." Fortunately, he was able to stay  with it after his playing days, although it took great sacrifices on the part  of his wife and three children and the willingness of his superiors, notably  Ranger Manager Bobby Valentine and General Manager Tom Grieve, to take a fresh  approach to the game.  </P> <P> The book is small, much like the man was in the world he chose. House is 5 feet  9, 165 pounds. His energy always has exceeded his strength. When he faced  reporters after the catch of Aaron's homer in the Braves' bullpen on that April  night in 1974, he identified himself in the terms of his teammates. "(They)  call me the 'Human Greenie,' " he said then.  </P> <P> He realized early in his career he would not be the next Sandy Koufax. In his  own words, House worked to become "the best 81 m.p.h. left-handed fastball  pitcher in baseball." With no small measure of pride, he said it was his  opinion that only Randy Jones did better with similar talent.  </P> <P> A graduate of USC, House was relentlessly hyper and curious. When a manager or  coach gave an order, he asked, Why? He's still asking. "The Jock's Itch," he  said, is a serious attempt not only to deal with the problems but also to find  solutions. It's a search of self-identification.  </P> <P> House certainly hasn't discovered a cure. Sitting on a stool in the visitors'  clubhouse at Yankee Stadium, he said he's still wondering "why I am not  comfortable outside this environment." He remains happiest "working with  pitchers on the mound, throwing batting practice, staying with a game called  baseball."  </P> <P> It's a relationship Dr. House hopes he never has to sever even as he continues  to study why parting is so difficult for so many.  </P></p>

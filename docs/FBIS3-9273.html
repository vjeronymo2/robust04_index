"We have received such an assurance from the coalition,"  said  Aleksander Kwasniewski, following the Tuesday [22 March] session  of the coalition's leadership.    As he was leaving the headquarters of the Polish Peasant  Party, Prime Minister Pawlak merely stated that a press  conference would be held on Wednesday. It can be expected,  therefore, that he will officially announce the decision he  reached yesterday.    Apart from the prime minister and the leader of the  Democratic Left Alliance, also participating in the coalition  meeting were Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy, Senate Speaker Adam  Struzik, Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, Michal  Strak, head of the Office of the Council of Ministers, and Jerzy  Szmajdzinski, general secretary of Social Democracy of the  Polish Republic.    One of the issues discussed was, among other topics, the  report from the National Council of Radio and Television.    The coalition has not yet agreed on a joint position on this  issue because not all of the deputies have had time to  familiarize themselves with the council's report.    "Evaluation of the report calls for a serious discussion,  which will be held at the end of April or the beginning of May,"  said Kwasniewski.</p>

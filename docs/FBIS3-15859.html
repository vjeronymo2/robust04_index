G. Aliyev stated this at a press conference in Beijing.    The Chinese leaders listened politely to their guest and  expressed sympathy but went no further than calling for a  peaceful settlement of the conflict. China, as a permanent  member of the UN Security Council, prefers to maintain  neutrality. Correspondents were interested to know whether  China had promised to render economic aid to Azerbaijan. It  follows from the president's reply that relations between the  two countries will be built on a mutually advantageous basis and  there was therefore no talk of China's economic aid.</p>

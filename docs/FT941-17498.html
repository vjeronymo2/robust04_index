			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Business backs unitary local government Sir, Your leading article on local government reorganisation ('Local difficulties', December 22), claims that 'business leaders have . . . reacted with horror to plans to create small single-tier authorities'. I am chairman of the Yuill Group of Companies, a construction group with a turnover of more than Pounds 50m and Cleveland's third-largest independent business. My company welcomes the recommendation of the Local Government Commission to create four unitary all-purpose authorities in Cleveland and, as a director of the Teesside Training and Enterprise Council, I know that this view is shared by many of my business colleagues in this area. Such opposition as exists to the commission's recommendation comes mainly from small groups within the local branch of the Confederation of British Industry and the Teesside Chamber of Commerce which, together, represent less than 20 per cent of local businesses. Set against this, 400 letters of support for unitary district government have been sent to the commission by individual local businesses. In addition, the commission's recommendation has been endorsed by key business agencies, including the Teesside Development Corporation, the Teesside Training and Enterprise Council and the northern branch of the House-Builders Federation. This support is not surprising when you consider that the four existing district councils in Cleveland have an excellent track record of working in partnership with local businesses, for example through the City Challenge Initiative. The enthusiasm and support for an extension of the partnership between council and private sectors was clearly in evidence at the recent launch of the Tees Valley Development Company, which is a joint district council/private sector initiative aimed at providing a focus for inward investment and job creation. More than 120 business leaders attended the event on a bitterly cold, foggy morning. The people of Cleveland have made very clear their support for unitary district local government. The misconception that this view is not shared by the business community owes more to a concerted misrepresentation of the facts by those who have a vested interest in influencing the debate. It needs to be corrected. Phillip G Yuill, executive chairman, Yuill Group, Cecil House, Loyalty Road, Hartlepool, Cleveland TS25 5BD</p>

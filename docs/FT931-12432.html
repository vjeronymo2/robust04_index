			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: US bank to spend Dollars 600m on First City CHEMICAL Banking, the third-biggest US bank which was formed from the merger last year of Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Chemical Bank, yesterday agreed to commit a total of nearly Dollars 600m to assume Dollars 4.4bn in deposits and acquire Dollars 6.6bn of assets of the defunct First City Bancorporation of Texas from the US government. Chemical will pay Dollars 346.8m and agree to inject Dollars 251m of capital as part of an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the US bank regulatory agency that seized First City last October. The transaction is being handled through Chemical's Texas Commerce Bancshares subsidiary, which will retain 34 First City branches, bringing its total network in Texas to 126 offices. TCB has assets of Dollars 18bn at present and earned Dollars 180m in net profits last year. The assets being acquired represent about three quarters of First City's previous total assets.</p>

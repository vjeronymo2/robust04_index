			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> Policy Letter No. 93&hyph;1 [Reissued] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To the Heads of Executive Departments and Establishments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subject: Management Oversight of Service Contracting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 --> May 18, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This Policy Letter establishes Government-wide policy, assigns responsibilities, and provides guiding principles for Executive Departments and agencies in managing the acquisition and use of services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This Policy Letter is issued pursuant to section 6(a) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Act, as amended, codified at 41 U.S.C. Section 405. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On March 15, 1993, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Leon Panetta requested that 17 major Executive Departments and agencies review their service contracting programs. The purpose of the review was to determine (1) if the service contracts were accomplishing what was intended; (2) whether the contracts were cost effective; and (3) whether inherently governmental functions were being performed by contractors. The results of the reviews indicated that service contracting practices and capabilities are uneven across the Executive branch and that various common management problems need to be addressed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the Director's review, the National Performance Review has found that improved support for customers of the procurement system is needed. To do this it is important that procurement officials work closely with program and other officials to develop clear and precise statements of work for the products and services being acquired. Contracting for services is especially complex and demands close collaboration between procurement personnel and the users of the service to ensure that contractor performance meets contract requirements and performance standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Policy Letter_which includes appropriate changes from Supplement No. 1 [59 FR 4955 (1994)]_has been revised to provide agencies with a more results-oriented approach to managing and administering service contracts through the ``best practices'' concept. One way to achieve excellence in contractor performance is to improve the acquisition, management, and administration of service contracts. This Policy Letter provides guiding principles through the ``best practices'' concept that should help agencies develop, analyze, and perfect requirements for service contracts which, in turn, should help to improve contract management and administration. Other ``best practices'' models in contract management and administration will be issued as separate guidance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guidance contained in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A&hyph;120, ``Guidelines for the Use of Advisory and Assistance Services,'' has been rescinded by Transmittal Memorandum No. 1, [58 FR 63593 (1993) and 59 FR 789 (1994)]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Definition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The following definitions are applicable to the Policy Letter: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Services <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  are identifiable tasks to be performed, rather than the delivery of an end item of supply. For purposes of this Policy Letter, only services obtained under nonpersonal services contracts are covered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Best Practices. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  For purposes of this Policy Letter, best practices are techniques that agencies may use to help detect problems in the acquisition, management, and administration of service contracts. Best practices are practical techniques gained from experience that agencies may use to improve the procurement process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Exclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Excluded from coverage of this Policy Letter are services that are (1) obtained through personnel appointments and advisory committees, (2) obtained through personal services contracts authorized by statute, (3) for construction, as defined in &sect;36.102 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), or (4) obtained through interagency agreements where the work is being performed by in-house federal employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also excluded from coverage of this Policy Letter are services obtained under contracts below the small purchase threshold, and services incidental to supply contracts. However, agencies should ensure that they are in compliance with appropriate OFPP Policy Letters applicable to service contracting and use good management practices and contract administration techniques when using these contracting methods to obtain services. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Challengers jostle in the queue: Competition from a 'third force' could soon disrupt the comfortable ways of Irish banking After years of unchallenged domination in their home market, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland are entering a stressful era. Foreign banks are queueing up to challenge them; customers are protesting about charges and the level of financing for small businesses; and rivals such as building societies are forcing them to lower margins. There is more to come for the two banks, which between them account for 70 per cent of banking in the Republic of Ireland, and nearly half of financial services. Next month, advisers are likely to set out how the government could auction TSB Bank, with assets of IPounds 1.2bn. This may create the 'third force' in Irish banking, called for by the ruling coalition of Labour and Fianna Fail when it was elected in 1992. The government originally planned to merge TSB with two small government-owned finance houses for agriculture and industry. But instead of this unwieldy state-controlled group, a large and vigorous bank could emerge. The proposal prompted an approach to TSB earlier this year by National Australia Bank. It agreed with the TSB's trustees a IPounds 102m offer to merge it with NAB's National Irish Bank. This led to a counter-offer from National Westminster Bank's subsidiary, Ulster Bank. If NatWest wins an auction, it might try to buy National Irish as well, creating a bank with IPounds 5.5bn of assets. This would be big enough to challenge AIB and Bank of Ireland. 'If the government wants a real third force, then we are the right partner,' says Mr Ronnie Kells, Ulster Bank's chief executive. Yet even without a third force, Irish banking is entering a period of stiffer competition and consolidation. The IPounds 183m flotation of the Irish Permanent Building Society next month will give the society access to capital markets so that it can make acquisitions. The two big banks are building up capital after a troubled period. Smaller players, such as the TSB, are seeking backing from sympathetic acquirers. Meanwhile, barriers which stopped competition among banks, building societies and life insurers have broken down, leaving the big banks to protest that their oligopoly is more apparent than real. 'There is a falsehood out there that we have got a grip on the market,' says Mr Tom Mulcahy, chief executive of AIB. 'On the street, we chase each other for customers,' says Mr Pat Molloy, chief executive of Bank of Ireland. But there are good reasons for foreign banks' interest in Ireland. Retail banking remains relatively profitable, with interest margins higher than in Britain and other European countries. Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank estimates that return on equity in the domestic retail market is about 40 per cent. This is double the 20 per cent overall return achieved by the most profitable European banks. Furthermore, the Irish Republican Army's ceasefire has stimulated the interest of investors in what Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, has called the 'Celtic Tiger' of European economies. The economy is expected to grow by at least 5 per cent this year and next year. Inflation is low, and growth in loan demand has re-emerged after the shock of the European exchange rate mechanism crisis of 1992. Ireland remains a tiny economy by European standards - its IPounds 32bn gross domestic product last year was equivalent to just 5 per cent of the UK's GDP. Yet the prospect of steady, low-inflation growth, is very attractive for banks. It lessens the risk that bad debts will compress interest margins, as they have done in other countries. 'I cannot remember a time when we have had such a high quality of loans,' says Mr Mulcahy. These factors have given the two banks a solid, profitable base. They have needed it in the past few years as they have struggled to clean up costly errors abroad. Both expanded in Britain in the 1980s too aggressively. Both have had to work out bad debts on corporate lending, and have now refocused their businesses on banking for Irish expatriates, and forms of secured lending such as residential mortgages. Bank of Ireland's experience in the US (where AIB managed to avoid trouble) was even worse. It lost a total of IPounds 180m over four years as a result of the New England real estate crisis, after buying First New Hampshire in 1988. 'Our timing there was especially unfortunate. We bought just before the bubble burst,' says Mr Molloy. The US subsidiary has now turned the corner, making a IPounds 13m profit in the year to March. Irish profits, and recovery overseas, have now prompted the banks to talk of renewed expansion abroad. AIB has made the loudest noises, talking of both US acquisitions to reinforce its Baltimore-based subsidiary First Maryland Bancorp, and perhaps buying a British building society. The banks reason that they cannot simply remain in Ireland if they are to compete alongside the emerging pan-European banks. Yet even with the cash to spend, overseas expansion is not a simple matter. Both in Britain and the US, banks are bidding around twice the book value of smaller banks and societies to take them over. This makes it hard to achieve their required return on investments, even if they avoid pitfalls. 'We will keep our money in our pockets if we have to. We are not going to make a purchase at any price,' says Mr Mulcahy. They may need to husband resources for the battle at home. Signs of this have emerged in the savings market, where the banks have narrowed margins by offering depositors higher rates. Mr Roy Douglas, chief executive of Irish Permanent, says that lending margins are also under pressure. 'The banks are finding the mortgage market very attractive, and there is a lot more competition than a year ago,' he says. The big banks accept that competition will inevitably erode interest margins. In response, they are trying to boost their earnings from other sources. An obvious source of added income is fees and charges. These are state-controlled, although the banks can negotiate increases. Irish banks gain a lower share of their income from fees than those in countries such as Britain, despite widespread criticism by consumers. The other possibility of added income is to sell more to their customers. The competition in the mortgage market is one sign of this; banks have also developed life insurance arms. 'We have a very strong base that we have not always used. If we can market products better to our existing customers, it will have a powerful effect,' says Mr Brian Wilson, director of AIB's Ireland division. Yet banks are unlikely to be able to sustain their returns solely through adding to income. This will put pressure on them to cut costs, either by reducing staff and branches, or by taking over others and removing duplication. Such a process has been taking place in the US and other European countries. It will be harder to achieve in Ireland, where there is 15 per cent unemployment, and strong resistance to job cuts. The possibility of cuts has already dogged part of the government's original proposal for a third force. The staff of Agricultural Credit Corporation - one of the two finance houses involved - protested at the potential cost of being merged with the Industrial Credit Corporation. It will also affect the TSB sale; bidders are likely to have to make pledges on jobs as part of their offers. Mr Craig McKinney, chairman of the biggest Irish finance house, Woodchester Investments, says that a bid for TSB is only attractive if it can be rationalised. 'To buy it with your hands tied behind your back does not make sense,' he says. Without such cuts, its new owner may be unable to undercut the big banks' charges, which would undermine the original rationale for selling the state banks. Such considerations are unlikely to hold outsiders back. Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, has stressed his bank's intention to preserve jobs if it wins an auction. Yet such pledges will not hold indefinitely. By the time the Irish banking market has consolidated, more than a few politicians and former bank clerks could be talking with nostalgia about the days before banks started to compete.  ---------------------------------------------- Assets in Republic of Ireland (1993)  ----------------------------------------------                                   (Poundsbn)  ---------------------------------------------- Bank of Ireland                         7.58 * Allied Irish Banks                      8.42 TSB Bank                                1.23 National Irish Bank                     0.60 Woodchester Investments                 1.50 Ulster Bank                             3.70  ---------------------------------------------- * 1994  ----------------------------------------------</p>

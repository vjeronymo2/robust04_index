			<p>CSO     [Text] President Suharto said that administrative  deconcentration and decentralization, along with economic  deregulation and debureaucratization, would continue, in line  with progressive stages of social autonomy.    Opening the National Discussions on State Administration  yesterday at the Presidential Palace, the president said that  society, both urban and rural, is very receptive to almost every  policy, strategy, and program initiated by the government. The  head of state said that various new forces autonomously  dedicated to increasing and expanding development had begun to  grow and move in an active way.    "The government itself is adjusting to these progressive  stages of social autonomy. The way to do it is to continue to  implement government deconcentration and decentralization, along  with economic deregulation and debureaucratization," he said.    At the discussions, which were attended by Minister of  Reform  for State Apparatus T.B. Silalahi, Minister of Defense and  Security Edi Sudradjat, and Minister/State Secretary Murdiono,  the president mentioned that the government's mission is  basically to foster and create the widest possible conditions  and opportunities for the growth and formation of social  initiatives and creativity for development.    The various groups within society are expected to forge,  generate, develop, and cultivate human initiatives and  creativity in order to autonomously increase the standard and  quality of life, both physical and spiritual.    "Given such cooperation, we hope that we can progress  rapidly  in the years to come," said the president.    The president said that institutionally the government is  made up of two basic tiers--the governing political tier, which  consists of the president, the vice-president, and the  ministers, and the state administrative tier, which consists of  officials and agencies under the ministers, which serve from the  federal level down to the village level.    The president said that it is this state administrative tier  which professionally prepares and implements a set of policies,  strategies and programs, which are established by the governing  political tier. Part of the success of national development in  the past few decades has come from the dedication and  professional skills of this state administrative tier.    "We must build up this state administrative tier. The  development of the state administration is an integral part of  our entire national development," he asserted.    In another part of his speech, the president suggested that  the development of the state administration is no less crucial  to national development than the development of other areas.  The development of the state administration, said the  president, could only be done after the governing political tier  was completely fixed up and it achieved stability in 1969.    "Since then we have really been able to build up the state  administration so that it can fulfill such an important  function. We have all begun to enjoy the fruits of the  development of the state administration through the functioning  of the entire state administrative apparatus," said the  president.    However, the president continued, we should not feel  satisfied yet. Economic competition between countries will be  even sharper in the future. That is why society and the state  administration must be able to increase the efficient and  effective use of national resources.    Before the president's speech, Hendropriyono, General  Chairman of the National Discussions on State Administration,  reported that 200 people are taking part in the three-day  program.    The speakers at the meeting will include a number of  important figures in the administration, such as Awaludin  Djamin, Bintoro Tjokromidjojo, Minister of Defense and Security  Edi Sudradjat, and Minister of Education and Culture Wardiman  Djojonegoro.</p>

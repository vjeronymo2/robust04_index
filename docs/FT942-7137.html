			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (7): The fire has been doused - Are dragon bonds doomed to obscurity? Dragon bonds set south-east Asia's debt markets alight last year: issuers as diverse as Abbey National and China launched some USDollars 3bn worth of bonds and some bankers found the paper easy to place. Now, the fire appears to have been doused. Mandates languish in bankers' desks and investors holding the once coveted Beijing issue have seen spreads widen to 125 basis points over US treasuries from 88 basis points at launch. Some argue that bad timing and lack of liquidity will consign dragon bonds to the mythical status of the creatures after which they are named. Others say it is a lull, predicting that China will be able to tap investors again for capital. 'We believe the dragon bond market is about to balloon. It has been held up because of the US treasury markets,' says Mr Chris Nicholas, senior vice-president with Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong. The US investment bank has been by far the most active bookrunner in a league table dominated by American banks. Since the Asian Development Bank's first issue in December 1991 some USDollars 4.6bn has been raised through dragon bonds, which are priced, launched and syndicated in Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) and listed in at least two of the three centres - Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. Some landmarks stand out - the USDollars 300m five-year dragon bond launched by General Electric Capital Corporation, the first corporate to test the waters, and the 10-year money raised by China. By issuing dragon bonds issuers can tap a healthy vein of demand that was previously frustrated at being left with the crumbs of eurobond issues: successful deals were fully taken up in London by the time Asian investors awoke, leaving them just the less popular issues. Not all bankers share Lehman's enthusiasm for dragon bonds. One syndicate manager notes: 'Coming to Asia to extract five basis points over and above what a fair market price would be in Europe is irresponsible tourism.' He offers a more regional role for the market: a forum for local investors to meet local borrowers, where a single A rating (or no rating at all) is not the leper's bell it might be in Frankfurt or London. Economic conditions in Asia - fast growth and big demand for financing (total costs of upgrading basic infrastructure have been estimated at USDollars 1,000bn) - support the call for a specific Asian bond market. 'When the time comes that Asian currencies or targeted transactions offer the best funding, that's the time when the dragon market will really shine,' says one banker. For its proponents, the existence of an Asian market is part of the globalisation of capital markets, rather than an alternative to global issues. It is the natural market for borrowers who may not have a presence in Europe, for example, but who wish to tap American and Asian investors. Mr Nicholas says: 'A lot of people are advocates of global markets, which have definitely started and increased quite dramatically in the last six months or so, but not every institution needs to come to the market and borrow USDollars 1bn. We have many projects right now in Asia where they need financing of US200m to USDollars 300m. That's a perfect fit for the dragon bond market.' However, the market has been shunned by local corporates. Companies in Hong Kong (traditionally cash-rich and without credit ratings) have steered clear, preferring to issue eurobonds and convertible bonds. That Hong Kong corporates will continue to tap international investors is signalled by ambitious expansion plans (chiefly in China) and by the fact that companies such as Wharf Holdings and Swire Pacific have secured credit agency ratings. Wharf, the conglomerate with interests spanning property, ports, cable TV and telecommunications, became the first to secure a rating earlier this year. The company was also among the first to raise money overseas in a bond issue in June last year. The triple-A-rated GECC has returned to the dragon bond market twice since its 1992 debut, raising a further USDollars 350m in three-year paper; and Intelsat has followed China to become the second issuer of a 10-year issue. By far the bulk of offerings has been on a fixed-rate basis, although in the first quarter this year the sums raised in floating-rate bonds exceeded that in fixed rate issues. If more companies and sovereign borrowers take up the baton as bond markets revive, bankers say new fire will be breathed into the dragon bond market. But as an embryonic market it still has far to go.</p>

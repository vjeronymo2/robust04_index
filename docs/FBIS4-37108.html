			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu </F> by Hayim Zissowitz; place not given -- live]    [Excerpt] [Zissowitz] We called you this morning to  discuss the possible establishment of a coalition by the Likud  and Hayim Ramon's faction in the Histadrut labor federation, but  we obviously cannot ignore the news of your meeting with  Jordan's Crown Prince Hasan in London in May.    [Netanyahu] Why not? We definitely can. I have nothing to  say about that.    [Zissowitz] Did you meet?    [Netanyahu] To repeat, I have no intention of getting into a  discussion of this issue. I thought you called me to ask me  about other things.    [Zissowitz] I began by saying that we wanted to discuss  other matters with you, but that we could not ignore this piece  of news which was first reported last night. I believe you have  not categorically denied it.    [Netanyahu] I can only tell you one thing: I think the  attempt made by certain elements in the last two years to  portray the Likud as the enemy of peace -- as opposed to the  supporters of peace -- has been futile. After all, it was the  Likud that brought about the two big steps: the Camp David  accords with Egypt and the Madrid conference on direct peace  talks with all our neighbors. The Likud adheres to its concept  that the attainment of a genuine peace must be based on security  and our ability to protect this peace with arrangements that  will prevent its disintegration and its deterioration into a new  war. The Likud proved this ability and continues to adhere to  this concept, whether it is in the government or in the  opposition, and will continue to do so when I am once again in  the government.    [Zissowitz] Not everybody in the Likud sees eye to eye with  you on this issue. Last time when you voiced your support for  contacts with Jordan and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's meeting  with King Husayn, former Prime Minister Yitzhaq Shamir lashed  out at you and asked you on what basis you were making such  declarations.    [Netanyahu] I will not comment on such speculations and  utterances. I can only tell you that Yitzhaq Shamir, just like  many other members of the Likud -- its overwhelming majority, if  not all of it -- firmly and clearly support the attainment of a  peace agreement with Jordan. I have always said this would be  one of our objectives. That is why we went to the Madrid  conference and why the Likud government conducted negotiations  with Jordan. This was and remains our objective.    [Zissowitz] Do you still adhere to your declaration about  Jordan -- East Palestine [previous three words in English]?    [Netanyahu] I have always said and continue to say today  that the solution of the question of Eretz Yisra'el and the  status of the Palestinian Arabs between us and the Arabs will be  found through two, not three, countries. Such a solution will  be attained by the Jewish state in western Eretz Yisra'el -- the  State of Israel -- and the Arab country with a Palestinian  majority located on the eastern part of Mandatory Palestine --  the state of Jordan. We could reach a stable arrangement in  negotiations with Jordan and the Palestinian Arabs; not the  arrangement which is now disintegrating before our very eyes in  Gaza and Jericho, but a different one. Negotiations with these  two elements -- the state of Jordan and the Palestinian Arabs --  would enable us to arrive at an autonomy arrangement rather than  at a state.    [Zissowitz] I suppose you were asked by your interlocutors  -- or your interlocutor, if the reported meeting indeed took  place -- whether as part of the understandings with Jordan you  would be prepared to arrive at a territorial compromise with it,  not with the Palestinian Arabs.    [Netanyahu] I suggest you do not make any suppositions. To  repeat, I will not comment on those reports. I suggest that we  stick to what I have just said.    [Zissowitz] But would you be prepared in principle?    [Netanyahu] I reiterate: It is our position that the  territory west of the Jordan River should remain under Israel's  sovereignty and our security domination. However, contrary to  the situation that has existed since the Six-Day War, we aspire  to revert from a military regime to a civilian government, to  autonomy for the Arabs and security for the Jews. This concept  has not changed. [passage omitted]</p>

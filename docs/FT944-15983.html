			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar weakness hits blue chips at the close - Market Report Currency factors yesterday tripped up a UK stock market which had taken in its stride the widely-heralded US data on consumer prices, retail sales and industrial production. Wall Street made little response to the economic statistics which were seen as largely neutral and likely to reduce the chances of an early tightening in Federal Reserve policy. A more potent factor at the London close was the weakness in the dollar as the DM advanced ahead of this weekend's elections in Germany. Dollar weakness hit a range of international blue chip stocks in London and the early loss in the FT-SE 100 Share Index was quickly extended. At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 35.2 points down at 3,106.7, having barely held above 3,104 earlier. Trading volumes were very slow at first but picked up in the second half of the session when a UK investment bank appeared to be operating a sell programme across the range of equities. The final total of 575.2m shares through the Seaq electronic network compared with 816.9m in the previous session. Non-Footsie business made up around 54 per cent of the day's total, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index shed 13.2 to 3,543.4 as profits were taken. While disappointed to see the market's six-day run of gains in the Footsie ended, and also to see the Footsie 3,100 mark challenged again so soon, analysts were prepared to see yesterday's setback as no more than an expected bout of profit-taking. The market has risen by 108 Footsie points, or around 3.6 per cent, this week as the mood has turned more optimistic on global and domestic interest rate and inflation prospects. Keen support has come from global bond markets as economic data from the US has suggested that need for an early tightening by the Federal Reserve is weakening. However, the Fed's Open Market Committee will meet at the beginning of next month and this provides a further opening for the Fed to act if it wishes. British government bonds had a quiet session yesterday and closed with small losses which ranged to around  5/32 at the short end of the range and slightly less at the longer end. The bond market took its cue from Wall Street's satisfaction with the US economic statistics. As expected the Bank of England announced that on October 26 it would auction bonds with maturities ranging from 1998 to 2002. Further details will be announced on Tuesday and when issued dealings start on the same day. The bank also announced that there would be no gilt-edged auction next month in view of the Budget to be introduced by the UK chancellor of the exchequer. Earlier, demand for bonds exhausted two of the issues taken into the market this week. Among the international stocks, Glaxo provided a lone firm spot at the close. The rest of the dollar-earning sector showed a list of mostly small losses, with the leading oil shares just a shade easier as the market took the view that the crisis on the Kuwaiti border appears to be easing. Consumer and retail issues gave back some of their recent gains in spite of the general view that this week's news of a further dip in domestic inflation has made it unlikely that base rates will be raised again this year. The market faces further tests of confidence next week in Europe and the US. The outcome of the German elections is likely to have further effect on currencies and the latest statistics on German M3 money supply is due at the end of the week. At home, the market will focus on the UK Public Sector Borrowing Requirement estimates, expected on Tuesday. Forecasts are for a sharp increase, perhaps to around Pounds 4.8bn, according to some analysts.</p>

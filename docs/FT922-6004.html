			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: TNT remains in the red but reduces borrowings TNT, the international transport group, has remained in the red for the third quarter of 1991-92 but has significantly reduced its borrowings. The company yesterday announced a loss of ADollars 44.4m (USDollars 33.6m) for the nine months ended March, against a half-year loss of ADollars 23.4m and a loss of Dollars A18.5m in the previous corresponding period. But the company said earnings continued to be heavily affected by abnormal items, most latterly associated with the flotation of the GD Express Worldwide venture in the US which raised about ADollars 400m. Abnormals added a ADollars 40.9m loss in the latest nine months, compared with ADollars 48.2m previously. Before abnormals and tax there was a profit of ADollars 23.2m, against ADollars 55m. Helped by the GD Express sale, TNT more than halved its interest bill in the period to ADollars 41.7m. Borrowings had been reduced by ADollars 898.5m. Despite the recession, the group increased revenue in Italy, GD Express Worldwide, domestic operations in Germany and Spain, the European contract logistics business and the TNT shipping and development group, the company said. Revenue was steady in the UK and the US, while declines were experienced in Australia, Canada and Brazil. TNT said the company's half-owned domestic airline operations, Ansett and Eastwest, had incurred losses in the period. 'While there is no question as to the underlying worth of TNT's investment in Ansett, it is possible that Ansett may reassess, at year-end, the value of its investment in Eastwest in the light of the current confused airline policy situation,' TNT said.</p>

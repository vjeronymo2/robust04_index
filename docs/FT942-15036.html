			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Brazil finishes restructuring debt Brazil has completed the restructuring of about Dollars 49bn (Pounds 34bn) of commercial debt, in the last of the main Latin American Brady-style debt reschedulings. The deal, agreed late on Friday night in New York, brings to an end more than a decade of uncertainty over Brazil's relations with the international financial community. Mr Rubens Ricupero, who took over as finance minister this month, described the deal's conclusion as 'an important milestone' in the country's 'continuing programme of economic reform'. But with presidential elections this year, and an unstable economy, there is unlikely to be a rush of confidence and foreign investment into the country, as happened in Mexico and Argentina after they completed similar restructurings. The Brazilian deal was also concluded without the agreement of the Dart family of the US, who hold about Dollars 1.4bn of debt and are the largest non-bank creditors. The Darts may take legal action to try to reverse the deal. Brazil and about 750 private creditor banks completed the elaborate debt restructuring after nearly four years of negotiations to exchange the country's old debt for new and reduce its total debt burden. The deal offered creditors a choice of six options to repackage loans and interest overdue into new bonds with maturities of up to 30 years. Brazil's central bank estimated the deal would reduce its debt by Dollars 4bn and bring Dollars 4bn more savings in debt servicing costs. The Brazilian deal differed from other 'Brady-style' restructurings - so called after the 1989 initiative from former US Treasury secretary Nicholas Brady - since it was the first main deal to be concluded without a standby accord from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF was concerned that Brazil's economic reform efforts are still uncertain. Without IMF backing, Brazil used Dollars 4.6bn of its own foreign exchange reserves as collateral for some of the six options.</p>

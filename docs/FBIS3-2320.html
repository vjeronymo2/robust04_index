Leading cadres  should take the initiative to launch a down-to-earth study  campaign and vie with each other for more efforts and better  efficiency in study so as to ensure smooth progress in the work  of all fields.    The forum was presided over by Hu Jingtao, Standing  Committee  member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of  the CPC Central Committee and president of the Central Party  School. Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and Secretariat; and Wen Jiabao, alternate  member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of  the CPC Central Committee; were present at the forum.    Jiang Zemin said: Our party has always set great store by  study. Whenever revolution and construction develops to a  critical turning point and whenever the whole party faces a new  situation and tasks, we stress even more the need to study.  Every step of advance taken and every victory won in our  party's cause during the past several decades are inseparable  from the study and advancement made by all party comrades.  Fruitful results of extensive study by the entire party  membership were especially conspicuous during the Yanan period  and on the eve of nationwide liberation. Following the Third  Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, China's  endeavor to build socialism entered a new development period.  At Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal, the party launched a  campaign to renew study. The remarkable achievements in China's  economic reform and development over the past more than a decade  should, to a large extent, be attributed to our efforts to  study. Looking back at our party's experiences over the past  several decades, it is of crucial importance to steadfastly take  our own road by persistently integrating the basic tenents of  Marxism with China's reality, and to diligently study and  continually do pioneering work based on the demand of the  situation and tasks facing the party in different periods of  time. It is precisely because our party upholds the fine  tradition of study and continually promotes and strengthens the  integration of the Marxist theory with China's national  conditions based on changes in the situation and tasks that our  party has been able to overcome dangers and difficulties, to  develop from a small and weak to a big and strong party, to  unite and lead the broad masses of people in taking the road of  revolution and construction commensurate with China's national  strength, to open up a new situation, and to advance from  victory to victory.    Jiang Zemin emphasized: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the  14th CPC National Congress set the establishment of a socialist  market economic structure as the objective of reform. A  blueprint for a new economic structure has been drawn up in the  decision adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee. Our reform has entered a new stage of  combining package reform with breakthroughs in key economic,  political, cultural, and social areas. At present, we all  realize that the rapidly-changing situation presents to us many  new and thorny problems and the difficulty in our work has  increased. All these explain that the establishment of a brand  new economic system for further emancipating and expanding  productive forces and expediting the pace of socialist  modernization has set a new and higher demand for our level of  theory, policy, knowledge, and work. There are many things we  are not familiar with or do not understand at all. What should  we do? The way out is to admit our weaknesses and  conscientiously study and master new knowledge and skills.  Moreover, we should realize that China's socialist  modernization drive is being carried out amidst a complicated  and everchanging international environment. The world today is  characterized by fierce competition, with the competition for  economic and overall national strength as the core issue. In a  sense, it is also a competition for talented people, for the  ability of leaders and the quality of nations. Amidst fierce  international competition, we must seize the opportunity to  develop ourselves and become invincible. We must work and study  hard. With a big party, big country, big population, our nation  cannot effect a real take-off and succeed in modernization if we  fail to arm ourselves with scientific theory and to master new  knowledge in various fields. Therefore, the issue of study  concerns not only the advancement of cadres at large, but also  the prosperity of the country and its people and the success of  the modernization drive. The entire party membership and the  whole nation must reach this consensus.    Touching on what leading cadres need to study in the face  of the new situation and tasks, Jiang Zemin said: Two important  aspects need to be studied: first, Marxist theory and, second,  social practice and the practices of the masses of the people.  At present, so far as the requirements for leadership work are  concerned, the most fundamental need is to study well the theory  on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Meanwhile,  efforts must be made to study the basic knowledge of a socialist  market economy and its related principles, policies, laws, and  regulations; the basic knowledge of modern science and  technology; and the experiences of Chinese history and, in  particular, of modern history and the world history of socialism.    Jiang Zemin stressed once again that it is necessary to  firmly grasp the quintessence of emancipating the mind and  seeking truth from facts and to study hard and have a thorough  understanding of the world outlook and methodology of  dialectical materialism and historical materialism contained in  Comrade Xiaoping's works when we study his theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. He said: After we have  adopted a correct stand, viewpoint, and method, it will be  relatively easy for us to have a thorough and comprehensive  understanding of the party's line, principles, policies, and  various reform plans and prevent one-sidedness or absoluteness;  to reach a consensus and reduce unnecessary disputes when we  carry them out; and to encourage a pioneering and realistic  spirit as well as a spirit to blaze new trails and to avoid  subjectivism and blindness when we handle tasks. Having a  thorough understanding of more materialist dialectics and  reducing idealism and metaphysics through study is an important  requirement for leading cadres at all levels. When studying  historical materialism at present, we must place more emphases  on the mass viewpoint of Marxism and on the party's mass line.  It is necessary for us to adhere to the party's basic line, to  implement the party's various principles and policies, to  improve the work style of leadership, to successfully carry out  various tasks, to remold our world outlook, and to enhance our  ability to resist corruption and prevent peaceful evolution.    Comrade Jiang Zemin called on party schools at all levels to  further successfully implement the principle of integrating  theory with practice. He said: Integrating theory with  practice is a fine tradition, a fine work style, a good style of  study, and a particularly strong point of our party. Persisting  in integrating theory with practice is an important issue that  must be solved when we strengthen and improve theoretical study  and an important principle for us to successfully carry out our  tasks. If we want to achieve a new breakthrough in promoting  reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, we must work  hard to make big progress in integrating theory with practice.  At present, the problems of inadequate study of theory and  losing contact with reality exist among our cadres; the issue of  integrating theory with practice remains to be satisfactorily  solved. If we want to strengthen and improve the work of party  schools, to improve the quality of their education, and to  enhance the level of their scientific research, fundamentally  speaking, we must further successfully solve the issue of  integrating theory with practice by proceeding from their  characteristics. If we want to persist in integrating theory  with practice, first of all, we must attach importance to  studying theory well. It is extremely important for us to  unswervingly adhere to the party's basic line for a hundred  years. The party's basic line is established on the basis of  scientific theory. Only by unswervingly upholding the party's  basic theory can we unswervingly adhere to its basic line. The  evolution of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics signals that the level of  our party's theory has reached a new height. However, it does  not mean that all party organizations and all party-member  cadres automatically solve the problem of arming themselves with  theory. A process of assiduous study is needed to fulfill the  task. Persisting in using theory to guide practice is the  fundamental purpose of our theoretical study. We must integrate  our study of the party's basic theory with our party's history,  with the reality of our work, and with the reality of our  ideology; we must sum up experiences and lessons; and we must  enhance our consciousness of correctly implementing the party's  basic line in an all-around way and strengthen our resolve in  this endeavor.    Jiang Zemin urged party committees at all levels to treat  the work of educating cadres on the important status and role of  party schools in the light of the overall strategic situation of  socialist modernization and from the high plane of long-term  peace and stability of the party and the state. Resolute  efforts should be made to prevent and overcome such short-term  behavior as paying attention to making use of personnel to the  neglect of cultivating more talented persons. Due attention  should be paid to the integration of the selection, use, and  cultivation of cadres. He said: Over the past years, party  schools at all levels have achieved great results in cultivating  many leading cadres and talented personnel in theoretic fields.  The current issue is that party schools should suit themselves  to the new situation and enhance teaching quality. Party  committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership and  guide party schools to center around the work of the whole  party, follow a correct orientation of running schools, and  strive to conduct reform in depth. In line with their limits of  authority in managing cadres, party committees at all levels  should be responsible for carrying out the task of training  cadres in rotation. They should promptly study and solve  important problems in the work of party schools. Attention  should be paid to replenishing and strengthening the leading  groups and teaching staff of party schools so as to gradually  improve conditions for running schools.    In conclusion, Jiang Zemin pointed out: At present, the  whole  party and the people across the country are striving to seize  the opportunity, deepen reform, open wider to the outside world,  promote economic development, and maintain stability. The new  situation and tasks have put forward higher requirements for the  work of party schools and, at the same time, provided a new  motive force for running party schools better. It is hoped that  comrades in party schools at all levels will have a better  understanding of the situation, clearly define their tasks,  enhance their sense of mission and responsibility, diligently  study, and work in a thoroughgoing manner, and under the  leadership of party committees at all levels, work hard to  create a new situation in the work of party schools so as to  promote the educational undertakings of party schools to a new  level, and make new contributions to the great cause of  vigorously carrying out the work of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics!

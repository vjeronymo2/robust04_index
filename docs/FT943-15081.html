			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Vietnam approves cannery joint venture Vietnam has approved a Dollars 41m (Pounds 26.9m) joint venture by Swire Pacific of Hong Kong, Crown Cork and Seal of the US and two Vietnamese state companies to make aluminium beverage cans in the north of the country, Swire Pacific said yesterday. Crown Vinalimex Packaging (CVP), the joint venture, aims to produce more than 400m cans a year for Vietnam's expanding soft drink and beer markets. In southern Vietnam, CarnaudMetalbox and Saigon Brewery recently began work on a Dollars 54m aluminium can factory with a capacity of some 460m cans a year near Ho Chi Minh City. Construction of CVP's factory in Ha Tay province near the capital Hanoi is to start in October and should be finished within 18 months. CVP will be 33 per cent owned by Swire Pacific, 34 per cent by Crown Cork and Seal, 20 per cent by Vinalimex and 13 per cent by Ha Tay Foodstuff Complex Factory. Swire Pacific, which controls Cathay Pacific Airways, said the factory was its first substantial non-aviation investment in Vietnam. Hong Kong is the second largest foreign investor in Vietnam after Taiwan. US companies were unable to commit funds until President Bill Clinton lifted the US economic embargo against Vietnam in February. Vietnam's communist government has welcomed foreign investors since it embarked on economic reforms in the late 1980s. Investors are keen to tap into this poor but fast-growing economy of 70m people, although bureaucracy, corruption and rivalry between central and local authorities have delayed some projects and restricted profits. Last week it emerged that the State Committee for Co-operation and Investment, the body that licenses foreign projects, had blocked plans for a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Ho Chi Minh City on the grounds that soft drink supplies in the south were already sufficient. A joint venture between PepsiCo PeP. N, a Singapore company and a Vietnamese state company plans to apply for licences to build two bottling plants in Hanoi and Danang, Reuter adds from Singapore. The joint venture has been operating a 600 bottle per minute plant in Ho Chi Minh City for 18 months.</p>

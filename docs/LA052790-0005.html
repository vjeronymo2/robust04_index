			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Why has Fox moved "Booker," one of its best shows, to the 10 p.m. time slot on  Sundays? Doesn't it realize most of the show's fans have to get up and go to  school Monday mornings? Fox, please ax "The Outsiders" and move "Booker" back  to 7 p.m. "The Outsiders" is a lame excuse for a TV show anyway.  </P> <P> Michelle Parkinson, Anaheim  </P></p>

			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / Letter: More to come Sir, I read with interest the article on welfare benefits by Julian Le Grand (Personal View, May 24) in which he states: 'We estimate that over their lifetimes people pay for between two-thirds and three-quarters of the benefits they receive from social security, education and health.' I look forward with even greater interest to a follow-up article explaining who pays the rest. George N Harvie, Lower Branscombe, Warnicombe Lane, Tiverton, Devon EX16 4NZ</p>

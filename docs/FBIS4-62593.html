			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Phone-in interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk </F> by moderator Volodymyr Bodenchuk, chief editor of the MOLOD  UKRAYINY newspaper; phone-in takes place at the newspaper's  office in Kiev on 13 May -- recorded]    [Summary from poor reception] [Bodenchuk] Leonid Kravchuk  has taken part in a similar phone-in at the newspaper's office  before, about a year ago, and this is a continuation of those  conversations.    [Caller] Is a monument to Mykhaylo Hrushevskyy, president of  the Ukrainian People's Republic, going to be erected in Kiev,  and if so when and where.    [Kravchuk] Such a monument will be erected and the plan for  this has been elaborated. Its location has not yet been  decided, but it is expected to be erected by 1995.    [Caller] Three or four years ago, when Ryzhkov was still in  the former Union, bonds were distributed. In 1993, we should  have received the goods from them, let us put it like that --  cars, refrigerators, and so on. How is this issue being  resolved, and will it be resolved or not?    [Kravchuk] Well, this issue is extremely complicated for us,  from the aspect that considerable funds are needed for this.  But the fact remains that it should be resolved -- you remember  that this issue has been raised two or three times at Supreme  Council sittings. At the last Supreme Council sitting an  instruction was issued to the executive power -- in particular  to the Cabinet of Ministers -- to find a mechanism to compensate  in full the debts from indexation of deposits and everything  connected with the paying back of debts to the people.    There are two main proposals now: The first is to include,  for instance, savings, property subject to privatization. There  are other proposals too. We are currently elaborating all of  those versions that are possible, so that they are realistic, so  as not to simply promise something to people, as before, and  then not to hand it over. Because, if I know today that I have  no funds in the budget, but I tell you that I will pay back to  you, well this will be just hot air, and there is no need to  engage in this. We are studying the versions. But the fact  that it should be paid back to people, and that it will be  returned -- there can be no other talk, as they say. The talk  can only be about how to do this most efficiently and  realistically -- so as not to promise, but to resolve.    [Caller, in Russian] I am an engineer and mother of two from  Kherson. My family is facing problems due to low earnings and  food shortages. I had to take an extra job to make ends meet.  How long can I hold out like this?    [Kravchuk, in Russian] Today no one is the enemy of his own  people and the state and all people should support one another  in these hard times. Today one should not engage in populism  and make hollow promises, thus deceiving the people, because  people will finally lose their faith in the authorities. All  these elections will be rendered meaningless. I appreciate her  efforts to cope with the difficulties independently and promise  that the state will do everything possible to support the people  who find themselves in such difficulties.    [Bodenchuk] There was a letter from Ivan Piven who works at  an agricultural firm in Lvov who calls on the president of  Ukraine to exercise all his powers to stop the political orgy  connected with the plot of the procommunist councils. Everyone  understands that the early election of the president and the  election of the local bodies of power are disastrous for the  state, which is just beginning to feel the first signs of  stabilization.    [Kravchuk] One can agree with the second part of this  proposal, this letter, that it is necessary to prepare a legal  basis at first and then to hold elections. This is the right of  the people and the right, after all, of the Supreme Council too,  and the right of all to determine what system our state will be  based upon. Whether it will be a unitarian state, or a  federative one, as some people propose. All this is the right  of the people, I repeat this, and not only a concrete person.  This is a very, well, large-scale problem dealing with,  probably, every man -- even the one who has not yet been born.  What kind of a state will we have? We cannot solve this  problem quickly and spontaneously. This is why I say that it is  necessary to create a legal basis -- to determine plenary  powers, to determine the status.    Some leaders at oblast level are unaware of the nature of  their relations with the central bodies of power and have no  plan of action.    If this move is not backed up with a legal basis, this can  be  disastrous for the state, and I agree with this. By the way, we  also have Crimea's experience. I was talking with journalists  today. Autonomy was granted to Crimea in 1990. Only two years  later the law on the delimitation of plenary powers was adopted  and over these two years Crimea has covered the distance that  should now be backed up with a legal basis, but it is much more  difficult to go back than to do what should be done from the  very beginning.    As for stopping them, for example, only by the powers  granted  by the people, there are nuances here. It is necessary to act  in compliance with the law. If every one of us starts to  violate the law and act only by the force of  authority...[pauses]. The authority is strong only when it is  legitimate. If it is illegitimate, it can be strong but then it  is not a democratic but a totalitarian authority. If I make  this step, say, toward totalitarianism and act proceeding not  from law but from the position of strength and fear, or  compulsion or pressure, then this will be a return to what we  already learned and what we had already lived through. I cannot  fully agree with the first point, but I agree with the second  part 100 percent.    [Caller] Does the president, as a presidential candidate in  the forthcoming presidential election, have an anticrisis  program.    [Kravchuk] The following should be said here: Ukraine and  its president do have an anticrisis program. What is more, it,  in principle, was also adopted by the Supreme Council. It  consists of three parts. Part one is the anti-inflation program  that was approved. Second, there is the program of concrete  steps, and third the program that was included in the  socioeconomic development plan and the budget. That is to say,  all those documents represent this program.    What is the problem then? The problem is not the absence of  a program but the mechanisms of its' implementation, and this is  where we continuously stumble. We have not yet worked out the  mechanisms that would allow us, let us say, to work effectively.    For example -- here is an example to make it clearer -- the  anti-inflation program that we approved, for instance, is  oriented toward market mechanisms, such as privatization and  demonopolization, i.e. toward the processes that again are in  the program. But if privatization and demonopolization progress  today is poor for various reasons -- which I will not speak  about now -- such as issues of communal and state ownership, and  the laws that have been produced, which is a whole, great topic  for a conversation and I do not want to approach it now -- if  there is no privatization and demonopolization yet, (there can  be no) anti-inflation program. In other words, the program is  ahead of time and is more our wish than our possibilities.    It is not only the programs that are wrong. He who thinks  that we lack a program is mistaken. We have enough programs but  we have not got enough people capable of carrying out a program,  and we are again short of fully developed mechanisms because of  a lack of certain experience in carrying them out at banks,  financial and commercial structures.    Yesterday, for instance, I signed a directive on Ukraine's  holding companies. There is no law determining the principles  that a holding company is based on. After its' finalization in  all structures, we have, for one and a half months, been working  with specialists in order to settle this issue of principle.  After all, holding should become a form of joint stock  organization [aktsionuvannya] and a form of corporatization,  which is the shortest way to market mechanisms and market  structures. So, however one looks at it, it should be started  from scratch.    But even that is not a problem. The problem is that everyone  should want to start, and make quick progress, which,  unfortunately, is what is lacking. The program, however, is  there.    [Caller] [question indistinct]    [Kravchuk] So, tell me what you would have done if you were  me? Well, just what would you have done immediately had you  been elected president tomorrow? What would your first steps in  relation to Russia have been?    [Caller] I would have considered the example of other  states.  I would have considered the conduct of Estonia, for instance,  where the president is a brave man protecting his land. He is  not afraid of this (giant) that Russia is.    [Kravchuk] In this case, one cannot but be afraid -- one  should fear no one. [sentence as heard] One should, however,  act so that tomorrow our children will not go to war. Your  point of view, you see, is this. Apart from Kiev, for example,  there is also -- (I will generalize), the (eastern) part of  Ukraine. All in all, around 9 million Russians live somewhere  there, in the east. So, suppose we should declare today, all of  a sudden, that we want to have nothing in common with Russia  because it is so and so, turn our backs on Russia, if that part  of our body could be described by that word, and go some other  way.    First, what would start in Ukraine itself, is the expression  of various points of view on this. There would then be no need  for anyone to make peace among us as we would fall out among  ourselves, the east with the west, the center, the east, and the  south. So what one should do is to maintain peace. No one is  afraid of Russia, no one wants to be under Russia, and my  position is clear: With Russia, but not under Russia!    [Caller] Yet, it is time now for us to show that we do not  just grovel to someone.    [Kravchuk] This is exactly what we show. But why, for  example, have we now found ourselves in the situation where we  have not got energy carriers or this or that? We have to  compromise and have a flexible policy in order not to lose our  statehood. We would always lose statehood when we would not  compromise, when we would fall out and when we would not take  account of real forces. It was then that we would lose our  state.    We need patience. We have to compromise today in order to  become stronger. Once we are stronger and more powerful, our  voice will grow stronger. Now, however, screaming and having  nothing to support us is somewhat reminiscent, you know, of  screaming by someone who is very weak but saying: I will get  you, I will get you, I will get you! -- yet running the other  way.    Joking aside, the truth is that we cannot take the risk. We  cannot risk our people. We cannot risk our state. We have to  act wisely, calmly and considerately.    I can understand you, caller. I absolutely understand you.  You want our Ukraine to be strong, for its voice to be heard  worldwide. Do I not want this or does anyone else not want this?  You want Ukraine to have prestige. Do I not want this? Maybe,  I want it more than anything else in the world, but, trust me, I  do know the distribution of forces and the situation, and I do  so better than you -- no hard feelings. I do know that if I  take a wrong step today, we will lose everything tomorrow.    [Caller] Well, what about Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev behaving as he pleases in our (Crimea)?    Kravchuk: Never mind. The main thing for us is to hold the  fort and then we will tell him how to behave himself.    [Caller] The people are losing hope. Hopelessness is what is  (frightening).    [Kravchuk] The people should understand -- and you must say  this as well -- that nihilism should not be sown now. (You must  tell them) that every time one is starting to build something,  one should build it and then be independent. But in the  situation where we have not yet built our state and are still  building it, facing everyone at once and, shall we say, showing  force, requires that force to be there.    In general, I am against any force. I am for living in  peace. You can see what the show of force has led to for those  who practiced it. They, up till now, have not been able to make  both ends meet. Take Yugoslavia: Two million of its people are  now living outside that country, have become refugees or are  wandering worldwide. I have recently spoken to Azerbaijani  President Aliyev: 200,000 people are living in tents at that end  of the country, in Iran, Iraq, and so on. We have so far  restrained ourselves. We are not destroying anything. We are  in the process of building. We need patience and flexibility  and we need to compromise -- although you are saying that this  should be ended and so on -- in order to build it. Once we have  built it, then the attitude toward us will change accordingly.  Once we have had enough wisdom to build it, we will be  respected.    Trust me, I have as great a desire as you do. One cannot,  however, have a desire alone if it is not backed by any real  possibilities.    [Caller] I am a correspondent from Radio Liberty's Moscow  bureau. Our first question is on the possibility of the  presidential election now indeed being cancelled by the current  Supreme Council...    [Kravchuk, interrupts in Russian] Well, it is difficult for  me to tell you whether it will or will not be. I have presented  to the Supreme Council a message where, in what seemed to me to  be a well-founded manner, I tried to explain why the election  today -- ahead of settling all legal and other issues at  constitutional level -- would not only be, as it were,  undesirable for Ukraine, but might also become a danger. What  the parliament will decide, I cannot say. The only thing I do  know is that 120 deputies, approximately two weeks ago, backed  this proposal. It is supported by local councils, enterprises'  work-forces, scientists, people. In other words, this question  is such that it should be addressed at parliamentary level and  such a document has been sent to parliament.    [Caller, in Russian] My second question is this: (You know  that) an economic agreement may be signed between Russia and  Crimea. How do you feel about these bilateral ties between  Russia and Crimea?    [Kravchuk, in Russian] Well, as for a trade and economic  agreement, we can say that Ukraine, for example, has its own  trade and economic relations with Tatarstan. We have also  signed an appropriate agreement. That is why I cannot see any  problems if the Crimean autonomous republic were to sign trade  or other relations of an economic nature with other entities.    I hope you understand that it is trade and economic ties  that  we are talking about, provision for which was, on the whole,  made in our documents and decisions, as it were. We are not  talking about the conclusion of any political treaties as an  entity of international law. That Crimea might act as an entity  in international law is not provided for and, let us say, is  today excluded.    [Caller] Here is my question. Since the Supreme Council of  Crimea and its current leadership tend to operate a pro-Moscow  policy rather than a pro-Kiev one, do you think the transition  of Crimea to Russia is a possibility? How does the Russian  leadership feel about this with regard to the international  situation?    [Kravchuk] I will answer your question. The leadership of  Russia is a broad notion, to a certain extent. There are  executive authorities within the leadership of Russia.    [Caller] Yes, I have in mind the top leadership.    [Kravchuk] For example, the president. For example, Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin, President Yeltsin, and others. As  official statements read, they support Ukraine's integrity and  this is stipulated in our treaties and the trilateral agreement.  The inviolability of borders, the integrity and sovereignty of  Ukraine are supported by both the executive authorities in  Russia and other states: The United States of America, France,  Great Britain, and Germany. That is to say, we enjoy full  international support as far as this issue is concerned. This  is the first thing.    Second, it is Russia's representative structures that are  conducting a crafty policy today. I have in mind the Russian  Duma. Well, the Duma's deputies and others arrive and allow  themselves to declare that Crimea is the territory of Russia,  that it was and will belong to Russia, that the fleet belongs to  Russia. The local authorities in Crimea also support such  statements by these people but these are their wishes only.    No international agreements, no other documents or  agreements  between Ukraine and Russia envisage -- on the contrary they  stipulate that Ukraine, as a state, is integral and inviolable.  We will conduct this very policy. However, there is no doubt  that, well, such a trend, such a stand, such a desire on the  part of the people in Crimea does exist. To prevent this we  must do everything possible so that life becomes better both in  Ukraine and in Crimea. Believe me, when it becomes better, these  issues will be relegated to the background.    [Caller] [passage indistinct]    [Kravchuk] Well, it may well be that this, let us say  openly,  is propaganda, because Russia cannot be assessed by what Moscow  and St. Petersburg are like. Let them go deep into Russia and  see for themselves what there is....    [Caller, interrupts] Why take three Russian cities and say  that Russia is better-off.    [Caller] Leonid Makarovych, this is [name indistinct]  calling  you. I am an engineer and work as deputy department head [words  indistinct] Statistics Ministry. I do not think that  privatization in Ukraine fully takes account of the interests of  the Ukrainians proper. The impression is that there are no rich  businessmen and entrepreneurs of Ukrainian nationality. The  state does not take proper care with the participation of  Ukrainians in business. So the question of how many Ukrainians  of Ukrainian origin have businesses is very important.    Leonid Kravchuk mentioned the United States of America as  an example of a country where business circles are represented  by the people of various nationalities. If we approach business  proceeding from ethnic belonging, we will not last long, believe  me, he added.    The caller then referred to American Indians who, in his  opinion, achieved more in the United States than Ukrainians in  Ukraine. He said they concluded a treaty with the occupants, as  he put it, in compliance with which they receive compensation  for the use of their land to the value of $400. He then said  that privatization in Ukraine, if carried out by all kind of  swindlers, may affect the interests of the Ukrainian population.    [Kravchuk] I will take your remarks into account. But I  would like to repeat that one should act in this case proceeding  from the following criterion: If a person is doing something  good to Ukraine, proper conditions should be created for this  person. Because, excuse me for saying this, but there are such  Ukrainians with whom I would not like to communicate and there  are such Russians and Jews with whom I would like to sit and  have a cup of tea. This is a normal phenomenon.    [Koltsov, in Russian] Good afternoon. I am Vladimir Koltsov  of the Moscow-based radio station Yunost [youth] of the  Ostankino Company.    Leonid Makarovich, I have this question: The thing is that  yesterday the Supreme Council did not put the issue on  postponing the early election of the president on the agenda.  What do you intend to do next in this situation?    [Kravchuk] No, it seems that you are not quite precise.  Yesterday the Supreme Council made up the agenda for three days  only. That is to say, it put only organizational issues on the  agenda. Namely, the election of the presidium, then the  formation of the working bodies of the Supreme Council, that is  the election of the chairman, deputy chairmen, and the formation  of the committees. Today they are tackling issues connected  with the setting up of groups and groupings, the time limit, and  so on. That is to say, the Supreme Council did not put on the  agenda the issues other than those dealing with the organization  of the work of the Supreme Council itself. However, it did  enter the issue on postponing the election in the list of issues  to be discussed by the Supreme Council after the organizational  issues are solved.    [Koltsov] But Leonid Makarovich, what do you think, in your  view, will the deputies agree to postponing the presidential  election, as very little time now remains until that date.    [Kravchuk] Well, you see, the issue here, whether little or  much time remains, for instance, the deputies have now divided  into two sections. Some of them are in favor of postponing the  elections of both the president and of local bodies. The  others, say, are in favor of only postponing the presidential  election, but to hold elections, say, to the local bodies.  Whether they agree or not, I understand it thus, that any  issue, no matter whether it is resolved late or early, even if  it is not ready, it must be resolved correctly.    The problem is not the time period. The problem is the  rightness and necessity of the issue. Because, for instance, if  one is faced with such a dilemma -- today something bad has to  be done, it is planned to do something bad, little time remains  to stop this bad thing, and we consciously agree to a bad step,  for instance, being guided only by the idea that there is little  time left. This does not happen. There is political  advisability, need, necessity, importance, and, as one says,  political consequences. That is the main thing. So, I have  presented, one can say, all of the arguments to the Supreme  Council. Their job is to decide, to decide finally, that is to  decide. And all those, who should go to the elections, will  decide.    [Koltsov] Leonid Makarovich, tell me, how do you evaluate  the  future of the further, let us say, dispute between Russia and  Ukraine on the matter of the Black Sea Fleet.    [Kravchuk] We should resolve this issue, as, incidentally,  the day before yesterday or thereabouts, I dispatched a letter  to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, about us, well, on the  whole, embarking on a continuation of these talks at a higher,  if one can express it thus, level of representation, about us  instructing our governments, or at the level of deputy prime  ministers or prime ministers, to sit down and make specific  proposals, and sign them, not passing them over to other  authorities. Because when we assemble there, for instance, with  the president, with the government, we resolve issues. Then we  hand them over to authorities, ministries, departments. They  begin to go the rounds and to wreck, as one says, these issues  right there. Therefore, they should be resolved at a  substantial level and submitted for signature, fundamentally--it  seems to me--elaborated and coordinated. Now the goodwill and  understanding of the interests of both Ukraine and Russia are  needed.    [Unidentified caller] Tell me please, might one call your  decision to stand in the presidential election on 26 June a  final one?    [Kravchuk] Well, you see, I want the Supreme Council to  examine my appeal and to decide on it. If the Supreme Council  postpones the election, then naturally I will withdraw my  candidacy from the voting. If the Supreme Council leaves the  decision of the old Supreme Council in force, that is, it does  not postpone or stop the election, that means that I will take  part in the election like all the others.    [Caller] If the election nevertheless, takes place, who of  the other contenders for the post of president do you consider  to be your main competitor?    [Kravchuk] Well, it is difficult to say now. You see, the  situation is changing. Clearly the main ones, I think, the most  credible contenders, who have already made themselves known,  whom Ukraine knows about and who have the right image, are Ivan  Plyushch and Leonid Kuchma. For instance, I know that certain  circles, certain structures and certain people have a favorable  attitude to the young contenders too, in particular to Valeriy  Babych and Volodymyr Lanovyy. I think that Oleksandr Moroz too,  has some possibilities for taking an active part in the  election, and so do others, that is Petro Talanchuk. That is, I  would not want to belittle anyone now or to single anyone out.  Everyone has a chance. But the voting will show who has made  use of it.    [Prytula] Leonid Makarovych, this is Volodymyr Prytula, a  journalist from the Crimea. Leonid Makarovych, at a news  conference today Serhiy Tsekov, chairman of Crimea's Supreme  Council, spoke in favor of Crimea forming its own National  Guard. What is your attitude to this, and in general what  measures will you take regarding this?    [Kravchuk] The Crimea is not a state; the Crimea is an  autonomous republic, and according to Ukraine's legislation, the  formation of its own armed forces or a guard or something else  is not envisaged by the Crimea.    [Prytula] [passage indistinct]    [Kravchuk] No one in the Crimea will accept it, because it  is  not a subject of international law.    [Starozhytska] This is Mariya Starozhytska from the  television news agency "Vikna" [Windows]. Yevgeniy Saburov and  Aleksandr Shokhin are to sign an accord in the Crimea tomorrow  [14 May] on cooperation between the Crimea and Russia. What is  your attitude to this as president of Ukraine?    [Kravchuk] Well, this needs to be formulated more precisely.  They are to sign an agreement on trade and economic cooperation.  We have also signed, Ukraine has signed corresponding  agreements on economic and trade cooperation between, for  instance, Ukraine and Tatarstan. And, let us say, Russia did  not become warm nor cold because of this, and we could work  normally with Tatarstan. We also sign corresponding trade and  economic agreements with other regions of Russia. And there is  no problem, for instance, when precisely a trade and economic  agreement between the Crimea and Russia is concluded, but this  is not, as you say, on cooperation, partnership, or something  else. This is not a political--not a document with the nature  of a treaty--this an agreement on trade, on economic relations.  This is envisaged. There is no problem with this. But if, for  instance, it had been about a treaty between two states, if, for  instance, Russia had signed some kind of interstate document  with the Crimea, or military-political, or some other kind of  document--this is impossible now, because the Crimea is not a  subject of international law. The Crimea is an autonomy within  the composition of Ukraine. But it can have economic relations  with any state.    [Bodenchuk] Here is a question sent in by representatives of  the U.S. magazine EASTERN ECONOMIST: The United States and other  Western states conditioned the allocation of a certain financial  aid to Ukraine by the implementation of economic reform. New  economic programs should be drafted and submitted toward that  end. If they are being drafted, who is engaged in this process?  When and how can one expect that the implementation of this  reform will get under way?    Answering this question Leonid Kravchuk said that such  programs, although they are not perfect, do exist. He also said  that an expert group of the International Monetary Fund is  expected to arrive in Ukraine soon to complete the elaboration  of Ukraine's program that may be backed up financially. The  problem of setting up a stabilization fund may also be solved.    [Kravchuk] That is to say, after this visit we will be able  to say definitely to what extent this program complies with the  norms adopted by these international financial structures, if it  is approved and adopted. This will mean that the green light  will be given to investments, [word indistinct], Western  economic aid, including [words indistinct]. However, at this  point one should know the difference: These $700 million  earmarked by the United States for Ukraine--$350 million for  military and nuclear issues and $350 million in economic  aid--are not directly linked with economic reform. Nobody means  to say that this money will not be allocated if economic reform  makes no progress. This is an absolutely different thing. The  talk is about the large-scale, let us say, movement of capitals  both along state lines, along commercial lines, along lines of  private investments, and so on. True, this movement of capitals  is directly linked with the progress of economic reform.    Well, it is worthwhile mentioning that, although with  difficulty, but one can say definitely that this movement, as  they say, is already carried out. Both the privatization  program...[pauses] You, probably, write and read and see this  yourself. They already mention specific numbers of enterprises  that are being privatized. Preparations are under way for the  introduction of our own currency unit the hryvna. Serious  restructuring processes are taking place in the banking, credit,  and financial structure. There is some stabilization today. We  have sharply reduced inflation rate. They say this is so  because money is not available. But one should not just receive  money, one should earn it.    That is to say, the statements to the effect that the reform  in Ukraine is at a standstill, although they have already been  driven into people's heads, they do not correspond to reality in  full measure. The reform is moving forward today. True, it is  moving forward with difficulty. True, it is moving forward in a  complicated manner. It is moving forward slowly, this is also  true. But one should take into account our specific features.    [Bodenchuk, in Russian] Here is a telegram from Volonovakha,  Donetsk Oblast: In order to coordinate further work for your  support, please inform us urgently of a time for an appointment  in Kiev so that we can leave immediately--the independent youth  of the rural areas.    [Kravchuk] That is interesting, Ukraine's youth for the  president. That is interesting. We should invite someone from  the group to contact us. Well, why should they all have to come  to Kiev. Perhaps I could go to them.    [Bodenchuk] Here is a telegram from Kobelyaki in Poltava  Oblast: There is nowhere to retreat to. More political will is  needed. We wish you success most sincerely. Ukraine is with  you. Mykola Androfiv, Kobelyaki.    [Kravchuk] Great. Thank you Mykola Androfiv from Kobelyaki--  that is in Poltava Oblast is it not? Truly for us to retreat,  it is not so much that there is nowhere to which to retreat, but  it is impossible. Even if there were somewhere to retreat to,  it would be impossible, because I tell everyone, and I have to  say it here, you know, this is a chance that history has given  to us to survive. And I say that there all possibilities for  doing this, all possibilities.    There was a time, in November-December of last year for  instance, when inflation reached 80 percent each month,  incidentally this is what the previous government did, we had  these consequences. I really thought that the economy would  collapse if we did not get any help, there was this nuclear  pressure, all channels were closed, we were being deprived, one  by one they were reporting that credits were being suspended,  and so on. This was terribly difficult, terribly difficult.  But, now that we have gone down this road, the attitude toward  us has changed. We have acquired some sort of experience.    Well, we were the first of the CIS countries, if we are to  take the sea as an example, to feel the sand at the bottom of  the sea. We were the first. We were the first to touch the sand  because we were the first to endure the blow of prices for  energy-carriers. We were the first to have, say, the fiercest  economic sanctions applied against us, perhaps not sanctions,  but economic levers, let us say. We have endured this. These  prices increased by tens of thousands of times. There was  nowhere to turn. We were at the bottom. This was sand. To go  lower would just mean to dig ourselves into the sand, or  possibly submerge ourselves in it. This means, that we can now  go, and we are beginning to go along the sand, for now very  slowly, but not downward now.    Perhaps we are even going up. For instance, [words  indistinct] has increased by 12 percent compared to the  corresponding period. There is the expectation and hope now  that we can survive economically. If we can survive  economically, then we will survive from the state, political,  and spiritual aspect without fail. Those countries, who have  not reached the sand, are currently experiencing greater blows.  I am thinking of the Central Statistics Directorate, the press,  contacts, for instance, with the Asian republics. They are  still sinking for the moment.    Therefore, there is a chance--not just for us, but for  everyone. If we are going to talk to one another about helping  each other within the CIS framework, and not set some kind of  ambitions or political aims, then we can survive and live in  friendship and partnership with all countries and peoples.  Naturally the will is needed, the strength is needed, support  is needed. People have also understood much over this time.    When some part, say, of the political forces and their  leaders, are widely shouting that again Ukraine will not  survive, that it can survive only under Russia. Some say with  Russia, but in fact it means only under Russia, because you know  if we do not have our own banks, our own armed forces, our own  currency, what kind of equality is this? We should just put  this out of our mind and have done with it, because why deceive  the people. They should say that we cannot live otherwise--we  need someone above us--and they could just go their own way.  Whoever wants to can go in that direction, whoever does not  want to- well, that is the way it is. Naturally, each person  will work it out. But there is no need to deceive the people  because independence is independence. It cannot be that there  is independence in just one thing--for instance, independence to  go out onto the street in the evening. [passage indistinct] We  can and will go out. But I would like everyone to understand  this. I wish you all the best.</p>

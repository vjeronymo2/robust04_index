			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Since the famous seclusion of the most famous  recluse in history [reference to 'Ali Salim al-Bid's withdrawal  from Sanaa to Aden in August, 1993], our country has gone  through the worst crisis in its history. All nationalist forces  in the Yemeni arena, above all the General People's Congress  [GPC], have explored every avenues to resolve the crisis.  Toward that end, and in the interest of the country's unity,  the GPC offered a series of concessions. In contrast, the other  side has given its party's interests precedence over all other  interests.    However, the good faith inherent in these concessions was  not  enough to reassure the spiteful gang in the Yemeni Socialist  Party as to its standing in a united, democratic, and  pluralistic society. This is because, by virtue of its black  and bloody history and its awareness of the manner in which the  people regard the crimes it has committed against the country's  worthy and struggler sons, it knew that it was bound to lose out  and that the relapse into disunity was the only way for it to  return to the iron-fisted rule that had ended with the  proclamation of the blessed unity on 22 May, 1990.    We had thought, along with all the worthy unionists on this  good land, that 27 April -- the day of democracy -- would put a  definitive end to the claims and absurd conditions that the  separatist elements within the Socialist Party used to buy time  before the right circumstances arrived for putting their  secessionist blueprint into practice.    The 27 April democracy introduced a new climate symbolizing  a  victory of the popular option of constitutional legitimacy.  However, seeing that this new climate would frustrate their  criminal scheme, the officials holding sway in the Socialist  Party tried to think up new pretexts in a desparate attempt to  create other conditions, at odds with constitutional legitimacy  but suiting their separatist bent.    Using its extortionist and exploitative approach to the  pro-unity forces, the party extracted a fresh string of  concessions that had no basis in legitimacy. When the  secessionist gang found its plan had no chance other than  through war, it sparked off hostilities without the least regard  for national interests.    At this critical moment in our history, the question arises  as to whether this gang within the party will achieve its  secession through the war it ignited. If the military situation  as it stands is any guide, then unity is here to say. The  Republic of Yemen's Armed Forces, with all its corps, are  standing shoulder to shoulder, poised to defend the gains most  cherished by the people. The coming few days will unmask the  ugly face of the gang of apostacy and secession, which is now  harvesting all the distress it has sown in our benevolent land.  Death to them, life to the homeland and unity.</p>

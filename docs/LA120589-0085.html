			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MENCKEN WAS PRO-NAZI, HIS DIARY SHOWS  </P> <P> The previously secret diary of writer and social critic H. L. Mencken discloses  virulent anti-Semitism, racism and pro-Nazi leanings, shocking even the  sympathetic Mencken scholar who edited it.  </P> <P> On Mencken's instructions, the diary, typewritten on 2,100 pages from 1930 to  1948, remained sealed for 25 years after his death in 1956. The Baltimore  Evening Sun, where Mencken once worked, published excerpts Monday. The diary  has been available to scholars since 1981, but quoting either directly or  indirectly from the 2,100-page document was prohibited.  </P> <P> On the subject of Jews, Mencken wrote in December, 1943, that the Maryland Club  had decided against admitting any more Jewish members after the only one on its  rolls died. "There is no other Jew in Baltimore who seems suitable," he said.  </P> <P> Of blacks, he wrote in September, 1943, that " . . . it is impossible to talk  anything resembling discretion or judgment to a colored woman. They are all  essentially child-like, and even hard experience does not teach them anything."  </P> <P> On Oct. 24, 1945, he wrote that "the course of the United States in World War  II . . . was dishonest, dishonorable and ignominious, and the Sunpapers, in  supporting (President Franklin D.) Roosevelt's foreign policy, shared in this  disgrace."  </P> <P> The book, "The Diary of H. L. Mencken," was edited by Mencken scholar Charles  A. Fecher of Baltimore and published by Alfred A. Knopf. It was scheduled for  January release but is already available in many bookstores.  </P> <P> The delay in publishing the diary stemmed from legal questions over whether  Mencken intended it to be published, as well as concern over the extremely  unflattering statements in it.  </P> <P> Mencken is revered by many writers and journalists for his erudite writing and  often brilliant social and political criticism. The National Press Club in  Washington has a library named in his honor and the Baltimore Sun bestows an  annual writing award named for him.  </P> <P> He spent 40 years at the Evening Sun, edited the Smart Set and the American  Mercury magazines and wrote dozens of books.  </P> <P> "His feelings about World War II are incredible in a man of his intelligence,  knowledge and perception," Fecher wrote in his introduction to the book. "He  seems to have had no conception at all of what a German-Japanese victory would  have meant to the civilized world, or to the liberties that he himself so  cherished."  </P> <P> Mencken's attitude toward blacks "was a curious mingling of total  egalitarianism . . . and patronizing superiority," Fecher wrote.  </P> <P> Mencken regularly published black writers in American Mercury and persuaded his  publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, to publish their books. The last article he wrote  for the Evening Sun in 1948 attacked segregation laws in Baltimore.  </P> <P> But the diary discloses Mencken's "deeply ingrained conviction that black  people were by their very nature inferior to white," Fecher wrote.  </P></p>

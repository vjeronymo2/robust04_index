			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA OKS INTERIM CITY ADMINISTRATOR  </P> <P> Seeking to waste no time putting city government on a different course, the  Pomona City Council's new majority has selected an interim city administrator  after one 20-minute interview.  </P> <P> Andrew Lazzaretto Jr., former city administrator of Burbank, was appointed by  the council in a 3-1 vote in closed session last week. The vote split along the  same lines as the council's May 1 decision to fire City Administrator A. J.  Wilson.  </P> <P> Council members C. L. (Clay) Bryant, Nell Soto and Tomas Ursua formed the  majority, while Mayor Donna Smith was the lone dissenter. Councilman Mark  Nymeyer was absent from both votes.  </P> <P> The council arranged to have Lazzaretto interview for the job after Soto  suggested him during a discussion at the council meeting.  </P> <P> Under an agreement tentatively worked out with the council, Lazzaretto will  receive $7,000 a month to work at least four hours a day, five days a week,  plus council meetings.  </P></p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Funds pressed on asset strategies UK pension funds should broaden investment strategies away from equities to reflect their rapidly increasing maturity, speakers told the Eastbourne investment conference of the National Association of Pension Funds yesterday. But Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, a member of the Goode Committee on pension law reform, denied that any shift towards fixed-interest bonds and other less risky assets should be blamed on his committee's recommendation of a minimum solvency standard. 'It is the age of the scheme that dictates asset allocation and not the minimum solvency standard,' said Mr Ross Goobey, who is the chief executive of PosTel, the manager of the British Telecom and Post Office pension funds. He said it was contradictory that consulting actuaries who were warning of the impact of a solvency standard were also attempting to persuade clients to pay for asset-liability studies which would highlight the need to invest in less volatile assets. A consultant, Ms Meredith Brooks, of Frank Russell, said too few pension schemes were taking sufficient notice of changes in their liability structure. 'In my experience, a lot of pension fund trustees are quite intimidated by fund managers,' she said. Mr Terry Webb, a former IBM pension fund manager now with RGB International, said that, so far, the asset-liability studies undertaken by UK pension schemes had seldom resulted in a substantial modification to the investment policies.</p>

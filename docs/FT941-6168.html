			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Indonesia surplus up 29.5% to Dollars 8.6bn Indonesia's trade surplus rose by 29.5 per cent to Dollars 8.66bn (Pounds 5.8bn) in 1993 from Dollars 6.69bn a year earlier, the trade ministry said, Reuter reports from Jakarta. Total exports for 1993 rose 8.4 per cent to Dollars 36.82bn from Dollars 33.97bn in 1992. Imports rose to 28.16bn from Dollars 27.28bn. Non-oil exports increased by 16.2 per cent to Dollars 27.07bn from Dollars 23.3bn. Indonesia's trade surplus fell in December 1993 to Dollars 548.8m from Dollars 908m in November. Economic analysts said that Indonesia was reaping the benefit of a shift towards higher investment in manufacturing since oil prices had fallen in 1986. In spite of the good trade performance, there were a few trouble spots, such as falling foreign investment, which the government was trying to rectify, they added. Information Minister Harmoko disclosed yesterday that Indonesia's consumer price index rose 1.76 per cent in February. This brought the rise in inflation to 3.01 per cent for the first two months of 1994. The government, which predicted inflation for the 1994/95 fiscal year at 5 per cent, forecast the rate for the current year at 4-6 per cent.</p>

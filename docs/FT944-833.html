			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Force of destiny When Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia won the general election in March, many Italians believed he represented the best chance of resolving the country's economic and political difficulties. That hope has crumbled into dismay. Far from providing solutions, Mr Berlusconi has become one of the chief problems. By announcing his resignation as prime minister yesterday, but suggesting that he should stay on pending new elections, Mr Berlusconi is compounding Italy's uncertainties. Forza Italia's partners, the Northern League and the neo-fascists, shoulder some of the responsibility, but most of the blame for his coalition's failure falls on Mr Berlusconi. He has shown insufficient energy to tackle Italy's debt and deficit crisis. He has become entangled in the corruption investigations which brought down the previous political establishment. And he has proved unable to put distance between himself and his media interests, now linked still more closely to his own political future. Earlier this month, Mr Berlusconi's ownership of three commercial TV channels was judged unconstitutional. His chances of resolving this issue to his own satisfaction may depend directly on his ability to remain in power. The state broadcasting organisation can be added to the string of Berlusconi supporters in the media. So he would have considerable scope to gather a strong sympathy vote in a short and probably vitriolic campaign targeting, in particular, the Northern League. Another election less than a year after the previous one would, however, resolve next to nothing. If it was conducted under the present unsatisfactory mix of proportional representation and majority voting, neither the parliamentary line-up nor the dilemma of how to form a cohesive government would be substantially changed. Yet external circumstances, determined partly by the international financial markets, would be even more trying than in March. Italy's immediate political destiny depends on President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who can dissolve parliament, as Mr Berlusconi wants, or entrust another leader with the prime ministership. Since the first option would lead to a dead end, the right course would be to seek a broad-based government drawing its legitimacy from the parties voted into parliament last March, including some representatives of Forza Italia. An interim government of an institutional character similar to that of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in 1993-94 would need a specific mandate geared to restructuring social security financing, clearing up the muddle over broadcasting control, and bringing in a new electoral law. This would be, at best, a breathing space. But it would give Italy a glimmer of an opportunity to tackle problems that Mr Berlusconi has done so much to highlight and so little to resolve.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Armenian forces attack ex-Soviet military base DOZENS of heavily armed Armenian militants surrounded a former Soviet anti-aircraft missile base inside Armenia yesterday, killing two soldiers of the Commonwealth of Independent States and taking the commander hostage, Reuter reports from Moscow. About 60 Armenians, who launched the attack on Sunday night at Artik, near the Turkish border, were demanding the handover of heavy weapons for their war against Azerbaijan, according to the CIS military command. The two former Soviet republics are fighting for control of Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian-dominated enclave within Azerbaijan. Both sides have reported death tolls in the hundreds in the past two weeks. More than 1,500 have died in four years of warfare. Howitzers and tank guns boomed across the disputed enclave yesterday, drowning out talk of peace between the two sides. Elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, violence continued in the month-long civil war in Georgia. An explosion in the town of Zugdidi, in the west of the republic , killed three policemen and injured several others. In the republic of Moldova yesterday, peace talks were due to start after a week of clashes between ethnic Russians and majority Romanian speakers in which at least 10 people have been killed. John Lloyd, in Baku, Azerbaijan, adds: Nationalist leaders in Azerbaijan yesterday stepped up the pressure on the interim government of the republic to dissolve parliament and to form a coalition government with a strong contingent of nationalists and former opposition figures. The aim of such a coalition would be to pursue a more active prosecution of the conflict in Nagorno Karabakh - to hit back at the Armenian forces after a string of reverses. Mr Niazi Ibragimov, deputy chairman of the Azerbaijani Popular Front - the focus for opposition nationalist forces - called for the dissolution of parliament and the passing of more power to the 50-strong National Council. The council is equally balanced between oppositionists and former communists whose orientation is now uncertain in the wake of the resignation last week of President Ayaz Mutalibov, a former leader of the Azerbaijani communist party. Kazakhstan told Nato yesterday it would not attend the meeting of the Co-operation Council that will draw former Soviet republics into an east-west forum on security, Reuter reports from Brussels. The republic said it was unable to attend 'for practical reasons'. Kazakhstan has already failed to turn up to other meetings at Nato to discuss arms control.</p>

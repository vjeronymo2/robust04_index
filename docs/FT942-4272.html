			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: British Land net assets surge 46% to 423p British Land, the property company headed by Mr John Ritblat, yesterday announced a 46 per cent rise in its net asset value to 423p a share in the year ended March 31. Gross assets increased by 38 per cent to Pounds 2.6bn. At the pre-tax level, profits surged from Pounds 27.2m to Pounds 53.9m. Mr Ritblat said British Land was 'exceptionally well placed'. 'We will continue to target opportunities for acquisitions, whether direct or corporate, with unabated effort,' he said. He added, however, that he was reluctant to make an acquisition of a quoted company because 'in our experience you only buy trouble'. British Land has bought Pounds 1.6bn of property since 1989. In the past year, the company has invested Pounds 615m in buying 200 properties. Property sales during the year raised Pounds 50m. The British Land partnership with Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund, has invested over Pounds 530m in the property market in the past year. British Land's debt to equity ratio was reduced from 106 per cent to 61 per cent. During the year, the company raised Pounds 665m in permanent capital or long-term debt. The current yield on the portfolio is 7.05 per cent. The uplift in the underlying value of the property was 21 per cent, a rise of Pounds 385m. The best performing property types were retail distribution centres, which rose by 42.8 per cent. Superstores and supermarkets rose by 32.5 per cent in value, shopping centres by 28.3 per cent and other retail properties by 30.3 per cent. City of London offices rose by 12.9 per cent, while the average improvement for UK offices was 13.9 per cent. The overseas portfolio, which is 7 per cent of the total, rose by 1 per cent. Earnings per share rose by 36 per cent to 11.7p (8.6p). A recommended final dividend of 5.08p makes a 7.53p (7p) total. COMMENT British Land has emerged as perhaps the shrewdest of all the large quoted companies to operate in the UK market in recent years. Shareholders have been well rewarded by its heavy buying programme during the downturn, its higher-than-average gearing and its adroit management of its debt. Moreover, the company is likely to benefit from its shift in emphasis away from London offices towards the retail sector that it has engineered over the past five years. For all that, the property market has cooled since March and it will be hard to pull off another bumper performance this year. Forecasts of this year's net asset value range between 460p to 500p, while pre-tax profits are likely to rise to Pounds 65m-70m. The shares, which rose yesterday by 5p to 389p, look good value assuming a discount to net assets of around 20 per cent.</p>

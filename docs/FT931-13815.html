			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Rivalries seen as bar to foreigners on Borse board PROVINCIALISM and regional rivalries are to blame for the exclusion of foreign banks from the supervisory board of the Deutsche Borse - the new centralised stock exchange for Germany - the head of the organisation representing foreign banks in Germany complained yesterday. The Deutsche Borse came into being at the beginning of the year as a holding structure uniting Germany's eight stock-exchanges - together with the Deutsche Termin Borse (DTB) derivatives market and the Kassenverein settlement agency - for the first time. The move represented a compromise between Frankfurt - overwhelmingly the largest stock exchange in Germany - and the smaller markets which had traditionally resisted centralisation out of fear of Frankfurt's dominance. The creation of the Deutsche Borse suggested that traditional rivalries had been buried. However, Mr Hans-Georg Engel, vice-president of J. P. Morgan in Germany and head of the Verband der Auslandsbanken in Deutschland, said yesterday that provincial rivalries had seen to it that no foreign bank had been represented on the new organisation's board, contrary to commitments when the plans for a centralised exchange were being drawn up. He argued that foreign banks deserved to be represented on three grounds: because they own 10 per cent of the Deutsch Borse holding company; because they conduct about 10 per cent of the business on German stock exchanges, and because in terms of member-firms they represent over half the institutions trading on the German securities markets, 'Pure political factors' had determined that regional banks had got four seats on the supervisory board, despite the fact that the regional stock exchanges own only 10 per cent of the Deutsche Borse holding company - the same as the foreign institutions. He said he hoped that foreign banks would gain representation later this year; the Deutsche Borse said that it also wanted foreign banks to be represented.</p>

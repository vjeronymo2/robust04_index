			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Haiti: US troops land in full strength The first US troops landed in Haiti yesterday in an operation that closely resembled the invasion they had planned to carry out just hours earlier. 'The most important differences are that we are not having to make a forced entry, we will not have to do it in the middle of the night, and we will not have to use our paratrooping forces to do it,' said Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, in a briefing just after the invasion was called off. The original plan called for six paratroop battalions from the 82nd Airborne division to attack the Port-au-Prince airport, while Army and special forces landed by helicopter to secure the southern half of the capital. At the same time, a force of more than 1,500 Marines planned an amphibious landing on Haiti's north coast, taking over Cap Haitien and other towns. Instead of a parachute landing, troops from the 10th Mountain division landed by helicopter at Port-au-Prince airport. Around 3,000 US troops were expected to be in Haiti by the end of yesterday, with the number rising to around 15,000 by the end of the week. 'We have, of course, the assurance of the Haitian government, but we do not believe we should have our troops depend just on that assurance, and so therefore they're going to go in in strength and fully armed,' Mr Perry said. In all, the US has had around 15,000 troops stationed off the coast of Haiti in a fourteen ship fleet, including the aircraft carriers Eisenhower and America and the amphibious command ship Mount Whitney. Vessels from Argentina and Canada have also been in position off Haiti. Around 2,000 troops and personnel from as many as 24 other countries are due to join the US-led task force. Countries contributing to the force include Caribbean nations such as the Bahamas, Barbados and Jamaica, Latin American and European detachments and large contingents from India and Bangladesh.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has proposed  signing a friendship treaty with China, North Korea's staunchest  ally, during policy planning talks in Beijing, Foreign Ministry  officials said Thursday.    Yi Chang-chun, assistant minister for policy planning,  suggested that the two countries sign a friendship pact to lay a  firmer groundwork for bilateral relations, officials said.    Yi is in Beijing for the second South Korea-China Policy  Planning Consultations.    Seoul had cautiously suggested a "Beijing declaration" to  showcase their budding relations when the two sides normalized  ties in August 1992, but the idea died out.    Yi and his Chinese counterpart Pei Yuan Ying discussed joint  participation in regional security talks including the Asean  Regional Forum (ARF), the officials said.</p>

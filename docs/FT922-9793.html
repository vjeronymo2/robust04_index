			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ptarmigan shares resume trading Shares in Ptarmigan Holdings, the hotels and food distribution group, began trading again yesterday as the company announced its results for the year to June 30 1991 and for the first half of the current year. The shares were suspended on January 31 this year as negotiations on a substantial acquisition reached an advanced stage. It proved impossible to complete these negotiations and talks have ceased. The group is now in talks with other parties. Ptarmigan reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 719,567 in the 1991 year, against Pounds 11,636 previously. Turnover fell slightly from Pounds 4.94m to Pounds 4.52m. But in the six months ended December 31 1991, the loss had been reduced to Pounds 104,000 on sales of Pounds 2.14m. Mr Philip Wilbraham, chairman, said the year had again proved difficult for the group, particularly in the hotel sector. The company incurred considerable cost as talks related to withdrawal from the hotels sector failed. This had an unsettling effect on the staff, the chairman said, but changes had since taken place to remotivate them. The loss-making fish hatchery business had been closed during the year but the remaining businesses had been profitable, Mr Wilbraham added.</p>

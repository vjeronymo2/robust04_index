			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MALAYSIA'S KING HOLDS A SOMETIME JOB AND DOESN'T EVEN GET A CROWN  </P> <P> This is a land where the kings take turns and have no coronations because they  wear no crowns.  </P> <P> But when the latest in the monarchal rotation kisses a wavy-bladed dagger April  26, he will become the Yang di-Pertuan Agung -- the one who is chief among the  most prominent.  </P> <P> The ninth agung since the country's independence from Britain in 1957, he will  keep his throne until 1994, then turn it over to an elected successor. Neither  the public nor Parliament has a vote. That privilege is limited to the heads of  Malaysia's nine royal houses.  </P> <P> One of them is chosen by secret ballot of his fellow monarchs for a five-year  reign as king of kings for this Southeast Asian federation of 17 million. When  his term is up, he returns to his home state, where his throne has been kept  warm in his absence by his eldest son.  </P> <P> Nine of Malaysia's 13 states have hereditary rulers. The others have to make do  with a governor, named by the agung acting on the advice of the prime minister.  </P> <P> The new agung is Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah, 60, the sultan of Perak, who was  elected March 2. He is a lawyer and career civil servant who was lord president  of the Supreme Court in 1982-84. He left the judiciary to succeed his late  father in 1985 as head of the Perak royal household.  </P> <P> Although not as wealthy as most of the other rulers, Sultan Azlan is widely  regarded as the best educated. He attended the then-prestigious Government  English School, where the sons of royal and well-to-do Malays were groomed for  government service in colonial days. From there he went to the University of  Nottingham and Lincoln's Inn, both in Britain, and was called to the English  bar in 1954.  </P> <P> The rotating throne solved a sticky protocol problem when Malaysia, then known  as Malaya, shed its colonial ties with Britain in 1957. Because none of the  state rulers would have been accepted by the rest as permanent head of state,  then-Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman devised the unusual system of giving  every state with a ruler a turn on the throne.  </P> <P> Years later in retirement, the Tunku, himself a prince of the royal house of  Kedah, said the agung was vested "with all the powers such as those given to  sovereigns of Great Britain and other democratic monarchies of the world. . . .  As symbolic head of state, the agung never interferes with the actual running  of the government."  </P> <P> Political power rests in a British-style national Parliament and state  legislatures, which are elected every five years.  </P> <P> In eight years in office, the current prime minister, Mahathir Mohammed, has  had uneven relations with the royal houses. His government tried in 1983 to  abolish the king's veto over legislation.  </P> <P> The rulers resisted, and Mahathir took his case to the country with a series of  public rallies. A compromise was reached in which Mahathir agreed that the  agung could delay legislation and send it back to Parliament for review, but if  it passed again, it would become law.  </P> <P> Seven states call their hereditary rulers sultans. Perlis makes do with a  rajah, and Negri Sembilan refers to its ruler as Yang di-Pertuan Besar, one who  is chief of state.  </P> <P> The state rulers provide a continuing focus for Malay identity in a country in  which Malays account for about half the population, which also includes sizable  Chinese and Indian minorities. Sultans function as important arbiters of Malay  custom and religion.  </P> <P> Some royals are criticized for their love of big cars, large palaces, frequent  trips abroad and aloofness toward their subjects. They are paid the equivalent  of about $23,440 a month. But most nurture their subjects, fulfilling the role  of benevolent leader.  </P> <P> Only the nine-member Council of Rulers can oust an agung, by majority vote.  Agungs are bound by the constitution "to act at all times on the advice of the  Cabinet."  </P> <P> An agung can be reelected for a second consecutive term, but none has been.  There is a tacit agreement among the rulers that once an agung's term is  completed, he returns to his state palace to give someone else a turn.  </P> <P> A deputy king, or timbalan agung, also is selected, which has proved a prudent  thing to do because three of the eight previous agungs died in office.  </P></p>

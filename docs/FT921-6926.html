			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Merrill Lynch president to become chief executive MR Daniel Tully moved a step nearer to taking over the helm at the biggest securities house in the US yesterday when Merrill Lynch announced he will take over the additional post of chief executive in May. The announcement did not surprise Wall Street as in recent years Mr Tully, currently president and chief operating officer, has played an increasingly important role in the running of Merrill. The post of chief executive is filled now by Mr William Schreyer, Merrill chairman, who has held the post since 1985 but who plans to retire in June 1993. Although Merrill will not confirm it officially, yesterday's decision makes it almost certain that Mr Tully will succeed Mr Schreyer as chairman. The two have effectively run Merrill for the past 10 years, and have earned equal amounts of criticism (for letting costs run wild and profitability deteriorate during the 1980s) and praise (for cutting costs and improving profitability in the past three years) during their stint at the top. Both Mr Schreyer, 64, and Mr Tully, 60, joined Merrill in the early part of their careers. Mr Tully has been credited with helping the firm build up its asset management business to such an extent that it now manages Dollars 435bn of client assets.</p>

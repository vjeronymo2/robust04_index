			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Sea change in UK defence: The planned link between BAe and VSEL The contrast between jet fighters which roar through the stratosphere at twice the speed of sound and nuclear submarines which creep silently through the ocean depths could hardly be more extreme. But that is the breadth of businesses British Aerospace is aiming to span if it can bring to a successful conclusion the current negotiations to buy the Barrow-based submarine maker VSEL. The two companies are locked in private discussions about the price at which a friendly takeover might take place. However, the fact that talks are taking place at all is another demonstration of the way in which the cut in global defence spending is forcing companies to consider mergers and alliances that would have been inconceivable five years ago. The catalyst for a deal between the two companies is a battle over the contract for the next batch of nuclear hunter-killer submarines for the Royal Navy. In 18 months the ministry of defence will award a contract for up to five Trafalgar class submarines, worth around Pounds 2.5bn. The contract will not go to VSEL on the nod, as it has done with previous orders. Thus far, the government has viewed nuclear submarines as a secret and vital technology that cannot be fully subject to the competitive purchasing reforms which have brought efficiency gains to other parts of the arms procurement programme. Now the cold war is over, the MoD has the confidence to demand a fixed-price bid to build the new submarines from a risk-taking prime contractor who will bear the losses if the programme runs over budget. VSEL badly needs the order. Submarines are its main business, and if the next batch of Trafalgars goes elsewhere, the company will have little work for its vast covered Devonshire Dock Hall in Barrow. Yet VSEL is a small company, and has found it hard to persuade the MoD that it can take the risks involved on such a large contract. To bolster its chances, the company has husbanded the Pounds 250m of cash which it has made from the Trident nuclear missile submarines over the past decade. It has also formed an alliance with the US electronics company Loral, which would provide the submarine's complex electronics, and the skills in integrating them into the boat. However, the decline in UK defence spending means that other predators are after the Trafalgar prize. Both GEC and BAe want to bid, and both have advantages. GEC owns the Yarrow shipyard on the Clyde where some of the Trafalgar work could be done. It also has enormous cash resources to back any bid, and is keen to expand further into prime contracting rather than merely supply components and sub-assemblies to BAe. BAe has no such reserves, but does have more experience than any other British company in managing large defence contracts. Bringing the millions of electronic components together and wiring them into a submarine hull - rather like making a ship in bottle - offers similar technical and managerial challenges to those of making advanced fighters. BAe is also keen to expand from being the prime contractor for aircraft to being the dominant defence contractor. It is already involved in the Horizon programme to produce the new generation of frigate, and its joint venture, BAeSema makes ship and submarine command and control systems. With two giants fighting over the shrinking procurement budget, VSEL is in danger of being squeezed out. It had considered a alliance with DML, the company which operates the Devonport dockyard in Plymouth. DML's work in refitting nuclear submarines is similar to the construction of the boats at Barrow, and there are many overlaps in the work. In the event, VSEL seems to have opted for the friendly embrace of one of the giants. Becoming part of BAe would give it the credibility it needs to become a prime contractor, while furthering BAe's ambitions in naval engineering. Such a deal would be financially advantageous for BAe: buying VSEL with shares would strengthen its balance sheet, while VSEL's large cash pile would cut BAe's debt substantially. GEC could yet frustrate BAe's plans by counter-bidding for VSEL. It could offer hard cash from its Pounds 2.9bn reserve which might well be more attractive than BAe's shares to VSEL's shareholders. However, GEC has looked at the submarine maker and decided not to bid, saying that it could win the Trafalgar contract without owning VSEL. The BAe approach alters the balance of power, and GEC may reconsider. However, the MoD might then raise objections, unhappy that a single company owns two of the remaining shipyards in the UK. If BAe wins, it could use the cash in VSEL's balance sheet to back bids for other contracts, such as the Future Large Aircraft military transporter, or to help rationalise its commercial aircraft operations. However, the real motive of the deal is industrial consolidation. Declining defence spending is forcing companies to cut overheads, and mergers are the most obvious way to eliminate costs. In the US the process is proceeding rapidly, but the political barriers to concentration in Europe mean that the process has been slower. Outright cross-border mergers between, for example, BAe and Dassault of France or DASA of Germany to produce one large military aircraft company would almost certainly be stopped by national rivalries and security concerns. Faced with limited opportunities on the continent, UK arms companies are consolidating across business areas at home. Earlier this year GKN, the engineering company which makes the Warrior armoured personnel carrier, bought Westland, the helicopter maker. The two are now being integrated into a single defence division with a unified management structure and marketing team. Since merger talks between GEC and BAe broke down a year ago, the UK defence industry has polarised further into two camps. BAe is trying to extend its stranglehold of large project management and the integration of complex systems to make complete military hardware. It wants to build fast jets, transport aircraft, attack helicopters, ships and submarines and would probably have tried to buy Westland if GKN had not started with an almost unstoppable shareholding. GEC has also been extending its stranglehold on the electronics and avionics business. In the past year, for example, it has acquired most of the remnants of Ferranti from the receivers. Both are, however, hedging their bets by forming cross-border alliances, GEC with Thomson of France in sonar, BAe with Matra of France in missiles. More such deals are likely to follow and both companies are also both involved in the biggest collaborative programme of all, the Eurofighter. The bid for VSEL is part of the first phase in European defence consolidation. The next, and larger, phase will be the decisive one with the two UK camps either merging with each other or combining with similar companies on the continent. Which route is taken will depend on whether the political reluctance to contemplate a truly European defence industry thaws faster than the opposition within BAe to a merger with its old rival.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BAE AND VSEL: DEFENSIVE STRATEGY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Group     Defence       Group      Defence                            Turnover           Operating profit/loss                           (Pounds m)              (Pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BAE                   10,760*      3,963        (237)         345 Year to 31 Dec 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BSEL                     466         317**        61           48** Year to 31 Mar 1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GEC                    5,791       2,749***      866          252 Year to 31 Mar 1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lockheed****           8,433       7,512         436          524 Year to Dec 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    * Includes Rover   ** Submarines  *** Electronics systems division **** Convertion rate Dollars 1.55  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

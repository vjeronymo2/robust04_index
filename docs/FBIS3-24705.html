			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kampala, Jan 30 (AFP) -- The Somali faction headed  by warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid said Sunday [30 January] it  planned to set up an interim government in Somalia before the  end of March, in a veiled ultimatum to the UN peacekeeping force  there to leave.    Spokesman for Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) Mohamed  Hassan Awale who accompanied the faction leader to Uganda said  the United Nations peacekeeping force in Somalia (UNOSOM) had  outlived its usefulness in the war torn-country now that famine  had ended.    "After the creation of an authority in (the capital)  Mogadishu and our target is March, disarmament will start and if  we need help we shall ask African leaders to provide a  peacekeeping force," said Awale, Aidid advisor on international  affairs.    Aidid left the Ugandan capital Sunday after a four-day visit  during which he had talks with President Yoweri Museveni.    The warlord has repeatedly called for UN Operation Somalia's  [UNOSOM] departure accusing the force of killing thousands of  Somalis.    The United States has set March 31 as the deadline for the  pullout of its troops from Somalia, but the UN plans to maintain  an 16,000-strong international force in the country.    UNOSOM went to Somalia last year originally to keep the  peace  while aid workers distributed food to hundreds of thousands of  starving people but the force was later locked in bloody clashes  with SNA militiamen after the UN accused Aidid of ordering the  killing of its soldiers and ordered his arrest.    Awale said Aidid had "fruitful discussions with President  Museveni on the situation in Somalia and the progress towards  peace amongst the fighting factions". The meeting took place on  Saturday.    Aidid is going back to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi to  continue peace negotiations with other Somalia factions, Awale  said.    He is expected to meet representatives from the Somali  Salvation Democratic Front, the Somalia National Democratic  Union and the Somali National Front, before returning to  Mogadishu within the next couple of days, Awale said.    Aidid travelled to Uganda from Nairobi on Thursday. He had  been in Kenya since UN-sponsored peace negotiations in Addis  Ababa collapsed.</p>

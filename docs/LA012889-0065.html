			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> S. AFRICA TALKS TO MANDELA ABOUT HOW TO FREE HIM WITHOUT TRIGGERING RIOTS  </P> <P> The government is talking to jailed black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela  about ways to effect his release without triggering bloody riots, Information  Minister Christoffel van der Merwe said Friday.  </P> <P> In a statement carried by the independent South African Press Assn., Van der  Merwe said, "The situation that could lead to Mr. Mandela's release is being  discussed with him, and it is being discussed in government circles."  </P> <P> He added that he could not promise that Mandela, leader of South Africa's  outlawed African National Congress, would be freed this year, however.  </P> <P> Mandela, 70, was jailed for life in 1964 for sabotage and plotting to overthrow  the country's white-led minority government.  </P> <P> "If we just released him today . . . it would undoubtedly have the result that  people would get killed. We have to create a situation where that will not be  the result," Van der Merwe said.  </P> <P> The minister declined to say why he believes Mandela's release would cause  riots and deaths.  </P> <P> Van der Merwe said Justice Minister Hendrik J. Coetsee, who is known to get on  well with Mandela, is seeking his cooperation to avoid bloodshed after his  release.  </P> <P> Mandela's lawyer, Ismail Ayob, said it is absurd to suggest that releasing his  client would cause deaths and said he was not aware of discussions with the  government.  </P> <P> "I think they are just looking for excuses yet again not to release Mandela.  There would be a great outpouring of joy at his release after serving two or  three life sentences, but I cannot imagine why even one person would die," Ayob  said.  </P> <P> "Mr. Mandela is not in jail anymore; he is in detention," Van der Merwe said.  </P> <P> Mandela's wife, Winnie, said earlier this year that he was more isolated and  lonely in the comfortable prison house he now inhabits than he had ever been in  jail.  </P></p>

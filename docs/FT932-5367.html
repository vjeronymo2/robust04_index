			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / World Trade News: EC seeks to tighten Japanese car curb THE European Community is to ask Japan to limit still further exports of cars and light commercial vehicles to the EC in 1993, following a significant fall in demand. Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, has written to Mr Yoshiro Mori, the Japanese minister for trade and industry, requesting urgent talks before the August break, aimed at revising the April deal on 1993 imports. The Japanese agreed then, in effect, to cut exports to the EC of cars and light commercial vehicles by 9.4 per cent - roughly 113,000 vehicles - on the basis of a European Commission forecast that EC car sales would decline by 6.5 per cent this year. Mr Bangemann said in April that the figures might need to be revised. Commission officials refuse to forecast the expected decline in the market this year and no figure is mentioned in Mr Bangemann's letter. But the officials point out that new vehicle registrations in the first four months of this year dropped by 17.8 per cent. The EC industry estimates that sales could decline by as much as 15 per cent over the year. 'It would need an explosion in (EC) demand to meet our original forecasts,' one senior Commission official conceded yesterday. The Commission has come under intense pressure from the EC industry - notably Mr Jacques Calvet, head of Peugeot-Citroen of France - and the French, Italian and Spanish governments to adjust the April agreement. Acea, which represents all EC manufacturers except Peugeot, said yesterday the two sides would have to act quickly if an adjustment was to have an effect. The April accord was based on the controversial July 1991 'understanding' between the EC and Japan, under which the Community pledged to open its market to full competition from Japanese vehicles by the end of the century. A renegotiated accord would still allow for an increase in Japanese exports this year to the five protected EC markets - the UK, France, Spain, Portugal and Italy. Officials in Brussels expect Japanese manufacturers to compensate for import cuts in the rest of the Community by redirecting EC-made Japanese vehicles - so-called 'transplants' - from the protected market to the remaining seven countries. Transplant vehicles are not covered directly by the July 1991 deal but are 'taken into consideration'.</p>

Speaking at a discussion-meeting  organized by the Forum Foundation, Zemko was reacting to the  current tense situation among the Hungarian ethnic minority  which is 560,000-strong and which constitutes 11 percent of  Slovakia's population. The Hungarians criticize the Slovak  authorities of not observing minority rights, and they have  called for autonomy in southern Slovakia, where most of them  live. Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the opposition Christian  Democratic Movement (KDH), said that as early as 1987  cooperation between the Hungarian and Slovak dissidents had been  subdued due to the Hungarians' unwillingness to recognize the  inviolability of the existing Slovak-Hungarian border.</p>

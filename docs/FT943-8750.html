			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Inflation target 'will not be met' Israel's central bank conceded for the first time yesterday that this year's 8 per cent inflation target would not be met. Mr Jacob Frenkel, Bank of Israel governor, said tight monetary policy had failed to rein in inflation, which is being driven primarily by rising housing prices and public sector wage settlements. He refused to predict the final figure, but declared: 'We will not make single-digit inflation this year.' His remarks came hours before the Bank released the July index which showed inflation for the month of 1.1 per cent. At least 0.5 per cent of itdue to housing costs. Bank officials said inflation for the first seven months of this year was 8.1 per cent. If prices kept rising at this rate, 1994 inflation would an 'extremely worrying' 13 per cent, raising the prospect of a further interest rate rise soon. The central bank has raised its interest rate to commercial banks from 10 to 12.5 per cent in three separate increases this year in an effort to meet the government's 8 per cent target, but Mr Frenkel said monetary policy was being 'overburdened.' It's a mistake to assign all the efforts in attaining the inflation targets to monetary policy alone,' he added. Decreasing housing prices, reducing the budget deficit, continued trade liberalisation, increased competition and reduction of monopolies and tight public-sector wage policies were all critical components of Israel's battle against inflation. Mr Frenkel was especially concerned about recent government wage pacts.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in Glaxo Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo was the main casualty among leading stocks as brokers reacted to shock news of a challenge to the company's headline drug. By the close of dealing, the shares had fallen 40, or 6 per cent, to 622p. The shares were also the most heavily traded in London - on turnover of 22m. Worries over the apparent threat to Zantac, Glaxo's anti-ulcer treatment, were sparked on Tuesday by news that an arm of Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss group, hoped to launch a version of the drug in the US. Zantac accounts for 43 per cent of Glaxo's sales and the threat to those sales by a global player prompted Goldman Sachs and Smith New Court to re-examine their views on the shares. Goldmans, already comparatively bearish, cut its short term recommendation and said that although it was holding its forecasts, 'the risk to these forecasts are now substantially increased'. Smith, formerly a buyer, turned to be being merely a short-term holder of the stock. Other bullish analysts were also busy assessing positions. The European pharmaceuticals team from UBS argued that the Ciba move could add SFr500m (Pounds 231.4m) to company sales in 1996, which would hit Zantac sales by 10 per cent.</p>

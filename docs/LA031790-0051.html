			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SWEET CRITIC?  </P> <P> Regarding Martin Bernheimer's review of Garrison Keillor at the Philharmonic  pension fund benefit (March 14): Lordy, Lordy.  </P> <P> Self-effacing, gentle and sweet are the only words that can apply. Not to  Keillor's performance, but to the review.  </P> <P> Bernheimer must have arisen from the right side of the sleeping apparatus  (there are those who'd swear it's a Torquemadic contraption involving spikes,  judging from the tone of some of his writings).  </P> <P> A night of discovery and appreciation outside the more rarefied strata of  traditionally "meaningful" musical efforts, from the Beckmesser-meister? "It  was a lovely evening." It was a lovely review.  </P> <P> MICHAEL McCONNOHIE, Burbank  </P></p>

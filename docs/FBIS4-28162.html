			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, June 7 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu says that the situation over the North  Korean nuclear dispute could change within a few days if  Pyongyang cooperates with the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] for its efforts to maintain nuclear safeguards in that  country. "If not, North Korea could not avoid U.N. economic  sanctions," Han told South Korean correspondents stationed in  New York, shortly before his departure for Bejing Tuesday.    On President Kim Yong-sam's order, Han was heading for  Beijing for talks with his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen on  the North Korean nuclear issue, it was announced by Foreign  Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho in Seoul Tuesday night. Han had  been scheduled to return home Tuesday from New York. He is  expected to meet Qian Thursday to explain the results of his  talks with U.S. Government officials and permanent members of  the U.N. Security Council on possible sanctions against North  Korea.    Han will ask China to go along with the Security Council  after explaining to Qian that the reason South Korea, the United  States and their allies are pursuing a resolution imposing  sanctions on North Korea is simply because there is no other  alternative.    Meeting with Korean reporters, Han said an overwhelming  majority of the Security Council members had told him the world  body must take strong action against North Korea. But a vote in  the council will not come until after next week because some  work must still be done on revising the language of a draft  resolution by the permanent members, Han said.    Pressed for a comment on the possibility that China might  oppose sanctions, Han said it appears Beijing will make up its  mind after looking for any changes in the North Korean attitude.  But when the Security Council adopts a resolution on sanctions,  the situation naturally calls for such action and therefore,  China would not be in a position to block the resolution or  oppose it, Han said.    Asked about his visit to China, Han noted that every country  in the Security Council believes that Beijing has an important  role to play in the North Korean nuclear issue. He said he  plans to brief Chinese leaders on the results of his  negotiations with U.S. and Russian officials and members of the  Security Council in New York.    Han said he will also ask the Chinese to continue their  efforts to persuade North Korea to accept U.N. inspections of  its nuclear facilities. With regard to a reported Russian  proposal for an eight-party conference on the nuclear issue, Han  said that is not the official Russian position.    Moscow was said to be pressing for such a conference, to be  attended by representatives from the two Koreas, the United  States, Japan, China, Russia, the IAEA and the United Nations.    On the possibility of multilateral sanctions being imposed  by  South Korea, the United States and Japan, Han said Seoul does  not feel such sanctions are needed. Han acknowledged there would  be some danger in the event that the United Nations slaps  sanctions on North Korea. Nonetheless, the world body cannot  afford to flinch because of Pyongyang's threats. Seoul will take  realistic, effective and comprehensive measures to deal with all  possible eventualities, Han added. In his talks with Qian, Han  will also explain the outcome of President Kim's visits to  Moscow and Tashkent before returning home Thursday.    Meanwhile, former Foreign Minister Yi Sang-ok is visiting  Beijing at the invitation of a Chinese association of diplomatic  officials and will discuss the North Korean problem with Qian.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Calculating your bill IF YOU sell an asset which is not in the above list, you may have to pay CGT. To find out, you need to make a complex calculation: first, take the sale proceeds, then deduct the cost or value of the asset when you bought it, inherited it or were given it (except by your spouse, see below) deduct allowable expenses, such as brokers' commission and stamp duty. The result is your unindexed gain. But the Inland Revenue allows you to offset the effects of inflation after March 1982. Each month, it produces indexation allowances for the previous month (which are published in the Weekend FT), which reflect the increase in the Retail Price Index. Assets bought before April 6 1982 have special rules (normally the March 31 1982 value is taken as the initial value). If prices have risen by 50 per cent between the month in which you bought the asset and the month in which you sold it, then indexation will reduce your taxable gain. For example, if the asset cost Pounds 1,000 and the proceeds of sale were Pounds 6,000. Indexation would reduce your gain by Pounds 500. Repeat the process for all the assets you have sold in the tax year. Total up the gains, deduct the losses and, if the result is over Pounds 5,500, you will have to pay CGT. This gain is added to your basic income and taxed at 25 per cent if your taxable income (including the gain) is under Pounds 23,700 and at 40 per cent if it is above that. Batches of shares Alas, the above calculation, complex enough, applies only to shares bought in one lump. Many investors will have gradually built up shareholdings in companies over several years. According to the Which? Tax Savings Guide (published by the Consumers' Association) if you sell shares which you have acquired in batches, they will be treated as being sold in the following order: any shares which you acquired on the day of disposal; any shares acquired within the previous nine days; any shares acquired after April 5 1982; shares acquired after April 5 1965 and before April 6 1982; shares acquired on or before April 5 1965. For most people, the problems will arise on dealing with shares acquired since 1982. Here the rules are complicated. The first task is to deal with shares bought between April 6 1982 and April 5 1985. Total the cost, and add the indexation allowance between dates of purchase and April 1985. Divide this total by the number of shares acquired in the period; the result is the indexed value per share. If you bought shares after April 5 1985, you add the initial cost of such shares to the indexed value of your 1982-1985 batch (including indexation between April 1985 and the date of the next purchase). You have a new indexed total, and can calculate a new indexed value per share. When you come to sell, you can apply further indexation from the month of your last purchase to the month of sale. Rights issues and bonus issues Shares acquired in such issues are treated on an averaging basis. On a rights issue, apply the same indexation calculations to the rights shares as you do to the original shares. Add the two indexed values together and divide by the total number of shares; the result is your average, indexed, cost per share. There are complications, however, and you should consult an accountant. The treatment of bonus issues (free issues of shares) is more simple. When you come to sell, divide the indexed value of your holding by the total number of shares, including the bonus shares. So, if you had 5,000 shares acquired at an indexed cost of Pounds 7,500 - and there was a one-for-one bonus issue - your indexed value per share would fall from 150p to 75p. Further information Leaflets from the Inland Revenue which explain the intricacies of the tax include CGT4 (owner occupied houses); CGT13 (indexation allowance for quoted shares); CGT 14 (an introduction); CGT15 (a guide for married couples) and CGT16 (indexation allowance; disposals after April 5 1988). CORRECTION In last week's A-Z of Personal Finance, it was stated that capital gains tax is payable on gilts. This is not, of course, the case. We apologise for this error.  ---------------------------------------------          CGT ALLOWANCES: JANUARY  ---------------------------------------------       1982   1983   1984   1985   1986 Jan   -     1.641  1.561  1.487  1.409 Feb   -     1.634  1.555  1.475  1.404 Mar  1.707  1.631  1.550  1.461  1.402 Apr  1.673  1.609  1.530  1.431  1.388 May  1.661  1.602  1.524  1.424  1.386 Jun  1.657  1.598  1.520  1.421  1.387 Jul  1.656  1.590  1.522  1.424  1.391 Aug  1.656  1.583  1.508  1.420  1.386 Sep  1.657  1.576  1.505  1.421  1.379 Oct  1.649  1.570  1.496  1.419  1.377 Nov  1.640  1.565  1.491  1.414  1.366 Dec  1.643  1.561  1.492  1.412  1.361  ---------------------------------------------       1987   1988   1989   1990   1991 Jan  1.356  1.313  1.222  1.135  1.041 Feb  1.351  1.308  1.213  1.128  1.036 Mar  1.348  1.303  1.207  1.117  1.032 Apr  1.332  1.282  1.186  1.084  1.019 May  1.331  1.277  1.179  1.074  1.016 Jun  1.331  1.272  1.175  1.070  1.011 Jul  1.332  1.271  1.174  1.069  1.013 Aug  1.328  1.257  1.171  1.059  1.011 Sep  1.324  1.251  1.163  1.049  1.007 Oct  1.318  1.238  1.154  1.041  1.004 Nov  1.311  1.233  1.144  1.043  1.000 Dec  1.313  1.229  1.141  1.044  1.000  --------------------------------------------- Source: Inland Revenue  ---------------------------------------------</p>

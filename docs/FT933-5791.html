			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Disgruntled Colombian coffee growers get sweetener COLOMBIA'S decision to raise the domestic coffee price paid to growers by 14.3 per cent is ostensibly a sign of confidence that firmer international prices are going to last. But the increase, which was agreed rather suddenly last Thursday, also seems to be a government gambit to mollify growers after the appointment of a special commission to study policy changes had antagonised much of the powerful coffee sector. Although the price rise satisfied the coffee federation, Federacafe, central bank officials are unhappy about its effect on inflation and the budget deficit. Just four months ago the price was put up by 8 per cent, so the overall increase so far this year amounts to 22 per cent - close to the annual inflation rate. All through the coffee crisis Colombia has maintained relatively high support prices and the international price will have to rise above 92 cents a lb in to reach a break-even point. Covering the latest increase will cost the National Coffee Fund about USDollars 50m more this year. However, the burden on the fund is not as big as it might have been because this year's harvest is expected to be under 15m bags (60kg each), about 20 per cent down on 1991-92 production. The reduction is due partly due to cuts in application of fertiliser and other inputs and partly to the effect of the 'broca' disease. But the cost of holding back up to 3m bags once the producers' export retention agreement begins to operate is likely to be considerable. Since the final collapse of the International Coffee Agreement talks earlier this year, both the private exporters and the government have been pushing for a major overhaul of coffee policies and institutions, to fit the better with the free market framework. Some have seen this as an attack on Federacafe - the pillar of the coffee industry - and the government's announcement of a new study commission, which did not include federation representatives, seemed to confirm this. However the latest price rise shows that the coffee growers still remain considerable influence in government circles. Robusta coffee futures prices fell back at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday after last week's big rise. The November position closed at Dollars 1,261 a tonne, down Dollars 20.</p>

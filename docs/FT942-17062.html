			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Squeeze makes the smaller Peps squeak: The price war that has broken out in the Pounds 5bn-a-year tax shelter The recent decision by merchant bank Barings to stop taking applications for personal equity plans shows the extent of competition in the Pep market. An aggressive price war backed by heavy advertising to promote 'name awareness' has raised the stakes for smaller Pep providers. And some companies complain that their distribution costs are increasing as independent financial advisers demand annual renewal commissions on top of initial commissions. Peps, which began in 1987, are popular tax shelters for private investors. Up to Pounds 6,000 a year can be invested free of capital gains or income tax in a general plan and a further Pounds 3,000 in single-company Peps. The general plan market has grown steadily from Pounds 1.6bn in the 1990-91 tax year to Pounds 3.1bn in 1992-93 and is estimated to be a record Pounds 5bn for the tax year just ended. Baring Global Fund Managers, the bank's asset managing arm, is a relatively minor player - Peps represent Pounds 15m of its Pounds 3bn in managed assets  -and the company is putting its Pep business on hold pending a review of its retail operations. Mr Nick Wells, product development manager, said: 'What stuck out like a sore thumb is that our Pep business is tiny compared to our institutional business.' He added: 'We do not want to discount nor do we want to put up standard charges.' Discounting is widespread. In 1992, Fidelity introduced tapered exit charges on its Peps allowing it to cut the initial charge to 2 per cent from the industry average of 5 per cent to 6 per cent. It continued to pay 3 per cent commission to intermediaries. This year, M&amp;G, the largest Pep provider, went further by abolishing the initial charge on its Managed Income Fund Pep and introducing withdrawal charges. Ms Rachel Medill, head of corporate communications, said: 'We are subsidising the managed income Pep, but we hope that it will be profitable over five years.' Nor is Barings the only company to feel the pressure. Mr Martin Harrison, managing director of GT unit managers said: 'We've felt the impact of the M&amp;G move on our own sales. The price war is unfortunate because more companies will move out. We'll be left with the giants and the niche players.' Chase de Vere Investments, publisher of an annual Pep guide, estimates 20 per cent of companies take 80 per cent of Pep money. The main costs of administering a Pep are sending out six monthly valuations to customers and recovering tax deductions on dividends from the Inland Revenue. Mr Michael Short, managing director of Premier Administration, said: 'You would need to take in at least Pounds 10m to Pounds 20m in a unit trust for it to break even, and the amount would be much higher for a Pep.' To survive on the low margins, companies are relying on generating sufficient volume to make profits and on the annual management charge, which has been edging up to 1.5 per cent. Ms Judy Delaforce, product development manager at Fidelity, thinks the Barings move could point the way for many more Pep providers. She said: 'A lot of small players will not be able to afford to stay in the Pep market.'</p>

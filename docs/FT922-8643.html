			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Electoral funding reform rebuffed EFFORTS to reform the way US political campaigns are financed have again run aground, but the issue seems likely to haunt politicians in November's elections. President George Bush this weekend vetoed a bill passed by the Democratic-controlled Congress that would have set voluntary limits on campaign spending in return for partial government funding. The bill would also have curbed 'soft money' donations channelled through political parties, but would have done little to reduce the influence of political action committees (PACs), interest groups which are among the main financiers of elections for the House of Representatives. Sponsors of the reform admit they have little hope of overriding the veto, which would require a two-thirds majority of both the Senate and House. But some Democrats believe Mr Bush's move could lose him votes this autumn. On three occasions in recent weeks Mr Bush has faced fund-raising embarrassment: when a Bush-Quayle fundraising dinner listed a number of corporate sponsors, in apparent violation of a ban on company donations; when a Republican fundraiser was sued by his employees who claimed he had coerced them into contributing to the party; and when the Republican party had to place in escrow a Dollars 400,000 (Pounds 226,000) donation from a man whose former wives and business partners say he owes them several times that amount. Most Republicans oppose the principle of government financing for congressional election campaigns - although they condone a similar system for presidential campaigns by which the government matches small contributions. They point out that the Democrats fudged the issue by failing to include in their bill any ideas about where the government money would come from. Republicans also oppose the concept of spending limits, on the grounds that challengers must be free to spend as much as they need to overcome the built-in advantages of an incumbent. MR Ross Perot moved closer to becoming a full-fledged presidential candidate yesterday, submitting petitions with 225,000 signatures - four times more than needed - requesting an independent spot on November's election ballot in his home state of Texas, Agencies report.</p>

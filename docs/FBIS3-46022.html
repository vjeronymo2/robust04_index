In exchange for this, Ukraine  will be financially compensated with aid of $175 million from  the United States and at the same time will be given a safety  guarantee. This is a major action that has been jointly  undertaken by Russia, the United States, and Ukraine concerning  the issue of nuclear weapons since the Lisbon Accord signed  between the United States and Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and  Belarus in May 1992.    All three parties have made positive assessment of the above  agreement. Clinton said that it was a "breakthrough" which has  reduced the possibility of nuclear calamities and has ushered in  a "new era" in the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship. Yeltsin  maintained that the agreement had intensified the nuclear  nonproliferation mechanism and pushed forward the process of  nuclear disarmament. Kravchuk said that the agreement was the  result of compromise made by all parties, which enabled Ukraine  to be more secure and obtain the right of equal partnership.    No doubt, the Moscow agreement has made significant progress  toward solving the nuclear weaponry problem in Ukraine, but many  problems have yet to be resolved. Moreover, whether the  agreement can be smoothly carried out will depend on the  development of Ukraine's domestic political situation and the  relations between Ukraine and Russia and between Ukraine and the  United States.    First, the issue of nuclear weapons has a decisive impact on  the stability of Ukraine's political situation. When Ukraine  proclaimed its independence, it declared that it would be a  nuclear-free country and promised to destroy all its nuclear  weapons. Over the past few years, however, there have been  different political propositions at home regarding the approval  of the treaty to reduce strategic weapons in the first stage and  the accession to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. In some  people's opinion, under the circumstances of enormous external  pressure and public territorial claims from certain Russian  forces, nuclear weaponry is Ukraine's "trump card" in defending  its national independence and territorial integrity. They were  even more worried about Russia's foreign policy after its new  parliamentary election. Therefore, they do not want to give up  their nuclear weapons but favor retaining them, at least for a  certain period. Other people are of the opinion that the  principle of becoming a nuclear-free country should not be  changed, but they should be compensated for giving away the  nuclear weapons, or the contents of the nuclear warheads should  be transformed into fuel for nuclear power stations to alleviate  the serious energy crisis. In addition, Ukraine found it  difficult to continue maintaining and managing the existing  nuclear missiles either economically or technically. If the  nuclear arsenal is preserved, several dozen billion U.S. dollars  will still be needed to set up a complete system of scientific  research and production. That will be beyond their ability,  even though they wish to do so. For this reason, the Ukrainian  parliament decided last year to approve the treaty with 13  conditions attached to it and called for the nuclear powers,  primarily Russia and the United States, to provide a security  guarantee and economic aid as compensation. Therefore, after  President Kravchuk signed the treaty in Moscow, he still has to  make painstaking efforts to persuade the parliament so that the  treaty can be endorsed and put into effect.    Second, the issue of nuclear weapons is a vital element that  has an impact on the relations between Ukraine and Russia and  between Ukraine and the United States. Since the disintegration  of the Soviet Union, nuclear weapons have all along been one of  the major disagreements between Russia and Ukraine. The Russian  side maintains that it should be the only successor of the  Soviet nuclear weapons, and that those in the Ukrainian  territory must be shipped to Russia. What is more, Russia tried  to force Ukraine to give in by suspending supplies of petroleum  and natural gas to the latter and pressing it to repay its  debts. As for the United States, it first tried to make Ukraine  submit to its pressure, threatening that, if Ukraine would not  settle the nuclear problem, it would not develop other aspects  of its relations with Ukraine. Later, it changed tactics by  promising to provide Ukraine with aid of $175 million and  increasing personnel contacts and consultations with a view to  urging Ukraine to hand over its nuclear weapons. As a matter of  fact, what Russia and the United States are worried about is the  emergence of another powerful and independent nuclear country,  apart from Russia, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union.  Hence, they insisted that they would not provide a security  guarantee to Ukraine unless it acceded to the treaty. Prior to  his current trip to Moscow, Clinton was the first to announce in  Brussels that Ukraine had consented to destroy the nuclear  weapons. He also made a short stay in Kiev, which was aimed at  demonstrating the progress made in nuclear disarmament so as to  remove the anxieties of Europe over the nuclear threats on the  one hand, and at manifesting the support he had won from NATO  members on the other.    The public maintains that the solution of the problem  regarding Ukraine's nuclear weapons is a major achievement that  has been scored through the coordinated position between the  United States and Russia. However, the principal purpose of  Clinton's current trip was to put his plan of a "partnership for  peace" into practice. He made no commitment to security in the  Eastern European region, and his promise of economic aid to  Ukraine was also much said but little done, which was far from  what Ukraine had expected. Judging from this, the changes of  political situation in Russia and the United States and whether  their policies toward Ukraine as well as the U.S. undertaking of  aid and compensation can be carried out will have an impact on  whether Ukraine will perform its obligations in a period of time  to come.</p>

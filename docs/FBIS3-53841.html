[passage omitted]    A senior aide to PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, who was in Cairo  on Thursday, warned the peace process could run out of steam if  there was no breakthrough within weeks.    "I believe we have a few weeks in front of us and if these  problems are not resolved in weeks I think the whole Declaration  of Principles and the process will be in danger," Yasir  'Abdrabbuh told reporters in the capital.    "I don't think they have the luxury of time in order to wait  for months. They need a quick solution as we do," he said,  referring to Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres who said  Wednesday that his country could afford to wait.    The chief PLO negotiator, Nabil Sha'th, said the Taba  meetings had produced "some opening." Although a security deal  is proving elusive, he has reported progress on the hand-over of  civilian powers to the Palestinians. [passage omitted]</p>

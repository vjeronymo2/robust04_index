			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-PARKS WORKER GETS 3 YEARS FOR MOLESTATION  </P> <P> A former city employee at Reseda Park was sentenced to three years imprisonment  Friday for molesting a 6-year-old boy.  </P> <P> Lars Juden, 38, who coached young people in athletics at the park since 1983,  pleaded guilty Friday to child molestation.  </P> <P> In exchange for the plea, prosecutors dropped a second child molestation  charge.  </P> <P> Juden and another man, Ronald Ray Rudd, a 39-year-old volunteer at the park,  molested the boy last July and August in the park office and in a van across  the street. They were arrested in August, and Juden was fired.  </P> <P> Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz could have sentenced Juden to  up to eight years in prison, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Eduards R. Abele. But  Abele said he was "quite satisfied" with Juden's sentence because the guilty  plea saved the boy the pain of having to take the stand. Juden has no prior  convictions for child molestation, he said.  </P> <P> Rudd, who admitted that he has twice before been convicted of child  molestation, was sentenced in September to 15 years in prison after he pleaded  guilty to three counts of child molestation.  </P> <P> At Juden's preliminary hearing, Los Angeles police Detective Joseph Diglio  quoted Juden as saying, "If the kid didn't come to the park alone, these things  wouldn't happen."  </P></p>

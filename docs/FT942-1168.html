			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Syltone rises 18% to Pounds 2.5m Profits before tax at Syltone advanced 18 per cent during the 12 months to March 31, underlining the encouraging stance adopted at the halfway stage by Mr Tony Clegg, chairman of the Bradford-based transport engineering group. On turnover ahead to Pounds 39.9m (Pounds 36.7m) - some 60 per cent of the group's sales go to export markets - the pre-tax line rose from Pounds 2.13m to Pounds 2.52m. Although still short of the Pounds 2.87m reported for 1991-92, Mr Clegg said: 'We are heading in the right direction and are not short of ideas for expansion.' The core business, Drum, which is the UK market leader in truck discharge equipment, reported strengthened order books and higher profits, although activities in continental Europe lagged growth elsewhere. The group has severed its link with Alfons Haar, its distributor in Germany. Fully diluted earnings per share emerged at 8.83p (7.35p). The final dividend is 3.31p, making a total of 4.935p (4.725p adjusted for scrip issue).</p>

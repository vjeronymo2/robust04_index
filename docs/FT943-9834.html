			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pay formula to unlock rail dispute Sir, The frustration of the present railway dispute is all the greater because the ingredients exist for a settlement from which all parties can gain. There is considerable scope to increase the productivity of signalmen both by matching staffing on all shifts to present workloads and by treating signalmen more as controllers of the system with greater responsibility for decision-making at times of disruption and for spreading information to users of the system. With such an upgrading of the role of signalmen in the larger and more modern signal boxes, the number of supervisors could be reduced with significant economy. Looking to the future, the latest electronic technology will open the door to further productivity enhancement. But the union won't talk about the future until its claim about past productivity has been recognised. The signalmen themselves feel aggrieved because less responsible workers, like those on station platforms, have already benefited from pay restructuring and increased earnings. There is a way forward which is likely to be acceptable to the union, will unlock discussions about future productivity and will reassure government, which is legitimately concerned that pay settlements above the level of inflation should be self-financing. This consists of paying to the signalmen a settlement which will amount to something like 5.7 per cent on basic rates. This will consist of the 3.2 per cent already on the table plus a lump sum of about Pounds 300. The lump sum would be consolidated into basic rates for one year only. In subsequent years the funding of the lump sum would come, as a first charge, from the new productivity agreement. As a condition of the offer, the union would give an undertaking to enter into a full-time working party to consider, in detail, the productivity deal, and to conclude those discussions by the end of August. The results would be put to a ballot of all signalmen to be concluded by the end of September. If some jobs are to be lost, attention will need to be given to providing an attractive severance package but in an industry with a high age profile this should not be difficult. The risks attached to all parties - government, Railtrack and the union - in the above procedure are small and the undertaking that it would be for the signalmen themselves to ballot on the outcome of the productivity working party will give everyone an incentive to be imaginative in their deliberations.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- The Iranian Government  will defer payments of trade debts worth 2 billion dollars it  owes to nine major Japanese trading firms, industry sources said  Monday [14 March].    Iran agreed with the Japanese trading firms, including  Mitsui  and Co. and Tomen Corp., to postpone payment of its trade debts  due by March until 1996 to 1999, the source said.    The agreement was reached after Iran promised it will put  priority on using its crude oil revenues to pay back the debts,  they said.    Iran is delaying payment of a total of nearly 10 billion  dollars in trade settlements, the sources said.    In February, Germany agreed to allow Iran to defer such  payments worth roughly 2.5 billion dollars.</p>

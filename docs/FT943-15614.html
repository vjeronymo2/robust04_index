			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Molyneaux pessimistic on Dublin links Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, yesterday urged the government to think again about proposals for cross-border co-operation in Ireland in the light of Dublin's handling of a dispute over horseracing. Mr Molyneaux used a parliamentary early-day motion to highlight the Irish government's failure to act 'in a fair and honourable manner' over nominations to the Irish Racing Authority. He called on the UK government to 'reconsider proposals for co-operation between the two administrations in Ireland' in the light of the way Dublin had acted. The move pointed up how carefully London and Dublin are having to tread in their efforts to secure a durable political settlement in the province. It emerged earlier this week that the UK government has virtually given up hope of agreeing with Dublin the framework for a comprehensive settlement in time for the next Anglo-Irish summit later this month. Downing Street said yesterday that a number of important and complex issues had still to be settled. The main differences involve the repeal of Dublin's constitutional claim to Ulster and the shape and authority of proposed joint boards to enhance cross-border co-operation. London believes no credible agreement is possible if the issue of Dublin's territorial claim is not resolved. Yesterday's motion said Dublin had 'contemptuously ignored' the Northern Ireland racing industry's nomination of a representative to the 'incongruously named' Irish Racing Authority. This replaced the Turf Club of Ireland, which had 'hitherto administered racing on all courses in Ireland including Downpatrick and Down Royal, in Northern Ireland, to the satisfaction of those concerned'. The motion called on the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland to 'intervene and ensure fair play'.</p>

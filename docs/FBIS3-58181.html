The visit will add a new dimension to the favorable  relations Turkey and Syria have recently established. Mentese  will visit the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] camp in the  al-Biqa' Valley; the camp was closed some time ago.    In a statement to HURRIYET, Agar said: "Syrian officials  want us to visit the al-Biqa' Valley. We probably will. Our  relations with Syria are very favorable. Of course, results  cannot be achieved immediately. Nevertheless, all the closed  doors have been opened."    A Syrian delegation will visit Ankara in February after the  Turkish delegation headed by Nahit Mentese visits Syria. A  Turkish delegation headed by Kamil Tecirlioglu, deputy director  general of police, returned to Ankara from Damascus with  favorable impressions the night before last. Tecirlioglu  discussed the revelations by Syrian citizens arrested in Turkey  and asked the Syrian officials to clarify the situation. The  Syrian officials were reluctant to give Tecirlioglu detailed  information on PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's situation. The  Turkish delegation's impression was that Syria is reluctant to  return Abdullah Ocalan to Turkey.    In a statement during the Turkish delegation's talks in  Damascus, Major General Budayr al-Hasan, deputy under secretary  of the Syrian Ministry of Internal Affairs Security Department,  said his country has nothing to gain from activities that  threaten Turkey's security and territorial integrity.</p>

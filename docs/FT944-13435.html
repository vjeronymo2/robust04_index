			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Learning lessons the difficult way - Richard Waters examines the issues raised by yesterday's ruling US anti-trust authorities may have put a spanner in the works of one of the biggest reorganisations to hit the country's pharmaceuticals industry. Fifteen months ago, Merck turned the industry on its head by buying Medco Containment Services, a big distribution company. The deal sparked a race among drugs manufacturers to secure their distribution lines. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has now put a question mark over this vertical integration strategy. In particular, it raises doubts about the wisdom of the three companies, which between them will have paid Dollars 13bn to buy distributors, once Eli Lilly's Dollars 4bn purchase of PCS is completed (in the other deal, SmithKline Beecham paid Dollars 2.3bn for Diversified Pharmaceutical Services). The commission has yet to outline publicly its concerns about the Lilly deal. Indeed, until it publishes the full details of the compromise it has reached with the company, it will not even confirm that it has held an investigation. The outline of the deal, however, suggests that the FTC's concern is that control of distribution by a small number of manufacturers could limit the ability of other drugs makers to sell their products. The result, in the long run, could be less choice and higher prices for consumers. Although the deal with the FTC applies only to Lilly, it is likely to have a bearing on how Merck and SmithKline operate. Both companies cleared a review by the agency when completing their own purchases, but the FTC says: 'Theoretically, the commission can go back and re-examine things on which it has passed before.' Two issues lie at the heart of the Lilly investigation. The first is whether other drugs manufacturers will have fair access to PCS's distribution system once it is acquired; in general, the deal will require the company to offer all other manufacturers' products for sale alongside its own. Pharmacy benefit managers such as PCS generally reduce costs for buyers of drugs by offering only a limited range of products, known as a formulary. The drugs included on this list are those on which the distributor can negotiate bigger discounts, or which are cheaper than rival products. The benefit managers encourage doctors to prescribe these formulary drugs through direct telephone contact. However, PCS will have to offer the option of an 'open' formulary - one which contains any drug the customer wants - which could reduce the competitive advantage to the company of controlling the distributor. Lilly, however, argues that this requirement makes no difference to the attraction of owning PCS, and that it was planning to offer the option of an open formulary anyway. Both Merck and SmithKline say they already offer open formularies to their customers. The second issue of concern to the FTC is the potential misuse of competitive pricing information. The regulators fear that Lilly could gain access to details of the prices at which other drugs companies are selling their products to PCS, and use this to undercut competitors. To prevent this, it has required Lilly to agree to a 'firewall' to keep the information confidential. This, again, is an arrangement that all three companies say they can live with. If the drugs companies are right in their claims that the Lilly consent decree will make no material difference to their businesses, why are the regulators showing such interest? One possible answer is that the FTC is acting politically. With the new spirit of anti-trust zeal under the Clinton administration, it could not appear to be taking no action amid such a significant industrial restructuring. Alternatively, the deal with Lilly may have more teeth than the manufacturers yet realise, or are prepared to admit. Either way, they still have a long way to go to prove to shareholders that buying distribution companies will support profits in the long term - and past experience is not encouraging. The biggest previous attempt to pursue this strategy in the healthcare field  -the Dollars 4bn acquisition of American Hospital Supply by Baxter International, a hospital supplies and healthcare company, in 1985 - proved a failure. Last year, half of Baxter's sales in the US came from hospital supplies, but only a quarter of profits. Nor has the deal lifted the company's market share. It is a lesson that the drugs companies could yet learn to their cost.</p>

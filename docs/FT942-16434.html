			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Remains of E German sell-off 'of no interest' The remains of eastern Germany's privatisation programme are of no interest to the German private banking sector, according to Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman of Dresdner Bank. The family silver had all been sold and eastern German companies still in the hands of the Treuhand privatisation agency were those with little hope of survival, he said in a brisk rejection of government criticism of the banking community's stance. 'The caricature figure of a banker unwilling to open up his full money bags for needy, weaker neighbours does not become any more convincing no matter how often it is published,' he said. Rich and profitable German banks have been criticised recently by politicians for allegedly not doing enough to help economic recovery in the east. Mr Sarrazin was speaking at a press conference on Friday to announce the bank's annual results. Dresdner revealed a 24 per cent increase to DM2bn (Pounds 800m) in operating profits for 1993. The banking industry had promised Bonn last year that it would contribute DM1bn to aid the privatisation process, as part of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's so-called solidarity pact. However, it had made clear at the outset that banks would only take over businesses which had an economic future, Mr Sarrazin said. 'Unfortunately, our serious intentions to co-operate fruitfully with the Treuhand have not often been crowned with success,' he added.</p>

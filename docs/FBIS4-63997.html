			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Aleksandr Mineyev and </F> Vladimir Smelov]    [Text] Brussels May 26 TASS -- Defence Ministers Pavel  Grachev of Russia and Leo Delcroix of Belgium emphasised today  the role of Belgium as a major mediator and connecting link in  development of relations between Russia and NATO with a view of  their further rapprochement. They addressed a joint news  conference here after today's talks.    Yesterday, Grachev started his official two-day visit to  Belgium. It was mostly thanks to Delcroix that the Russian  defence minister met for the first with his NATO counterparts on  Tuesday. At that meeting, Grachev delivered an hour-long report  on Russia's new defence doctrine and expounded upon Moscow's  views of European security issues. Apart from this, he  delivered to NATO Russia's proposals for parameters of  partnership with this organization.    At today's news conference Grachev told reporters that  Russia  would sign shortly a framework document of NATO's Partnership  for Peace programme, but only proceeding from the said  parameters. The date of signing depends on how soon NATO will  consider the Russian proposals. Their analysis at the expert  level is being already carried out. Then, Russia expects NATO  ministers to discuss and approve the proposals. After this, the  two sides will just have to settle technical issues. "Now all  depends not on Russia only", the minister pointed out, stressing  the point at issue was exactly proposals, not any terms.    When asked about Russia's idea of a mechanism of  consultations with NATO, Grachev said since Russia was not a  member of the North Atlantic Alliance, it had no right to demand  to be informed and consulted on what country should be admitted  to NATO and when, but certainly it will make its own conclusions  about this. Consultations with NATO should above all concern  peacekeeping missions. In this connection, the Russian defence  minister recalled that he had criticized NATO's air strike upon  Bosnian Serb positions, which was launched without preliminary  consultations with Russia.    "Russia does not only want but will remain a great power",  Grachev said. But it does not mean that Russia intends to exert  pressure upon Central and East European countries or to direct  them. "We favour equal partnership with these states upon mutual  consent", he pointed out, adding that Russia views cooperation  with other CIS countries as a top priority.    The Belgian defence minister told reporters that Grachev's  meetings with NATO senior officials had promoted better  understanding between Russia and the North Atlantic Alliance.  Delcroix believes Russia is highly influential in the world and  it requires an adequate treatment if NATO countries would like  it to join the Partnership for Peace Programme.    Delcroix also reported that today's talks, at which the two  ministers addressed each other not only as colleagues but as  personal friends as well, concentrated on the NATO's partnership  initiative, Russia's military doctrine and the situation in  Bosnia.</p>

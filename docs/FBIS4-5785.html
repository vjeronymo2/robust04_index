			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and  China have signed a contract to build a hotel near Mt. Paekdu on  a joint-venture basis, the semi-official China News Service  reported Wednesday.    Mt. Paekdu is located on the border between North Korea and  China and many South Koreans, who consider it a holy site, like  to climb the mountain on the Chinese side.    Samson Enterprises Co. of Korea and Yanbian Tourism Corp. of  Jilin Province have agreed to invest 8 million U.S. dollars in  building a hotel to accommodate 1,200 guests near Mt. Paekdu.    The project has been approved by the Chinese State Council.    Samson and the Yanbian Tourism Company have set up a  joint-venture company to operate the hotel over the coming 50  years and they plan to use the profits to boost farming in  Yanbian, largely populated by ethnic Koreans.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils uneasy Oil shares were largely unmoved by news that Iraq may well agree terms with the UN at a meeting on Wednesday and sell up to 600,000 barrels of oil a day on the international market for humanitarian reasons. Oil prices tumbled as the news emerged, with August Brent sliding around 30 cents a barrel. 'The news is worrying and in any event oil shares have not reflected the fall in sterling oil prices since the Opec meeting,' said Mr Brendan Wilders at Hoare Govett. 'We view the sector as fully valued,' he added. No real pressure emerged in the sector, however, despite the opening decline on Wall Street. BP settled 3 down at 305 1/2 p on relatively small turnover of 9.9m, while Shell dipped 4 to 627p on 4.2m traded.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Appointments: Opportunity of 'secondary space' Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, the Chicago-based architects which also sustains a significant interior design business, has hired Sara Galbraith as its new head of interior design in London. Galbraith, an American who studied architecture at Berkeley, has spent the past seven years in London with Pfister Chadwick. Charles Pfister, whose design business was merged with an English firm on his death a few years ago, had once been a partner at SOM, so Galbraith - who had earlier worked for another ex-SOM partner - says the style at her new firm is familiar. Being a trained architect, which many of her predecessors in design at SOM were not, is a decided advantage, she claims. 'You have to know how buildings work - interior design is not just about picking fabrics and colours.' She says London offers marvellous opportunities at the moment, partly because of the upgrading of 'secondary space', in other words refurbishing existing offices vacated for the plethora of recently completed buildings. 'Interior design has remained an important part of our business despite the collapse of the property market,' adds SOM director Robert Turner. One of SOM's main claims to fame in London is as architects of Canary Wharf; the company says its involvement is 'now virtually complete', leaving it 'not overly exposed' to Olympia &amp; York and its current troubles. Galbraith's biggest current project is fitting out the new premises for the merged Manufacturers Hanover/Chemical Bank in Canary Wharf. At Pfister Chadwick she had been working for Arthur Andersen which moves into the building in Kingsway being vacated by Chemical.</p>

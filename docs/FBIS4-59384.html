			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lamis K. Andoni: "PLO Reformists Gain Strength </F> Ahead of Self-Rule"]    [Text] Deliberations to form a Palestinian authority have  triggered an unprecedented internal power struggle as  Palestinian officials and leaders seem determined to put an end  to Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman Yasir  'Arafat's single-handed leadership prior to moving to Jericho  and Gaza.    So far most PLO officials and leaders from the  Israeli-occupied territories have declined to take part in the  25-member authority either in protest against the agreement on  Palestinan autonomy signed in Cairo on May 4, or against Mr.  'Arafat autocratic style, which, they fear, will dominate the  new authority.    Prior to Mr. 'Arafat's departure for South Africa to attend  the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela, the PLO leadership  in Tunis challenged his attempt to single-handedly appoint the  Palestinian authority.    But, during his brief stay in South Africa, the PLO chairman  defied the challenge by appointing by telephone four members  from the occupied territories.    So far the four leaders from the occupied territories, who  are said to have accepted membership in the Palestinian  authority, are Fatah head in Gaza Zakariya al-Agha, Frayh  Abu-Middayn (also a Gaza close to Fatah), Bethlehem Mayor Ilyas  Frayj, and the head of the Palestinian side of the liaison with  Israel, Jamil al-Tarifi.    By going over the heads of the PLO Executive Committee and  prominent PLO leaders in the occupied territories, Mr. 'Arafat  is apparently trying to force the reluctant leaders to follow--a  tactic that he has perfected in the past.    But this time the situation is more complicated as many  officials and leaders are wary about the implications of taking  part in an authority in charge of implementing an agreement that  they either oppose or have strong reservations about.    Most, including his partners in the 30-month-of peace  process, feel that they were marginalised in the actual  negotiations and that Mr. 'Arafat is now trying to impose on  them an agreement that they were not party to.    In a strongly-worded statment, the Palestine Democratic  Union, FIDA, led by Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, charged that the pact  enables Israel to practically maintain its control over the Gaza  Strip and Jericho.    FIDA officials, however said that Mr. 'Abd-Rabbuh was ready  to take part in the Palestinian authority provided Mr. 'Arafat  accepted clearly defined terms and democratic basis for the  functions of the authority.    According to FIDA, the main immediate task is to work on  freeing the Palestinian authority from the constraints imposed  on it by the agreement. According to the agreement, the  Palestinian authority cannot take major or minor decisions  without the approval of the Israeli side through a maze of joint  committees and subcommittees that will oversee its  implementation.    Some argue that it is already too late to try to alter the  role of the Palestinian authority that has been limitted by the  terms of the agreement.    Some argue that it is already too late to try to alter the  role of the Palestinian authority that has been limitted by the  terms of the agreement.    The Palestine People's party (PPP), which maintains such a  view, has already informed Mr. 'Arafat that it was not  participating in the Palestinian authority according to the  conditions outlined in the Israeli-Palestinian pact.    But it seems that Mr. 'Arafat has underestimated early signs  of defiance by completely ignoring last-minute appeals to him  not to sign the agreement as soon as the details became known to  his colleagues and PLO leaders in the occupied territories.    Both Faysal al-Husayni, Fatah's leader in the West Bank, and  Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian delegation to the  Washington bilateral talks, had urged Mr. 'Arafat not to sign  the pact and try to renegotiate some of its terms.    In a lengthy memo to the PLO chairman, Dr. 'Urayqat wrote  that the pact aimed "at perpetuating, instead of ending, the  occupation."    Mr. 'Arafat was not able to secure full-fledged support for  the accord by his own PLO Executive Committee or the Fatah  Central Committee. At a meeting in Tunis on May [no date  given], Mr. 'Arafat was said to have not even sought the  approval of his colleagues as the issue was presented as a fait  accompli.    PLO Executive Committee member Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi  was particularly outraged by the terms of the economic agreement  signed in Paris on April 29.    In an internal memo to the PLO Executive Committee, made  available to the JORDAN TIMES, Mr. al-Nashashibi said that the  Paris pact allowed Israel total control over the Palestinian  economy through the joint Palestinian-Israeli economic  committee. In Mr. al-Nashashibi's view, by allowing Israel to  share, If not to control, economic decision-making, the pact  will obstruct the building of a Palestinian national economy.    Mr. al-Nashashibi is said to have declined membership in the  Palestinian authority.    A senior Fatah Central Committee member, Hani al-Hasan,  believes that the Paris economic accord is the most dangerous  part of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement.    Mr. al-Hasan, and his brother, Khalid, who is currently  under  medical treatment at the Farah centre of the al-Husayn Medical  City, are both against the accord and refuse to move to Jericho  and Gaza under its terms.    So far Mr. 'Arafat has failed in talking any of the  cofounders of his Fatah movement to join the authority, as head  of the PLO Political Department Faruq Qaddumi has already  refused to be part of the new authority.    The only exception could be Intisar al-Wazir, widow of PLO  military leader Khalil al-Wazir, Abu-Jihad, who has reluctantly  accepted her appointment to the authority.    But if most PLO leaders are mainly reacting to being  excluded  from the negotiations process, resulting in an agreement they  were not party to, Mr. 'Arafat is not having an easier time with  two of his closest partners that continued with the deal all the  way through the signing, PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud  'Abbas and economic chief Ahmad Quray'.    Both are said to have declined invitations to join the  Palestinian authority citing differences with Mr. 'Arafat over  the handling of the Palestine Economic Council for Development  and Reconstruction (PECDAR).    Analysts and PLO officials, however, believe that Mr.  'Arafat  will eventually succeed in forming a Palestinan authority. But  they say the body will not be a strong one if he failed to  recruit credible names with broad following in the occupied  territories, especially after losing the support of important  leaders like the estranged chief Palestinan negotiator Haydar  'Abd al-Shafi.    But many, including opponents of the peace pact, now argue  that the only way to contain the damage and to open the way for  the emergence of strong nationalist leaders is to ensure that  free elections will be held after the setting up of the  Palestinian authonomy.</p>

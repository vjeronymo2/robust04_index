			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better mechanism needed so legal aid system not abused Sir, John Mason ('Cheap ride on trial', August 30) rightly draws attention to the scandal of legal aid payments to tycoons facing criminal charges, while help for the genuinely poor is being more tightly rationed. In many cases the apparently easy availability of legal aid to the astute fraudster has resulted in an unwelcome burden on industry. The burden is borne by employers (and falls disproportionately on smaller employers) who take ex-employees to court following their discovery of in-house fraud, usually at senior level. The cost of making an example of such persons can be prohibitive if the offenders can fight a long war of attrition funded by state legal aid. The state should be encouraging and not discouraging public-spirited employers from bringing fraudsters to book. Without this deterrent industry would risk even larger losses through fraudulent misappropriation of funds. It is also a fact of life that the fraudster, who has been able to outwit his company's security checks, is best equipped to out-smart the legal aid system. Frustration knows no bounds for a company spending vast sums in legal fees in the task of bringing a crooked former director to book, not only when he miraculously 'divests' himself of substantial assets in order to qualify for legal aid, but when he also qualifies for income support so that the state pays his mortgage interest and council tax on the grounds that his own company is only paying him a pittance for working eight hours a week, because he needs the rest of his time to prepare his defence. Sadly, this pattern of experience has been the lot of too many UK companies. A more effective mechanism for preventing such abuse of the legal aid system would not only benefit the tax payer but also the large number of UK companies for whom the costs of their continuing war against fraud has been grossly inflated by the apparent ease with which wealthy fraudsters have been able to qualify for legal aid.

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UN pressure on Afghan factions A UNITED Nations representative yesterday stepped up pressure on warring factions in Afghanistan, less than a month before a representative assembly of Afghans is to meet to discuss a transitional government. Mr Benon Sevan, personal representative for Afghanistan of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general - in Islamabad after his second visit this week to Kabul - called those who sought a military victory 'arsonists' for whom there was no longer room. With international help, Mr Sevan said, 'we shall be able to resolve the Afghan conflict peacefully and now, not next month, this month.' Western diplomats are cautious in their optimism about prospects for an end to the 14-year war. Last month Afghan President Najibullah agreed to step down and pave the way for transferring power to an interim government. A UN-backed assembly of representatives of Afghan groups is due to be held by the end of this month, either in Geneva or in Vienna, as a first step towards making arrangements for a transitional government. Reuter adds from Kabul: Mr Najibullah sought to speed up the peace process in Afghanistan when he met Mr Sevan yesterday, a presidential spokesman said. Mr Najibullah's announcement two weeks ago that he would not take part coincided with his loss of Mazar-i-Sharif, the biggest city in the north, to guerrillas and dissidents.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "First Day of Trial Against 14 </F> Albanians in Prishtina" -- issued by the Democratic League of  Kosova]    [Text] The trial against 14 Albanians accused of "hostile  activity" against the self-proclaimed Yugoslavia resumed  yesterday at the Serbian-run District Court in Prishtina,  today's BUJKU reports. The 14 Albanians have been charged of  having allegedly set up the Defense Ministry of the Republic of  Kosova. They are accused of two criminal offenses --  "association for hostile activity" and "endangering of  territorial integrity," in compliance with Articles 136 and 116  of the Criminal Code of "FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]."    The accused: Hajzer Hajzeraj (1943), Haxhi Ferati (1949),  Zaim Berisha (1949), Ejup Dragaj, Agim Krasniqi (1956), former  army officers: Ibush Kelmendi (1952), Halit Rama (1949), Xhelil  Rama (1940), former officers of the Territorial Defense: Sali  Gitaku (1937), Bilall Syla (1965), Heset Sahiti (1959), Adem  Salihaj (1950), Sylejman Hasani (1945), and Ismajl Hehmeti  (1945) were brought in the court-room hand-cuffed.    The trial was interrupted on April 18, as the lawyers had  lodged a request for the exclusion of the public prosecutor,  Miodrag Brklac, and his deputy, Jovica Jovanovic.    All the accused were detained during September last year,  and  according to their lawyers they have all been tortured during  the investigation procedure.    During the first day of trial two of the accused were  cross-examined. Hajzer Hajzeraj, the alleged "defense minister"  described the torture he underwent during the detention period.  He denied the accusation and all the statements that were  obtained from him under pressure and torture by the police and  security.    Haxhi Ferati said in his defense that everything in the  accusation was false. He also said he had been severely  tortured while in detention and that confessions had been taken  from him by force. The trial is to continue tomorrow.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / N American groups to link fertiliser interests COMINCO, the Vancouver-based mining group, and Alberta Energy Company of Calgary plan to combine their fertiliser interests in a new publicly-listed company. The entity, to be called Cominco Fertilizers, will be among North America's biggest integrated fertiliser producers, with annual output of 1.6m tonnes of nitrogen products and over 1m tonnes of potash. Cominco Fertilizers plans to raise about CDollars 100m (USDollars 79m) through an initial public offering, which is expected to be priced in early April. Following the share issue, Cominco will have a 50 per cent interest in Cominco Fertilizers and Alberta Energy 10 per cent. The two companies are partners in several nitrogen plants and distribution facilities in western Canada and the mid-west US. But the growth of the fertiliser business has had to take a back seat in recent years to Cominco's efforts to turn around its lossmaking, and much bigger, mining and metals division. The creation of a separate unit and the infusion of new equity is expected to broaden the horizons of the fertiliser unit. Cominco said that Cominco Fertilizers 'is examining a number of expansion and growth opportunities'. A Cominco official said yesterday the spin-off would also have the benefit of turning Cominco into a pure mineral exploration, mining and metals processing company. Cominco's fertiliser division posted operating earnings of CDollars 29.1m in 1992 on sales of CDollars 355m.</p>

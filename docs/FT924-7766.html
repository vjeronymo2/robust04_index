			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Recession catches up with less-hit areas THE RECESSION has caught up with parts of the UK which had previously escaped the worst of the country's economic woes. A regional breakdown of the latest Confederation of British Industry survey of manufacturing trends, carried out with Business Strategies Limited, the economics consultancy, shows that Scotland and Wales are being affected by the economic gloom prevailing elsewhere. The survey found that overall business confidence has weakened with total output expected to fall in every region except the north-west and the Yorkshire and Humberside area over the next four months. Mr Richard Holt, associate director of Business Strategies, cautioned that the survey - held between September 23 and October 14 - was conducted too soon after the pound had been devalued for the implications for the economy to be assessed fully. Sterling's devaluation, however, has improved the sentiment about exports across the country, while some regions will do well out of measures announced in the Autumn Statement. The west Midlands should benefit from the abolition of car tax, while Scotland and south-west England, where many investment goods are produced, are expected to benefit from improved capital allowances. The north: export orders have increased for the first time for a year, although home market orders continue to fall. After a brief revival over the past two quarters, optimism about the general business situation has dropped. Yorkshire and Humberside: optimism about export performance has surged, suggesting an export-led recovery in output over the next four months. But job losses will continue to rise rapidly and general business confidence remains low. East Midlands: a rise in export demand is expected over the next four months, but orders have continued falling. Unit costs and prices are expected to increase in the months ahead following the devaluation of sterling. East Anglia: business optimism deteriorated as companies reported a sharp fall in demand. Average home and export prices have decreased since the summer and more companies than not have cut their unit costs. London and the south-east: the fall in orders has accelerated for the second consecutive survey. South-west: demand has continued to fall but at its slowest rate for two years. A rise in export orders is now expected to offset weak home demand. West Midlands: the fall in orders was less sharp than in the rest of the country. Total orders are expected to stabilise over the next four months and rapid growth in export orders is forecast. North-west: output has fallen more quickly since the summer than at any time for three years. A slight increase is now expected. Optimism about exports has improved. Wales: demand and output fell sharply over the past four months. Earlier indications that the recession was ending have disappeared. Pressure on profit margins remains strong. Investment in plant and machinery is expected to fall. Scotland: total orders continued to fall and export demand looks set to remain weak in spite of sterling's devaluation. With widespread excess capacity, investment intentions remain weak. Northern Ireland: another increase in new orders is reported, against the national trend. Export orders have grown strongly. Employment has risen slightly.</p>

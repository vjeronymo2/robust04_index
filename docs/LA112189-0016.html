			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> NOVELTY BY 'BLACK CHOREOGRAPHERS' AT WADSWORTH  </P> <P> Icons of refinement began each half of the Saturday program in the "Black  Choreographers Moving Toward the 21st Century" festival at the Wadsworth  Theatre.  </P> <P> First came San Francisco Ballet principal Christopher Boatwright, dancing  Alonzo King's "Prayer" (music by Al Koran Alkarin) with his customary nobility  and a superb mastery of all the solo's surprising inversions and enhancements  of classical style.  </P> <P> Later on, L. Martina Young appeared in "Oath: State of Recurrent Intimacies"  (an unaccompanied solo excerpt from her "America Flats"), shaping every mobile  balance-in-extension, every statement of technical prowess into a triumphant  victory over gravity, time and fear.  </P> <P> Boatwright made his virtuosity look natural and easy, Young forced you to  consider dancing, moment-by-moment, as a metaphysical miracle. Both helped the  festival deconstruct limited notions of black choreography in a program  dominated by pure-dance issues.  </P> <P> Each featuring nine dancers, King's "Untitled" (for the Bay Area-based Lines  Dance Company) and Donald Byrd's "Rend" (for The Group, from New York City)  sought to update ballet rhetoric and technique -- King from the inside, Byrd  from the outside.  </P> <P> As in his solo for Boatwright, King experimented with torso fluidity, with  conventional classical steps executed from unconventional positions, with  movement patterns in which control suddenly yielded to raw impulse.  </P> <P> Strongly danced (especially by Marina Hotchkiss), this was highly arbitrary and  self-conscious choreography -- but spectacularly promising too.  </P> <P> A neo-Armitage essay in Fascist control, "Rend" framed manic solos by Tricia  Toliver with semaphoric group assaults -- all very difficult and nasty, but as  much a commentary as a showpiece. Byrd has always tested his audience as much  as himself and some of his best works have been double-edged.  </P> <P> Lula Washington's "Initiations" (for L.A. Contemporary Dance Theatre) began  like the cell scene in "Petrushka" (a dancer flung through a doorway),  developed into a "No Exit"-style triangle and used a lot of obvious mime plus a  little flamboyant dancing to suggest the way deprivation fuels rage, and the  price that society exacts for acceptance. Washington has a genuine talent for  characterization and movement expression; none of it was evident here.  </P> <P> Intense, inventive scores by Donald Fontowitz, Mio Morales and Robert Dale  enhanced the King, Byrd and Washington pieces.

Written Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Chairman of the Trade Policy Staff Committee invites written public comments on the issues to be addressed in the course of negotiations with Bulgaria, Mongolia, Russia, and Ukraine to determine the terms of these countries' accession to the General Agreement and potentially to the World Trade Organization. These terms will be negotiated in bilateral meetings with their governments' representatives and in meetings of their Working Parties, established by the Contracting Parties to the GATT to conduct the negotiations. Public comments were requested on the accession of Bulgaria to the GATT in June 1990, but changes in Bulgaria's trade regime since that time require that we request additional comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee is seeking public comments on the possible effect on U.S. trade of these countries' accession to the GATT/WTO, with particular reference to any trade measures applied by these countries that could be subject to the provisions of the General Agreement or the WTO, including on: (1) Tariff levels or other import measures currently applied by these countries to imports of specific interest to U.S. exporters, (2) export restrictions and charges, (3) conditions in trade in services, (4) trade-related investment measures, (5) protection of intellectual property, (6) customs procedures in the areas of valuation, licensing, application of standards and sanitary and phytosanitary measures, (7) subsidies applied to domestic production and exports that affect trade, (8) government procurement and on trade in civil aircraft, and (9) the overall experiences of U.S. firms in trading with these countries in recent years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee is seeking information on the structure and conduct of these countries' trade policies, on barriers to trade with them, or on any other measure that inhibits imports or artificially stimulates exports to the detriment of U.S. trade interests that can be addressed in the context of the obligations they will undertake with their adherence to the General Agreement and later membership in the WTO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments will be considered in developing the U.S. position and objectives for the examination of the trade regimes of Bulgaria, Mongolia, Russia, and Ukraine in the context of their GATT accession and potential membership in the WTO, and for the bilateral negotiations concerning both the substantive terms of the Protocol of Accession and the establishment of schedules for market access in the areas of agriculture, industrial goods, and services. Information on products or practices subject to these negotiations should include, whenever appropriate, the import or export tariff classification number used by Bulgaria, Mongolia, Russia, and Ukraine for the product concerned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Persons submitting written comments on Bulgarian or Mongolian accession should provide a statement, in twenty copies, by noon, Friday, June 3, 1994, and on Russian or Ukrainian accession by noon, Friday, June 17, 1994, to Carolyn Frank, TPSC Secretary, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Room 414, 600 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20506. Non-confidential information received will be available for public inspection by appointment, in the USTR Reading Room, 600 17th Street NW., room 101, Washington, DC, Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 12 noon and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. For an appointment call Brenda Webb on 202&hyph;395&hyph;6186.

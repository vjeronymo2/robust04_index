			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> HIGH JINKS AMID HEROICS IN 'HENRY V'  </P> <P> With its handsome Elizabethan stage and period look, Orange Coast College's  "Henry V" seems to promise at the outset a respectable and authentic approach  to Shakespeare.  </P> <P> But things get prickly soon enough. By the time Nym, Bardolph and Pistol show  up, director Alex Golson has let the high jinks out of the bag. His young  actors (Peter Roche as Nym, William C. Meadows as Bardolph and Karl A. Person  as Pistol) goof off -- silly swordplay, face-making, that sort of thing -- and  it does the production little good.  </P> <P> To be fair, there is much parody in these braggart servants-cum-reluctant  soldiers -- and the 17th-Century English stage was known for its fits of  ribaldry -- but turning the trio into the Three Stooges with a Bard's-eye-view  is too much. Further, it disrupts the tone that is so crucial to the drama: a  telling of heroics and the savagery of war.  </P> <P> Golson does get back to basics, but even then he can't resist the occasional  flippancy. Still, this production features a nicely turned collegiate  performance by Mike Thompson as King Henry in his most masterful moments as  leader, manipulator and even flirt.  </P> <P> Thompson may not find the notes of romantic fatalism and regret in the glorious  "St. Crispian's Day" speech ("We few, we happy few, we band of brothers") on  the eve of battle with the French, but he makes it a rousing call to arms. And  his wooing of Princess Katharine (played attractively as the height of coyness  by Glynna Goff) has awkward charm. To be sure, he seems more like a youthful  Prince Hal than the more mature King, but in that respect, Thompson's own age  plays against him.  </P> <P> On the technical side, David Scaglione's set, with its tall archways, balcony  and entrance paths, is a fine-looking representation of the stage during  Shakespeare's day. Jane Hobson's lighting is rudimentary but gets the job done,  and Dawna Oak's costumes are a mixed bag, some being rich and elegant, others  more economical and pedestrian.  </P> <P> 'HENRY V'  </P> <P> An Orange Coast College production of Shakespeare's historical drama.

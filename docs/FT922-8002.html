			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: GPA to enlarge UK and Irish float GPA is planning to sell more shares in the UK and Ireland in next month's flotation, according to indicative figures published in the preliminary registration in the US. The filing came as Mr Tony Ryan, chairman of the aircraft leasing group, yesterday launched the pathfinder UK and Ireland prospectus which values the shares on offer at about Dollars 800m (Pounds 452m) and the group as a whole at Dollars 2.4bn. As reported, the company is issuing 28m new shares and 12m of the 95m existing shares, excluding convertibles, are to be sold by existing shareholders. The 40m new shares (which are doubled following a 1-for-1 scrip issue) are to be priced between Dollars 10 and Dollars 12.50. American depository receipts, comprising of two shares, will be priced between Dollars 20 and Dollars 25. Advisers to the sale said the allocation between UK and Ireland, New York, Japan and the rest of the world would depend on demand. However, the US preliminary registration document, which gives indicative figures, shows that the group expects to sell slightly more shares in the UK with the rest evenly split although amounts may change by the time of the sale. A UK prospectus offer for sale will be published on Monday June 8 with pricing, allocation and commencement of the sale on June 17. GPA also confirmed that 75 per cent of its shareholders had agreed to a binding lock-up agreement not to sell their shares for a year after the float, with a further 11 per cent giving morally binding commitments. Nomura, the Japanese global co-ordinator, is confident of persuading a few of the 14 per cent of shareholders which have not signed a binding lock-up agreement to do so within the month. The group also announced its year end results which showed a 2 per cent increase in after-tax profits to Dollars 268m (Dollars 262m) for the year ended March 31 1992. Fully diluted earnings per share were up 4 per cent to Dollars 2.30 (Dollars 2.21). Mr Maurice Foley, chief executive, said the results showed the resilience of the group during the 'most severe recession since the beginning of the jet era'. The extent to which the company evolved over the past few years was illustrated by the lastest breakdown of revenues. Over the past year aircraft leasing increased to 42 per cent or Dollars 837m while sales of aircraft fell back to 56 per cent or Dollars 1.1bn. Fees, commission and other income accounted for just 2 per cent or Dollars 46m. See Lex</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / French left wanting: The Socialists face a dilemma ahead of the presidential election Last week, in a telling post-script to the collapse of the French Socialist party, Michel Rocard, long-standing star of the party, finally abandoned his presidential ambitions. It was a poignant and symbolic moment in the postwar history of French politics. And it raises the question whether the Socialists can pull themselves together, and if so, how and on what terms. For 20 years and more, this intelligent man's popularity made it seem almost inevitable that he would one day contest, and might win, the presidency. Only three things stood in his way: President Francois Mitterrand, the factionalism of the Socialist party, and its eventual disintegration. Between them, they put paid to Mr Rocard's presidential ambitions. President Mitterrand cordially disliked Mr Rocard for his intelligence, for his popularity, and for his insubordinate ambitions; and since Mr Mitterrand dominated the Socialist party, he had the whip hand. In the run-up to two presidential elections Mr Rocard virtually declared his candidacy; on both occasions he withdrew in favour of Mr Mitterrand, but these retreats did not earn him Mr Mitterrand's gratitude, merely scorn for his weakness and anger for his offence of lese-majeste. Mr Mitterrand was determined Mr Rocard should not succeed him in the Elysee Palace. For nearly 20 years Mr Mitterrand maintained his dominance of the Socialist party by manipulating rival clans or courants. But by 1990 his power was waning, and the faction leaders precipitated the inevitable power struggle for the succession. In an early spasm of this struggle, it looked as though Mr Rocard would be the primary beneficiary, when he negotiated a token endorsement as the party's future presidential candidate. But this window of hope swung shut with the Socialists' massive defeat in the general election of 1993: Mr Rocard lost his seat in the National Assembly, and though he briefly seized formal control of the Socialist party machine, he was himself thrown out this year, when he led the party to an even more catastrophic defeat in the European Parliament elections. Last week Rocard let it be known that he would be giving up his position as mayor of the town of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the western outskirts of Paris. His friends claim that he will continue to play a leading role in the party. But the commentators and the opinion polls tell a different story: Mr Rocard is out of the running, almost certainly for good. But the Socialist party is not out of the running. It has been battered by its recent electoral defeats, but there is a general presumption that it ought to be able to recover some of the lost ground. In this year's European Parliament elections, the Socialists sank to an abysmal 14.5 per cent of the vote, and the communists to less than 7 per cent. Nobody believes that what used to be called the left-wing electorate - 48 per cent in the 1988 general election - has disappeared, especially not in a period of economic woe. The problem is how to recover the lost voters. The immediate focus of attention is the presidential election campaign next spring, since in France the presidency determines everything. And with the evaporation of Mr Rocard as the Socialist party candidate, it is being assumed his place will be taken by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, who has the merits of being French, socialist and popular with the French electorate. Since his tenure in Brussels expires at the end of this year, he will be available just in time for the French presidential election campaign. And yet his relationship with the party may be a difficult one. Mr Delors is not by temperament a fighter, nor is he a seasoned political campaigner; and though he is a member of the Socialist party, many in the party distrust him for being, not just a Social Democrat (like Mr Rocard), but in effect a Christian Democrat. Since he is not a fighter, it seems unlikely he will stand unless he is sure of the unanimous support of the party. But this is a party which is, and has always been, structurally divided; and it will not willingly surrender to an outsider, except after laborious negotiations or in desperation. On the surface, the Socialists' dilemma seems acute, because of their recent defeats. But their biggest problem is one affecting the whole political establishment: popular revulsion against the traditional parties of government. The most spectacular result in this year's European elections may have been the drop in the Socialist vote; but it was perhaps less significant than the fact that the governing conservative parties scored less than 26 per cent. The specifics of this election result can be partly explained by the mobilisation of anti-Maastricht sentiment, notably by the ultra-nationalist group led by Mr Philippe de Villiers. But you only have to go back to the regional elections of 1992, to find a similar desertion of the traditional parties of government, in favour of minority and protest parties. The basic rule for the presidential election is simple: you can't get elected except as the candidate of a major party of government. Raymond Barre campaigned as a solitary figure in 1988, and scored a respectable 17 per cent, but he could not be elected. But recent elections indicate the French dislike and distrust their traditional political parties. In other words, it is possible Mr Delors could be elected as standard bearer for the Socialists, even though the party is now intensely unpopular, and many traditional Socialists distrust him. This would pose, in extreme form, the ambiguity of the French constitution between its parliamentary and its presidential aspects.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Consortium wants entire Rosyth site Three companies and a Scottish bank have formed a consortium which would seek to take over the entire Ministry of Defence site at Rosyth on the Firth of Forth. It would develop parts of it for commercial use, allowing the navy to continue to use the areas it needed for defence purposes. The Ministry of Defence is currently seeking bids for the privately-operated Rosyth Royal Naval Dockyard as well as its counterpart at Devonport. But the Rosyth 2000 consortium, which was launched yesterday, proposes buying the entire 1,200-acre MoD site at Rosyth, which also includes the Rosyth naval base, housing and other facilities, a tank farm, and farmland. The consortium consists of Babcock International, which operates the naval dockyard; Forth Ports, the quoted company which runs all the ports on the Forth estuary; ScottishPower, the electricity company; and Bank of Scotland. Babcock International will be lodging a separate indicative bid for the dockyard by the end of this month with a view to acquiring it by 1996. But like the other consortium members it believes there should be a comprehensive approach to developing the entire site. Rosyth 2000 envisages leasing back to the navy the Rosyth naval base, which is being scaled down to a support facility in two years' time with the loss of 700 civilian jobs. Under its scheme the dockyard would continue to be commercially managed by Babcock International. Forth Ports would establish a commercial port along the unused waterfront and use it for shipping bulk cargoes. It could also establish a roll-on roll-off freight and passenger terminal. 'The new port would be a long-term development to complement our existing major ports of Leith and Grangemouth,' said Mr Hugh Thompson, Forth Ports' chief executive. 'It would have the advantage of excellent access to the motorway system and a lot of land behind it for ancillary developments.' Other vacant or under-utilised land would be developed as an industrial estate or business park, in conjunction with Fife Enterprise, the local enterprise company, and the local authorities. Redundant naval housing and leisure facilities could be developed for civilian use. 'It's important to take an overall, helicopter-like view of the development of this site, rather than see it developed piecemeal,' Mr Thompson said. ScottishPower would develop and operate the utilities on the site for the use of occupants. Bank of Scotland, whose general manager Mr Gavin Masterton is acting chairman of Rosyth 2000, would provide financial backing for the new venture. Rosyth 2000 has held preliminary discussions with the MoD and the Scottish Office over the past six months. So far the MoD has not given its view but Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary and an Edinburgh MP, is known to be interested in it. The consortium refused yesterday to indicate how much it would have to bid for the site. It pointed out that along with the assets it would also be taking on substantial liabilities. Although the nuclear risks should be contained within the dockyard there was likely to be contamination from the tank farm, which dates back to the first world war, and considerable other industrial pollution.</p>

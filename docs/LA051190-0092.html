Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland)  that would create a universal health insurance program for all Californians,  financed by a payroll tax, increased sales taxes and possibly a higher income  tax.  </P> <P> Both measures now go to the Revenue and Taxation Committee for further  consideration.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, an Assembly Finance and Insurance subcommittee is holding hearings  on a third bill (AB 3032) by Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) to require  employers to provide health insurance for their employees.  </P> <P> GOVERNOR  </P> <P> Signed into law a bill (AB 1314) by Assemblyman Steve Clute (D-Riverside) to  require automobile dealers to report all cash transactions exceeding $10,000 to  the state Department of Justice to help crack down on illegal drug dealers.  </P> <P> Issued a proclamation designating May as Water Awareness Month in California.  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY  </P> <P> Floor Action  </P> <P> Airline Fares: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 44-21 vote a bill (AB 3508)  by Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco) to make intrastate airline fares  subject to regulation by the Public Utilities Commission.  </P> <P> Maritime Academy: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 47-23 vote a bill (AB  3038) by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South San Francisco) to make  gubernatorial appointments to the Board of Directors of the California Maritime  Academy subject to state Senate confirmation.

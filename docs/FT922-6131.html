			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Bouygues to raise fresh capital BOUYGUES, one of the world's largest construction groups, is to raise FFr1.04bn (Dollars 180m) of new equity capital, the first leading French quoted company to launch a big rights issue in the present stock market rally. The group is to issue 1.712m new shares at FFr610 each, a 5.4 per cent discount to yesterday's opening price, to help 'pursue the development of its mainstream activities and its diversification in France and abroad,' said Bouygues. It was interested in buying parts - but not all - of Elbo, the east German construction group being privatised, said Mr Martin Bouygues, chairman. He predicted the group's profits would rise this year from last year's FFr635m net on turnover of around FFr64bn, about the same as in 1991. Stockmarket analysts had expected Bouygues to take advantage of the recent strength of its share price, up by 20 per cent from mid-February, the start of the stock market rally, to a peak of FFr675 in mid-May. However, the share price fell FFr19 to FFr626 by yesterday afternoon, on fears that the rights issue would dilute earnings per share. Other leading French groups will soon follow Bouygues' example while share prices continue their strength, said Mr David Harrington, research analyst at James Capel in Paris. Bouygues has not had a rights issue for six years and was thought undercapitalised in relation to total assets. Its debts stood at an estimated 46 per cent of shareholders' funds at the end of last year. Nearly three quarters of the issue, FFr744.2m, will be reserved for French shareholders, with the remainder for international investors. Subscriptions will be open from May 28 to June 16. Alcatel Cable has already said it is planning to raise up to FFr1.5bn next month. Others thought likely to benefit from an injection of fresh equity capital include Michelin, the indebted tyre maker, Moulinex, the household appliance group, and Ciments Francais, the construction materials supplier.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 26 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will visit Italy,  France, and Germany from 3 May, and make his debut on the  international stage as a prime minister.    While this will be a trip undertaken on very short notice  after former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's sudden decision  to resign, it is deemed necessary to fill the diplomatic vacuum  resulting from the domestic political confusion. Hata has also  decided to push through with the European visit because of the  need to establish a relationship of trust with leaders of  European countries before the meeting of leaders of the advanced  nations (Naples summit) in July. Furthermore, since cooperation  with the European states is closely linked to a breakthrough in  Japan-U.S. relations, the primary diplomatic task for Japan at  the moment, the prime minister is expected to face a serious  diplomatic challenge immediately after his assumption of office.    Hata is scheduled to hold talks with French President  Francois Mitterrand, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the new  Italian prime minister during his European tour. However, the  political situation in Italy remains volatile, and the new prime  minister may not be chosen before Hata's visit.    This visit to Europe was originally planned for former Prime  Minister Hosokawa during the Golden Week holidays [29 April-5  May]. Hata has decided to comply with the original schedule as  the successor to Hosokawa.    During his meetings with European leaders, Hata is expected  to convey the message that, even after the change of political  regimes, Japan's basic policies will remain unchanged under the  new administration, and the Hosokawa administration's reform  policy of market liberalization through deregulation and other  measures will be maintained and further developed.    Russia's participation in the Naples summit will also be a  major item on the agenda. Hata will also exchange views with  the European leaders on the DPRK's development of nuclear  devices, and the situation in the former Yugoslavia.    Both the Japanese ruling and opposition parties agree that  the primary diplomatic issue for the new administration is how  to effect a breakthrough in the stalled Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks. The government would like to find a solution  before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting to be held during the  Naples summit.    In this connection, since the European countries have  consistently taken the position that the numerical targets  demanded by the United States may contribute to managed trade,  the Japanese Government believes that "the prime minister's  upcoming visit to Europe will be important for Japan's relations  with the United States" (according to a Foreign Ministry source).</p>

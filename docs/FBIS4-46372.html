			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza, from Mustafa al-Sawwaf, AL-NAHAR Documentation  and Press Office -- Dr. Ibrahim al-Yazuri, one of the leaders of  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in the Gaza Strip, has  stressed the need for postponing talks on forming a political  party until things settle down and we can see how democratic the  self-rule authority will be.    He said that the notion of forming an Islamic political  party  is good for presenting concepts from an Islamic perspective  under the National Authority. But, he added, there are  drawbacks, such as the need to obtain a permit from the  Authority to set up such a party. This Authority has not been  elected or established by the masses.    Al-Yazuri continued by saying that he is inclined to form an  opposition front that includes all factions opposed to the  agreement because this front, unlike a party, would not need a  permit from the Authority. According to al-Yazuri, the  Authority established by the agreements signed in Oslo and Cairo  has conceded many Palestinian rights and there is nothing  positive about it other than the return of the Palestinian  police and deportees.    Al-Yazuri denied recent statements made by Major General  Nasr  Yusuf [commander of the Palestinian police] that the latter has  contacted or met with Dr. al-Yazuri to discuss last week's  incidents of kidnapping and killing agents. He stressed that he  has no knowledge of such meetings or contacts, adding that this  claim is baseless.</p>

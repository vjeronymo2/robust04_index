			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- The House of Representatives  Budget Committee decided Thursday [2 June] night to summon a  former high-ranking trade ministry official as a witness to  explain why he was dismissed last year by then Trade Minister  Hiroshi Kumagai.    Committee chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi announced he will go  along with opposition demands that Masahisa Naito, former head  of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Industrial  Policy Bureau, appear before the panel on Monday to explain why  he was sacked by MITI Minister Kumagai.    Kumagai reportedly fired Naito for his alleged favoritism in  personnel matters within MITI.    The demands by the two largest opposition parties -- the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party  (SDP) -- stalled Diet proceedings, and the ruling minority  coalition finally relented.    During the budget panel's Thursday morning session, LDP  lawmaker Kiyoshi Mizuno blasted Kumagai, currently chief cabinet  secretary, for his alleged conspiracy to get rid of Naito by  distributing defamatory pamphlets critical of Naito.</p>

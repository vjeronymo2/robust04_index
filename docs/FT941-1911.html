			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: MTM share placing to help fund Pounds 12m acquisition MTM, the chemicals company which sold most of its businesses last year to repay its bankers, is proposing its first acquisition since its financial reconstruction. It is to pay up to Pounds 11.8m for Colin Stewart Minchem, a minerals and chemicals processor which was a Pounds 5.5m management buy-out from Benjamin Priest in 1989. The purchase will be funded partly by a placing of 9.7m shares at 60p, for which existing investors can apply on a 3-for-8 basis. Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, has also placed most of the shares which MTM's bankers agreed to swap for Pounds 28.9m of their loans last April. In August, MTM outlined a new strategy of acquiring technology-related businesses which are either profitable, cash-generative and with a strong management team, or are emerging businesses which are expected to be profitable within 12 months. Colin Stewart Minchem falls into the first category. Based in Winsford, Cheshire, it processes minerals and chemicals mainly for the detergent industry which accounts for 80 per cent of its sales. One of the three leading detergent companies provides a 'substantial' proportion of its gross profits. Ignoring one large contract in 1991 sales and operating profits of CSM have risen steadily, reaching Pounds 10.7m and Pounds 2.08m respectively in the 12 months to March 1993. Mr David Swallow, MTM chairman, said the initial consideration of Pounds 10.5m represented 9.5 times fully taxed earnings for last year with the multiple dropping to 6 if the vendors earn the additional consideration of Pounds 1.3m. This requires operating profits of Pounds 2.8m next year. After the acquisition MTM will have net cash of Pounds 5m and net assets of Pounds 15.8m. MTM also announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 12m for 1993, down from Pounds 59.2m in 1992. The remaining agrochemicals business made an operating profit of Pounds 300,000 on turnover of Pounds 21.1m. After head office costs the continuing activities made an operating loss of Pounds 818,000. Broker Hoare Govett is provisionally forecasting profits of Pounds 2m this year for earnings per share of 5p after 15 per cent tax. COMMENT Given the valuations of most chemicals companies these days this deal looks almost suspiciously cheap, though there is always a risk of Colin Stewart's main customer walking away. MTM will now be hard pushed to repeat the trick by finding a decent earnings enhancing acquisition which can be funded by shares on a multiple of only 12. But a company fresh from a near-death experience and still looking for a chief executive can scarcely expect much better.</p>

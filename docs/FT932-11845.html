			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: German smelters 'under threat' NONE OF Germany's aluminium smelters would survive if present low prices continued into 1994, said Mr Karl Wobbe, management board member responsible for production at VAW Aluminium. Even VAW's most-efficient and biggest smelter, the 210,000 tonnes-a-year plant at Neuss, would have to close unless the London Metal Exchange price recovered to Dollars 1,200 a tonne and stayed above that level - VAW needed Dollars 1,150 a tonne to cover the smelter's cash costs. The three-month aluminium price closed at Dollars 1,123.75 a tonne on the LME last night. His warning comes at a time when VAW is about to enter negotiations for new power supply contracts for its smelters and EC producers are pressing the European Commission to impose quotas on aluminium imports from Russia. However, Mr Wobbe denied that the threat of closure, which would affect about 1,000 people, was motivated by these factors. 'Even with a new power contract it would not make sense to continue at Neuss at today's prices,' he explained. Total German aluminium output this year would be 25 per cent below the 1988 level at about 550,000 tonnes.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234.219&blank;Gate Arm Lights and Light Cable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule requires that each gate arm light be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visible to approaching motorists. The rule also required that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lights and light wires be secured to the gate arm. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor/management group suggested that the proposed rule be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified to reflect a maintenance requirement. FRA concurs with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this recommendation and is revising the rule to require that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gate arm light be maintained in such condition to be properly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visible to approaching highway users.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires that each gate arm light be maintained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in such condition to be properly visible to approaching highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> users and that lights and light wire be secured to the gate arm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234.221&blank; Lamp Voltage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rule requires that lamp voltage be maintained at no less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 85 percent of its prescribed rating. The National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transportation Safety Board has recommended that FRA establish a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard for minimum lamp voltage at highway-rail grade crossing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning systems. There is a consensus that it is impossible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain lamp voltage at the full rating of the lamp, at all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning system installations. The State of Oregon Public Utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission commented that the rule should require that voltage be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained at 95 percent of the lamp's prescribed rating. FRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agrees that 95 percent, or even 90 percent of the lamp's rating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a desirable voltage and should be maintained when possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, it is not a realistic minimum standard, particularly at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locations where there is great distance from the source of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lamp voltage to the farthest lamp (i.e., lights supported by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cantilever on expansive highway) or at older installations where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light cable upgrades would be required at substantial expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All other commenters were supportive of the 85 percent minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement. The section will ensure that the lamp voltage is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient to provide suitable illumination of the lamp.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires that each lamp shall be maintained at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not less than 85 percent of the prescribed rating for the lamp.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234.223&blank;Gate Arm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule requires that each gate arm, when in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> downward position, extend across each lane of approaching highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traffic and be maintained in a condition sufficient to be clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> viewed by approaching highway users. The proposed rule also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that each gate arm start its downward motion not less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than three seconds after flashing lights begin to operate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assume the horizontal position in a minimum of five seconds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the arrival of any train at the crossing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The labor/management group commented that the rule should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified to reflect a requirement for maintenance of gate arms in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the design of the warning system. They believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it would be inappropriate to establish universal criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for gate arm operation because of the variation in warning system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designs, particularly at locations utilizing four quadrant gates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or other special applications. While FRA does not want to impede  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the development or use of special applications, we do believe it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is important to establish minimum standards for gate arm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations. FRA has revised this section to make clear that, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four-quadrant gate installations, the three second and five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second requirements apply only to entrance gates, (the gates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closest to oncoming traffic).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Jersey Transit commented that there is no demonstrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need for the requirement that gates assume the horizontal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position at least five seconds before the arrival of any train at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the crossing. We disagree. It is important for the highway user  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to have more than a minimal warning of approaching trains. We do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not believe that sufficient warning is provided by only requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that gates reach the horizontal position before arrival of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> train at the crossing. The five second requirement helps to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that the highway user who attempts to cross at the last  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity will be able to clear the crossing or vacate a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stalled vehicle. It will not have any impact on the design of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grade crossing warning systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires that each gate arm, when in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> downward position, shall extend across each lane of approaching  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highway traffic and shall be maintained in a condition sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be clearly viewed by approaching highway users. Each gate arm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall start its downward motion not less than three seconds after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flashing lights begin to operate and shall assume the horizontal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position at least five seconds before the arrival of any train at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the crossing. At those crossings equipped with four quadrant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gates, the timing requirements of this section apply to entrance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gates only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (What It Means To You): Changes to NICs will bite next year - Direct Tax THE BUDGET'S changes to direct taxation are piffling for most taxpayers. By expanding the 20 per cent band by another Pounds 500 from its current Pounds 2,000, all those whose annual pay exceeds their annual income tax allowance by Pounds 2,500 or more - a majority of taxpayers  - will receive an extra Pounds 25 per year. Income taxpayers also know that they have another Pounds 25 to look forward to next year, as the band will expand by another Pounds 500. Much worse news comes from the changes to National Insurance, which will not bite until the 1994-95 tax year. An increase of one percentage point (from 9 to 10 per cent) in the rate at which Class I National Insurance contributions are levied means that those earning Pounds 405 or more per week will be worse off by Pounds 3.51 per week - Pounds 182.52 per year. An extra 1 per cent is also being levied on self-employed contributions. The 10 per cent band rate of NICs will be levied on any weekly earnings in excess of Pounds 54. No NICs need be paid on earnings in excess of Pounds 405. This means that those on Pounds 100 per week will be worse off by 46p per week, those on Pounds 200 will lose Pounds 1.46 weekly, and those on Pounds 300 will be down by Pounds 2.46. However, while the limit remains in place, nobody will be worse off by more than Pounds 3.51 weekly. For the year 1993-94, nobody with two children or more will be worse off, according to the government's figures, with those on Pounds 80 per week set to benefit by 1 per cent per week. In percentage terms, no one who does not receive child benefit will be better off by more than 0.5 per cent per week. Those on Pounds 450 per week stand to be worse off by 0.2 per cent, while those in higher income brackets will be worse off by 0.1 per cent.</p>

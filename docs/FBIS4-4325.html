			<p>CSO     [Text] Jakarta, 31 Jan--The government needs to reactivate  the Small Investment Credit Program (KIK) and the Permanent  Working Capital Credit Program (KMKP) to help small and medium  sized business firms to grow. Based on the experience of a few  years ago, it was proved that the KIK and KMKP programs were  able to help business firms become strong.    This was stated by Sukamdani Sahid Gitosardjono, president  of  the Sahid Group of companies, at a seminar on "Indonesian  Economic and Financial Prospects During 1994," held by HIPMI  Jaya [Indonesian Young Businessmen's Association of Greater  Jakarta] in Jakarta on 29 January.    According to Sukamdani, one cause of success in extending  KIK  and KMKP loans to help small and medium size businesses in  Indonesia was that the criteria and the objectives were clear.  These loans were really extended to those who needed them. This  situation differs greatly from loans extended under the present,  Small Business Loans Program (KUK), although both programs have  been aimed at small and medium size businesses.    Sukamdani said that the criteria used under the KUK program,  which replaced the KIK and KMKP programs, were unclear and  confused. He said: "Loans provided to small businesses under the  KUK program have an upper limit of 200 million rupiahs. Small  businesses do not need so much money. In the past a KIK loan for  one million rupiahs was unusual."    He said that previously the government, through the KIK and  KMKP programs, successfully strengthened small and medium size  businesses. He asked why these programs were not continued.    Regarding the statement of the minister of finance that  loans  will be extended to small and medium size businesses through  government owned banks, Sukamdani expressed the hope that before  this statement becomes a government regulation a dialogue needs  to be held. This is because in a dialogue views closer to the  real situation can be obtained.    He said: "The government is `committed' to this program. We  must 373 provide our inputs through a dialogue. This can also be  done through the mass media."    Later on he said that converting small- and medium-sized  businesses into large companies is presently difficult because  there are structural and sectoral obstacles in the way. In  structural terms the development of small and medium size  businesses requires the "political will" of the government on a  continuing basis. In fact the government often follows a "mixed  strategy."    On the one hand the government develops "capital intensive"  industries, particularly downstream industry. However, at the  same time small- and medium-sized industries are also encouraged  to grow.    In sectoral terms agricultural products produced on the farm  and mineral products do not have substantial added value and  competitive strength in the market. There are still many  agricultural products which are marketed in raw form. In this  connection there is no other solution than establishing  industries based on technological innovation. This needs to be  done by a working team provided with appropriate guidance,  consisting of experts and persons with practical experience who  have different but mutually related skills.    Meanwhile, Dr Djisman Simandjuntak, director of the Prasetya  Mulya Executive Higher Management School, said that, in fact,  the difficulties facing small and medium size companies in  developing their businesses have been created by the government  itself.    The government is unfair in providing incentives to  businessmen. Often already large companies obtain protection and  incentives more extensive than those extended to small  businesses. Furthermore, there are many business practices which  are still common, such as the formation of cartels which only  benefit big businesses. As a result, the question is not how to  encourage economic growth of about six percent, rather, it is  how to stimulate a higher rate of economic growth and, at the  same time, achieve a balance in all business sectors.</p>

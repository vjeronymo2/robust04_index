			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR MORTGAGE;  </P> <P> HIDDEN COSTS OF ARM CONVERSION;  </P> <P> REFINANCING: MANY HOMEOWNERS WHO WANT TO CHANGE TO A FIXED-RATE MORTGAGE FIND  THAT IT WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THEY HAD THOUGHT.  </P> <P> When a young commercial artist bought a townhouse with an adjustable-rate  mortgage three years ago, she was delighted with her selection of an ARM that  could be converted to a fixed-rate loan. But as her date for possible  conversion approaches, she is beginning to wonder whether it is such a great  deal after all.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of nerve-racking detail in this conversion process. All this  makes me feel the bank knows a lot more than I do and that they're counting on  that," she says.  </P> <P> Like many Americans who took out convertible ARMs a few years ago with the  expectation of an easy conversion to a market-level fixed-rate loan, the artist  is disappointed. Hours spent pouring over the fine print in her loan documents  have convinced her that conversion will be neither easy nor necessarily  economical.  </P> <P> "Conversion is a nice option, but many times people are surprised at the  interest rate they have to pay," says David Ginsburg, president of Loantech  Inc., a nationwide mortgage advisory firm. "They realize they'll have to pay a  premium for the luxury of getting out of their adjustable-rate mortgage, that  there's no free lunch."  </P> <P> Under typical mortgage contracts, the borrower must be willing to accept an  interest rate three-quarters of a percentage point above the prevailing market  rate to convert, according to Keith Gumbinger, president of HSH Associates, a  financial publishing firm based in Butler, N.J.  </P> <P> That could result in a monthly payment more than $50 over market for a $100,000  loan or more than $100 for a $200,000 loan.  </P> <P> "People think that when they convert they can get that nifty low rate  advertised in the newspaper, but that's just not true," Gumbinger says.  </P> <P> The popularity of convertible ARMs has been accountable to the fact that  "Americans love to have their own way," Gumbinger says. But what many home  buyers failed to realize when they opted for a convertible ARM is that having  your cake and eating it, too, comes at a cost, he says.  </P> <P> Many who took out convertible ARMs a few years ago mistakenly assumed they  could simply convert to a fixed-rate loan bearing the same interest rate  offered to the lender's other customers at time of conversion, Gumbinger says.  </P> <P> What they didn't notice, he says, is that the lender tacks a premium onto the  market rate when a conversion occurs.  </P> <P> The premium is related to a figure known as the "margin." In a conversion  situation, the margin is the amount over and above some prevailing mortgage  interest rate, or "index," that the converting borrower must pay. Once the  margin is added onto the index, many who convert wind up with higher monthly  payments than they projected, mortgage experts say.  </P> <P> To make matters worse, grasping the arcane details of the conversion process  can be difficult. Relatively obscure indexes are commonly used as the basis for  pricing conversions, with the two most common related to wholesale mortgage  rates set by two giant quasi-federal agencies that buy mortgages from the  lenders who make them.  </P> <P> Information on the two Washington-area agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is  not easily found.  </P> <P> Burrowing into the fine print of her loan documents, for instance, the artist  learned that her new mortgage rate after conversion would be pegged to a Fannie  Mae index. But the prose in her loan documents struck her as puzzling at best.  </P> <P> "If you exercise your conversion option, the new fixed interest rate will be  equal to the Fannie Mae required net yield for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages  covered by applicable 60-day Mandatory Delivery Commitments in effect as of the  date forty five (45) days before the conversion date, plus five-eighths of one  percent (.625 percent) rounded to the next highest one-eighth of one percent  (.125 percent)," reads the woman's loan document.  </P> <P> Clerks at the savings bank that originated the artist's mortgage are of little  help in explaining such language or in providing information on where the  Fannie Mae index stands now or has stood in the past, she says. "They act like  Joe's bank &amp; grill," she quips.  </P> <P> Still, mortgage experts say lenders are obligated to provide such information  to borrowers with conversion options. Government agencies such as Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac are a back-up source for data on index behavior. And private  consulting services, such as Loantech will, for a fee, verify that a borrower's  conversion has been correctly executed.  </P> <P> Gumbinger, the HSH Associates mortgage expert, says those with convertible ARMs  shouldn't necessarily assume that conversion is their best option, even though  the up-front fee for a conversion usually runs only $100 to $500 -- a small  amount compared to the cost of a full-blown mortgage refinancing.  </P> <P> He counsels homeowners contemplating conversion to weigh several factors when  deciding how to proceed. These include the interest rate they're currently  paying on their ARM, where they think mortgage rates will go in the future, and  how long they intend to remain in their home.  </P> <P> "If you're only going to be there another year, it probably won't pay you to  convert your ARM," Gumbinger says.  </P> <P> Of course, there are psychological as well as financial reasons to unload an  ARM. Many a homeowner who took out an ARM a couple of years ago has been  unnerved by upward adjustments on their mortgage rate and yearn for the  certainty of a fixed-rate loan -- even if that certainty comes at a price,  mortgage experts observe.  </P> <P> Says the artist: "That's what I bargained for when I took out a convertible  loan and that's what I really want."  </P> <P> Los Angeles Times-Washington Post News Service.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> AVERAGE RATES FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES  </P> <P> Average rates for residential mortgages as of Nov. 2, 1990.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.44IN:1.89IN:1.89IN:2.11IN:2.22IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="6"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Survey  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL SPN="3" CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Conventional Mortgages  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL SPN="2" CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Adjustable Mortgages  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Area  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 15 Year  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 30 Year  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Composite  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1 Year  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Composite  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> National  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.85%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10.18%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10.03%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8.10%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8.39%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> California  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10.15  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10.45  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10.29  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8.39  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8.33  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Connecticut  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.91  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10.23  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10.10  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8.17  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8.37  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Wash.

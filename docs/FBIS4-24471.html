			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch by staff correspondent Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 </F> 1627): "New Policies on Tibet Being Drawn Up by the Central  High-Level Authorities Attempt To Promote the Region's Economy  With Preferential Treatment"]    [Text] Beijing, 29th--An authoritative figure here has  revealed that decisionmakers at the highest level in the central  authorities are stepping up efforts to come to a decision to  develop and open the Tibet Autonomous Region, which represents  one eighth of China, and to pursue a policy there which is even  more open than those in all the special economic zones and  Shanghai's Pudong. The idea is to promote Tibet's economy with  massive and large doses of preferential policies, so that the  region can be incorporated in the country's modernization effort  and launched on the fast track of development as soon as  possible.    This person said that, over the last 40 years, the central  authorities have pumped tens of billions of yuan into Tibet and  have actively supported and assisted its economic development,  regarding it as a matter of great importance. The highest  levels are currently conducting a comprehensive review of their  rule over Tibet and the successes and failures of their policy,  comparing the region's economic development with that of its  neighbors, and studying the experiences gained over the last few  years in border opening. The central authorities believe that  Tibet is now ready to be opened to the outside world,  particularly southern Asia, and has the right conditions for  being incorporated in the country's modernization effort. In  view of its geographic and various unique features, the central  authorities have decided to jump start Tibet's economy with  massive doses of preferential policies. The authoritative  person said that Tibet's unique position among the country's  provinces, cities, and autonomous regions means that the special  policy to be pursued toward Tibet will not be applicable to  other minority nationality autonomous regions.    It is understood that the special preferential policy for  Tibet, which the highest levels in the central authorities are  working on, is only at the discussion stage. It is not known  when it will be unveiled, and there have not been any  disclosures of detailed procedures for the policy. However, the  authoritative figure was certain that the central preferential  polices to be granted to Tibet will be much more favorable than  those for the five special economic zones of Shenzhen, Zhuhai,  Xiamen, Shantou, and Hainan and Shanghai's Pudong.</p>

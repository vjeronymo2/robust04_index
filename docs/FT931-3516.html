			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Rekindling the creative flame - The decline in Japan's entrepreneurial spirit may have far-reaching economic consequences Japan is facing a crisis of entrepreneurship. The sharp downturn in the Japanese economy has brought small business confidence close to the lows it reached at the depths of the 1975 recession caused by the rise in oil prices. Small business bankruptcies are about 40 per cent up on a year ago, compared with about 4 per cent for large companies. Employment in family enterprises is falling at an annual rate of about 10 per cent a year, compared with a continued moderate rise in salaried employment at large businesses. This downturn comes after a lengthy period of stagnation in small business performance, with declining rates of start-up and falling labour and capital productivity. Japanese small companies have been a vital spark of creativity in Japan. Many of the household names of Japanese manufacturing had their roots in entrepreneurial companies, founded after the second world war. The Honda Motor corporation started in a motorbike repair shop and Matsushita, the largest integrated electrical appliance maker in the world started as a small components manufacturer. Small businesses are a vital source of flexibility, acting as sub-contractors to larger groups. They have also provided employment stability. Between 1981 and 1991 the share of employment accounted for by small companies, employing less then 300 workers, was stable in construction and real estate and fell marginally in manufacturing, retailing, financial services, transport and services. About 80 per cent of the Japanese workforce is employed in small companies. The stability of small businesses' share of employment in Japan has been one of the main reasons for the country's low unemployment rate which did not rise above 3 per cent in the 1980s. But there is mounting evidence that the economic downturn has hit Japanese small businesses at a time when they were already running out of steam. A combination of structural factors and the sharp cyclical downturn means small businesses could be facing a shake out which could have far-reaching consequences for the economy. The rate of business start-ups declined from about 7 per cent of all enterprises in the early 1970s to close to 4 per cent in the late 1980s. The net rate of business creation, the number of openings minus the number of business closures, stands at just under 1 per cent, according to official statistics gathered by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. But even that understates the decline in entrepreneurship. Start-ups by independent entrepreneurs now account for less than half of new enterprises. The rest are subsidiaries of large businesses. Moreover Japan's small businesses have gradually become less dynamic. In 1975 they were 62 per cent as productive as Japan's large companies. In 1990 they were only 50 per cent as productive, according to Miti figures. One of the main reasons for the fall in labour productivity is that since the 1970s small businesses have been a vast 'labour-sponge' soaking up workers displaced from manufacturing companies. These have maintained their international competitiveness by streamlining their factories. Now small companies are facing a number of pressures which will force them to restructure too, making it more difficult for them to soak up labour which is being shed from larger companies. As small companies get about 60 per cent of their finance from banks, they are vulnerable to a more restrictive approach to lending by the banks which are burdened by mounting bad loans. Banks are taking a more cautious approach to lending to risky small businesses, after a rapid expansion of lending in the mid-1980s. In manufacturing small sub-contractors will feel the brunt of moves by large companies to cut costs by lengthening product cycles and reducing the number of model variations. This means manufacturers will need fewer components made by fewer suppliers. Small businesses in manufacturing are heavily exposed as about 56 per cent of them are sub-contractors. Small manufacturers generally make less sophisticated products than large companies and are thus more vulnerable to mounting competition from rapidly industrialising low-wage economies. Deregulation in retailing is making it more difficult for small companies to compete with large groups. Between 1988 and 1991, the number of large retail outlets grew by 9.4 per cent, compared with a fall of 1.8 per cent in the number of small shops, according to Miti. Many small companies are trapped by the rise and fall of Japan's land prices. The rise in land prices during the speculative bubble economy of the late 1980s made it difficult for small companies to get started. However, small businesses which used land holdings as collateral to increase their borrowing now face a tight financial squeeze. According to Miti's estimates a 30 per cent fall in land prices would require small businesses to reduce their outstanding debts by about 27 per cent to maintain a constant ratio of debt to assets. Commercial land prices have fallen by between 4 per cent and 20 per cent and are still falling, according to official surveys. The implication is that small businesses will have to devote a growing share of their earnings to paying off debts, rather than investing. In the short term small businesses' hopes of salvation rest with the government. Small businesses are a vital source of support for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The government has begun to cushion them against a credit crunch imposed by the banks restricting their lending. In February, the Ministry of Finance wielded its influence over the commercial banks by officially asking them not to refrain from lending to small businesses. The government has also increased public lending to small businesses through the public sector Peoples' Finance Corporation and the Small Business Finance Corporation. Bank of Japan statistics show public-sector lending is growing in an attempt to offset a sharp fall in the growth rate of bank lending to small companies. At its height in 1987, commercial bank lending to small businesses grew by 18.7 per cent, while the Small Business Finance Corporation's lending contracted by 3.3 per cent. However, since 1990 the roles have been reversed. In 1990 commercial bank lending to small business grew by 11 per cent but public lending rose by almost 20 per cent. In June last year public lending was rising at an annual rate of about 8 per cent, while commercial lending was growing at only 1.3 per cent. Yet the government will be less able to offset the slowdown in commercial bank lending than it was during past downturns. The rise in private-sector lending to small businesses in the 1980s means they are now more heavily dependent upon the banks. In 1983 public sector lending to small businesses was worth about 25 per cent of bank lending, but by last year this figure was only 13 per cent of the bank's outstanding loans. Moreover, the rise in public-sector lending will do nothing to relieve the longer term problems - intensifying competition from the rest of Asia, weaker relationships with their main Japanese clients, sluggish domestic demand and weak balance sheets. The waning of the entrepreneurial spirit is becoming a source of official concern. The government has just begun to address what could prove to be a prolonged period of restructuring. A recent Miti report on small businesses said: 'Considering the major contribution made by active business opening to boosting the country's industrial vigour, the decline in new start-ups, especially by individual entrepreneurs has come to a point where we really need to worry about its grave consequences for the future of the Japanese economy.'</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> Camp Cucamonga (NBC Sunday at 7 p.m.), a new TV movie set in a co-ed summer  camp, offers a lineup of TV series stars plus G. Gordon Liddy.  </P> <P> Pack of Lies (Channel 9 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is a taut, superior 1987 TV movie in  which a suburban London couple allow British agents to spy on their neighbors.  With Ellen Burstyn, Teri Garr and Alan Bates.  </P> <P> Suzanne Pleshette stars in Leona Helmsley: The Queen of Mean (CBS Sunday at 9  p.m.) as the controversial New York hotel magnate.  </P> <P> She Said No (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, stars Veronica Hamel as a  rape victim who is subsequently sued for slander by her attacker (Judd Hirsch).  </P> <P> The Running Man (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), a high energy 1987 futuristic science  fiction thriller concocted by Stephen King under the nom de plume of Richard  Bachman, has a comic book savagery that tends to undercut its own ideas about  the brutalizing aspects of mass media. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a cop  turned fugitive.  </P> <P> Gotham (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 8 p.m.), a 1988 cable  movie is a misfired attempt to update the tough-guy detective movie of the '40s  and give it a supernatural twist. Tommy Lee Jones stars as a down-and-out  gumshoe who accepts a client (Colin Bruce who claims he's haunted by the ghost  of his late wife (Virginia Madsen).  </P> <P> With The Sure Thing (Channel 11 Monday at 8 p.m.) Rob Reiner puts a lively  contemporary spin on "It Happened One Night" when he traps a pair of seemingly  ill-matched Ivy Leaguers (John Cusack, Daphne Zuniga) in the same car heading  to Los Angeles for Christmas.  </P> <P> The new TV movie Casey's Gift: For Love of a Child (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) tells  how next-door neighbors are torn apart when the son of one family drowns  accidentally in the pool of the other. Michael Tucker and Kevin Dobson star.  </P> <P> A delightfully off-the-trails 1968 comedy-Western directed by Sydney Pollack,  The Scalphunters (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) manages a wary, sly reversal of  traditions. Burt Lancaster is a crusty trapper and Ossie Davis is a runaway  slave who happens to be a literate, even effete man of poetry and haute  cuisine.  </P> <P>  The new TV movie Good Night, Sweet Wife: A Murder in Boston (CBS Tuesday at 9  p.m.) is based on the murder case that rocked Boston last October when a young  husband (Ken Olin) tries to place the blame for his wife's death upon a black  man.  </P> <P> In Sunset (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) Wyatt Earp, legendary lawman of the  Old West helps cowboy movie hero Tom Mix solve a Raymond Chandleresque murder  mystery. Unfortunately, this 1986 Blake Edwards film misfires badly. James  Garner is a wonderful Earp, even though a couple of decades too young, but  Bruce Willis' Mix is so lifeless that his subsequent screen stardom came as a  surprise.  </P> <P> Cloak and Dagger (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) is the inspired 1984 reworking  of the 1947 thriller "The Window" in which a boy with an overactive imagination  witnesses a murder but nobody will believe him. Henry Thomas stars as the boy,  who has been given an imaginary hero and constant companion (Dabney Coleman,  who also plays his sorely tried widower-father).  </P></p>

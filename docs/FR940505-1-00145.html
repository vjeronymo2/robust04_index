			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) Baseline reports. As described above, EPA requests comment on requiring airlines to submit baseline reports that provide emissions data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the baseline year of 1990, or some alternative baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting period as discussed in section III.D.4.e.(2)(b) above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Baseline reports would provide EPA with additional detail and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precision for the purpose of establishing the baseline emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inventory, the seasonal emission limits, and, ultimately, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seasonal environmental performance targets. Any revisions to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission limits and environmental performance targets would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made after notice and opportunity for public comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One alternative for implementing a baseline reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement, is to require commercial airline operators to report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data concerning aircraft operations into or out of the basin for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their particular airline in the baseline year of 1990 (or for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1989 and 1990 for the purpose of calculating a two-year average).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Airlines would submit this data to EPA no later than 180 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following finalization of this rule. These reports could also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide information on ground access vehicles under the direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control of airlines for incorporation into the control strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More specifically, the baseline reports could include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following information to be provided by airlines:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Aircraft type and model, engine type and model, and number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of landing/take-off operations (LTOs). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Taxi/idle time by engine for each flight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) operating time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ground Support Equipment (GSE) population by type. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;GSE activity by fuel type, engine size, and annual use hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recognizes that detailed information may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available in each of these categories for 1990. In these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances affected airlines could report estimated data; such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates would be accompanied by a description of the estimation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology used, including any supporting data. Alternatively,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA could establish a set of default values for use in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absence of detailed data, as described above. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comment on these and other baseline report alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Annual compliance determination reports. Beginning with a report describing activity during the 1999 ozone season, the FIP will require commercial airlines to submit annual reports within 60 days of the close of each calendar year. These reports will include information on aircraft-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions and airline activity for the previous year's ozone season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commercial airline operators will be required to submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual reports describing regulated aircraft-related activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and emissions in each control area for their airline during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preceeding year's ozone season beginning in 1999. These annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions/activity reports will be submitted to EPA within 60  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days of the close of each calendar year; the first report thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be due by March 1, 2000. Initiating these annual reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1999 will provide airlines and EPA with an opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assess data-gathering and -analysis requirements well in advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the first emission targets in 2001, as well as providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines with important information on their performance needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the first round of required reductions. Subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual reports will be used to determine compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seasonal emission targets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure to submit an annual emissions/activity report will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject an airline to EPA enforcement. Affected airlines will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to maintain appropriate data collection equipment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures necessary to complete the annual report in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfactory manner. Failure to maintain such equipment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures also will subject an airline to EPA enforcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Annual emissions/activity reports will include the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information for aircraft and aircraft-related operations during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the seasonal control period:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Flight number for each flight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Aircraft type and model for each flight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Engine type and model for each flight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Taxi/idle time by engine for each flight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) operating time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Number of passengers carried for each flight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Weight of non-passenger cargo for each flight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ground Support Equipment (GSE) population by type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;GSE activity by fuel type, engine size, emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level, and number of hours used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Airlines will be required to track and report actual data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the above information categories. Default values will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepted for the purposes of determining compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental performance target.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reporting airlines will be required to calculate their VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions for the ozone season using the above data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enter these emissions on the report form. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anticipates using existing EPA documents for the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation methodology. Comments are requested on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> desirability of issuing additional specific technical guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning emissions calculations for aircraft and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft-related operations. Reporting airlines also will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to calculate their total PEUs using passenger and cargo  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data, as well as their pounds/PEU emission rate for VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and enter these results on the report form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

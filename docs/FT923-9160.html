			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: French bonds rally on opinion poll support for Treaty FRENCH government bonds rallied to close higher yesterday as the latest opinion poll indicated strong support for the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty on European economic and monetary union. The opinion poll for Paris-Match magazine showed that 64 per cent of respondents were certain to vote at the referendum on September 20. Of these, 56 per cent would vote for the Treaty and 44 per cent against. French bond prices picked up on rumours of the poll results before the figures were released officially, and dealers warned the French bond market was likely to be focusing closely on the polls in the run-up to the referendum. Although the bond market slipped after the official announcement, bond prices closed higher, with the Matif futures contract trading at 105.54 by late afternoon, against the opening level of 105.32. THE results of the French poll helped to lift German bond prices yesterday afternoon, but the market ended the day little changed. News that the Bundesbank had drained DM8.3bn - a larger amount than expected  -depressed bund prices in the morning. The central bank drained cash out of the system and allocated all of the one-month funds at its repo at 9.70 per cent or above. The news heightened concern that the Bundesbank may consider raising the Lombard rate at today's Council meeting. The Lombard rate was left at 9.75 per cent on July 16 when the discount rate was raised from 8.0 per cent to 8.75 per cent. The Liffe bund futures contract moved in a range of 86.82-87.12, ending the day at around 86.97. A further DM1.3bn of the Bundespost's 8 1/4 per cent 10-year bond issue was sold at auction with bids of 99.40 and above accepted. On Tuesday, DM3bn of the bonds were sold. THE UK government bond market slipped yesterday as sterling weakness held the short end of the market in check and expectations of an auction announcement pushed longer-dated issues lower. The 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 fell from 102 27/32 to 102 while in the futures market, the Liffe gilt contract edged up from 96.21 to 96.26 by late afternoon. News that interest rates on National Savings products were to be cut had little impact on the gilt market, dealers said, adding the move was taken as a sign that the government is trying to prevent a rise in mortgage rates. US government securities fell from early gains at the long end yesterday amid mild disappointment that the Treasury's latest quarterly refunding programme did not include a cut in the size of its long bond offering. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond, which had been up 1/4 point at midsession, was down  1/32 at 106 23/32 , yielding 7.427 per cent. The two-year note was slightly firmer, up  1/32 at 99 15/16 to carry a yield of 4.266 per cent. Dealers reported light activity in the market throughout the morning session, although there was some overseas buying at the short end early on. Attention was otherwise focused on the refunding package, which analysts expected to come in around Dollars 36bn. Their forecasts were spot on, but the hoped-for cut in long bond issues never materialised. Consequently, those dealers who had readied themselves in early trading for a rally at the long end sold off some of their bond positions quickly, bringing bond prices down. JAPANESE government bonds tried to test new highs in the cash and futures markets, but profit-taking trimmed early gains and the markets closed lower on the day. The September futures contract, which opened at 105.05, reached a high of 105.18 before falling to close at 104.88. Dealers said the futures contract has approached last week's high of 105.23  -the highest level since October 1989 - on a few occasions recently but has failed to breach this level so far. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 4.91 per cent and moved to 4.96 per cent, corresponding to the low price of the day. The bond traded at a yield of 4.94 per cent in the London trading session.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Beirut AL-'AHD in Arabic on 15 April  publishes on page 5 an approximately 200-word report on a speech  delivered by Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh Na'im  Qasim during a ceremony held at Beirut's Arab University on  Wednesday, 13 April, to honor excellent students. Shaykh Qasim  says in part: "The media ban imposed by the Lebanese Government  aims to deflect attention from the case of the perpetrators of  the church massacre, and to pave the way for Lebanon to  normalize relations with Israel."    On the same page, the paper publishes an approximately  350-word report on a speech by 'Ammar al-Musawi, deputy head of  Hizballah's Political Bureau, at a ceremony organized by  Hizballah on the occasion marking the 14th anniversary of the  martyrdom of Scholar Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr.  Al-Musawi says: "The law on the reorganization of the media is  primarily aimed at silencing the voices rejecting the peace plan  with the enemy." He adds that "the resistance is the chief  loser from closing radios, because without radios, the  resistance cannot communicate with its masses and society."  Al-Musawi calls "for confronting the government's decision  which portends grave consequences."    Pointing to the ongoing "capitulationist" process, al-Musawi  says: "Sixty people were recently killed in al-Ibrahimi Mosque  in Hebron. What have the Arab rulers done regarding crime?"  The Hizballah official goes on to say: "The Arab regimes were  more embarrassed than the Zionists by this massacre. This is  because the Arabs made a treasonous decision. These crimes  expose their treason and collusion. What kind of peace are they  talking about after this massacre which was committed during the  ongoing negotiations which are imposed on the Arabs? Had this  peace been a true peace, they would have allowed us to have our  say. But they want to repress every voice in the name of  stability. They are accusing us of plotting against Lebanon.  Even if for the sake of argument we agree that the logic of  negotiations is sound, we would still be wrong to lay down our  weapons while the enemy owns the most sophisticated planes in  the world and even nuclear weapons."    On another memorial ceremony for martyr al-Sadr held in Burj  al-Barajinah in Beirut, AL-'AHD publishes on page 5 an  approximately 650-word report on an address by Shaykh Muhammad  Yazbik, member of the Hizballah leadership council. After  underlining the feats of the martyr and criticizing the "plot"  against the media, Shaykh Yazbik says: "This plot is a coup  against the nationalists in Lebanon and a conspiracy to abrogate  Lebanon." He adds: "We will not allow this plot to be  implemented against our kinsfolk and people." Shaykh Yazbik  adds: "If they believe that they are paving the way for a peace  settlement, I tell them that they will not succeed in doing so.  Our reply to the Zionist enemy's attacks and massacres will be  carried out in the form of suicide operations by the mujahidin  in the occupied territories and in the form of qualitative  operations by the Islamic resistance."    In a similar memorial ceremony held in Damascus, Ayatollah  Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah delivered an approximately 2,000-word  speech. After devoting the bulk of the address to the occasion,  Fadlallah turns to the ongoing peace process. He says: "There  is much talk, and as al-Sadat used to say, that there can be no  solution without the United States. We have seen the U.S.  solution in Egypt, and we also know the U.S. solution  everywhere, including the current one in Palestine. The U.S.  solution is the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which gives the  Palestinians neither a homeland nor a state." Continuing,  Fadlallah says: "They say that innocent people were killed in  al-Ibrahimi Mosque and in the Israeli bus. But is there any Jew  in Palestine whom you could call innocent? The issue is not one  of carrying arms. He who seized the Palestinian land is an  enemy. He who confiscated the Palestinian house and built a  settlement on the Palestinian land is an enemy. But the United  States wants to convince us that they are innocent." Fadlallah  adds: "The United States wants to place the entire region under  its control, including the region's riches, human beings, land,  policies, economy, and security. The United States seeks to  revoke everything called the Arab world."    In a 1,000-word statement on page 6 issued at the end of its  ordinary meeting, the Bloc of Loyalty to the Resistance  [Hizballah's parliamentary group], notes that "the government's  decision serves the conspiratorial scheme targeted against the  country's principal issues, foremost being the issue of  liberation and resistance." The Bloc concludes its statement,  saying: "With all objectiveness, resolve, and determination, we  call for the cancellation of the government's recent decision  concerning the ban of newscasts and political programs, and we  will make every effort, and everyone is responsible, to wage the  battle of media freedoms until the government reverses its  decisions."    A 500-word interview is carried on page 9 with Dr. 'Ali  al-Shaykh 'Ammar, deputy head of the Islamic Group Political  Bureau. 'Ammar discusses the ministerial measures concerning  the private radios and says: "These measures involve all of  Lebanon and the Lebanese people and they will have impact on  Lebanon's future and status and on the role being played by the  resistance in confronting the Jewish plan in the region. These  measures should not be allowed to preempt or circumvent the  various effective and influential forces in Lebanon."</p>

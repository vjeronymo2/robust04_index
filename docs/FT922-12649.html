			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Apple suit dismissed in surprise ruling APPLE Computer has suffered a stunning defeat in its landmark copyright infringement suit against competitors Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard with the dismissal of most of Apple's claims by a San Francisco court. Apple filed suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard in 1988 charging that Microsoft's Windows program and Hewlett-Packard's NewWave program infringed upon the copyrighted computer screen displays of Apple's popular Macintosh personal computer. In rulings issued late on Tuesday that surprised all parties, a San Francisco judge granted virtually all of Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard's arguments that elements of the computer displays, such as movable symbols or 'icons' and overlapping windows, are not protected by copyright, either because they do not represent 'unique expressions' or because they were covered by a 1985 licensing agreement between Apple and Microsoft. The suit had cast a cloud over the runaway success of Microsoft's Windows, which provides ease-of-use features similar to the Apple Macintosh for IBM-compatible personal computers. Microsoft has sold over 10m copies of Windows 3.0, a version of the program launched in June 1990. Apple had been expected to seek damages of Dollars 5.5bn according to Microsoft, which recently disclosed the estimate of damages prepared for Apple by an independent expert. Microsoft's stock price surged on news of the rulings, rising to Dollars 129 in midday trading yesterday from a Tuesday close of Dollars 117. Hewlett-Packard was up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 81 5/8 , while Apple gained Dollars  3/4 to trade at Dollars 59 1/2 . Although some issues in the case have yet to be resolved, the rulings have 'substantially narrowed the areas of dispute' Mr Edward Stead, Apple's general counsel, acknowledged. Microsoft and HP officials hailed the rulings as a victory. 'Apple's case has been eviscerated,' said Mr John Stark, an attorney representing Hewlett-Packard. 'If it wasn't a complete victory, it was certainly at least a 95 per cent of the way,' said Mr David McDonald, a lawyer for Microsoft. What remain are 'miniscule' issues such as the appearance of a 'trash can' image that symbolises the process of discarding unwanted data, said Mr Stark. 'It now appears unlikely that the case will go before a jury,' he added. 'The case is over in terms of liability.' Apple is still analysing the rulings said Mr Stead. He indicated, however, he may ask Judge Walker to reconsider his rulings. If that fails, Apple will continue to pursue the remaining elements of the case while considering an appeal. However, Apple's chances of prevailing appear to have been significantly diminished. Lawyers on both sides said the judge appeared to have been strongly influenced by a recent appeals court ruling in a separate software copyright case that rejected the 'overall appearance' approach. In an appeal, Apple would have to persuade the same appeals court to reverse its opinion.</p>

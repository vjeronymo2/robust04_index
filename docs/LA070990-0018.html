			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Ex-Abba Members File Suit: Two members of the disbanded Swedish pop group Abba  are suing their former record company for alleged underpayment of millions of  dollars in royalties. Agnetha Faltskog and Benny Andersson, two members of the  foursome whose hits in the mid-1970s included "Dancing Queen" and "Fernando,"  say that Polar Music International has not carried out an agreement to increase  their royalties to 9% from 3% since January, 1983 -- which could amount to $27  million.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 12 May (MENA) -- Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif  Sidqi has affirmed that the government's policy is characterized  by frankness and openness. He said that what Egypt has so far  achieved is undeniable. Indications that the suffering has  started to decrease are emerging and the country has started to  reap the fruits of economic reform since it has completed the  larger and more difficult part of it.    Dr. Sidqi clarified in statements to AL-AHRAM newspaper to  be  published in its issue of tomorrow, Friday, 13 May, that the  infrastructure in Egypt, on which over 200 billion pounds has  been spent, is ready and able to provide greater production  bases for all aspects of Egyptian life.    He pointed out that the Egyptian economy grew annually by  6.2  percent during the first five-year plan and by 3.9 percent  during the second five-year plan. Growth is expected increase  during the third five-year plan to 5.1 percent, while the budget  deficit will drop to less than 3 percent and inflation to 7  percent instead of 28 percent. This is something that no one  was expecting.    Regarding the project of a thousand a day, by which the  government proposed to realize some economic growth and ease the  burden on the citizens, Dr. Sidqi said that the thousand a day  project has not dwindled at all, as some parties are claiming.  He pointed in this regard to international organizations'  praise for this project.    On the revenue from the sale of the public sector companies,  Dr. 'Atif Sidqi told AL-AHRAM that the revenue will be used as  previously stated by the Government in reforming the structures  of the public sector companies and in providing liquidity for  them, which they are in desperate need of. The revenue will  also be used in modernizing the equipment and developing  production. At the same time, all this will be supervised by  the specialized state organs.    Regarding democratic practices in Egypt, Dr. Sidqi said that  freedom of the press, be it the national newspapers or the  opposition, has gone beyond all expectations. Freedom of  opinion is guaranteed for every citizen; and the deputies of the  People's Assembly, both the supporters and opposition,  interrogate every official about every point, small or major.  The People's Assembly discussions are open to the public.    Dr. Sidqi contemplated the role of the Government in  alerting  the upcoming generations and opening the eyes of the youth about  their religion, saying that this is being taken for granted. He  stressed that the government does not make light of this matter.  He clarified that what has happened is not due to the  Government's failure to perform its duties, but was the result  of misguidance of a small group under the cover of religion. He  added that our guiding banner is the book, the Prophet's  teachings, al-Azhar, and the men of religion who have been  entrusted with affairs of religion.    The prime minister affirmed once again that terrorist groups  are an alien element in Egypt and a phenomenon from which some  foreign countries are not absolved, because they have exploited  some of Egypt's difficulties to plant certain ideas among our  youths, ideas alien to our religious thinking and our homeland,  by giving money to these youths. He said awareness and guidance  are wasted on such people.</p>

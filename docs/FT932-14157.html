			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris falls in spite of further interest rate cut POLITICAL upheaval or the prospect of it vied with interest rate hopes in moving bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was largely unmoved by a further easing in intervention rates, prefering instead to concentrate on comments made by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, on Sunday in which he said that taxes, which he did not specify, may have to be raised in order to cut the budget deficit. The CAC-40 index closed 17.78 lower at 1,968.91 in thin turnover of some FFr2.2bn. Mr Andrew Shepherd-Barron, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said that investors were looking for further interest rate cuts if the historically strong start to the year was not to peter out. However, he added, with the rate differential between France and Germany now at 60 basis points further cuts domestically were effectively ruled out until the Bundesbank moved once again. Both Eurotunnel and Euro Disney featured heavy trading as the former delayed completion of the project and cut its revenue projection for 1994 and the latter was hit by further negative press articles and fears of higher staff costs. Eurotunnel closed off FFr1.30 or 3.4 per cent at FFr37.35 while Euro Disney lost FFr2.80 to FFr81.80. Lafarge was another heavy loser, down FFr6.40 at FFr357.60, after announcing that it was making a Pta36bn share swap bid for full control of Asland, Spain's second biggest cement group, in which it has a 54 per cent stake. MILAN maintained the higher trend established early in the session as exit polls published after the close of voting in the electoral reform referendum confirmed that the country was in the mood for change. The Comit index rose 12.12 or 2.36 per cent to 525.38 as exit polls showed 83 per cent of voters in favour of reform. 'For the first time, investors can start looking at Italy on the fundamentals rather than having to absorb an unnecessarily high political risk,' said Mr Nicholas Potter at Credito Italiano International in London. 'At last the door has been opened whereby tangible progress can be made towards a new style of government, within a sensible time table.' Generali, helped by buy recommendations from London brokers, rose L700 or 1.9 per cent to fix at L36,600 before adding a further L600 after hours. Fiat rose L159 to fix at L6,410 before rising to L6,610 after hours amid signs that it may voluntarily co-operate with magistrates investigating the country's political corruption scandal. FRANKFURT fixed upon the French repo rate move to speculate that the Bundesbank will make significant interest rate cuts on Thursday. The DAX rose 14.45 to 1,693.30, turnover climbing from DM4.8bn to DM6.1bn. Foreign orders, and short-covering on the DTB futures market were reported for VW, Mannesmann and Veba, up DM5.80 to DM323.50, DM5.20 to DM265.70 and DM6.20 to DM394.20 respectively. Veba was also boosted by speculation that its PreussenElektra subsidiary might be floated on markets. The subsidiary denied the speculation. A fall in profits at the specialty chemicals company, Henkel, left it DM4 lower at DM542.50. AMSTERDAM was in a positive mood with a rise in the CBS Tendency index of 0.9 to 110.6. There was interest in cyclical stocks with Akzo putting on Fl 2.00 to Fl 157.30 while ING, which saw an intraday 12-month high, closed up 10 cents at Fl 67.70. MADRID cleared the 240 level, the general index closing 4.29 higher at 244.12 on anticipation of a Bundesbank move. Turnover put on nearly 50 per cent, rising from Pta14.3bn to Pta21.3bn Construction stocks, strong last week on a Pta658bn plan to divert water resources to the south, climbed again on the bid from the French group, Lafarge, for the cement company, Asland. ISTANBUL took fright at the prospect of political upheaval after President Turgut Ozal's sudden death on Saturday and prices plunged by 10.45 per cent. The market index fell 767.23 from Friday's record high to 6,574.14, having rebounded during the last half hour from a day's low of 6,502. The sharp fall was also attributed to a correction after the bull run which had taken the index up 25.19 per cent since April 1, posting eight record high closes on the way. Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders in London noted that the fundamentals responsible for this month's upward surge - a positive corporate outlook, a liquid lira and bank plans to set up equity-based mutual funds - had not changed and he expected the market to pick up again as soon as the political uncertainty was resolved. OSLO edged higher, with the central bank's trimming of the overnight lending rate by 25 basis points to 8.25 per cent coming after the close. The all-share index finished 4.11 higher at 450.66. HELSINKI also benefited from lower rates with a rise in the HEX index of 18.8 or 1.7 per cent to 1,079.4.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- April 19                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1166.43    1167.33    1167.85    1168.40 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1224.08    1224.55    1225.82    1226.28  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1168.93    1168.07    1165.54    1164.59 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1226.28    1224.19    1222.46    1221.99  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Apr 16    Apr 15    Apr 14    Apr 13    Apr 8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1159.61   1156.40   1160.63   1157.54   1151.40 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1217.23   1220.62   1223.50   1220.72   1211.28  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1169.31; 200 - 1226.98 Low/day: 100 - 1164.59 200 - 1221.21 .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

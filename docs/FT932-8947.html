			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Records: The sound of French Baroque - Ronald Crichton on a new 'Castor et Pollux' and a re-issued 'Faust' WILLIAM Christie's recordings with his group Les Arts Florissants are as eagerly awaited as those of John Eliot Gardiner with his London forces. Both excel in bringing style, sympathy and vitality to the fascinating but not foolproof world of French Baroque theatre music. Christie's new Castor et Pollux (HMC 9014353/37, 3 CDs) is well up to standard. Rameau's drama of the half-brothers (sons of Leda, but Pollux's father was divine Jupiter) and the Princess Telare whom they both love is presented with clarity and tautness also with tenderness and relaxation when needed for the dazzling changes of mood and colour in Rameau's skilfully assembled and contrasted divertissements. The dialogues, in recitative with brief airs, are done with spirit and point - following them with the text (English translation provided) makes all the difference. Castor is Howard Crook, a fine high tenor often admired in music of this period, the voice gaining in strength. Brother Pollux is the baritone Jerome Correas, less assured at first but warming up to a deeply account account of the big aria 'Nature, Amour'. As Telare, Agnes Mellon sings the famous 'Tristes apprets' with admirable control. Mellon's voice, too, is gaining in strength and richness. Veronique Gens is a most effective Phebe, an unsympathetic character for whom one nevertheless feels rather sorry. The sonorous Jupiter of Rene Schirrer might with advantage have been placed further from the others - one does not feel he is singing ex machina. Sandrine Piau does full justice to three of the demanding small roles with which stud the score, Mark Padmore likewise catches the attention in two more. Rameau's chorus writing is testing as well as brilliant. The ensembles here are sung with notable trenchancy and rapidity of articulation. The version used is the original of 1737, as given in the Durand score. The music is a joy: only the athletes' dances fail a little below the general level, but perhaps routine triads and trumpets are what those Spartans deserve. I was brought up on the early version and on the whole prefer it while admitting that (as the English Bach Festival Castor at Covent Garden in 1981 memorably showed) the ending from the later, 1754 revision, reflective rather than jubilant, is the more moving of the two finales. Re-issues on CD from the age of 78s continue to throw up treasure. Of major interest is the (almost) complete Faust made in Paris in 1930, conducted by Gounod's friend and pupil, Henri Busser (re-mastered by Ward Marston for Pearl, GEMM CDS 9987, 2 CDs). The sound is elderly and uneven, but so clear is Busser's exposition (this is the 'old' Faust with recitatives) and so high the standard of singing that one soon forgets. The Mephistopheles of Marcel Journet was famous. What a voice, even throughout the range, full of colour, zest and verbal inflections, with plebeian mockery peeping out from beneath a 'gentlemanly' exterior. The bronze-toned Cesar Vezzani's Faust is more heroic than lyrical, a fine example of its kind. Mireille Berthon, a very experienced soprano, is equally apt to the girlish side of Marguerite, the roulades of the Jewel Song and the drama of the church and prison scenes. She lacked a strong vocal personality. Valentin is Louis Musy, a sterling singer who no more shows the unpleasant side of the character than Vezzani suggests Faust's studiousness. Journet apart, they do not 'act with the voice', but lines are beautifully firm and words blessedly clear.</p>

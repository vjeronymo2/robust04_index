			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Citadel storm The apparent storm in a teacup between the two main rightwing contestants for next year's French presidential election looks set to fracture a great deal of Gallic porcelain. For several months, antipathy has been growing between the two main figures in France's Gaullist RPR party, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac, the party leader and mayor of Paris. This week the squabbling has burst into the open following Mr Balladur's accusation that Mr Chirac has been using the Gaullist party as a 'citadel' in which to take refuge from the world outside. Although this almost certainly was not his intention, Mr Balladur has publicly put his finger on a central problem confronting today's inheritors of the mantle of President de Gaulle. Their inability to reconcile the doctrines laid down in his name with the requirements of France and Europe after the end of the cold war represents a crucial political handicap for the right. This failure encouraged disillusioned Gaullists to seek solace in fringe parties in the June elections for the European parliament. France's left wing is in a still more sorry state than the RPR, but the conservative infighting can only benefit Mr Jacques Delors, the Socialist president of the European Commission. If, as expected, he runs for the presidency next year, Mr Delors would rely powerfully on his perceived attractiveness to middle-ground voters - an appeal that Mr Chirac, in particular, manifestly lacks. The recent description of Mr Delors as 'the candidate of German Christian Democracy' by the former Socialist defence minister, Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, was no doubt meant as a jibe, but it could have a prophetic ring. Chancellor Helmut Kohl owes his four successive election victories to his ability to maintain support across a broad swathe of conservative and centrist voters. No present-day French politician can match this appeal. In one sense, the Balladur-Chirac duel reflects the inevitable frustration of like-minded politicians bidding for a prize they covet and suspect may be slipping away. But the squabble also reflects a wider failure of adaptation of the French political system. France badly needs an organised form of preselection of candidates for the presidential elections to avoid a damaging abundance of rivals from the same camp and give their policies clarity and coherence. Another conservative hopeful, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the centre-right UDF grouping, has pointed out that the right has three times fielded rival candidates since 1958 and won. However, the proliferation of wounded pride and wounded egos on the right contributed to Mr Francois Mitterrand's success in the 1988 presidential election, and could conceivably presage another conservative defeat next year. Mr Charles Pasqua, the RPR interior minister, has suggested US-style primary elections to select the right's preferred candidate well in advance of the presidential poll. The idea has been given only a lukewarm reception, yet the right needs to end quickly the rivalry in its own ranks. Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac would be wise to back Mr Pasqua's proposal.</p>

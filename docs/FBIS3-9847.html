Ministers Serreqi  and Daskalov agreed on the extension of joint contacts at all  levels for a great economic-trade cooperation, the protection  and encouragement of investments and further promotion of  cooperation in the context of the Black Sea agreement. Among  the fields of cooperation were transport, trade, education, and  culture. Ministers Serreqi and Daskalov also agreed on an  interparliamentarian cooperation, removal of double taxation and  relations between the academies of sciences and chambers of  commerce of the two countries.    Mr. Daskalov asked from the Albanian party that Albania be a  free trade zone for Bulgaria like some other countries, and the  opening of an exhibition with Bulgarian products in Tirana.  This will serve the promotion of trade cooperation between the  two countries. They also discussed the possibility of  constructing a gas pipeline which will pass across Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], to supply  Albania with gas.    Regarding the situation in the region, the two parties had  similar opinions for the solution of the crisis and the possible  threat of the extension of the conflict in the Balkans. Mr.  Serreqi and Daskalov supported the latest Croatian-Bosnian  agreement. They considered as fundamental element the Kosova  factor and added that the embargo against Serbia must not be  lifted.    Both parties supported the role of the peace-keeping forces  in the former Republic of Macedonia and underlined the need of  the international observers in Kosova as well. Mr. Serreqi  confirmed once more the Albanian point of view that the  relations with the Macedonian state will be conditioned with the  observation of the rights of the Albanians living in Macedonia.</p>

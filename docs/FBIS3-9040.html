On Wednesday [16 March], the President's Office said that a  referendum through which the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS) wanted to solve the question of early elections, the  validity of the mandates of the deputies who have switched  parties and the "origin" of the money used in privatization,  would not take place since the 350,000 signatures, which  according to the Slovak constitution are needed for the  president to call a referendum, were not collected.    The Office said that out of more than 420,000 signatures  collected only 233,000 were valid. This statement provoked  anger on the part of the Petition Committee established by the  HZDS of former Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar.    In a statement given to CTK today, the President's Office  said that Kovac would violate the constitution if he called a  referendum without 350,000 valid signatures.    While checking the validity of the petition sheets the  President's Office proceeded in harmony with the law on  petitions and it considers the accusation of the illegal  interpretation of some of its provisions untrue, deliberate and  non-trustworthy, the statement says.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Last stand before sell-off junction: The concerns underlying a possible Tory backbench revolt over rail privatisation The British have an attachment to their railways out of all proportion to their willingness to use them. Leaving aside the 426,000 season ticket holders who commute daily into central London, most people who own cars (and many who do not) hardly take a train from one year to the next. Yet they regard railways in much the same way as people with private medical insurance regard the National Health Service - they want them to be there, just in case. It is a rash government, then, that dares to tinker with the trains, as Mr John Major is finding to his discomfort. Even before the heavy Conservative defeat at the Newbury by-election and county council polls a fortnight ago, the planned privatisation of British Rail had been dogged by concerns about the possible implications for fares and services. Now, with Conservative backbenchers in no mood for measures that could further reduce party support, the government is facing the possibility of a revolt when the Railways Bill reaches report stage in the Commons next week. On the face of it, this is an avoidable crisis. The rebellious backbenchers say that are not seeking to wreck the legislation; they simply wish to make it more palatable by building in safeguards to protect rail users' interests. But the backbenchers' move raises at least two questions. First, are their fears about the possible consequences of privatisation justified? And if they are, can the legislation be amended without involving the government in an embarrassing climbdown? Underlying the widespread concern about the government's plans for the railways is the fact that this privatisation is unlike those that have gone before. The gas, electricity, water and telecommunications industries were profitable and expanding when they came to the market, so their privatisation was not accompanied by fears of reductions in services. Rail, by contrast, is a heavily loss-making industry in long-term decline, and most of its services exist only because they are propped up by the state. People understandably fear that, if exposed to the full force of commercial reality, the railways would have a very short future. The government has attempted to address these concerns by adopting a hybrid approach to rail privatisation. Only the freight train operations are to be sold outright. The infrastructure - the tracks and signalling - will be hived off to a new state company called Railtrack, while the operation of British Rail's passenger services will be contracted out to whichever private sector operator bids the highest sum for the franchise (or, more likely, bids for the lowest subsidy). It follows that what is going on is not a privatisation in the accepted sense. Freight aside, virtually no assets are to be sold. In terms of day-to-day operations, the railways will be more highly regulated than ever because of the need to supervise private-sector participation through two new bodies, the rail regulator and the franchising director. And since nearly everyone involved in running the passenger railway will remain beholden to the government for subsidy, ministers will retain the right to go on meddling in the railways' affairs at every level. The implication is that the new structure will make little difference. Yet it will bring at least one fundamental change - in the way government subsidy is paid. Under the present system, British Rail is paid block grants each year to cover the costs of operating its loss-making Network SouthEast and Regional Railways divisions, without anyone being aware of exactly where the money is being lost. After privatisation, the profits and losses of each individual route will have to be identified so that would-be franchisees know how much to bid for them. The result could be to show that some lines are losing so much money that the case for closing them becomes irresistible. There is another aspect to the subsidies issue. As long as British Rail is running the railways, the costs imposed by the loss-making lines are partially relieved by the surpluses produced by the profitable routes. Under the new system, the surpluses generated by the profitable services will be pocketed by the companies that win the franchises to operate them, but the public sector will still be paying subsidies to the franchisees running the loss-makers. Perversely, the result is likely to be that privatisation increases rather than decreases the net cost of the railways to the exchequer. How will the government respond to these pressures? The answer is that nobody knows. In theory, the upward pressure on subsidies should be counterbalanced by cost savings resulting from efficiency gains. But the government has given no indication of how great it expects those cost savings to be, nor how it will react if they are insufficient to stop subsidies rising. Is the Treasury going to write a blank cheque guaranteeing that all services will continue to run and that fares will stay unchanged? Since the answer to that question is no, then what? It is this chasm of uncertainty that has given rise to the fears being articulated by Conservative backbenchers. In order to bridge it, they are seeking guarantees that passengers will be protected from line closures, fare increases and the abolition of the London Travelcard scheme. They also want an amendment to the Railways Bill allowing British Rail to bid against the private sector for the passenger service franchises. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, seems unlikely to yield on any of these issues. Where line closures are concerned, no transport minister would promise to keep all railway lines open forever, with or without a blank cheque from the Treasury. As for fares and Travelcards, the amount of regulation facing train operators is already in danger of deterring would-be entrants to the market, and any further inroads into companies' commercial freedom could be in danger of turning rail privatisation into a dead letter. Instead, Mr MacGregor might attempt to defuse backbenchers' concerns through reassurance. Successful private-sector train operators will be those providing services that people want to use, he is likely to argue, so they will have a commercial incentive to offer more and better trains at attractive fares. The purpose of privatisation is the expansion of the railway, he could say, not its contraction. It sounds convincing. It may even be true. But it is not the same as saying that railway privatisation will be painless. By introducing transparency to the allocation of subsidies, privatisation will confront politicians with awkward decisions about the future of unprofitable services. The bureaucracy needed to administer the Travelcard, student railcard and other schemes requiring revenue to be split between several different companies would be costly to run and is unlikely to appear unless someone volunteers to pick up the bill. Some train services will improve, others will disappear; some fares will go up, and others will come down. There would be no point in privatising the railways if nothing changed. It is this point that explains why the backbench amendment least likely to be accepted by the government is the one proposing that British Rail should be allowed to bid for franchises. Conservatives supporting the idea say it is absurd that the people who know more than anyone about running the railways should be prevented from throwing their hat into the ring. The government counters that the point about privatising the railways is to get the running of the trains out of the public sector, but emphasises that existing rail staff will be strongly encouraged to take part in the process through management/ employee buy-outs. In fact, there is another aspect to the British Rail argument. Experience in Sweden has shown how nationalised railways tend to win nearly every time when competing with the private sector for contracts to operate train services. The suspicion is that they do so because they are able to cross-subsidise the contracted-out services with revenues from their other operations. It is not hard to imagine how such a process in Britain could result in the majority of contracts going to British Rail, so reducing the privatisation process to a paper exercise that resulted in everything staying the same. For nervous Conservative backbenchers with an eye on the next election, that might be no bad thing.</p>

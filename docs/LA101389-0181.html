			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> KITTY DUKAKIS TALKS ON ADDICTION  </P> <P> Kitty Dukakis, describing herself as an alcoholic and drug addict, today urged  doctors at a World Congress of Psychiatry to avoid prescribing drugs that may  cause addiction.  </P> <P> "I urge you psychiatrists not to give in to our society's urge for a quick fix,  not to rush to identify drugs as the first solution to your patient's problem,"  Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, said.  </P> <P> Doctors' prescriptions often complicate an alcohol and drug abuse problem,  which addicts carefully hide from their doctors, she told the conference.  </P> <P> Dukakis said her long addiction to amphetamines relapsed to alcoholism after  her husband lost the presidential elections in 1988. "I am an alcoholic and a  drug addict," Dukakis said.  </P> <P> She said diet pills she took as a teen-ager to look slim became a 27-year  amphetamine addiction, which she hid from everyone including her husband.  </P></p>

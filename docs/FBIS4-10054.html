			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon </F> Fournier by Jacobo Zabludovsky; place not given; from the "24  Hours" newscast -- live]    [Excerpt] [Zabludovsky] We will interview Costa Rican  President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier. Good evening, Mr.  President.    [Calderon] Good evening, Jacobo. It is a pleasure to be here  tonight. This is a very important day for my country because  the free trade agreement with Mexico will create extraordinary  opportunities for development in Costa Rica. Our country will  be able to integrate its economy with Mexico's great economy, an  economy with 90 million participants.    [Zabludovsky] Could you briefly tell us how the agreements  signed today will benefit Costa Rica and Mexico?    [Calderon] We must stress one very important aspect: Mexico  has shown its solidarity with Latin America. One of Mexico's  most outstanding foreign policy achievements was the free trade  agreement with the United States, which made it possible to  integrate the Mexican economy into the world's strongest  economy. This creates jobs and will bring development to  Mexico, well-being to the Mexican people, and more opportunities  for all.    By the same token, our free trade agreement with Mexico  means  that Costa Rica is entering a country with a population of 90  million citizens, a country with a growing economy, a country  that will become part of the First World at the beginning of the  21st century through the free trade agreement.    What does it mean for Mexico? As always, Mexico has shown  its solidarity with Latin America. The free trade agreement  with the United States and Canada has made Mexico a stronger  country that has opened its doors to its Latin American  neighbors to give us the same opportunities.    [Zabludovsky] Last night Nicaraguan President Violeta de  Chamorro expressed her hope that Nicaragua will also join this  agreement. Do you think the free trade agreement between Costa  Rica and Mexico can be extended to other countries in the area?    [Calderon] Definitely. That has been President Salinas de  Gortari's wish from the beginning. At a meeting in Tuxtla  Gutierrez three years ago, Central American countries agreed to  sign a free trade agreement with Mexico. Costa Rica had the  opportunity to advance and persevered until the agreement was  signed today. The rest of Central America will follow to  acquire the same advantages that Mexico has given Costa Rica  today. [passage omitted]</p>

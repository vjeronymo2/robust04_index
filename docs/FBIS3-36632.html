This is a result of a meeting between the U.S. President and  leading foreign policy advisers.    Two new events which had not been envisaged in the U.S.  scenario prompted this review, which by all accounts is not  coming easy to the White House. They are, first, the inability  of the reformist section of the former Russian Government to win  sufficiently broad public support, which became a springboard  for Zhirinovskiy's success, and second, the Crimean presidential  election.    In endeavoring to avoid both the triumph of Russian  imperialism and the Yugoslavization of the post-Soviet area, the  White House is markedly deviating from principles which only  recently it was firmly espousing.    First, the United States, which has previously put pressure  on Western borrowers and investors, the World Bank, and the IMF  to make allowances when allocating new loans to Russia, does not  intend to do this any more.    Second, the period during which one of the main purposes of  U.S. aid was to strengthen President Yeltsin's political  influence can be considered to be over. "The impressive  performance of nationalists, communists, and other antireform  forces in the December elections has cooled Washington's ardor  to play Russian politics," THE WASHINGTON POST writes.    Third, the State Department has confirmed that Clinton and  his advisers have reached "firm agreement" about the need to  support Ukraine's intentions to revive its withered economy and  "put an end to disputes with Russia regarding Ukraine's  possession of nuclear weapons."    Fourth, President Leonid Kravchuk, who for a long time was  something akin to persona non grata here, will at last be able  to visit Washington in March. He will be given financial aid in  order to weaken Russia's attractiveness in the eyes of the 12  million ethnic Russians living in Ukraine. It is also proposed  that the aid will be made conditional on the Ukrainians'  agreement to radical economic reforms.    Fifth, the U.S. Administration's reluctance to "pursue new  lines in Europe" is no longer as absolute as it appeared very  recently, during discussion of the "Partnership for Peace"  program. Although Washington does not believe that the Russian  Government will want, or be in a position, to recreate an empire  on the ruins of the USSR, people here will also do all they can  to oppose Russia's domination in this region.    Ukraine is more than just some other republic capable of  serving as a counterweight to the trends making themselves  increasingly manifest in Moscow, and the United States will try  to play the Ukrainian card adroitly.</p>

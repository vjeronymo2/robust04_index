			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Central Europeans resent Nato snub: Russia and former allies take different paths Frustration among central European countries over Nato's approach to enlargement surfaced at a meeting of the 38-member North Atlantic Co-operation Council in Brussels yesterday. Mr Andrzej Olechowsky, the Polish foreign minister, sought to link Nato proposals for military co-operation to a progressive expansion of the alliance. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic said the 'partnership for peace' agreements proposed by Nato would not be an acceptable substitute for membership. They also sought to broaden the scope of the agreement beyond peacekeeping missions to cover full co-operation in areas such as military doctrine and planning. Nato envisages that the agreements, to be formally proposed at a summit next month, would be applicable to all former Warsaw Pact countries and some other European nations, but they would lead to differing degrees of co-operation, in some cases as a prelude to membership. The central European countries are anxious that their membership prospects are not held back by problems with other countries, including Russia. Divergences between them and Moscow emerged over Russian proposals for the future of the NACC, which serves as a forum for Nato to talk to its former Warsaw Pact adversaries. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, proposed making the NACC into an institution separate from Nato, acting as a defence arm for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Aspiring Nato members, to the contrary, want to strengthen the NACC's ties with the alliance. Ministers yesterday agreed to extend NACC discussions to the topics of air defence and arms procurement. However, Polish officials complained that the scope of its work was still too restricted. The US and its allies meanwhile failed to make apparent progress on the elimination of nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory. But Mr Anatoly Zlenko, Ukraine's foreign minister, raised the prospect of tripartite talks between the US, Ukraine and Russia.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  Businessmen Scrutinize Economic Policy </H8>   The business sector "Group of Eight," composed of the  Argentine Banking Association (ABRA), the Argentine Industrial  Union (UIA), the Argentine Union of Construction (UAC), the  Association of Argentine Banks (Adeba), the Commodity Exchange,  the Chamber of Commerce (CAC), the Argentine Construction Board  (CAC), and the Argentine Rural Society (SRA), has decided to  meet regularly, "at intervals no greater than 30 days, to  analyze key aspects of [the Argentine Government's] economic  policy and its political and social implications," reported the  12 May Buenos Aires LA NACION. According to the daily, the  current Constituent Assembly as well as the 1995 presidential  elections are the reasons why this "exclusive" group of  "business organizations most plugged into power" has decided to  meet more frequently. Key topics discussed at the group's second  meeting this year on 11 May were labor flexibility,  privatizations in the provinces, and the deregulation of labor  union and business sector pension plans. "Without labor  flexibility, we won't be able to attack the scourge of  unemployment," asserted Chamber of Commerce President Jorge  Fiori. According to another report in the 11 May LA NACION,  other topics on the agenda were the Argentine Government's  social policy, exports, tariffs, and the desirability of lifting  the economic state of emergency. "Even though there are issues  still pending in the country, economic conditions are no longer  uncertain," according to an unidentified leader of the Argentine  Construction Board.  <H8>  Banks Seek Reduced Costs </H8>   Bankers belonging to the Association of Argentine Banks  (Adeba) have called for the elimination of taxes and other  expenses which "significantly" push up the costs of doing  business and thus the price charged for financial services,  reported the 13 May Buenos Aires LA PRENSA. The main obstacles  to cost reduction cited by Adeba bankers are:    --the social security contribution;    --the Institute of Banking Social Services (ISSB)  contribution, the equivalent of 2 percent of banking commissions  and interest. This expenditure, which is equal to 11.7 percent  of bank personnel salaries and "eats up" 4 percent of  administrative expenses, "must be abolished," insisted the  bankers;    --the absence of a tax deduction from gross earnings for  banking activities in Buenos Aires, where 60 percent of  financial operations take place. Such a tax deduction would save  7 percent of bank administrative costs;    --physical security expenses, which absorb $500,000 monthly  and constitute 2 percent of administrative expenses;    --check-holding requirements, which cause high outlays for  transfers;    --minimum reserve requirements which do not include branch  office assets and funds in transit.    "Even though the peso system has a 40 percent reserve  requirement, in reality it becomes 65 percent of deposits" since  the branch office assets and funds in transit are not included,  continued LA NACION. Eduardo Escasany, Adeba president and Banco  de Galicia head, explained that "the 40 percent reserve is  necessary because there is no guarantee on deposits." He added,  however, that banks "should work with the additional 25  percent."  <H8>  Study of Provincial Financial Markets </H8>   The Association of Argentine Banks (Adeba) and the Argentine  Industrial Union (UIA) have formed a working group to study the  causes of high interest rates in the provinces and their impact  on small and medium-sized businesses (PYMES), reported the 13  May Buenos Aires daily LA PRENSA. The goal of the joint  commission is to evaluate provincial financial markets and come  up with solutions to the high cost of credit which hinders  production.  <H8>  Former Economy Minister on Exports Trend </H8>   While recognizing that Argentina's ratio of exports to Gross  Domestic Product (5 percent) is "pitifully small," former  Economy Minister Roberto Alemann has predicted that the country  will increase exports due to a retooling of businesses, the  recovery of the international economy, and better market access  following the GATT agreement, according to the 8 May Buenos  Aires LA NACION.    After suffering with "the worst trade terms of the century"  for the past two or three years, Alemann asserted, there would  be substantial improvements for agricultural exports. He said it  looked like the 40 million tons of grains that Argentina  exported in 1993 might bring in $1 billion more during 1994 for  a total of $5 billion. As a result of the GATT agreement, he  added, Argentina has secured the sale of 11,000 tons per year of  special cuts of high-quality meat to the European Union (EU) at  a cost of $100 million, as well as an annual 20,000-ton quota  from the United States. "Argentina may also benefit from a  change in the European Union's meat stocks, which dropped 1  million tons in 1993 to less than 400,000." He explained that if  these stocks continue to shrink at such a fast pace, by the end  of 1994 nothing will be left, in which case meat prices may  improve and Argentina may reclaim its role as a great meat  exporter. Alemann concluded that, in general, the outlook for  Argentine exports was favorable due to cuts in U.S. and EU  subsidies, the reduction of quotas, and prospects for better  prices.    Regarding improvements for Argentine exports due to  conditions inside the country, Alemann pointed to hydrocarbons.  "Argentina is already producing around 40 million cubic meters  of oil, a large portion of which is exported. The oil pipeline  to Chile alone channels exports worth $500 million annually."  He also mentioned "the enormous gas field recently discovered  off the coast of Tierra del Fuego," another site under study in  Salta, and the Loma de la Lata-Santiago de Chile gasline as  other good potential sources of foreign exchange. The former  minister added that currently there are 40 mining projects under  way in Argentina. A $600 million investment has been announced  for the Bajo de la Alumbrera site alone, while $100 million will  be invested at Salar de Hombre Muerto. "All this production will  be exported," asserted Alemann. "Argentina will be a great  exporter of lithium and its by-products. For the first time, the  country will be exporting large quantities of minerals, among  them gold, copper, and silver. We'll have to give this sector a  couple of years and the results may be startling."    Alemann also predicted that the fishing sector would  increase  exports by $200 million in 1994.  <H8>  Argentine Businessmen `Prefer Domestic Market' </H8>   According to Secretary for International Economic  Negotiations Jorge Campbell, Argentine businessmen prefer the  domestic market, reported the 8 May Buenos Aires LA NACION. In  response to repeated criticism with regard to the slow growth of  Argentine exports, Campbell explained that the trade balance is  not meaningful unless it reflects permanent links that help  sustain growth. "If sales are not sustainable over time,  businesses, and therefore the economy, will most likely swing  back and forth between export production and production directed  at the domestic market." He said that one of the difficulties of  boosting exports is that production aimed at the domestic market  is "still more profitable." One of the challenges facing  Argentina, he added, is to reach a point at which it makes no  difference to businesses whether they sell to the domestic  market or abroad. Campbell concluded that Argentina needs to  develop an "export culture" that will contribute to "breaking  through [Argentina's] isolation from the rest of the world."</p>

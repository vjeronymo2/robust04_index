This is the first  large-scale meeting since the sixth provincial party committee  was elected. The main subjects discussed at the conference were  to study and implement the guidelines of the third plenary  session of the 14th party Central Committee and the central  rural work conference, to sum up and exchange the experiences in  rural reform and development, to discuss and work out the policy  measures for speeding up the development of agriculture and the  rural economy under the socialist market economic conditions,  and to arrange the agricultural and rural work in 1994 and in  the foreseeable future.    Present at the conference were leading comrades of the  provincial party committee, the provincial people's congress,  the provincial government, and the provincial committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, including  Jiang Chunyun, Zhao Zhihao, Li Chunting, Li Wenquan, Lu Maozeng,  Ma Zhongcai, Dong Fengji, Chen Jianguo, Sun Shuyi, Guo Changcai,  Wang Jiangong, and Wang Yuxi; secretaries of the city and  prefectural party committees; vice mayors (vice commissioners)  in charge of agriculture and the rural economic work; chairmen  of the city and prefectural agricultural commissions; directors  of the town and township enterprise administrative bureaus;  secretaries of the county (city and district) party committees;  and responsible comrades of the provincial-level departments.  Xiao Wanjun, vice chairman of the central policy research  office, attended the conference.    Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and governor of the provincial government, chaired the  conference. Wang Jiangong, vice governor of the provincial  government, relayed the guidelines of the central rural work  conference.    Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee,  made an important speech at the conference.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: According to the guidelines of  the  third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and  the central rural work conference and in line with the actual  conditions, the province should persist in the following basic  ideologies of speeding up the development of agriculture and the  rural economy in the foreseeable future: Unswervingly implement  the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation of the  national economy and persistently put agriculture in the primary  position of the economic work. The development of high-yield,  good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture should be regarded  as the fundamental way for agricultural development. The  cultivation of the mainstay of the market, the improvement of  the market system, the enhancement of the macroeconomic  regulation and control, and the protection of agriculture should  be regarded as the main contents of the rural reform. The  acceleration of the rural economic development, the ceaseless  increase of the peasants' income, and the realization of the  target of becoming fairly well-off should be regarded as the  fundamental starting and ending point of the rural work. We  should strive to make a new leap in the rural economic  development. In line with these basic ideologies and ideas and  according to the provincial party committee standing committee's  study opinions, Jiang Chunyun talked about seven issues as  follows:    Jiang Chunyun first urged that under the conditions of the  socialist market economy, we should further understand and  upgrade agriculture's role as the foundation of the national  economy. He said: The issues relating to agriculture, rural  areas, and the peasants are always the fundamental issues  relating to the overall situation of the party and the state.  Reviewing the work done in the past years, we know that the  party and government leaders at various levels have gradually  upgraded their understanding about agriculture's role as the  foundation of the national economy and upgraded their awareness  of agriculture. The overall agricultural and rural economic  situation is good. However, through the examinations according  to the guidelines of the central instructions, we know that some  leaders still lag behind in terms of their understanding about  the role of agriculture and fail to firmly foster the idea of  taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy.  Under the new situation, they consciously or unconsciously  neglect agriculture. This is a problem that the party and  government leaders at various levels across the province should  pay high attention to. The provincial party committee  maintained that under the new situation of developing the  socialist market economy, the leading cadres at various levels,  particularly those at or above the county level, should further  study and understand Comrades Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin's  important expositions, work closely in line with reality,  further understand and upgrade agriculture's role as the  foundation of the national economy, and strive to make a new  leap in understanding.    Jiang Chunyun stressed the necessity to clearly understand  the following few points: First, although the proportion of  agriculture in the national economy is relatively reduced,  agriculture's role as the foundation of the national economy has  not been changed yet. The developed industry should be based on  the developed agriculture. Only when the foundation of  agriculture is solid will we be able to greatly develop the  secondary and tertiary industries. Second, agriculture's role  as the foundation of the national economy and agriculture's  strategic functions cannot be replaced in the course of  developing the socialist market economy and carrying out the  open policy. Third, enabling peasants to by and large have  sufficient food and clothes does not mean that agriculture has  passed the test. We should affirm the breakthrough in  Shandong's agriculture and rural economy and the historical  changes in the rural outlook achieved in the past decade and  more since reform and opening up started. However, tasks to  develop agriculture and rural economy remain very arduous. We  should never overestimate our agricultural production level and  peasants' prosperity level, be unrealistically optimistic and  complacent, or neglect and slacken efforts in the issues of  agriculture, rural areas, and peasants. Fourth, judging from a  long-term viewpoint, the fundamental position of agriculture  should be further strengthened instead of weakened if we are to  attain the "three- step" strategic objective of economic  development. Merely a small number of counties among the 135  counties, cities, and districts of the province have achieved a  fairly comfortable standard of living, merely 21 percent of the  rural population have achieved a per capita income of 1,000 yuan  or more, and some peasants in mountainous areas and areas  adjacent to reservoirs and beaches have yet to have sufficient  food and clothes. Evidently, without a great development in  agriculture and rural economy, the grand goal of modernization  cannot be attained smoothly. Fifth, we should also note that  agriculture is not only an economic issue but also a political  and social issue concerning the future and destiny of the party  and the state.    Jiang Chunyun emphasized: As a large agricultural province,  Shandong must attach great importance to agriculture at all  times and under all circumstances. It should never hold that  agriculture is no longer the foundation of the national economy  just because agriculture accounts for a small proportion; never  hold that agriculture is no longer important just because we are  developing the market economy and opening to the outside world;  never hold that we may slacken efforts in agriculture just  because there is a bumper harvest every year and peasants have  sufficient food and clothes; and never hold that we may relax  and all is well just because the rural situation is relatively  stable. Following the requirements of the party Central  Committee and the State Council, we must have more initiative in  developing agriculture and rural economy in the historical  process of developing the socialist market economy. We should  see to it that the better the situation is, the more we should  attach importance to and strengthen agriculture and rural work;  that the more reform is deepened and the wider we open to the  outside world, the more we should pay attention to agriculture  and make it successful; and that the more the market economy is  developed, the more we should protect and support agriculture.    The second issue Jiang Chunyun discussed was revising and  improving the plans for the development of agriculture and rural  economy in line with the need for developing the socialist  market economy. He said: In the condition of the market  economy, we need a scientific plan for accelerating the  development of agriculture and rural economy. Based on the  guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party  Central Committee and Shandong's "three-step" strategy for  economic development, we should include the development of  agriculture and rural economy in the overall plan for the  socialist market economy and, in line with the principle of  "adjusting the structure, improving efficiency, accelerating  development, and increasing income," map out overall plans and  rational arrangements and implement them step by step in line  with specific local conditions. The general plan of the  province is to greatly facilitate the industrialization,  commercialization, and modernization of agriculture in line with  the requirement for developing the socialist market economy and,  by the end of this century, to develop Shandong's agriculture  into commercial and market-oriented agriculture with the  characteristics of coastal developed areas--rational layout,  balanced structure, advanced technology, scientific management,  high rate of resources utilization, large share of the market,  high degree of opening up, and high overall efficiency--and to  raise the overall quality of Shandong's agriculture and rural  economy to a new level and turn Shandong from a large  agricultural province into a strong agricultural province.  After achieving this, we should make efforts for another decade  to by and large attain agricultural modernization and establish  a new pattern of industrialized, commercialized, and modernized  agriculture.    Jiang Chunyun emphasized: To attain the above-mentioned  targets, we should accelerate development of rural economy in  all sectors and achieve new breakthroughs in some key spheres  and key links: 1) a new breakthrough in structural adjustment,  2) a new breakthrough in improving the comprehensive production  capacity of agriculture, 3) a new breakthrough in increasing  scientific and technological content in farm products, 4) a new  breakthrough in the processing of farm and sideline products, 5)  a new breakthrough in the transfer of rural labor forces and the  construction of small cities and towns, and 6) a new  breakthrough in developing export- oriented agriculture. Based  on the guidelines of the central rural work conference and this  conference and their specific local conditions, all localities  in the province should conscientiously revise and improve their  own plans, put forward realistic and feasible targets and key  points of development and supporting measures, and implement  them in a down-to-earth manner.    The third issue Jiang Chunyun discussed was to accelerate  rural reform, with the aim of establishing the socialist market  economy system.    He said: Cultivating the mainstay of the market and  improving the rural operating system are important tasks of the  current rural reform. By deepening the reform, we should truly  turn peasant households and rural operating organizations into  producers and dealers of commodities who are independent in  management, responsible for their own profits and losses, and  capable of self- development and self-restraint and into the  mainstay of the market which is full of vigor and vitality. We  should fully respect peasant households' decision-making power  in management and, in line with the stipulations of the central  authorities, extend the term of land contracts another 30 years.  We should gradually establish and improve the system of paid  transfer of land use right according to law in line with the  principle of peasants' voluntary participation and mutual  benefit and gradually guide peasants to develop the  optimal-scale management and intensive management of land in the  localities where the secondary and tertiary industries are  developed and most labor forces are engaged in the trade other  than agriculture and have stable income. We should strengthen  and improve unified management and expand the economic strength  of the collectives step by step to enhance their service  function. We should popularize the shareholding cooperation  system in rural areas in an active and yet prudent manner. All  localities should learn from and disseminate the experiences of  Zhoucun and Laiyang and lead and encourage peasants to develop  multiform shareholding cooperation in township enterprises,  farming, livestock breeding, agricultural development, farmland  capital construction, and tertiary industry. Meanwhile, we  should conscientiously summarize experiences and formulate  corresponding rules and laws to gradually standardize rural  shareholding cooperation.    He said: How to lead peasants to the market and link the  independent operation of thousands upon thousands of households  to the unified large market is another important issue we should  resolve with great efforts when deepening the rural reform. The  first thing is to establish and improve the rural market system.  Shandong's markets for farm products have been developed better.  However, the development of labor, money, technology, and  information markets has been relatively sluggish, and  development of the markets for property rights has yet to begin.  The next step is to build more rapidly the markets for the  wholesale of farm products and for the essential elements of  production and, with the establishment of the modern enterprise  system, actively explore ways to cultivate and build the markets  for property rights to promote the rational distribution of the  essential elements of production and the maintenance and  increase of the value of collective assets. Rural cooperative  foundations and shareholding cooperative foundations are the  organizations for mutual aid with the collective funds of the  communities. We should actively give them guidance, strengthen  their management, standardize their activities, and give full  play to their positive role in developing the rural market  economy. Third, we should organize agricultural production in  such a way that it is industrialized and actively apply the  management form under which trade, industry, and agriculture are  integrated, and production, processing, and marketing are a  coordinated process. All localities in the province should  industrialize agriculture and regard this as an important  measure for facilitating rural reform and economic development.  In line with the local resources and basic conditions and  according to the domestic and foreign market demands, we should  define our own key industries and products; carry out regional  distribution, specialized production, coordinate management,  socialized service, and enterprise management; and set up a  production and management system of making cropping, breeding,  and processing a coordinate process; production, supply, and  marketing a coordinate process; agriculture, industry, and  commerce a coordinate process; and agriculture, science, and  education a coordinate process. We should pay attention to  industrializing agriculture on a trial basis. We should foster  the idea of circulation on a large scale; break the bounds of  different trades, different regions, and different ownerships;  develop large- scale circulation and large markets; positively  guide and organize tens of millions of the peasants to enter the  circulation spheres; and fundamentally solve the purchasing and  marketing difficulties.    He pointed out: Strengthening and improving the  macroeconomic regulation and control over agriculture and  effectively protecting and supporting agriculture is also a  problem that should urgently be solved in the course of  deepening reform. According to the state requirements for the  macro regulation and control over agriculture, we should perfect  the means for regulation and control, set up a special grain  storage system and grain risk-taking funds, and establish  branches of agricultural policy banks and commercial banks. We  should set up a system to support and protect agriculture, fix  grain protective prices and the ceiling prices for means of  production, and perfect the various-layered grain storage  systems. The reduced portions of the grain subsidies of the  financial departments at various levels should be used as grain  risk-taking funds but must not be diverted for other purposes.  We should also study ways to set up systems to protect and  store up such major farm products as cotton and oil-bearing  crops.    We should conscientiously sum up experiences gained from  practice and positively explore the best ways for developing  agriculture and the rural economy. This is the fourth issue  that Jiang Chunyun defined in his speech: He pointed out: Over  the past years, all localities in the province have positively  made explorations in this aspect, created many successful  experiences, and pioneered the ways of development with special  features. The ways of development can be summarized as follows:  First, ways for high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient  agriculture. Second, ways for comprehensively developing a  diversified economy. Third, ways for making trade, industry,  and agriculture a coordinate process and production, supply, and  marketing a coordinate process. Fourth, ways for developing the  export-oriented agriculture. Fifth, ways for overall  development. Sixth, ways for cultivating markets to promote  development. Seventh, ways for linking agriculture with science  and education and coordinating science with prices and policies.  Besides, there are ways with which each township should have its  own specialized trade and each village should have its own  special product, ways for developing transcropping and  transplanting agriculture and ecological agriculture, and ways  for developing garden-based economy. The aforementioned ways  are created by the masses in the course of reform and  development. All localities should proceed from their actual  conditions to study these ways and use them for reference,  select accurate ways suitable to their local conditions,  continue to make improvement in the course of practice, and  strive to make a new leap in agriculture and the rural economy.    When talking about the fifth issue, Jiang Chunyun stressed  that we should firmly foster the ideology that science and  technology are the primary productive forces and positively  carry out the strategy of relying on science and education to  rejuvenate Shandong. He pointed out: The key to developing  high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture,  elevating the rural economy to a new height, and modernizing  agriculture is to actually popularize and apply agricultural  science and technology. The party and government leaders at  various levels across the province should strategically change  their guiding ideologies and realistically shift the focus of  agricultural development onto the orbit of relying on scientific  and technological progress and upgrading the quality of  laborers. We should ensure that top leaders should personally  grasp the primary productive forces and grasp the following  several key work links. First, we should accelerate the  popularization of existing applied agrotechnologies and turn  scientific and technological findings into productive forces.  Second, we should strengthen the basic and applied research on  agricultural science and technology. Third, we should  popularize and apply new high technology and cultivate and  develop new agricultural growing points. We should continue to  run nine provincial-level new high-tech development experimental  zones and some city and prefectural experimental centers, bring  into full play these experimental zones' exemplary roles, and  promote the development and application of agricultural new  high-tech. Fourth, we should restore and improve the  agricultural science and technology dissemination network as  soon as possible. Agrotechnology dissemination organizations at  all levels are the bridges for developing agriculture through  the application of science and technology. We should restore  and improve such organizations as soon as possible according to  the agriculture law and the law on science and technology  dissemination. We should develop more rapidly and improve the  county-level agrotechnology dissemination organizations and step  up efforts to determine the nature, establishment, and personnel  quotas of town and township agrotechnology dissemination  organizations. We should actively support peasants' specialized  technology associations and research societies and  nongovernmental science and technology organizations and give  full play to their role in disseminating agricultural science  and technology and leading peasants to prosperity through  application of science and technology. Fifth, we should exert  great efforts to train scientific and technical personnel.    Speaking on the sixth issue, Jiang Chunyun urged further  efforts to intensify construction of infrastructural facilities  to raise the level of agricultural modernization. He said: To  push agriculture up to a new level, infrastructural facilities  for agriculture should reach a new level first. The focus of  the infrastructural facilities for agriculture is farmland water  conservancy projects. For many years in a row, Shandong has  organized millions of laborers to build farmland capital  construction on a large scale, with the focus on harnessing  rivers, thus greatly improving the conditions for agricultural  production. Generally speaking, however, the province has yet  to fundamentally change the situation of "feeding the people at  the mercy of heaven." Following the requirements of the central  authorities, we should regard water conservancy projects and  other infrastructural facilities for agriculture as important as  energy, communication, and other basic industries and attach  sufficient importance to them. We should adhere to the  principle of emphasizing both the antidrought work and flood  prevention, both the work to increase income and the work to  reduce expenses, and both construction and management and  persistently draw up unified plans for comprehensive improvement  of mountains, rivers, farmland, forests, and roads. A success  in farmland water conservancy projects depends mainly on the  labor accumulation of peasants. Meanwhile, we should increase  investment from various sources.    He said: The development of the market-oriented agriculture  urgently requires good infrastructural facilities for  circulation. All localities in the province should regard  construction of such facilities as the basic work for developing  the rural market economy and, like Zhucheng, Shouguang, and  Cangshan, build supporting facilities for the processing,  storage, and transportation of farm and sideline products to  provide a basic guarantee for peasants to enter the market. In  the process to promote agricultural modernization, they should  regard it as an important task to achieve mechanization and  should strive to gradually mechanize the major links of  production, such as plowing, harvesting, transportation,  threshing, and drying, and the work after production, such as  the processing and storage of farm products, so that their  equipment for agricultural modernization will be raised to a new  level. We should adopt effective measures to speed up  development of chemical fertilizer, pesticide, plastic sheet for  farm use, and other agriculture-oriented industries.    In conclusion, Jiang Chunyun spoke on strengthening and  improving party leadership over rural work to comply with the  new situation in developing the socialist market economy. He  pointed out: Developing the rural market economy and building  socialist new countryside with Chinese characteristics  constitute a brand-new undertaking, and comprehensive  strengthening and improvement of party leadership over rural  work is needed. City, prefectural, and county party committees  should focus their work and energy on rural work. Major  responsible comrades of the party committees and governments at  all levels should personally attend to agriculture and rural  work. Comrades in charge of agriculture and rural work of party  committees and governments should truly hold their  responsibilities. Other members of city, prefectural, and  county leading bodies should also show concern for and study the  issues on rural areas and make their work serve agricultural  development still better. As they are on the forefront of rural  work, town and township party committees should always regard  agriculture as the work of prime importance and successfully  organize forces to develop it. Leading cadres at all levels  should conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics to improve their  ideological, theoretical, leadership, and policy-making levels.  We should particularly study well Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, master and apply  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's basic stand, viewpoints, and methods to  conscientiously analyze and study the new conditions, new  issues, and new experiences in the current rural reform and  development, respect practice, laws, dialectics, and the masses'  creation, strive to turn perceptual knowledge into rational  knowledge, and implement correct and effective policies and  leadership over agriculture, rural economy, and social  development. Meanwhile, we should also conscientiously study the  knowledge on the market economy, science and technology, and  management to continuously upgrade our ability to lead and  control the rural market economy.    He emphasized: We should persistently attend to two tasks  simultaneously and be competent in both. The current main  stream in the rural ideological and political field is good, but  problems in ideology, social conduct, and public security remain  rather conspicuous, which our party and government departments  at all levels should pay great attention to. The more we  accelerate reform, opening up, and economic construction, the  more we should strengthen the socialist spiritual civilization,  democracy, and the legal system so that we can truly attend to  both and be competent in both. We should educate rural cadres  to develop democratic work styles, enhance sense of respect for  the legal system, and successfully carry out ideological and  political work to resolve contradictions. We should strictly  crack down on various economic and criminal offenses according  to law to eliminate the various ugly phenomena, safeguard rural  public security, and make sure that peasants have a sense of  security toward production and their life.    He pointed out: In improving leading bodies, we should pay  attention to two aspects. One is the leading bodies of county  and township party committees, and the other is the rural  grass-roots party branches. In particular, we should do a good  job in selecting secretaries of party branches. We should make  conscientious efforts to improve leadership styles and  leadership methods. Leading cadres at all levels should meet the  demands put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin for devoting more  time to study and attending fewer parties, conducting more  investigations and study and engage less in subjectivism, and  doing more solid work and giving less empty talk. They should  often visit rural areas, rural households, and the forefront of  agricultural production to conduct investigations and study,  give heed to the voice of the masses, ensure implementation of  policies, and earnestly carry out solid work for peasants. We  should advocate earnest efforts to tell truth, seek real  results, and do practical work and oppose formalism,  exaggeration, and cheating. We should all the more prohibit  coercion, commandism, and violation of laws and discipline, and  those who violate laws and discipline should be strictly  investigated and dealt with. In giving work guidance, we should  not only pay attention to the development of economically  developed localities but also attach importance to the  development of and support to the economically less developed  localities. We should continue to reduce the burdens on  peasants and formulate laws to manage this work. Leaders at all  levels should use policies and fruitful work to fully boost  peasants' enthusiasm for reform and development and guide,  protect, and develop well their enthusiasm. All trades and  professions should support and protect agriculture. They should  firmly embrace the idea that "they can achieve development only  when agriculture is development and they share the same fate  with peasants," be eager to meet the needs of peasants, and  provide them with what they need.</p>

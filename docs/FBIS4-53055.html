			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore's economic growth this year is expected  to be at the higher end of the 6 to 8 percent forecast by the  government last November. The Ministry of Trade and Industry  said the continued expansion in the U.S. economy and the strong  growth in developing countries will have a favorable effect on  Singapore's trade. The ministry made its optimistic forecast in  its latest quarterly economic survey. The survey showed that  the economy expanded by a higher than expected 11 percent in the  first quarter of this year, exceeding earlier forecasts of  between 9 and 10 percent. It forecast the 10.7 percent growth  in the first quarter of last year and the 9.9 percent recorded  for the whole of 1993.    Growth was mainly fueled by the exceptionally strong  performance in the manufacturing sector and the financial and  business and services sectors. Manufacturing output expanded  11.9 percent in the first quarter over the same period in 1993,  boosted by a strong external demand. The electronic, machinery,  and transport equipment industries also experienced strong  growth. The financial and business sector expanded by 14  percent, while the construction sector by a strong 10.8 percent.  The commerce sector expanded by 9.1 percent, and the transport  and communication sector grew just under 10 percent.    Total volume of trade continued to expand in the first  quarter, growing by 14 percent. Exports grew by 12 percent,  while imports increased by 9.6 percent. Non-oil domestic  exports rose by 13 percent, nearly doubling the growth in the  first quarter of last year.    The number of jobs created in the first quarter, however,  was  lower than that in the previous quarter. Labor productivity  grew some 6 percent, unchanged from the previous sector.    Inflation rose 3.2 percent compared to the same quarter last  year.</p>

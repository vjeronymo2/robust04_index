			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE REVOLT PREDICTED TO BOLSTER CLEAN AIR BILL;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: BOTH WILSON AND CRANSTON SAY THEY WILL SEEK TO RESTORE PROVISIONS  DELETED BY NEGOTIATORS. THEY ADMIT THEY FACE AN UPHILL FIGHT.  </P> <P> Maintaining that the nation's dirtiest cities need tougher pollution controls,  a group of dissenting senators led by California's Pete Wilson and Alan  Cranston said Friday they will introduce legislation to restore some of the  stringent provisions deleted from the compromise clean air bill crafted by  Senate and White House negotiators earlier this week.  </P> <P> The senators conceded they may face an uphill fight, given an agreement by the  White House and the Senate leadership to oppose any attempts to alter the key  elements of the bipartisan compromise announced on Thursday.  </P> <P> But Wilson, announcing plans to introduce an amendment to strengthen the bill's  clean fuels program, said there were "a great many senators who will join us in  this" and predicted that a floor revolt against the compromise will have  "considerable" support.  </P> <P> "The overwhelming majority of senators are not committed to what they (the  negotiators) accomplished," said Cranston, adding that a broad coalition of  Western, Northeastern and Midwestern senators was likely to support changes in  the bill.  </P> <P> Any serious attempt to challenge the clean air accord would put Wilson, the  Republican candidate for governor of California, on another of his occasional  collision courses with the White House. Wilson recently incurred the wrath of  White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu when he voted to override a  presidential veto of a measure that would have placed severe restrictions on  the joint development of a fighter plane with Japan.  </P> <P> It would also represent a slap in the face to Senate Majority Leader George J.  Mitchell (D-Me.), who invested enormous amounts of both time and prestige in  crafting a compromise that bridges the deep regional and ideological divisions  that for the past 10 years have prevented clean air legislation from coming to  the Senate floor.  </P> <P> "This has really been Mitchell's show from the beginning. He worked extremely  hard on this, to the point where it has become his first major test as majority  leader," a Senate staffer close to the clean air talks said.  </P> <P> In agreeing to some of the changes sought by the Administration, Mitchell and  the Senate subcommittee that drafted the bill neutralized the threat of a  filibuster that would have been mounted by a loose coalition of Republicans and  Democrats representing the auto, oil and coal-mining industries, among other  business interests. They also eliminated the threat of a veto by President  Bush, who believed the Senate bill would cost too much to implement.  </P> <P> To accommodate the conflicting interests, the negotiators drafted complex  formulas to reduce automobile emissions, regulate the release of toxic  chemicals and lower the emission of acid-rain causing sulfur dioxide by  coal-burning utilities.  </P> <P> Also included in the bill is an alternative fuels program that would mandate  the development and use of automotive fuels at least three times as clean as  conventional gasoline in Los Angeles and eight other urban areas that have the  worst smog problems in the country.  </P> <P> Defending it as the best deal than can pass the Senate, Mitchell said the  compromise "dramatically expands clean air laws in the most cost-effective  manner."  </P> <P> Specifically, the bill would:  </P> <P>  -- Lower the emissions of smog-causing hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides from  automobile tailpipes by 22% and 60% respectively over a three-year period  beginning in 1993, with a second round of 50% emission cuts taking effect in  2003 if 12 or more cities with serious pollution problems have not met federal  clean air standards by the end of 2001.  </P> <P>  -- Require industries to control the emissions of 191 toxic chemicals with the  "best available technology," taking cost into account, by 1997, with the  National Academy of Sciences to assess the remaining risks to health and the  need for further controls after that date.  </P> <P>  -- Require Midwestern utilities to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million  tons by the year 2000, with a cap at 1980 levels after that, with some  relaxation of the restrictions and extra "pollution credits" for utilities that  use specific cleanup technologies or lower emissions below the required level.  </P> <P>  -- Mandate the use of reformulated gasoline in nine cities with the worst smog  by 1995, but allow California to proceed with its own, much stricter  alternative fuels program.  </P> <P> Wilson's clean fuels amendment would allow other states to immediately adopt  the so-called "California-New York Alternative" based on a California program  that requires the production of 150,000 clean-fuel vehicles in 1994, 300,000 in  1995 and 400,000 in 1996. Any of various alternative fuels could be used as  long as they meet emissions standards twice as strict as those required in the  Senate bill for conventionally fueled cars.  </P> <P> Besides Wilson and Cranston, other senators supporting the amendment include  Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.), Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) and John D. (Jay)  Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.). Sens. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.) and Joseph I.  Lieberman (D-Conn.), two dissident members of the Senate subcommittee that  wrote the bill, are also expected to support the measure.  </P> <P> Lautenberg and Lieberman, who refused to support the compromise, plan to  introduce amendments to strengthen the automobile and air toxics provisions of  the bill.  </P> <P> A Wilson aide said the senator was unsure whether the Senate leadership would  regard the alternative fuels proposal as a "killer amendment" aimed at cracking  the compromise, which is so delicately crafted that it could all fall apart if  any of its components is changed. If that turns out to be the case, then  Mitchell and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) will muster their forces  to defeat it.  </P> <P> However, other sources said there were already indications that the compromise  may be starting to crumble because of dissatisfaction with the bill among a  number of senators.  </P> <P> "The two leaders seem to think that the hard part is over, but in truth it may  only just be beginning," one Senate aide said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UNDER FIRE: THE CLEAN AIR COMPROMISE  </P> <P> Although criticized by environmentalists as too weak to help Los Angeles and  other badly polluted urban areas clean up their air, the compromise crafted by  Senate and White House negotiators substantially strengthens current clean air  laws. Here is a comparison:  </P> <P> AUTOMOTIVE EMISSIONS:  </P> <P> Current Law:  </P> <P> Restricts automobile tailpipe emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides,  the precursers of urban smog, to 0.41 gram per mile (gpm) for hydrocarbons and  1.0 gpm for nitrogen oxides (NOx).  </P> <P> Senate/White House Compromise:  </P> <P> Reduces hydrocarbon emissions to .25 gpm and NOx emissions to .4 gpm by 1995,  with further reductions of 50% for both pollutants in the year 2003 if 12 or  more cities currently classified as having "serious" pollution problems are not  in attainment by the end of 2001.  </P> <P> ALTERNATIVE FUELS:  </P> <P> Current Law:  </P> <P> No provision for alternative fuels in current law.  </P> <P> Senate/White House Compromise:  </P> <P> Requires reformulated gasoline or similarly clean fuels to be used in cars sold  in nine cities with the worst smog by 1994. Similar regulations would also  apply to fleet vehicles, starting in 1995.  </P> <P> ACID RAIN:  </P> <P> Current Law:  </P> <P> No provisions for acid rain control currently in effect.  </P> <P> Senate/White House Compromise:  </P> <P> Requires 107 polluting utilities in the Midwest and Southeast to cut sulfur  dioxide emissions by 10 million tons in the year 2000, when emission levels  would be capped at 1980 levels. Utilities also would cut NOx emissions by 4  million tons by 2005.  </P> <P> An"allowance" system would let utilities reducing emissions below the required  levels sell "pollution credits" to others. Special incentives would also be  granted to utilities to use clean coal technology known as "scrubbers."  </P> <P> AIR TOXICS:  </P> <P> Current Law:  </P> <P> Imposes controls on the emissions of seven chemicals classified as toxic, but  enforcement has been lax.  </P> <P> Senate/White House Compromise:  </P> <P> Requires industry to use best available technology, taking cost into account,  to control emissions of 191 air toxics by 1997.  </P> <P> EPA could impose additional health-based standards after that, depending on the  results of a risk assessment study to be conducted by the National Academy of  Sciences.  </P></p>

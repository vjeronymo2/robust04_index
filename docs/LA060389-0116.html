			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO TIME FOR THE PAIN: DAVIS HITS FOR THE CYCLE AS REDS BEAT PADRES  </P> <P> Eric Davis insists that his hamstring still hurts. If he ever gets healthy,  pitchers will have to run for cover.  </P> <P> Davis, who came off the disabled list May 19 and has been hitting solidly ever  since, had his biggest night of the season when he led the Reds to a 9-4  victory over the San Diego Padres Friday at Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Davis, the first Cincinnati batter to hit for the cycle in the last 30 years,  drove in six runs while going four for four.  </P> <P> Davis doubled home Barry Larkin in the first, singled him home in the third and  hit a three-run home run in the fourth off Walt Terrell.  </P> <P> Davis tripled to center field in the seventh to complete the cycle.  </P> <P> The last Red to perform the feat was Frank Robinson, who did it against the  Dodgers on May 2, 1959.  </P> <P> Davis has four consecutive multiple-hit games, going 10 for 15 during the span.  </P> <P> Larkin scored four times and extended his hitting streak to 13 games. His  batting average has improved to .339.  </P> <P> After the game, the Padres announced that they had traded outfielder John Kruk  and infielder Randy Ready to the Philadelphia Phillies for outfielder Chris  James. Ready will replace retired third baseman Mike Schmidt. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At the Georgian-Abkhazian talks in Geneva on April  12 on the deployment of a peacekeeping force in Abkhazia the two  sides failed to agree on sites for the stationing of such forces.    Chief negotiator Djaba Ioseliani told the Georgian radio on  Wednesday that the Georgian plan envisages the deployment in the  zone of conflict of up to 2,500 UN servicemen. They are to take  under control the Russian-Abkhazian border along the Psou River,  all mountain passes connecting Abkhazia with the North Caucasus.  Peacekeepers are also to be deployed in Sukhumi, Gudauta,  Leselidze, the Kodori canyon and along the Inguri River. The  Georgian side plans to locate the UN headquarters in Sukhumi.    Meanwhile, the Abkhazian side, said Ioseliani, continues  insisting on the deployment of peacekeepers along the  confrontation line on the Inguri River.    I do not know how the talks will proceed, but our plan was  approved by the UN and Russian representatives, said Ioseliani.    He also said that according to the Russian side the  deployment of 2,500 peacekeepers would not be an adequate number.    The talks in Geneva continue on April 13.</p>

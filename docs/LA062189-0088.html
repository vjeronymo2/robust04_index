			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Both smokers and nonsmokers favor the ban of smoking on short-haul airline  flights, an anti-smoking group said. The tobacco industry said the group's  survey of 27,000 passengers at 66 airports in 33 states was flawed. The  American Assn. of Respiratory Care announced the results of its April survey at  a Washington news conference with several House members who said they would  support legislation to extend the ban to all flights or at least make the  present limited ban permanent. The law bans smoking on flights of two hours or  less until April, 1990. The survey results showed a bare majority, 51.7%, of  smokers supporting a permanent ban, and an overwhelming majority, 91.1%, of  nonsmokers in favor.  </P></p>

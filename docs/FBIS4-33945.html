			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 10 Jun (EFE) -- Chilean President Eduardo  Frei announced today that during the upcoming Cartagena summit,  he will explain the Chilean plan to eradicate poverty that will  be proposed at the Social Summit in Copenhagen.    Speaking before the United Nations in 1993, former Chilean  President Patricio Aylwin proposed a social summit to undertake  a global effort to eradicate poverty, which affects millions of  people around the world.    During a meeting today with foreign correspondents, Frei  stressed the importance of the Cartagena summit. He said he  will use the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings with  presidents from neighboring countries, with Spanish King Juan  Carlos, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Venezuelan  President Rafael Caldera, and Cuban President Fidel Castro.    Regarding Cuba, with which Chile maintains ties at the  consular level, Frei noted the appointment of Ambassador  Patricio Pozo, the former Chilean representative to Costa Rica,  as Chilean consul to Cuba. He also mentioned Chilean-Cuban  commercial and tourism ties. Frei commented on the credit line  granted to Cuba for the purchase of foodstuffs from Chile, as  well as Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's upcoming visit.  Frei said that during his talk with Castro, we will continue to  discuss the strengthening of bilateral ties seeking to  consolidate democracy and uphold human rights.    Frei reasserted his opposition to a unilateral armed action  against Haiti, but hastily condemned the serious situation in  that country. He said: "We do not favor unilateral solutions  and will support all multilateral measures adopted by the  international community that seek to restore democracy in Haiti."    Open regionalism will be one of the priority proposals to be  made by Frei at the Cartagena Summit. Frei stated: "In an  integrated world, in which large economic blocs like the EU,  NAFTA (among the United States, Mexico and Canada), and APEC  (Asian-Pacific Economic Corporation) are being consolidated we,  as Latin Americans, must also be present. A Latin American  union should not be a closed association, it should help us to  open these markets."    Development with equity, the fight against poverty and  crime,  and drug enforcement are also included in the Chilean proposal.  Frei said: "Particularly, a clear political idea to achieve  progress regarding integration."    He stressed the Chilean decision to join the Common Market  of  the South (Mercosur) which originally comprised Argentina,  Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay.    The Cartagena Summit will be the first international  conference to be attended by President Eduardo Frei since he  assumed power on 11 March.    Frei will meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton in  Washington  on 28 June. He will attend the Rio Summit in September, and  attend the APEC Summit meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia, in  November. During this meeting Chile will be accepted as a  member country.    On 9 and 10 December, Frei will attend the presidential  summit in Miami called by President Clinton. Speaking about the  possible duplication as a result of the Ibero-American summit in  Cartagena and the Summit of the Americas in Miami, Frei said he  believes all efforts to increase the number of meetings of Latin  American presidents or European leaders are positive.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / People: Sinegal's extensive cut-price philosophy A mixed reception awaits Jim Sinegal, 57-year-old American founder of the Costco cut-price retailing chain, when he arrives in London today for the opening of Britain's first warehouse club, writes Richard Tomkins. Shoppers may be delighted at the impact he will have on British retailing. Other store chains would sooner he had stayed at home. Doubtless the controversy is something Sinegal would have preferred to avoid, for as one of the less flamboyant US business executives, he shuns publicity. He is also unusual in extending the cut-price philosophy to his own role in the company: notoriously, his desk is out in the middle of the work area at Costco's Seattle headquarters, separated from the rest of the workspace only by a low divider, and he answers his own phone. His salary is just Dollars 514,547 - a pittance for the boss of a company with annual sales exceeding Dollars 16bn. The low profile notwithstanding, few make the mistake of under-estimating Sinegal. For 23 years he worked for Sol Price, the man who invented the warehouse club concept when he set up the Price Co chain in 1976. Sinegal looked an upstart when he decided to go his own way and set up Costco in 1983. But Costco emerged as the most successful operator in the field, and earlier this year proved the point by taking over Price Co - though Sinegal, true to form, had the grace to call it a merger.</p>

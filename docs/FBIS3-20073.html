Britain appeared to back down from its hardline stance in  the  row about voting rights in an enlarged European Union, conceding  the principle that a larger number of votes would be needed to  block measures.    But critics said the proposed compromise, worked out during  an informal weekend meeting, was a "time bomb" which opened the  door to future delaying tactics by dissident minorities within  the EU.    London and Madrid had objected to changes in the minimum  number of votes needed to block measures if the Union is  enlarged. Currently, countries with 23 out of 76 votes can veto  decisions. The other 10 EU members want the entry of four  would-be newcomers to raise the blocking minority to 27 out of  90.    Influential rebels in Britain's ruling Conservative Party  have opposed any compromise, insisting that the 23-vote  threshold be retained so that Britain's veto powers are not  diluted.    According to the compromise studied by ministers at the  weekend, the ratified membership treaties of the four new states  would stipulate a 27-vote threshold but a parallel political  declaration by the Council of Ministers would allow a  conciliation process if the vote falls between 23 and 26.    The problem is that the new formula does not specify a  cut-off period for the conciliation process, although French  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe suggested three months.    The president of the EU's Executive Commission, Jacques  Delors, has expressed reservations about the compromise proposal  and was submitting it for discussion by the Commission at its  next meeting on Tuesday, an EU source said.    Greece, current head of the EU's revolving presidency, has  submitted details of the proposal to its 12 member states who  were expected to respond by Tuesday.    Unless settled by the end of next month, the voting row  threatens to delay EU membership for Austria, Finland, Norway  and Sweden which are scheduled to join at the start of next year.    Any compromise would be valid only until a major overhaul of  the EU's institutions planned for 1996.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, fighting to stem  rebellion in the Conservative Party ahead of local and European  elections, told BBC radio on Sunday that Britain was winning  ground in the debate and its concerns were now "more fully  understood."    "People have moved towards us and we have said that we are  willing to consider a satisfactory compromise, but we're not  there yet," he added.    His Spanish counterpart Javier Solana felt "significant  advances" were made at Ioannina on what he called a "balanced"  formula.    But Hurd said Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg are  worried about the new proposal, because they think it goes too  far in Britain and Spain's favour.    This was backed up by Dutch Foreign Minister Peter  Kooijmans,  who described the new formula as "a real time bomb."    Juppe said the absence of a cut-off point could allow de  facto blocking at 23 votes, which he described Saturday as  "unacceptable."    His Belgian counterpart Willy Claes agreed, saying Sunday it  would have been "wiser" to establish a two- to three-month  period, but he did not see the formula as a British victory.    "It is not a victory for the British because the principle  of  a 27-vote blocking minority has been granted, and they have no  guarantees on the length of the conciliation period," he  commented.</p>

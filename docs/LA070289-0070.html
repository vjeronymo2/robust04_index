			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIGHTING THE ENEMY FROM TONKIN TO TENNESSEE;  </P> <P> SOLDIER'S JOY BY MADISON SMARTT BELL (TICKNOR &amp; FIELDS: $19.95; 465 PP.)  </P> <P> Two men, Tom Laidlaw, a white, and Rod Redmond, a black, return from Vietnam to  a small Tennessee town near Nashville in the early 1970s. The two had grown up  together and served on the same Long Range Reconnaisance Patrol team in the  Army, and so they are close and intend to remain so until thugs from the local  Ku Klux Klan begin making trouble for them. This is the simplified plot of  Madison Smartt Bell's stark latest novel.  </P> <P> Of course, there's more to it than that. Laidlaw's arrival back in his  hardscrabble little village is marked by an emptiness of spirit, drained both  by the war and his father's recent death inside his burning farmhouse. Laidlaw  begins to eke out a fragile existence, installing himself in a run-down tenant  shack once occupied by Redmond's family. Aided by a kindly red-neck neighbor,  he cultivates a garden, begins raising sheep and practices on the five-string  banjo. All this takes such a long time that by the end of 100 or so pages I  felt I had learned quite enough details about farming, animal husbandry and  banjo picking. And then Redmond finally comes into the story.  </P> <P> Redmond came back from the war earlier than Laidlaw, went to New York, became  involved in an armed robbery, returned home to get enmeshed in a housing fraud  scheme fostered by a ubiquitous white real estate agent nicknamed "Goodbuddy,"  served some more time and is now free on parole. He gets a job in a warehouse  where he's ultimately set upon by a tire-tool wielding white man and winds up  in a crummy rooming house near an establishment known as Mosque Number 2, which  serves as a restaurant and house of worship run by Redmond's cousin, Raschid,  who has converted to Mohammedanism.  </P> <P> Meantime, Laidlaw has found a couple of partners to form a bluegrass band --  Martin Brown, a guitarist with stage fright, and Adrienne Wells, a classical  violinist turned country music fiddler, with whom Laidlaw ultimately begins a  love affair. It is at one of their performances in a dingy saloon that Redmond  appears and Laidlaw is so moved that he steps from the stage and embraces him.  This begins the troubles with the Klan, which ultimately leads Laidlaw,  Redmond, and a third member of the patrol team, a half-crazed veteran named  "Ratman," on a sort of deja vu trip of violence in rural Tennessee.  </P> <P> There are sub-themes of "Soldier's Joy" worth exploring too. The relationship  between Laidlaw and Redmond is complex. As children they played together and  Redmond's father, Wat, now an ailing old man, showed favoritism toward Laidlaw  at Redmond's expense, a slight that causes Redmond to resent Laidlaw. For his  part, Laidlaw wants only friendship with Redmond and defies the Klan or anyone  else to interfere. On the other hand, Redmond is easygoing and wants mostly to  be left alone, having accepted his lot as an uneducated black in the South of  the 1970s.  </P> <P> More friction is sparked when Laidlaw finds out that some of the nightriders  who've been harassing him are the sons of the kindly old Mr. Giles, who's been  helping him farm and fix up his place. The crooked Mr. Goodbuddy resurfaces as  a player in a Klan scheme to mistreat a black gospel preacher called Brother  Jacob, at whose revival Laidlaw's band is supposed to perform. This leads to a  final confrontation in which everybody reverts to form.  </P> <P> "Soldier's Joy" -- the title is taken from a Revolutionary War tune often  played by banjo pickers -- is an honorable novel. Its themes pitch the forces  of good against the forces of evil, the value of friendship and the power of  redemption.  </P> <P> A problem with this is that the author renders them in spurts, broken  frequently by long and seemingly irrelevant passages that lead no place fast.  Although these passages or divergences have some cumulative effect on character  in the end, one still comes away with the impression of an uneven novel. The  story's at its best when the action becomes fast paced, not when the writer  lapses into his "descriptive" mode: giving us the weather report or gaggles of  complicated interior thoughts. But Bell's writing is very good and his  storytelling poignant and powerful, enough to make this book worthwhile  reading.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Mar 23, BNS -- The Government Information  Agency issued an explanatory statement Wednesday [23 March] on  the March 15 agreement between Latvian and Russian negotiators  on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia, which forsees  temporary operation of a radar station at Skrunda.    Russia has completely given up the idea to use the newest  block of the radar station, according to the statement. The  newest part of the compound will be transferred to the Latvian  authority as soon as the withdrawal agreement is signed.    The United States has pledged Latvia 10 million USD needed  to  start the radar's dismantling. Russia, in its turn, promised to  supply the equipment necessary to dismantle the newest block of  the station.    Currently, the Skrunda early-warning antimissile radar  occupies 1,008 hectares. After the agreement is signed, Latvia  starts to control more than 80 percent of the territory. Russia  continues its actitivities on 164 hectares of the total area for  four years.    The draft agreement also forsees that Russia substitutes  part  of the radar's military personnel with civilians. The civil  staff may be Latvian citizens and permanent residents.    Under the agreement, Russia should not change the functions  or the equipment of the radar station. The "old" radar, built  in late 1960's, is "morally and physically outdated," Soviet  specialists said already in 1990.    Russia may even decide to suspend the operation of the  costly  and ineffective installation in view of its complicated domestic  situation, the Latvian Government said in the statement.  Moreover, Russia may start to use the Baranovici radar, which  is still under construction, before the temporary operation term  expires.</p>

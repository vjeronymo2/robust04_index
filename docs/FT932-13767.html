			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Bonhams halves commission rate BONHAMS, the auctioneer, yesterday announced that it will halve its commission rate on major lots. Unlike its competitors, Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips, Bonhams did not increase its buyers' premiums earlier this year. Now it hopes to encourage vendors to consign works of more than Pounds 30,000 by charging a flat commission rate of 5 per cent.</p>

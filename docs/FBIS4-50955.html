			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- The China Committee for  Authenticating Environmentally Labeled Products was founded in  Beijing today, signalling a period of substantial development in  our country's "green industry." The committee's establishment  will facilitate the improvement of the quality and reputation of  environmentally labeled products, the development of domestic  and foreign markets for such products, and the promotion of  coordinated environmental and economic development.    Environmental labels, also known as ecological or green  labels, are a kind of corroborative trademark which indicates  that the products in question meet specific demands for  environmental protection during the entire process, from the  development and exploitation of raw and semifinished materials  to production, utilization, and recovery or scrapping; that they  pose no harm to the ecology or cause little pollution; and that  they facilitate the regeneration and recovery of relevant  resources. At present, more than 20 countries or regions in the  world have adopted these labels or are drawing up plans for  adopting them.    A leading environmental problem currently facing China is  the  serious wastage of resources and outmoded production technology.  In light of its own national conditions and drawing on the  experiences of foreign countries, China will first provide  environmental label authentication services for environmentally  harmful products which can be rendered significantly less  noxious. Chief among them are products with low levels of  toxicity and harm, energy- and water-saving products, products  with low emissions, and recoverable, low-noise, and  biodegradable products. Our country has prescribed and unveiled  its first set of technological requirements for six  environmentally labeled products. They apply to household  refrigerators with low levels of chlorofluorocarbon [CFC],  CFC-free aerosols (hair sprays and mousse), water-based paints,  unleaded gasoline, recycled toilet paper, and silk products.    The China Committee for Authenticating Environmentally  Labeled Products, which was established by the State  Environmental Protection Bureau with the authorization of the  State Technology Supervision Bureau, is the only third-party  authentication agency which verifies various environmentally  labeled products on behalf of the state. The committee, which  is composed of specialists from environmental protection  departments, economic management departments, scientific  research institutes and academies, quality inspection  departments, and relevant mass organizations, is headed by Xie  Zhenhua, director of the State Environmental Protection Bureau.    The design of the Chinese environmental label consists of  green hills, blue water, the sun, and 10 rings, signifying that  "all people have joined forces to protect the environment on  which mankind depends for survival."</p>

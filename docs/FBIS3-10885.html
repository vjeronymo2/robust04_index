The small town of Rio Blanco in Dolores, Peten Department,  is  the one most seriously affected by these actions. The homes of  the residents -- who are mostly Quekchi Indians from Alta  Verapaz -- have been burned by the invaders. This situation is  nothing new in this village that was settled 15 years ago. The  pressure by Belizean troops, however, began nine years ago.  According to Salvador Jimenez, a man from Jalapa who has been  living in this village for 15 years, a black woman came to this  village several weeks ago and threatened to leave them with  nothing during the corn harvest.    Francisco Javier Chen, a young Quekchi Indian who is a  community leader, added that the Belizean soldiers have told  them they are inside Belizean territory and that if they remain  there their homes, crops, and even their lives are at stake.    The village, on the banks of the crystal-clear waters of the  Blanco River and a little further out than Chiquibul, seems to  be like the garden of Eden. There is abundant agricultural  production, the weather is very nice, and the river waters are  fresh. One can hear the cry of the Saraguate monkeys in the  distance.    Speaking in Quekchi, Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez  Morales held a lengthy conversation with the residents of the  Rio Blanco village in Dolores, Peten, who complained of the  actions by the soldiers from Belize. Guatemalan peasants  wearing ragged shirts and rubber boots came down nearby paths,  as well as women who were wearing the native outfit from Alta  Verapaz and adolescents who wore colorful necklaces and carried  sweaty children.    Likewise, sweaty soldiers walked down the same paths. They  were wearing dirty camouflage uniforms because they have been in  the area for a long time. Some of them carried light artillery  weapons. Others carried M-16 rifles, while another carried radio  equipment.    Enriquez, speaking in their language, urged the peasants to  respect the law and not cross the border. "The Army is here to  give you a helping hand. If for any reason you have to abandon  the area, the government will find land to give you," he said.    The peasants said that they "harm no one and work in their  fields." On some occasions they said they have found tombs, but  they never touch them. They always leave them where they are.  They complained that the Belizean soldiers accuse them of  "opening the Maya tombs, but this is not true."    The dialogue between Enriquez and the community leader was  interrupted several times when 10 persons speaking at the same  time explained that they "are Guatemalans and they hope their  government will do something for them at this time -- the worst  of their lives -- because there has never been anything like  this before in the jungle."    The troops from Military Zone No. 23, stationed in Santa  Elena but with jurisdiction in Peten Department, are arriving at  the border area between this department and Belize.</p>

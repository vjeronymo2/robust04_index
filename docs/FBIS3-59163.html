In a statement at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, where he  stopped over en route from Malaysia to his country, Izetbegovic  said that the efforts of the UN Security Council and  international organizations have so far failed to stop the  Serbs. A NATO operation would bring peace, Izetbegovic  reiterated, adding that the delay in such an operation has  caused the deaths of 200,000 people and the occupation of 70  percent of his country's territory.    In response to a question on the Turkish and Pakistani prime  ministers' plans to go to Sarajevo, Izetbegovic said: Let them  garner their courage and come. We are waiting for them.    Commenting on his visit to Malaysia, Izetbegovic explained  that he was very pleased with his brief visit and received  significant support from the Malaysian Government.    In his statement after seeing Izetbegovic off, Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin said that the recent developments  concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina were assessed. Cetin remarked  that during the meeting with Izetbegovic, views were also  exchanged on the conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina to be held in  Geneva on 10 February.</p>

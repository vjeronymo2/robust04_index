			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Newman Tonks hit by setback in final quarter NEWMAN TONKS Group, Europe's largest architectural hardware concern, saw pre-tax profits slide in the last part of the 1992 year and returned Pounds 13.2m for the 14 months to December 31 against Pounds 15.1m for the year to end-October 1991. Sales amounted to Pounds 266.5m, compared with Pounds 222m, but the group incurred losses in November and December reflecting seasonal factors. Net profits of Pounds 8.59m, down from Pounds 10.9m, were nearly wiped out by extraordinary charges of Pounds 8.3m caused by the closure in the UK, Belgium and the US of businesses whose future depends on the gloomy new-build sector of the construction industry. The closures were part of two years of rationalisation, which saw 8 per cent of the workforce depart in 1990-91 and a further 10 per cent in 1991-92, taking the employment roll down to 4,600. 'The actions we have taken over the last two years have reduced our cost base and improved our competitiveness. We have paid the heavy cost of these actions. The bulk of the resulting increase in profitability has yet to come through,' said Mr Doug Rogers, chairman. Earnings per share emerged at 6.5p, against 9.56p last time. The group has maintained its dividend with an already declared second interim of 5.5p making a total of 9.3p. No final distribution is proposed. The dividend cost Pounds 12.4m, resulting in a Pounds 12.2m transfer from reserves. Over the last year the group has been consolidating, looking for future growth by strengthening existing companies rather than by acquisition, the case in the late 1980s. Capital investment last year was Pounds 10m, 20 per cent more than the year before. After the seasonal losses, trading conditions improved markedly. Sales were 20 per cent higher in January and February than over the same months of 1992, according to Mr Geoff Gahan, chief executive. The group has been trading well in Germany, where a new product range has just been introduced and has found US demand growing steadily. The UK market has stopped declining.</p>

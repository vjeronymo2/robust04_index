			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Records set at sale of furniture Part of a suite of furniture designed by Chippendale in the 1770s for Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire sold for Pounds 759,500 at Christie's yesterday. New auction records were set for a pair of giltwood torcheres, or candlestands - which made Pounds 177,500 - and for two pairs of chairs, which sold for Pounds 166,500 and Pounds 161,000 respectively. A pair of sofas realised Pounds 254,000. Prices were roughly double their estimates. In the same auction of English furniture, a set of12 mahogany dining chairs, after a design by Thomas Sheraton, sold for a record Pounds 463,500. In 1984 Christie's sold them for Pounds 75,600. The auction totalled more than Pounds 3.2m, and was almost 90 per cent sold by value, confirming furniture as one of the strongest sectors of the antique market. A collection of ancient and Islamic glass, assembled over the past three decades by Mr Hans Benzian, a Swedish businessman, sold for Pounds 1.37m at Sotheby's - above the high estimate. An amber-coloured kohl tube, for eye make-up, made in Iran in about 400 BC, made the top price of Pounds 102,700. The highlight of a disappointing auction of European sculpture and works of art at Sotheby's was a bronze drinking vessel, shaped like a lion, which made Pounds 199,500.</p>

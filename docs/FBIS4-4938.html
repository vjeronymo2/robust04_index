			<p>BFN     [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit  yesterday said he voted in support of the Opposition's  constitution amendment bill last week because the  Government-proposed bills were based on the 1992 Constitution  criticised as being undemocratic and dictatorial.    The 1992 Constitution was drafted at the order of the  now-defunct National Peace-keeping Council [NPKC] which  overthrew the Chatchai Chunhawan Government on February 23, 1991.    Gen Wimon said he thought it proper to support the  Opposition  bill based on the 1978 Constitution which had no connection with  the NPKC in any way.    If we truly want to discard the dictatorial image of the  NPKC, the proposed amendments should be based on the 1978  Constitution, he said.    The Army chief said any amendment of the 1992 Constitution  was likely to come in for criticism from some groups.    He said he wanted to see the nation united but thought this  would be difficult while criticisms persisted.    A number of issues might yet be amended in the Opposition  draft.    He said the reduction in the eligible voting age to 18 had  divided senators and he hoped the committee appointed to  scrutinise the bill would look carefully into the matter.    Gen Wimon said senators supporting the Opposition last  Thursday had acted independently.    This contradicts another senator who claimed Upper House  members had been lobbied to vote in favour of the Opposition.    The Army commander yesterday said he was worried some people  might exploit the present situation.    He also thought it improper to say the situation would be  tense during the scrutiny of the Constitution.    Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm Prachet Siridet said senators  voted for the Opposition bill because they found it acceptable.    He also came to the defence of Defence Minister Gen Wichit  Sukmak who is under attack from Government MPs for voting for  the Opposition draft.    Adm Prachet said Gen Wichit was acting in his capacity as a  senator, not a Cabinet member, when he voted on the issue.    He said any move such as replacing Gen Wichit should be  based  on reason.    Adm Prachet said the Government had made it clear from the  beginning that the attempt to amend the Constitution had nothing  to do with the Government and senators were free to exercise  their own judgement.    House Military Committee chairman Gen Athit Kamlang-ek  yesterday also backed Gen Wichit by saying he did not think the  minister had committed any grave mistakes.    "I know Prime Minister Chuan Likphai quite well and don't  think he will replace Gen Wichit. He is polite and has respect  for other people," said the former army commander.    Mr Chuan, meanwhile last night vouched his support for Gen  Wichit.    The premier said he fully understood the general whom he met  for talks yesterday.    He said Gen Wichit did not vote for the change in the agenda  to place the Opposition draft ahead of the eight amendments  bills proposed by the coalition parties because he did not  support the move.    The defence minister voted in favour of the Opposition draft  because he felt the eight amendment bills were not sponsored by  the Government, but the coalition parties.    The prime minister praised Gen Wichit as an honest and  responsible man citing his cooperation in amending the capital  peacekeeper's law.    Earlier, Mr Chuan said there was no misunderstanding on Gen  Wichit's part since he knew from the beginning the amendments  were not government drafts. He was not asked to vote for them  as everyone had the right to exercise their own judgement.    The Premier also said there was no law prohibiting Gen  Wichit  from being both a senator and cabinet minister.    He would not say what was discussed with Gen Wichit  yesterday  but said:    "Gen Wichit is a soldier and a gentleman and he is not  afraid  of anything."    Gen Wichit yesterday refused comment on reports that  Democrat  Party MPs were pressing him to resign after he supported the  Opposition-sponsored constitution amendment bill.    Gen Wichit, a senator appointed to the defence portfolio  under the Democrat quota, insisted he had the right under the  Constitution to a free vote.    The Defence Minister last week joined the majority of  senators and the entire Opposition in an unprecedented move to  beat the government-sponsored constitution amendment bills  during the special session of Parliament.    Democrat MPs are reportedly angry with Gen Wichit and want  him expelled from the Chuan Likphai Cabinet.    Gen Wichit denied discussing any political issues with the  Premier yesterday.    He said the meeting was about the opening of the Thai-Lao  Friendship Bridge scheduled for Friday.    He also denied he was told to choose between being a senator  and a minister or that there had been any political pressure put  on him.    It had earlier been reported that Gen Wichit told Mr Chuan  he  had voted with the Senate because he was afraid his lack of  cooperation with the military might affect his work at the  Defence Ministry.    Mr Chuan said there was no need for the Defence Minister to  explain his vote to the Cabinet.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Why is the government losing committee-stage votes? - As the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty returns to the House of Commons, FT writers look at the remaining obstacles to its passage MOST MPs support the Maastricht treaty. And yet the government has already lost one committee-stage vote and is in danger of losing more. Nor can it command the votes necessary to speed its progress by forcing MPs to debate it beyond 10pm. Why? The short explanation is that the two main opposition parties - though pledged not to wreck the treaty - have not ruled out seeking to 'improve' it. Nor does Labour in particular feel any compunction about prolonging the committee stage as much as it can. This delays the consideration of other bills and complicates life for those charged with managing the government's legislative programme. Combine these votes with those of the hard-core Tory Euro-sceptics intent on sinking the bill, and the government's overall majority of 20 becomes vulnerable on all but amendments that would change the text of the treaty and therefore wreck it. The table below, showing the likely division of forces if the government pressed to prolong debate beyond 10pm, illustrates its problem. The figures  -which suggest the government would lose such a division by some 17 votes even when supported by the Liberal Democrats - indicate that more Tories are prepared to rebel on these 10 o'clock-rule votes than on non-procedural motions.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW MPS MIGHT VOTE ON DEBATING AFTER 10PM*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- PARTY                FOR    ABSTENTIONS    AGAINST  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Conservative         281        15           35 Lib Democrats         19         -            1 Labour                 -         -          267 Plaid Cymru            4         -            - UPU                    1         -            - Ulster Unionists       -         -            9 SDLP                   -         -            4 Dem.

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Malaysian car project costs set to increase The rise in the value of the yen is causing problems for Malaysia's second national car project, due to start operations later this year. Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua (Perodua), a consortium of Malaysian companies, is due to begin manufacturing the Kancil, or Mouse Deer, 660cc car in September. Daihatsu of Japan is partnering Perodua in the project. The Kancil had been aimed at the lower end of the market with a cost of about MDollars 24,000 (Pounds 5,900). However, rising import costs from Japan could push up the price. Since the Kancil project was announced two years ago the yen has appreciated by more than 30 per cent against the ringgit, the Malaysian dollar. Mr Ho Tet Kheong, Perodua's chief executive, said that up to 50 per cent of the content of the Kancil will be sourced from Japan in the initial stages of production. 'We are looking at ways of absorbing the cost but prices could rise,' said Mr Ho. 'We are also seeking the government's assistance.' Perodua plans to produce an initial 25,000 cars a year at its plant outside Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia already produces the Proton car in partnership with Mitsubishi. Proton now has more than 70 per cent of the local market. More than 17,000 Protons were exported last year, mostly to Britain.</p>

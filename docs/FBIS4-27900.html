			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "North Korea Needs To Show Its Sincerity"] </F>   [Text] The situation continues to worsen regarding the  issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected development of  nuclear weapons. Assistant Secretary of State Robert L.  Gallucci, who twice represented the U.S. side in the U.S.-DPRK  high-level talks last year, declared: "There are no longer any  grounds on which to hold the third round of high-level talks."    Kang Sok-chu, DPRK first vice minister of foreign affairs,  who represented the DPRK in the high-level talks, earlier said:  "If the United States declares the foundation of the DPRK-U.S.  talks has been destroyed, the foundation on which we have  temporarily suspended the effectuation of our declared  withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) will  collapse." In this way, Kang hinted at formal DPRK withdrawal  from the NPT. However, Gallucci said: "The United States and  the international community will not stand for any threats from  North Korea." He thus indicated the United States does not  intend to back off at all.    We have insisted that to completely settle the North Korean  nuclear issue, the third round of high-level U.S.-DPRK talks  should be held without any preconditions attached. According to  bilateral accords reached last summer, the United States and  North Korea are supposed to hold the third round of talks to  discuss such issues as North Korea's official return to the NPT,  special inspection of the DPRK's two undeclared nuclear  facilities, and the replacement of North Korea's graphite  moderated reactor to the light water reactor, which has a low  plutonium conversion ratio. These issues are to be broadly  discussed along with other problems such as the improvement of  political and economic relations between the two nations.    Originally, the United States had planned to hold the third  round of talks with North Korea in early June, after holding  discussions with Japan and the ROK. In the end, this plan  failed to materialize, as the DPRK refused to comply with the  International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) request to follow  its regulations regarding separating and storing spent nuclear  fuel rods in the process of refueling North Korea's  5,000-kilowatt experimental nuclear reactor.    It is a mystery as to why North Korea refused to cooperate  with the IAEA. The nuclear watchdog organization had in fact  given consideration to North Korea for its "unique status" and  made concessions, agreeing to analyze the fuel rods "in the  future" rather than "at the present."    A senior U.S. Government official has said that the issues  of  DPRK missiles exports and human rights are to be taken up at the  third round of talks with North Korea. Perhaps North Korea felt  that it needed a new negotiating card in response to U.S. plans  to take up the human rights issue in the third round of  bilateral talks.    In the United States, however, more and more Government  officials and Congressmen became irritated with Gallucci's  policy of trying to settle the DPRK nuclear issue through  dialogue. Finally, the United States has become enraged with  the fuel rods issue.    Regardless of the DPRK's intention, high-level talks between  the United States and North Korea remains the most realistic way  to settle the nuclear issue. However, the U.S. assistant  secretary of state, who ardently insisted on settling the issue  through dialogue, has been forced to declare "suspension of the  third round of talks." Considering such a political situation in  the United States, the only way to break the currently  deadlocked situation is for North Korea to take a sincere  attitude regarding the issue of the removal of its spent nuclear  fuel rods.    Although North Korea has asserted that "fuel rod samples can  be analyzed in the future according to the way we proposed," the  IAEA is not convinced. The IAEA has made concessions regarding  when fuel rod samples would be analyzed. Now, it is North  Korea's turn to make concessions to open the third round of  talks.    Not only will imposing economic sanctions against North  Korea  fail to solve the nuclear issue, but it could also deal a  serious blow to the NPT framework. Considering that North Korea  is being pushed into a corner, there is even a possibility that  military tension might develop as a result of economic sanctions.    It will require a lot of time for the UN Security Council to  discuss economic sanctions. Moreover, its is expected that in  the end, the PRC will exercise its veto power. For this reason,  the Japanese Government is considering joining the U.S. and ROK  Governments toward imposing multilateral sanctions against North  Korea, outside of the UN framework. However, we urge that the  government exercise caution. It is necessary to continue  striving to settle the issue through dialogue, at all costs,  with both the PRC and Russia, which border the Korean peninsula,  participating in the discussions.</p>

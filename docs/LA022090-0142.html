			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BOOSTER'S CAR PAYMENTS DENIED  </P> <P> A former UNLV basketball player says he or his ex-girlfriend made all the  payments on a car he leased from a former university booster during his senior  year.  </P> <P> Anthony Jones, now with the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA, said the booster, C.  J. Lotter, did not help in making any of the payments.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday that Lotter, during the 1985-86 season,  made payments on the 1982 Mazda RX7 which Jones was driving.  </P> <P> Nevada Department of Motor Vehicle records show that the car was purchased by  Lotter in October, 1984, and was registered in his name until May, 1987.  </P> <P> Jones, reached by telephone in Cleveland, said that he only had the car in his  possession for six or seven months and that that was only after he had  completed his senior season of eligibility in 1986. Jones said he or his former  girlfriend made all the payments, which were $115 per month.  </P> <P> If Lotter made car payments on Jones' behalf, as The Times reported, it would  be in violation of NCAA rules.  </P></p>

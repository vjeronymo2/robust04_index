			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HEADLINE UNFAIRLY RIPPED DOUCETTE  </P> <P> I just had an opportunity to read your "Viewpoint" column in last Saturday's  edition of The Times.  </P> <P> I was aghast to see such a large damaging headline applied to such a petty  article about Eddie Doucette. I believe Doucette does a great job of selling  the Rams without much to work with this year. The article was a small  viewpoint; your headline was a large injustice.  </P> <P> THOMAS L.

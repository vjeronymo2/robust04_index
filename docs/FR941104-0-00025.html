			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA, in its authorization of the State of Washington for RCRA corrective action, is not authorizing the State to ```regulate' mixed waste disposed of prior to 1986'' as suggested by the commenter. Rather, the authorization will allow the State to assert  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> corrective action <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (cleanup of past releases) jurisdiction, which is not RCRA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> operational <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (day-to-day waste handling and management) jurisdiction, over solid waste (which includes the hazardous component of radioactive mixed waste) at solid waste management units at facilities seeking permits under RCRA. The State of Washington received final authorization for RCRA operational jurisdiction over radioactive mixed waste on November 23, 1987.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter pointed out that EPA was not authorizing the State of Washington at this time for the ``omnibus'' authority of section 3005(c)(3) of RCRA, yet the State corrective action program and regulations indicate that the State will assert authority over releases of hazardous waste and constituents from ``non-SWMU'' units and areas. The commenter then asks whether EPA will assert its omnibus authority along with the State authority over corrective action for non-SWMU releases, and if so, how will EPA conduct such action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, EPA cannot disregard its statutory obligations under RCRA to require corrective actions where EPA deems such actions to be necessary to protect human health and the environment. However, EPA also does not intend to require duplicative efforts under two separate statutory or regulatory schemes at any given facility. EPA is not authorizing the state of Washington for RCRA ``omnibus'' authority as part of today's authorization. As such, State regulations which allow the State to require corrective action for releases from non-SWMUs are ``broader in scope'' than the corrective action program for which the State is currently seeking authorization and, as such, are not federally enforceable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, EPA's statutory obligations under sections 3008(h), 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6928(h), 6934, and 6973, to ensure protection of human health and the environment, empower EPA to ensure that all releases of hazardous waste are addressed. These statutory authorities are independent from EPA's oversight of the authorized state corrective action program. Should EPA decide that assertion of EPA statutory authority is necessary, such action will be coordinated with any ongoing State action to ensure that duplicative actions are not taken unless necessary to protect human health or the environment. However, EPA does not anticipate that it will have to exercise such authority very often, given the protectiveness embodied in the State's MTCA statute and the manner in which the State has implemented the MTCA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter questioned that once a State-issued order is incorporated by reference into the facility's RCRA permit, can that order be amended without a corresponding modification of the RCRA permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, at the time the State order is incorporated by reference into a RCRA permit, the order becomes subject to all permitting requirements, including public participation requirements required for permit modifications. This includes any State-issued orders designating a corrective action management unit (CAMU) or temporary unit (TU). Therefore, if at some time after incorporation by reference into a RCRA permit, it is determined that the incorporated order must be changed, such a change will require a permit modification as well. The class of permit modification required, along with the extent of public participation required by such a modification, will be determined using the State regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter requested clarification of the public participation process to be used by the State under the authorized corrective action program. Specifically, the commenter pointed out that MTCA orders have their own public participation process. The commenter queried whether there would be a second public participation process at the time such order would be incorporated into a RCRA permit. The commenter also queried to what extent the public would be able to comment on the previously issued order at the time of permit issuance or modification; and to what extent the existing State regulations governing public participation would operate in lieu of the federal regulations codified at 40 CFR 124.11 through 124.17.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, the commenter is referred to the Program Description contained in this application for authorization, wherein Washington's Department of Ecology explains how public participation goals and requirements will be met. In brief, the State will follow only the existing MTCA public participation requirements (which are extensive) when a MTCA order is issued prior to permit issuance. Since that is not a RCRA permit action, there are no RCRA permit public participation requirements which apply. At the time the order is incorporated into a RCRA permit through permit modification, or if the order is issued concurrently with the RCRA permit, the permit issuance or modification will be under the State's authorized corrective action program. The RCRA public participation requirements would govern the public participation process at that time. However, public comment at that time will be limited to whether the incorporated MTCA terms, schedules and conditions appropriately fulfill corrective action requirements of the authorized State RCRA program. Public comment on the MTCA terms, schedules and conditions will not affect the ability of the state to enforce the MTCA order under MTCA authority, independent of the authorized RCRA corrective action program. At the time the MTCA order is incorporated into a RCRA permit, and at any time thereafter for the life of the RCRA permit, Ecology will ensure that the public participation procedures under RCRA and MTCA are coordinated to eliminate duplication of effort and fulfill RCRA requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

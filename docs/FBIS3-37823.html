At the same time, he told Interfax-Ukraine that Russia  continued to supply Ukraine with gas.    According to Yalovega, Ukrainian consumers "have nothing  special to worry about, for the republic's facilities store gas  in sufficient quantities which would last until the end of the  heating season."    Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Valentin Landyk told a press  conference in Kiev today that Ukraine will send 60,000 tons of  grain to Turkmenistan to reimburse part of its debt for Turkmen  gas that he estimated at $150 Mn. However, Turkmenistan  believes that the debt has already reached $700 Mn.    Landyk added that a telephone conversation between acting  Ukrainian Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy and the Turkmen  leadership failed to help resume the deliveries.    In 1993, Ukraine received 25.5 Bn cubic meters of gas from  Turkmenistan and another 69 Bn cubic meters from Russia.</p>

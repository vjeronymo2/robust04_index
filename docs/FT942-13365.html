			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / S Africa bomb toll mounts as right wing targets poll Twelve people were killed as bombers struck again in South Africa yesterday, raising fears that rightwing extremists are planning to target polling stations in the country's first all-race elections which start today. Last night in Pretoria two people were killed and nearly 30 injured, nine seriously, when a bomb was thrown from a passing car into a cafe at a transit point for black commuters. Earlier a car bomb exploded at a minibus taxi rank used by blacks in Germiston, near Johannesburg, killing 10 people and injuring 36 others. A man claiming to be a spokesman for the White Freedom Movement - a small pro-apartheid group banned in 1988 but legalised two years later - told a newspaper the group was responsible for the Germiston bomb. The bombings brought the number of attacks since Saturday to 13. Nine people were killed and nearly 100 injured in Sunday's car bomb explosion in central Johannesburg. Security in and around polling stations was being tightened last night after talks between President FW de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader. Today the elderly and infirm go to the polls, as well as South Africans abroad. The rest of the 22m eligible voters are able to cast their ballots tomorrow and on Thursday. The attacks, which have shattered the optimism that greeted the decision a week ago of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi to take part in the poll, are expected to target the 9,000 polling stations around the country. Shortly before the attack in Germiston, Mr de Klerk stressed the election would go ahead. 'We are not going to allow the right wing or anyone else to delay this election,' he said. At the same time, the shift of conservative opinion to the Freedom Front led by retired army general Constand Viljoen, which is taking part in the election, continued yesterday as MPs and town councillors defected from the Conservative party, which is boycotting the poll. The impact of the bombs on the election outcome is hard to determine. Research suggested blacks were more inured to violence than whites, and thus more likely to ignore the risk and cast their vote. Apart from tightening security measures, Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela are understood to be close to agreeing on an amnesty for perpetrators of past acts of violence in an attempt to defuse the rightwing threat and reassure white members of the security forces fearful of retribution under an ANC-led government. Bombs have also gone off at the Steynsburg town hall in the eastern Cape, at Bloemhof magistrates' court in western Transvaal, and at a taxi rank in Randfontein, west of Johannesburg. Most of the attacks have been close to polling stations. South African police have offered a R1m (Pounds 185,000) reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. The stock market shrugged off news of the bombings, with the general index finishing up 28 points at 5,068. Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, yesterday promised to boost US business investment in South Africa and double US assistance to Dollars 160m (Pounds 109.5m) once a new government was installed in Pretoria.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Inflated Payrolls and the Labor Parliament"] </F>   [Text] The first 267 sessions held in workplaces to discuss  the economic and financial problems of both the nation and of  each workplace reveal the people's growing awareness of the need  to end the negative phenomenon of inflated payrolls.    However, the real consensus on this strategic goal does not  guarantee that there will be the same agreement on tactics,  which deal with how to bring about a downsizing process.    Many other questions on this issue may have answers that do  not always agree. For that very reason, they are an important  topic of debate at the Workers' Parliaments being held in  workplaces.    In these discussions, however, it is wise not to exaggerate  the impact of an overlarge work force on the inefficiency of  some workplaces.    Payroll is, of course, an element to be considered in  seeking  efficiency, but not the only one, and in our present situation  it is possible that it may not even be the most important factor  in a great many places.    We want to make this clear and apply a remedy before it is  too late, so as to keep administrative reports from dragging  this out with excessive analyses of this aspect of a complex  solution, while rejecting other approaches that might well have  a greater impact on inefficiency, and which could be introduced  quickly without having to engage in consultations.    As an example, let us take the case of workplaces with  massive quantities of missing items, items that are not paid for  and workers that do not pay for their sales and purchases;  workplaces where workers squander raw materials and fuels  without respecting or even considering consumption regulations;  workplaces where workers produce very low quality goods;  workplaces with workers with high absenteeism rates, etc., etc.,  etc.    In summary, we believe it is better to analyze thoroughly  other possibilities for improving efficiency, before seeking  immediate solutions by downsizing payrolls.    We say this, among other reasons, so as not to forget that  the sensitive downsizing process cannot tolerate improvisations  or local measures not in full compliance with our state policy,  and with the decisive participation of the union movement.    "No downsizing process can be carried out without the  unions.  This is a requirement, an essential condition for it to be done  with quality. It is an orderly and managed process," stated  Carlos Lage, vice president of the Executive Committee of the  Council of Ministers, speaking at the recent session of the  National Committee of the CTC [Cuban Workers Federation].    Lage also explained that the guiding principle continues to  be to transfer surplus personnel to other activities or to  create new, economically justified functions within the same  workplace.    It is clear that the ministries and their sector and  business  institutions can and must study and suggest solutions, but their  actual application will depend on a general policy approved at  higher levels with the input of the CTC and its unions.    We maintain that the payroll downsizing process should be  done gradually, avoiding traumatic consequences in any sector,  area, or activity of labor.    We agree that labor restructuring should proceed quickly in  workplaces whose products are essential for our economic  revitalization, and which currently have difficulty performing  their functions.    In general, the view that downsizing and its dynamics are  related to the potential for existing jobs or jobs that may be  created in the territories or in enterprises and sectors should  take priority; an active policy of training and retraining must  be included.    It is our view that future decisions on payroll downsizing  should be based on case-by-case analyses, not on  one-size-fits-all formulas.    In the Workers' Parliament sessions, the most informative  and  educational thing may be payroll analyses to determine what  salaries paid inefficiently mean in terms of the actual cost per  peso of production. This might serve as a basis for finding  solutions for the problem.    That cost breakdown must be prepared so that the cost per  factory, per shop, per shift will be shown.    If these data for the enterprise are available, but the  workers do not know them, the current effort to improve  efficiency loses one of its best weapons.    We also wish to speak out against simplistic views that  consider the mobilization of personnel for agricultual  activities, microbrigades, or defense work, like building  people's tunnels, as sources of workplace inefficiency.    These personnel, said Lage at the meeting mentioned earlier,  cannot be considered surplus, for their work is useful to the  nation.    Now that the parliaments are being intensified at  workplaces,  it is worthwhile for the problem of surplus personnel to be  analyzed everywhere without embellishing or concealing anything,  with the certainty that there is no room for discouragement or  confusion.    The solutions are in the hands of the workers. We must make  sure that any future decision on employment and relocations will  reconcile the interests of the nation and social justice.</p>

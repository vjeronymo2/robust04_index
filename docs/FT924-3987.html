			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Arts: Levine and the Vienna Philharmonic - Concerts on the South Bank The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, in its 150th year of existence, has decided to spread itself more generously around the world. Cities other than the home base - London, Berlin, Paris, New York, Tokyo - are to be visited on a regular basis. This should be a cause for wide rejoicing: the orchestra remains probably the most admired in the world, and in the 19th-century Austro-German repertory (much of which is the orchestra's native inheritance) it continues to set a standard - for sound at once broad and warm in tonal character, mellow in blend, uniquely 'together' in corporate personality - by which other orchestras tend to be measured. However, Wednesday's concert at the Royal Festival Hall, which launched the initiative (and which was transmitted live on Radio 3), was far from affording a great occasion. James Levine, the conductor, has been absent from London since the mid-1970s; one wanted to cheer his return, since in the intervening period he has grown into a figure of weighty significance on the international scene. It became increasingly hard to do so, since Mr Levine's direction of of Brahms, Schoenberg and Debussy was so plainly the reason for the artistic dullness, superficiality and (at times) gross vulgarity that hung on the evening like a lead weight. The Brahms was the Third Symphony. The orchestra's seating - violins opposite each other, violas and cellos in the middle - is the correct one, and its virtues were apparent in the even spread of beautiful sound, neither lopsided nor out of balance with the winds. In Brahms performance, though, beautiful sound is only the starting point: intellectual and emotional adventure, risk-taking, decisive approach to musical ideas are the necessary next stages. This Brahms Three began and ended with beautiful sound. It lacked energy, inner direction, strength of conviction; it gave the impression of rather tired imitation, of Vienna Phil re-production. At least, though, the language that Levine and his performers were speaking was recognisably, if not interestingly, Brahmsian. Their Schoenberg - the Five Orchestral Pieces, Op. 16 - was incoherent, with exquisite detail followed by muzziness and uncertainty (frankly, I wondered how completely the players had mastered the music). Their Debussy - La Mer - was simply grotesque: timbres worlds away from idiomatic leanness, every percussion flicker turned into a slam and a bang (the close of the first movement came direct from the J. Arthur Rank School of Debussy Interpretation), not the faintest grasp of how to mould sentences into paragraphs and thence into whole movements. The language of La Mer seemed mystifyingly foreign to these executants; their attempts to conceal incomprehension with regular recourse to inflated gesturing proved unsuccessful, to put it politely. Next VPO appearances on February 8, conductor Solti, and May 30, conductor Muti</p>

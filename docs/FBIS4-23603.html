			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 9 SAPA -- The South African  Government viewed nationalisation as a constitutional option  which should not be applied, President Nelson Mandela said on  Thursday. Answering questions after his opening address to the  two-day World Economic Forum [WEF] conference in Cape Town, he  said a clause of the African National Congress' Freedom Charter  of 1955 had called for the nationalisation of a "limited sector"  of the economy -- the mines, banks and monopolies.    That had been the correct strategy because history had shown  countries had not been able to escape nationalisation after a  trauma such as war.    However, he and the ANC had been "so hammered" on the  nationalisation issue at the 1992 WEF conference in Davos,  Switzerland, that it "became clear that although we were correct  in this strategy, we had to do something if we wanted investment  in the country", Mr Mandela said -- to applause and laughter  from the international and local delegates.    The ANC had, therefore, shifted its stance and its position  today was exactly the same as that of Germany, where the  constitution provided for nationalisation but where it had not  been implemented for decades.    "Now our position is a pragmatic one," President Mandela  added.</p>

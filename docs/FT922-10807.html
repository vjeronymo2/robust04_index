			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Survey of The Isle of Man (2): More life companies enjoy tax benefits - Investment THE MANX investment industry, once regarded as a disreputable dwelling for dubious dealers, received the stamp of royal approval last week. Clerical Medical International, one of the most successful life assurance groups to have started on the island in the last decade, won a Queen's Award for Export Achievement. Mr Miles Walker, the chief minister, was delighted by the news, but added: 'It not only reflects their business acumen but also endorses the status which the Isle of Man has earned and continues to earn as a growing worldwide financial services centre.' This assessment is not over-stated. Life assurance has been a particular success for the island, as life company subsidiaries have taken advantage of tax privileges introduced to encourage captive insurance companies. Insurers which do no business on the island are exempt from tax. Last year, Hafnia Prolific International, a subsidiary of the Danish life group, became the latest to establish itself in Douglas. By the end of its first year HPI had Pounds 50m in funds under management, a figure which has since grown to around Pounds 80m. It now employs more than 20 people and is set to move to a new office, although the merger of Hafnia with Skandia, whose subsidiary Royal Skandia is also based on the island, may put a long-term question mark over its future. The island's space for expansion has also helped. For example, Royal Life International, the largest and longest established Manx life insurer, has moved its 170 employees into a spacious new building on the southern tip of the island - a marked improvement on the five offices the company used touse. Royal Skandia's new office, in a renovated church which forms one of Douglas' most distinctive landmarks, would also make most City-dwellers green with envy. Marketing has been the key to the expansion of CMI, and of Royal Life International. They no longer concentrate on the UK expatriate market, but instead look for 'international investors'. CMI now has more than 60 outlets around the world. The tax position of the island allows high net worth individuals, even if resident in their own country, to benefit, and marketeers are finally learning to exploit this. Hong Kong accounts for 25 per cent fo CMI's business and 35 per cent of RLI's, and both are exploiting new markets in South America, the Gulf, and Africa. Allied Dunbar, which manages Dollars 177m on the island for 7,000 clients, is also revamping its sales practices, with the creation of a new post in charge of international marketing. New concessions for non-life linked funds could be vital for the life groups. The government wants fund management to provide an appropriate 'third leg' to their financial services industry, joining banking and insurance. The tax incentives introduced last year to bring in fund managers amount almost to personal bribes. From April 6 this year, managers of Isle of Man collective investment schemes have paid a concessionary 5 per cent rate of income tax. This incentive will last at least until 2005. Earlier this month Pierson Heldring &amp; Pierson, a subsidiary of ABN Amro Bank, set up a fund administration subsidiary on the island, and cited tax concessions as the main reason for its decision - music to the government's ears. The island also offers an attractive regulatory framework for managers wanting to start innovative funds. The options are as follows: Authorised schemes are designed to be directly comparable to UK authorised unit trusts. This puts broad limits on the types of securities which can be held, but allows Manx trusts, with their tax advantages, to be marketed on the same basis as UK unit trusts. In December last year, the Japan Securities Dealers Association in Tokyo announced that these schemes were eligible for sale to Japanese investors. Mr Donald Gelling, treasury minister, called this 'a further boost to our efforts to develop the Island as the major 'Offshore Europe' funds location of the 1990s'. Restricted schemes are described by Mr Christopher Edmonds, collective investments supervisor, as 'second tier' funds for offer to sophisticated private investors. Examples would include managed futures and options funds, or derivatives funds which offer a 'guarantee'. These cannot be marketed with the same freedom as a unit trust, but they could provide many firms with attractive options for their private clients. There are now 68 such schemes, and regulators are hoping for a swift expansion. Exempted restricted schemes are essentially private, and of appeal only to professional investors such as pension funds. The maximum number of participants is 50, and these schemes may not be offered to the general public. But the Manx authorities hope they will help to funnel more funds in the island's direction - for example, Mr Edmonds suggests that pension funds could spread risk by collaborating on offshore derivatives funds using this vehicle. Closed-end schemes, similar to UK-based investment trusts, are also allowed, as are limited partnerships. Since they are not regarded as collective investment schemes, but as companies, they are not subject to strict regulation. Judging by progress so far, it seems that the Isle of Man's third financial leg is alive and kicking.</p>

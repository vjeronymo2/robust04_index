			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: An unpalatable fix for some European regions Sir, Christopher Jackson, (Letters, October 26) correctly states that moving to irrevocable fixed exchange rates is a more attractive option in many ways than moving straight to a single currency. Cocaine is also a lower health risk than heroin, and I suspect he would find the medium-term effects of either fix unpalatable. The basic economic argument is clear, and cannot be repeated too often. It is that fixed exchange rates in an environment of less than free capital and labour markets, both in mobility and price, worsen regional recessions. Europe's labour markets are far from free, and we are facing a big employment challenge now and for the foreseeable future. The introduction of fixed rates can only make that challenge harder. As Germany will not accept a common currency, but would accept fixed rates, I expect we will get them, and the unemployed somewhere in Europe will be paying for Mr Jackson's 'relief from the cost and fuss of changing currencies'.

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Call for reduction in excise duties Britain must cut its excise duties to the same levels as France in order to prevent the cross-Channel bootlegging of alcohol, says London Economics, the consultancy. The group says in a report that legitimate cross-Channel trade in alcohol costs Britain between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m a year, while illegal trade results in further losses. The price of an average bottle of wine is 69 per cent higher in Britain than in France, while a case of beer costs 123 per cent more. The consultancy estimates that cross-Channel travellers could soon be spending Pounds 1bn a year on alcohol, and that by 2000, more than 10 per cent of UK spending on alcoholic beverages will occur in France. It adds that the trade also limits the ability of the government to discourage alcohol abuse by raising prices. The report has been backed by Tesco, the supermarket chain, which said it lost Pounds 38m of alcohol sales to French retailers last year. Tesco is calling for a freeze on excise duties and a harmonisation of European Union duty rates. Cross-Border Shopping. London Economics, 91 New Cavendish Street, London W1M 7PS.</p>

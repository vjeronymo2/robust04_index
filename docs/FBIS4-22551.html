Jokingly he said that working for the government he  feels himself much wiser. His hair became grayer and he lost  some weight. No matter, he will set things right and promises to  create ten years of progress. He was born in Khmelnitsk Oblast,  to a peasant family. After school and a technikum he worked for  three years at the Twice Hero of Socialist Labor Grigoryy  Tkachuk Farm, and learned from that experience. He graduated  from the Kharkov Veterinary Institute and served in the army.  Then in Zaporozhye he started accumulating years of independent  economic activity: chief veterinarian, kolkhoz deputy chairman,  and chairman. Later, party schooling as first secretary of the  rayon committee for many years. He was invited by Pelsha to  Moscow, for work at the KPK [Committee of Party Control]. He  refused. People pointed their fingers at him saying that only an  abnormal person would turn down an apartment in Moscow.  Subsequently he was elected chairman of the Zaporozhye Oblast  Executive Committee. Without connections, without bribes, using  only his own head and through his determination he managed in  one of the largest industrial oblasts of Ukraine. Later he  worked for a year as representative of the president. In October  1992 he became vice premier. He speaks of that time as follows:  "I was really a lucky man! I had just arrived when there were  two years of drought and I was told to buy five million tonnes  of grain wherever I want, including in America. I went there and  was told: the Union has been destroyed--you must resolve the  problems on your own. My wife told me: don't complain, our time  will come and, indeed, our situation slowly started to improve."    [Question] Vladimir Vasilyevich, is it true that prices for  agricultural products in Ukraine, by contrast with those for  others, have gone up over the past months by just one percent?  How did you manage that under conditions of such a tremendous  rise in the cost of living?    [Answer] We stopped trading on the stock market, regulated  the money rate. By the way, the same course is now being  followed by the government of Belarus as well. Our economy was,  of course, seriously undermined by fuel prices, which led to a  rise in prices for all agricultural products. Through the  regulation of procurement prices, however, we managed to  accomplish something. We calculated procurement prices for grain  of the new harvest in the following manner: we divided 1,290,000  coupons by the new exchange rate of 12.6 and obtained 90  dollars. That is the world price for grain.    We use the same rate in settling accounts for fuel and  fertilizers. That served to calm down the peasants somewhat,  convinced them that there would be no sharp rise in prices for  industrial products and that it is possible to work without  worrying.    [Question] What are the results of the last agricultural  year? What was it possible to attain with state price regulation?    [Answer] Liberalization of prices, just as their regulation,  equally leads to a decline in production. Under our conditions,  however, the latter proved to be beneficial. We managed to  convince the peasant that his labor is not wasted and he reaped  a grain harvest eight million tonnes greater than in 1992. At  the same time, we are now recording only cleaned high-grade  grain.    The distribution of land helped. At present 5.6 million  hectares of arable land are privately owned. Cereal crops in the  public sector shrunk by a million hectares. That is all right.  We did not purchase grain on the side like other foodstuffs .  Moreover the private sector yielded 40 percent of all  agricultural products in gross terms, diminishing the load on  kolkhozes and sovkhozes.    For the first time we gathered the entire sugar beet harvest  in just one month whereas previously that operation took three  months. This was done despite the fact that there was a shortage  of fuel. Despite the overall decrease in cattle stock over the  past two years, we managed to increase it by 200,000 head. Take  a look for yourself: all 30 trains departing Kiev are filled  with foodstuffs.    In the newspapers, however, one reads that if the Ukrainian  does not starve to death in the morning, he will certainly be  doing so in the evening.    [Question] Do you feel any product intervention by western  suppliers, particularly with regard to sugar as well as liquor  and spirits?    [Answer] I just read in IZVESTIYA that the Russian  government  raised customs duties on imported products by 15 - 20 percent  and that this is prompting a price explosion. We are also doing  this and will continue doing so in order to protect our  producer, even though his products today are more expensive than  the imported ones. At the same time, however, we are trying to  support the monopoly on sale and purchase of agricultural  products within the state. A package of legislative documents  has been worked out allowing the peasant to sell his harvest in  any way profitable to him. Our trade has been semi-privatized,  and the director of a meat combine today does not stay in his  office but searches for the best partner for himself in the  countryside.    The Barnaul meeting of representatives of CIS countries is  coming up on the protection of agricultural products from  foreign commodity intervention, and I want to discuss that issue  once more with V. Zaveryukha, vice premier of Russia. We must  know how to protect ourselves. No one is waiting for us on the  western market, all the markets there have already been divided  up.    [Question] You have probably heard about the war taking  place  between Moscow and Moscow Oblast in the area of food  procurement. The mayor of Moscow uses foreign currency credit to  purchase cheaper, but perhaps lower quality products abroad,  while farms in the oblast are compelled to ship their products  either to Siberia or the Far East or bury them in the ground.    [Answer] God protect us from the conduct of such a policy.  Our butter, meat, and sausage are of better quality than the  foreign products and why should we undermine the roots of our  public and private sectors. We now created a state procurement  order which is 10 percent of the previous one. The remainder  will be planned by them on their own. But this is due to our  poverty. Agriculture is subsidized, mentored, and regulated  throughout the world. In the former GDR only 30 percent of the  collective farms disintegrated. The remaining 70 percent are  alive and thriving. Their production is much cheaper than that  of farmers in the former FRG.    Wheat is sold to the American farmer for 120 dollars and  bought for 245. The government at present has no money. What is  the solution? We are liberalizing prices. But that is better  than cheating the peasants by telling them that we will pay and  then giving them nothing in return.    We are not aspiring toward a revolution in agriculture but  are proceeding along the evolutionary path, with caution, so as  not to destroy its basis. In the future, if we provide our  worker with agricultural equipment of the highest quality, along  with means to protect the harvest and are able to subsidize our  kolkhoz members and farmers, like the Americans, then life will  be much better.    [Question] What tasks are you planning on resolving in the  new agricultural year?    [Answer] In the last two years we have had to alter the  mechanism of mutual economic relations between the state and the  farms every month. It would be so desirable to create a  situation where visiting the peasants one would be told: finally  the government did not cheat us. This year we invested 20  trillion karbovantsy in the state procurement order for grain,  sugar beets, potatoes, and sunflower seeds alone. The remainder  will be placed under complete control of the producers of the  goods themselves. Nevertheless the problem remains. I see the  struggle among various forces taking place both in Russia and in  our own case. The most "fearsome" individual is the one who  insists on the fulfillment of his obligations. Last year I did  everything possible in order to purchase all the grain from the  villages, that, of course, increased prices, but we do have  grain, it did not rot in pits. This year the bankers have got us  by the throat. We, however, have established the following  course--we purchase currency in the bidding committee, dollars  at the state price, purchase oil, fuel, and fertilizers and  supply them to the farms, converting everything to world prices.  In the fall they will return products to us at the same world  price. This is a non-monetary form of commodity turnover. But  that is a solution only for today.    Probably for the first time we are confronted by the  full-blown problem of not where to buy, but how to buy from the  capitalists and to whom we should sell our products.    The most important matter today is to finance the 30 percent  of the products that the agricultural sector will provide for  us. This is an extremely difficult problem but it cannot be  avoided.</p>

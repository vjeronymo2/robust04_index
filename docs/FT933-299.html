			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (5): Price has risen steeply in two years - Creditors have been asked to show imagination over debt IN A LITTLE over two years, the price of Peruvian commercial bank debt on the secondary market has climbed tenfold from 4 cents for every dollar of face value to more than 40 cents. The price has risen as the government has made great efforts to re-insert itself into the international mainstream of finance. Many followers of this market find it difficult to understand why the price has remained at these lofty levels. The reason, in part, is that there are few 'plays' left in the bank debt market for speculators and an inordinate amount of interest has been funnelled into a small amount of debt. According to bankers close to the talks which have restarted between the government and its leading commercial bank creditors, the International Monetary Fund is telling the bankers there is not much in the pot for debt servicing until the end of the millennium. The IMF figures suggest that paying interest on all public sector debt should amount to just under 4 per cent of gross domestic product until the end of 1995. This is more than 40 per cent of what the government is collecting in taxes and represents already too heavy a burden on an administration that needs to rebuild social expenditures after the depredations of the 1980s. However, according to prime minister Mr Alfonso Bustamante, there is some leeway: 'There is room to pay something to banks.' However, since 'only half of the Dollars 6bn is principal, the rest is interest. This makes it very difficult.' In no large bank rescheduling so far has the ratio of past due interest to principal been so high - a problem because commercial banks like to penalise interest arrears in reschedulings so as to discourage them. A further problem is the more than 50 pending legal suits from banks against the government, the most difficult of which concerns a Dollars 20m loan from Chemical Bank made in 1984 to the now defunct Compania Peruana de Vapores. The government of President Alan Garcia repudiated the debt, claiming that the transaction was fraudulent. President Albert Fujimori has asked for imagination from creditors in approaching the debt issue. Mr Jorge Gonzales Izquierdo, head of the economic faculty at the University of the Pacific, says that imagination has been in short supply. Mr Gonzales Izquierdo calls for a three-track approach to the problem: ask for a deep debt forgiveness, including from the Paris Club of creditor nations to which Peru owes Dollars 8bn of its total Dollars 23bn foreign debt; get waivers from banks to buy back the commercial debt in the secondary market; and aggressively use the debt, heavily discounted, as currency in privatisation programmes. The approach has not been followed in part because of the deep dislike of Japan to debt forgiveness on its own debts. Upsetting the Japanese government by demanding debt write-downs would potentially jeopardise new aid flows from Tokyo, which have become especially important with the hold up of aid flows from the US because of human rights concerns. Furthermore, the price of the debt at the moment would act as a deterrent to a successful buyback programme. The government says it is working on the debt-equity conversion idea, but the soundings coming from government officials suggest it will be less than aggressive. Mr Bustamante says: 'We are evaluating the debt-for-equity issue. We think that where a company is very profitable we prefer to sell for cash. Where a company is losing money, we can sell it for debt.' Yet the rules are still to be worked out. If the privatisation programme goes ahead as the government is envisaging, it had better get a move on.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                    PERU - BASIC SOCIO-ECONOMIC DATA  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                               1983     1984     1985    1986    1987  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Annual percentage change  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Consumer price index         111.2    110.2    163.4    77.9    85.8 Real GDP per capita          -14.6      2.5      0.0     6.9     6.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                              USDollars million  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total debt                  11,344   12,157   12,885  14,887  17,491  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                               1988     1989     1990    1991    1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Annual percentage change  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Consumer price index         667.1  3,398.7  7,482.6   409.5    72.5 Real GDP per capita          -10.2    -13.5     -7.0     0.3    -4.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                              USDollars million  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total debt                  17,971   18,249   19,429  20,709  20,829  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IADB  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                        KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  1989   1990     1991     1992    1993*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Real GDP growth (%)             -11.7   -5.1      2.4     -2.9      3.5 Trade balance (USDollars bn)     1.20   0.34    -0.17    -0.57    -0.60 Current Account balance   (USDollars bn)                 0.40  -0.77    -1.48    -2.03    -2.53  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  * As envisaged in IMF programme  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: C.

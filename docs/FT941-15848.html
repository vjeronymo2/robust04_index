			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Party members face expulsion Five Labour party members face expulsion next week over claims that they campaigned for rebel former MPs during the last general election. The five lecturers and union officials, all from Coventry, will be questioned over claims that they supported Mr Dave Nellist - the former Coventry South East MP, who was expelled before the 1992 general election for his alleged links with Militant - and Mr John Hughes, the former Coventry North East MP, who was de-selected. Both stood against the official Labour candidates. The five have described the events leading up to their suspension as 'the biggest purge of its type for decades'. A quarter of Coventry's membership was suspended after the election and 127 members were investigated.</p>

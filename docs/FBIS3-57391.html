			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kyrgyz </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin </F> message to President Askar Akayev]    [Text] Estemeed Askar Akayevich, as you know, Russia  closely follows with interest (?the development of events in  Kyrgyzstan) and the steps which the government of Kyrgyzstan is  taking so as to tackle difficult economic, social, and political  problems in the transitional period. This is understandable  since similar processes are also taking place in Russia.    On the other hand, and this is very important, the future  and  the status of Russian-Kyrgyzstan relations depends a great deal  on how successful we are in our movement toward transformations  and the wise choice by our people of the main directions, values  and priorities. Cooperation and friendly relations between the  two independent countries should be built on this basis.    I want to emphasize that we strive to strengthen friendly  relations and wish for comprehensive cooperation with  Kyrgyzstan, its president and the government in the interests of  common goals.    We are devoted to the deep historically based roots  connecting the Kyrgyz and Russian peoples, the fruitful legacy  of which could not only be preserved but also enriched. This is  especially important in light of the fact that in many centuries  of our history the fates of the citizens of Russia and  Kyrgyzstan have become intertwined.    We have already covered a major part of the path in building  Russian-Kyrgyzstan relations. Its legal and normative basis has  been created; a mechanism for realizing bilateral relations is  being upgraded. Of course, we still have much to do in building  our interstate relations, and should take into consideration the  existing realities and common interests as well as the  aspirations of the two countries toward preserving close  relations, comprehensive interaction and mutual understanding.    Like you, Askar Akayevich, I am sure that the considerable  intellectual and professional potential of the Russian-speaking  community residing in Kyrgyzstan could be used effectively in  successful implemention of political and economic reforms,  strengthening democratic [word indistinct] and maintaining the  interethnic accord of the peoples of Kyrgyzstan.    We understand that this is the goal of a state program aimed  at stabilizing the status of the Russian-speaking community. It  is being elaborated with the participation of different public  forces of the republic.    We highly evaluate, Askar Akayevich, your personal  contribution to the development of Kyrgyzstan-Russian relations,  your activity aimed at strengthening [words indistinct] and  democratic transformations in the republic. I am convinced that  only on the basis of real economic and political  transformations, and by joining our efforts will we succeed in  achieving progress and prosperity for our nations. In  connection with this I confirm the readiness of Russia to  continue rendering economic assistance and support to the  fraternal Kyrgyzstan. I want to wish you, estemeed Askar  Akayevich, success in your honorable work in the interests of  multinational Kyrgyzstan. Together with you we are ready to do  everything [word indistinct] to develop and strengthen  friendship and cooperation. [passage indistinct]</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / China protests at conditions of MFN renewal PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday signed a one-year extension of China's Most Favoured Nation trade status but backed away from imposing tough conditions on renewal in 1994. China yesterday protested nevertheless. It said the attachment of any conditions for renewing China's trading status next year was an 'open violation' of a standing agreement and seriously threatened bilateral relations. With congressional Democrats by his side, the president has sought a middle ground between US business interests and a campaign promise to take strong action on human rights. The conditions Mr Clinton imposed are not legally binding but simply order the secretary of state not to recommend another MFN extension unless China has demonstrated progress on human rights and other issues. Mr Clinton called on China to release political prisoners, to recognise Tibet's 'distinctive religious and cultural heritage,' to permit international radio and television broadcasts into China and follow humane practices in the use of prison labour. He said he wanted Chinese progress on nuclear non-proliferation and eliminating trade barriers. The president sought to compensate for the absence of tough action with rhetoric. Bringing human rights into the trade equation is 'a new chapter in United States policy to China,' he said. He does not want 'to isolate China' but is 'standing up for American values.' Congressional leaders, who liked to bash President Bush on the issue were quick to praise President Clinton's 'leadership.' 'For the first time since the events of Tiananmen Square, nearly four years ago, we have a president who is willing to act in order to bring about positive change,' said Senator George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader and a long time crusader on the issue.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Clinton goes on tour to recapture lost elan PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday set out to recapture some of the elan of his election campaign last year, and to garner from voters in the Midwest the support that has been eluding him in Washington. Troubled by his fast fading approval ratings in opinion polls and by the obstacles he has found in Washington to his legislative agenda, Mr Clinton took his case to a more sympathetic audience at a shopping mall in Cleveland, Ohio. Mr Clinton, who last week tried to 'refocus' his administration by adjusting the White House staff structure, mocked those who have criticised him for trying to do too many things at once, asking for help in pushing his economic proposals through Congress as a whole, instead of allowing interest groups to whittle away at each component. 'We've got to do it as a package. If everybody goes around saying what's in it for me instead of what's in it for us, the thing will come apart,' he said. By whipping up public enthusiasm for his programme, Mr Clinton could strengthen his hand with his fellow Democrats in Congress, whose first flush of party loyalty has disappeared as fast as the president's stock has fallen. Back in Washington, however, his critics complain that the two-day Midwestern tour showed Mr Clinton turning his back on the unforgiving task of governing in favour of the more congenial pastime of campaigning. With foreign policy issues such as the Bosnian conflict looming intractably but unavoidably on its agenda, the new administration has been haunted by Mr Clinton's promise to focus 'like a laser beam' on the economy. His principal success in this sphere, the swift passage of a framework budget, was quickly overshadowed by his failure to push through a much smaller short-term spending package. Some administration officials and many Democratic leaders are now worried that the ambitious reform of the healthcare system, which Mr Clinton plans to launch next month, will overload a Congress already choking on the details of a budget plan it has passed only in outline. A centrepiece of the budget proposals, the energy tax, is being attacked by everyone from aluminium producers to farmers. Democratic officials are even more concerned, however, by the persistent sniping of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, whose poll numbers have been rising as Mr Clinton's have fallen.</p>

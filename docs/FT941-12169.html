			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Consumer spending is forecast to rise 17% Consumer spending is expected to increase by 17 per cent in real terms during the next five years, Mintel, the market research organisation, says today. Mintel says the largest spending growth sectors are likely to be household and garden products, medical and school fees, and insurance and pensions. Falls in unemployment and base interest rates and low levels of inflation should lead to higher disposable incomes between 1993 and 1998, with spending on home and security taking priority as the recession ends, the report says. An upturn in the housing market is forecast to stimulate spending on garden products (up 36 per cent during the next five years) and hardware (up 35 per cent). House purchase and alterations expenditure is set to rise by 30 per cent. Spending on medical and education fees is likely to increase by 31 per cent, while insurance and pensions spending is forecast to grow by 26 per cent. Mr Peter Ayton, Mintel's head of research, said there was increasing public concern about the need to prepare for old age and ill health 'in the face of dwindling government resources'. The popularity of home entertainment will be maintained over the period, with sales of brown goods such as televisions and hi-fi equipment, set to increase by 35 per cent, the report says. Interest in healthier lifestyles will increase spending on fruit and vegetables, while soft drinks will continue to be the fastest-growing part of the drinks sector. The highest growth areas in consumer spending over the past year have been: education fees; shoes, clothing and furniture repair; medical insurance; house contents and building insurance. Expenditure in all these areas grew by more than 10 per cent in 1993, the report says. Overall, housing accounted for the largest part of consumer spending last year, as it has in previous years. A total of Pounds 88.4bn - 22.2 per cent of household expenditure - went on housing. Next came transport (Pounds 48.8bn, 12.2 per cent of expenditure), then food eaten at home (Pounds 43.8bn, 11 per cent). A 10-year analysis by Mintel of spending patterns shows some changes in the shape of household budgets. Spending on food eaten at home, heating, lighting and power, domestic appliances and drink now each account for a smaller share of household budgets than in 1983. The proportion of spending on housing has increased from 20.1 per cent to 22.2 per cent. Other spending which has increased its share of the household budget includes insurance and pensions, medical and educational fees, and household services such as cleaning. Over the 10-year period average gross household income increased from Pounds 12,490 to Pounds 23,533. Stripping out inflation, this represents a real increase of 14 per cent, says the report. Mintel, however, also points to a growing polarisation of income. The top-earning 20 per cent of households increased their share of Britain's total household income from 35 per cent in 1979 to 40 per cent in 1992. At the other end of the scale, the share of total income taken by the lowest-earning 20 per cent of households fell from 10 per cent in 1979 to slightly more than 5 per cent in 1992.

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (3): Fixing the cracks - TransCo and the independents Engineers at British Gas's national transmission system control centre at Hinkley in the Midlands can tell you exactly what they were doing on February 14 1994. For on that day a cold snap triggered off a record surge in demand for natural gas. By the end of the day TransCo, British Gas's transportation and storage division, had carried a record 355.25m cubic metres of gas, compared with a daily average of just 168.1mcm. The engineers say the fact that they were able to cope with such a strong surge in demand testifies to the wisdom of years of heavy investment in a transport and distribution system that Richard Giordano, British Gas chairman, recently called the 'biggest and best in the world'. Critics, however, say it is over-engineered and over-built. The creation of Solihull-based TransCo, whose assets are valued at Pounds 17bn, stems from British Gas's decision last March to split the UK business into five domestic divisions. It will retain its status as a national monopoly under the government's liberalisation plan, and is the clear core activity of British Gas's UK operations. It will also play a central role in the introduction of competition in the domestic market. All of the independent marketers as well as British Gas's public gas supply division will use its pipelines to distribute gas to the 18m or so household customers. Transportation costs account for about half of the total bill paid by residential consumers. So the degree to which TransCo cuts its cost base over the next few years will have a big effect on the extent to which domestic gas prices might fall with the onset of competition. Harry Moulson, TransCo's managing director, and his staff of senior executives say they are determined to build an efficient, commercially-driven organisation which is responsive to the needs of its growing list of customers. But relations between it and the independents operating in the commercial and industrial markets already opened to competition have not always been smooth. Last year a number of disputes arose over the slow pace at which TransCo provided billing information to the independents. Mr Moulson attributes the problems to the unexpected speed at which independents took market share away from British Gas's trading arm. 'We believed there would be 3,000-10,000 supply points (for the independents),' he said. 'Now there are 120,000, and we've had to keep it together through fire-fighting.' Shortcomings in the current computer system added to the frustration felt by shippers. TransCo has since designated senior account managers to try to alleviate the tensions. Les Dawson, one of the managers, says: 'Twelve to 15 months ago most shippers said they had difficulties dealing with us. Now its just a handful'. Trust has developed slowly, but some companies are now providing TransCo with details of future business plans. There have even been instances when TransCo executives accompanied the independents on sales presentations to potential customers, a development which would have been unheard of only last year. In addition some TransCo staff may eventually be stationed in the offices of the independents to ensure a speedier service. Mr Moulson says TransCo's new commercial outlook means that it would even consider joint ventures on future pipeline projects. A document spelling out the main elements of the future relationship between TransCo and its customers is currently under consideration. The Network Code will define in detail the commercial and operating regime which will underpin a competitive market. David Dewar, TransCo's development director, admits that the atmosphere during early meetings on the code was 'pretty dire'. He believes there has been a 'dramatic' improvement in recent months, although he worries that the present political impasse could undermine the commitment of some independents to taking part in what is inevitably a time-consuming and highly technical process. There are still many issues, however, on which TransCo and the independents disagree. At present shippers do not have to supply to TransCo on a daily basis the gas their customers consume. But the present system of monthly balancing means that TransCo is 'physically and financially' subsidising them, according to Mr Dewar. The biggest disagreement, however, concerns the valuation of TransCo's assets. Ofgas, the industry regulator, agreed to put off until 1997 a root-and-branch revaluation because of the pressing need to separate TransCo's activities from British Gas's trading arms, and to prepare the company for competition. The independents say a lower valuation could pave the way for substantially lower transportation charges, and hence lower domestic prices. TransCo officials say such demands should be treated with caution, given the constant need to renew and reinforce the network to prepare for future growth, and for the cold winter days which could be just around the corner.</p>

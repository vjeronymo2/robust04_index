			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> LAWRASON GETS FORM TO FILE FOR MAYOR  </P> <P> City Councilman Paul Lawrason is the first elected official to request papers  to run for mayor of Moorpark.  </P> <P> The Nov. 6 election will be the first time Moorpark voters get to select their  mayor.  </P> <P> Historically, the mayor has been chosen for the post by the five-member  council.  </P> <P> Elected to the council in 1988, Lawrason served a six-month stint as mayor  earlier this year. The city's current mayor, Bernardo Perez, has not indicated  whether he will seek reelection.  </P> <P> Although filing does not close until Aug. 10, Councilwoman Eloise Brown has  indicated that she may run for reelection rather than seek the mayor's post, as  had been rumored. Brown said she is keeping her options open, waiting to see if  Councilman Clint Harper decides to run for mayor, as he has indicated.  </P> <P> Harper has not filed for office or requested official papers to do so. Brown, a  councilwoman since 1986, has requested documents to run for another four-year  council term.  </P> <P> Moorpark Planning Commissioner John Wozniak also obtained papers to run for the  City Council, said City Clerk Lillian Kellerman. Appointed in 1987, Wozniak's  term ends this year. PSYCHE PASCUAL  </P></p>

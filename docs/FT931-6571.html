			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / People: Erskine gets on the mobile Mars was marvellous for Peter Erskine but the call of the portable phone proved compelling and he has just been appointed director of BT's Mobile Communications division. Erskine, 41, describes it as an opportunity to take a leading role in one of the few markets which are booming at the present time. The division, 700-people strong, deals with BT's cellular telephones and radio pagers, serving more than 600,000 customers. A marketeer by training and inclination, Erskine clearly relishes the prospect of competing against Vodafone and a host of new entrants to what is one of the fastest moving high technology markets. 'My job is to make sure we take a leading share of this market,' he says. The portable phone business will be revolutionised over the next few years as personal communicators using digital transmission replace today's mobile telephones. Erskine went to Liverpool University where he read psychology before learning the essentials of sales and marketing with Colgate Palmolive. He then worked for companies in the Mars group, ending up as vice-president for Mars Electronics International. A brief interlude with Unitel, now part of Mercury, kindled his enthusiasm for mobile phones: 'The challenge is using consumer marketing techniques in a area where they have not been used extensively before,' he says.</p>

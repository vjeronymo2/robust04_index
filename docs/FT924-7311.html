			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nippon Housing Loan plunges to Y21bn loss NIPPON Housing Loan, Japan's largest housing loan company which is being restructured due to mounting problem loans, yesterday posted pre-tax losses and a sharp fall in turnover for the first half to September. The company plunged into taxable losses of Y21bn (Dollars 169m) from profits of Y1.1bn a year earlier. Turnover fell by 31.8 per cent to Y73.2bn. At the net level Nippon Housing Loan reported losses of Y29.4bn compared with profits of Y738m. The company said non-performing loans were increasing due to the property slump. Unrealised losses on securities were Y27.7bn, while the outstanding balance of loans at the end of September fell 3.3 per cent to Y2,239.8bn. Nippon Housing Loan is passing its interim dividend compared with Y3 a share last time, and has refrained from making an earnings projection for the full year to March.</p>

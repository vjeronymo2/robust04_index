			<p>BFN     [Text] In tandem with the declaration of the Iranian  pilgrims' day of support for the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  the representative of the supreme leader and the head of the  Iranian pilgrims to the house of God staged a spectacular  ceremony at the mission of the esteemed leadership in holy Mecca  last night.    During the ceremony, which was attended by many Iranian and  non-Iranian pilgrims, Ayatollah Jannati, the supreme leader's  representative on Bosnia-Herzegovina affairs, discussed the  Serbs' numerous crimes and the oppression of the Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Criticizing the silence and indifference by  international forums and by heads of Islamic countries, he said:  The land of revelation and the house of God are the best venues  for defending oppressed Muslim nations, especially the oppressed  people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Why should Hajj officials be  satisfied with praying and prevent practical steps from being  taken in support of the Bosnian Muslims?    Referring to the Islamic Republic's assistance and support  for the oppressed Bosnian Muslims, he said: We have always  stressed that without the least bit of irreverence for the house  of God and by fully observing order, the problems and  difficulties of 1 billion Muslims should be propounded and  solutions found. The issues that the Islamic Republic of Iran  raises are not its own issues; they are the problems of the  world of Islam. He added: Today no issue is being attacked as  much as Islam. Muslim nations are aggressed and placed under  pressure on charges of wanting Islam.    Saudi Government officials have officially disagreed with  the  declaration of the day of support for the oppressed Muslims of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and with the collection of aid for them.  Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Mohammadi-Reyshahri, the  representative of the supreme leader and head of the Iranian  pilgrims to the house of God, stated in reply to a letter from  the Saudi minister of pilgrimage: We are surprised that the  Saudi Government is raising the issue of helping the Muslim  nation in Bosnia and calling on Friday imams to pray for the  nation, yet preventing Iranian pilgrims from trying to help the  Bosnian Muslims and collect aid for them.</p>

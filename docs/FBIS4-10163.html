			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Esteban Huertas G.] </F>   [Text] "The statements by Robert Gelbard, U.S. deputy  assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, are  vague and ambiguous when he says Panama is a drug  money-laundering center," Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino said  yesterday. Mulino said: "Gelbard's statements are not specific  and shed no light on the faults committed by Panamanian  authorities."    The foreign minister said that "the administration's report  does not give names and places where the illegalities occur."  Mulino said: "The case to which the document alluded was the  raid on the Gil Cafe Company, but added there was no sustaining  evidence in the fact." [sentence as published]    For his part, Supreme Court Magistrate Jose Manuel Faundes  cited "the strange U.S. attitude of discrediting Panama's image  before the concert of nations." Faundes stressed the national  authorities' cooperation against drug trafficking, a situation  that can be brought up in the face of any accusation on the part  of the United States." [no opening quotation mark as published]  The magistrate said: "Panamanian international financial centers  have controlled money laundering, something to which U.S. banks  can attest."    A U.S. delegation is visiting the country and being escorted  by Olegario Barrelier, president of the National Banking  Association (ABN). This visit will last until 11 April,  according to Barrelier's agenda.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Treasury ahead of deficit schedule THE GOVERNMENT is well ahead of its schedule for financing this year's budget deficit, a Treasury report stated yesterday. The monthly monetary report said the public sector borrowing requirement was overfunded by Pounds 9.6bn by the end of January. The overfunding was almost entirely explained by intervention to support the pound before it left the European exchange rate mechanism in September. However it is too early to judge how overfunded the authorities will be at the start of the next financial year in April. The government is expected to have to finance a PSBR of about Pounds 50bn in 1993-94. The report also pointed out that the surprise public-sector budget surplus in January was due partly to higher VAT receipts, which have been temporarily distorted by the reintroduction of postponed accounting for VAT. The Treasury also underlined prospects for an economic recovery this year, pointing out that UK retail sales remain on an upward trend and that output expectations have improved. The report says: 'Retail sales rose strongly in January, more than recovering December's unexpected fall.' It adds that 'UK demand and activity in late 1992 appear to have been, if anything, a little stronger than the Autumn Statement forecast assumed'. Although the report reiterates the government's optimistic view on inflation  -pointing to the sharp fall in retail price inflation in January, and a recent fall in pay settlements - it acknowledges the first signs that sterling's devaluation is feeding through to prices. The Treasury notes that output prices in the latest three months increased at a slightly faster rate than in the three months ending in December.</p>

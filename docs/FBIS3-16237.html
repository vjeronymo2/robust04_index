On Friday [11 March], at the end  of a shuttle trip between PLO headquarters and Israel, Moscow's  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev "announced" the imminent  resumption of the negotiations broken off after the Hebron  massacre. In fact, Yasir `Arafat was rather reserved, and all  attention is now shifting to UN headquarters, where the Security  Council is due to vote Monday on a resolution on the massacre,  the text of which is now almost completely ready.    In his joint press conference with the PLO leader Friday  evening, Kozyrev treated this as a fait accompli, talking in  terms of Yasir `Arafat's "great courage." The latter confined  himself to reaffirming the "political" commitment to resume  negotiations, which has in any case never been denied.  Yesterday Palestinian sources specified that it is necessary to  await the Security Council vote before negotiations can resume  and that Russia and the United States, as "co-sponsors" of the  peace conference must provide "practical" guarantees of the  Palestinians' security. This is precisely what Israel does not  want. In any case Washington clearly told `Arafat a few days  ago that it would prevent the approval of the UN resolution  unless the PLO pledges to resume the dialogue with Israel.  Yesterday the U.S. Government received Kozyrev's "announcement"  with great circumspection.    Be that as it may, Moscow's foreign minister seemed  determined to exploit the Middle Eastern arena, too, in order to  bring Russian foreign policy to international attention again,  and `Arafat for the present seems willing to provide him with  the opportunity to do so. This obviously pleased Kozyrev, who  was in Genoa yesterday on an unscheduled stopover necessitated  by fog over Rome airport: "It is the critical nature of the  present situation that demands that all forces mobilize for  peace," he told journalists, recalling that he had spoken two  days ago with the U.S. State Department's second-in-command,  Strobe Talbott: "We are agreed in our impression: Either we  succeed in salvaging the peace process in the Middle East right  away, or we are bound to lapse back into conflict. Our efforts  are shared by the United States. When the house is in flames,  everyone must help to quench the blaze."    [LA REPUBBLICA] But some people have the impression that the  United States really is not pleased with this latest Russian  diplomatic initiative.    [Kozyrev] We spoke the evening before my departure, and I  explained my intentions. I was assured that there are no  objections to the plan. In any case, we are in constant  contact. After the Hebron tragedy, the main problem is for  everyone to do their utmost to safeguard peace. This task  involves Russia and the United States, but also the Security  Council, within which we have gone to very great pains to  establish a text acceptable to both Israel and the PLO.  [Kozyrev ends]    After a brief stroll through the city accompanied by Russian  Consul Valeriy Karassev (he wanted to visit Columbus' house), he  had a conversation with journalists at the airport in which he  gave an account of his meetings in Tunis and Jerusalem: "Rabin  and Peres in Israel and `Arafat in Tunis agreed on restarting  the peace process and negotiations. It was more difficult for  `Arafat, of course, who is demanding guarantees for the  Palestinian population in the occupied territories. Partly for  this reason, I believe that the resumption of the dialogue is a  wise move on his part, and also a very courageous one."    [LA REPUBBLICA] Is this a success for Russia?    [Kozyrev] Let us call it a joint achievement by Russia and  the United States. At my meeting Monday with U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher in Vladivostok, we will talk about how  our two countries can make themselves useful at this stage. We  are willing to provide all the technical assistance necessary to  organize the negotiations.    [LA REPUBBLICA] But when can the negotiations resume?    [Kozyrev] It is up to the Palestinians and Israelis to  decide  where, when, and how to meet. We will accept whatever decision  they may make. It does not matter whether they meet in  Washington or in Cairo: The only thing that counts is that an  opening be created. And that the two sides agree on the need to  settle the issue of Gaza and Jericho right away. And to proceed  from there to extend their agreement. [Kozyrev ends]    The only uncertainty hanging over the peace process, Kozyrev  said, is precisely the Security Council resolution on the Hebron  massacre; its section covering measures to protect the  Palestinians living in the territories occupied by Israel, which  the PLO regards as a precondition. "But it is not only the PLO  now," the Russian foreign minister said. "Israel, too, has  clearly stated that the opening is conditional on the adoption  of the UN resolution."    However, the text of the resolution, presented yesterday  evening by Russia, Spain, France, and Britain, is very vague  about how security should be guaranteed. It calls for  unspecified "measures" to ensure the protection of Palestinian  civilians throughout the occupied territories, including "a  temporary international or foreign presence." This is exactly  what the Palestinians are demanding and the Israelis refusing.  The wording of the UN resolution is vague, however, and cites  the "Declaration of Principles" signed by `Arafat and Rabin in  Washington on 13 September, which refers only to Gaza and  Jericho and which in any case requires agreement between the two  sides. The United States has objections on this point and on  the section of the introduction that explicitly cites Jerusalem  as being among the territories occupied by Israel. According to  the Israeli Government, however, the city is the country's sole  and indivisible capital, and there must be no discussion of its  future for the present.</p>

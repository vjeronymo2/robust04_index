			<p>BFN     [Text] According to military sources, on 15 and 16 May the  U.S. imperialists deployed for mobile operations long-range  aircraft squadrons in South Korea, waging a provocative aerial  war exercise aimed at a northward invasion.    On 15 May, deployed for mobile operations in the bases of  the  U.S. Air Force in South Korea were squadrons of nuclear-loaded  F-16 and F-15 fighters-bombers, EA-20 observation aircraft flown  in from U.S. Pacific bases.    On 16 May, in accordance with the operational plans of the  U.S. Pacific Air Force Command, these military aircraft ran wild  in staging an aerial war exercise--centered on the skies over  Chungju, Yongwol, and (?Kunwi)--aimed at launching a surprise  strike against the facilities of the strategic in-depth areas of  the northern part of the Republic.    This war exercise was aimed at conducting a swift deployment  of the overseas-based aircraft into the Korean Peninsula for  mobile operations and at increasing the capabilities for an  actual warfare between the U.S. Air Force in South Korea and the  puppet air force for launching a joint strike for a northward  invasion.    In the meanwhile, flown into the U.S. Air Force bases in  South Korea on 15 May were a succession of squadrons of C-141  and C-130 transport planes, including super-large C-5 transport  aircraft, carrying numerous troops and lethal equipment from  U.S. Pacific bases.    All facts show that the U.S. imperialists' maneuvers of  preparing a war of aggression are reaching a grave stage.</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Salomon Inc.: The New York-based firm said it lost $28 million in the first  quarter, with profits in the company's energy division partially compensating  for $150 million in losses by the company's securities and commodities arms.  The loss was the latest in a series of gloomy reports by Wall Street firms  attributed to a sluggish securities business. Salomon, the parent of Salomon  Bros., said the loss compared to a year earlier profit of $173 million. Revenue  declined 4.3% to $1.54 billion. The firm said a $72-million pretax loss was  reduced by a $44-million income tax benefit.  </P></p>

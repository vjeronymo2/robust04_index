			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL REJECTS CHARTER CHANGES  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council has voted unanimously against changing the City  Charter, despite assertions by the Torrance League of Women Voters that reform  is needed.  </P> <P> As an alternative, council members said, the city attorney's office could  review the charter to assure that it is up to date and does not contain  outmoded sections.  </P> <P> The league proposed in June that the city conduct a thorough review of the  charter. It recommended limiting council members to two four-year terms and  said the current method of paying council members is misleading.  </P> <P> But none of the City Council's seven members has expressed much interest in the  league's proposals. A council committee voted 3-0 in late August against  recommending a charter review, and the full council concurred Tuesday.  </P> <P> League President Lynitta Schaffer said in an interview after the vote that the  league will probably contact local groups, such as homeowners' associations, to  discuss charter reform and gauge their interest in the issue.  </P></p>

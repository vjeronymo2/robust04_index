			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of 3 May Telegram from His Excellency Khieu Samphan, </F> chairman of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea, to King Norodom  Sihanouk; place not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] I would like to express my deepest thanks to Your  Majesty for sending me the message dated 3 May 1994 whose  significance is as follows:    1. Calling for an immediate and unconditional general  cease-fire in which each side must implement an end to  activities;    2. Calling on the two sides to immediately send two generals  -- two from each side -- to set up a cease-fire observation  committee under the chairmanship of Your Majesty; and    3. A roundtable meeting will take place in the Royal Palace  or in the (?Chhang Sun-on) royal residence when the cease-fire  has been truly and permanently implemented across Cambodia.    I would like to be permitted to inform Your Majesty of the  following:    I. I am delighted to abide by Your Majesty's formal and  solemn proposal for a concrete and permanent cease-fire  throughout the country because a cease-fire constitutes an  initial step toward national reconciliation, peace, and genuine  independence, which represent the desire of Democratic Kampuchea  as well as the aspiration of the Cambodian nation and every  Cambodian citizen since long ago.    II. I would like to inform Your Majesty that the cease-fire  should be truly, concretely, and permanently implemented because  it is the vital need of the entire Cambodian nation and people  who have suffered for more than 15 years due to the Vietnamese  war of aggression which continues to this day.    III. I would like to inform Your Majesty about the  cease-fire issue. It is an old problem that has been discussed  for years. It was raised before the existence of the Paris  accord and during the Paris conference in 1989. At subsequent  meetings in other places this matter was also raised.  Nevertheless, it has never been implemented concretely. This  has led the general public to believe that it is a maneuver or a  trick repeatedly employed by the aggressors to serve their  strategic purpose. For example:    A. In December 1978, Pham Van Dong [former Vietnamese prime  minister] declared to the ASEAN countries that the SRV did not  need to invade Cambodia. The statement was an answer to  questions by [word indistinct] ASEAN spokesmen who were anxious  about Vietnam's preparations to invade Cambodia. Immediately  afterwards, when Pham Van Dong had not yet even taken a plane to  return to Hanoi, several hundred thousand Vietnamese troops had  already invaded Cambodia in an aggressively arrogant and  insolent manner.    B. The 23 October 1991 Paris accord is a tremendous and  vitally important document that took the world and United  Nations several months or years to map out. The document has a  balanced essence that could bring about a cease-fire, national  reconciliation, and peace in Cambodia. Nonetheless, it has been  shredded and trampled upon at will. That being the case, peace  can never be restored in accordance with the accord's essence  and spirit, and the flames of war have continued.    C. After the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]  organized elections and the formation of a government with two  prime ministers, they began to inflame an undeclared war.  Apparently, they immediately attacked Democratic Kampuchea at  Phnum Chhat [in Banteay Meanchey Province] and Stoung [in  Kompong Thom Province] in August (?1993). Between September and  November 1993, they continued to attack the people and  Democratic Kampuchea at Anlung Veng without caring in the least  about peace and national reconciliation, which are profoundly  desired by our nation and people, and without considering the  spirit and essence of the Paris accord. In January and February  1994, they continued to thunderously attack the people and  Democratic Kampuchea at Anlung Veng. In March and April 1994,  they continued to attack Pailin and openly declared war with  Democratic Kampuchea. The two prime ministers of the two-headed  government and their ministers, deputy ministers, and commanders  all declared war against Democratic Kampuchea. They said they  would at all costs destroy Democratic Kampuchea in northern and  western Cambodia. They do not want national reconciliation and  they have repeatedly raised their three conditions to destroy  Democratic Kampuchea.    IV. Presently, the situation concerning national and  social issues and the war situation in Cambodia continually  being waged by the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and an  alliance and its cronies are further deteriorated. The problem  of implanting millions of old and new Vietnamese in Cambodia in  accordance with the strategic goal of swallowing and turning  Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kroam has become increasingly  serious. In fact, Vietnam has already swallowed half of  Cambodia. As such, it does not need to spit out Cambodia or  solve problems to achieve national reconciliation, unity, and  peace in the country. Many social problems have seriously  worsened and the economy and finance have become paralyzed. The  subsistence of the two-headed government is supported only by  communist Vietnamese muscle and force and the alliance's meager  financial aid. Therefore, a cease-fire or a non- cease-fire  depends on this situation. It is the communist Vietnamese and  the alliance who are the masters, not the Cambodians. They do  not need a cease-fire; do not need national reconciliation,  national unity, and peace; and do not need to allow Cambodia to  exist as an independent and neutral country within its  territorial integrity.    Because of these reasons, the cease-fire initiated by the  two-headed government is not sincere. It is only a poisonous  trick which they have raised on many occasions previously.    V. Regarding the issue of sending two generals to  participate on the committee for overseeing a concrete, true,  and permanent cease-fire under His Majesty's august  chairmanship, I clearly understand that this problem is an  important matter that needs to be pondered and that military  personnel from both sides need to be present to achieve good  results and a definite cease-fire, thereby restoring peace to  Cambodia.    I believe that discussions and negotiations concerning the  cease-fire, which is an important issue, should take place in a  safe area. Phnom Penh is in the hands of the communist  Vietnamese, the alliance, the communist Vietnamese puppets, and  the two-headed government, all of whom have a policy and  concrete actions, about which I have already informed Your  Majesty above, to permanently destroy Democratic Kampuchea.    Evidently, on 27 November 1991, when I and H.E. Son Sen  returned to Phnom Penh to participate in the implementation of  the Paris accord, since all of us have the goodwill to implement  the accord correctly, the communist Vietnamese and the alliance  organized communist Vietnamese commandos and the cat's-paws of  the Vietnamese puppet State of Cambodia to attack us. They went  so far as to strike me in the head until it bled.    In sum, I understand that His Majesty, with such important  work in dealing with the destiny of our Cambodian nation and  motherland, wants negotiations on the cease-fire to be held in a  safe place inside or outside the country.    VI. I, like our entire nation and people, wish to express to  Your Majesty my total and constant hope that one day a  roundtable meeting for peace and national reconciliation will  certainly take place at a neutral site inside or outside the  country.    The information that I have presented to Your Majesty above  ensues from Democratic Kampuchea's firm and constant stance of  shouldering the responsibility for the issue of life and death  of the Cambodian nation and race.</p>

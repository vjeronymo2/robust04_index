			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eduardo Damaso and Fernando Semedo: "Drug </F> Landings With Police Protection"]    [Text] Portugal has played the role assigned to it by the  international drug traffic: that of a gateway to Europe. A  maritime route, the Portuguese coast has been used  systematically, for cocaine and hashish trafficking in  particular. However, this is not a passive participation. The  major drug trafficking networks, controlled mainly by Galicians,  but also by Italians and Netherlanders, have their accomplices  here. Only in this way can their activities succeed. The  trafficking routes still remain effective, and nothing is left  to spontaneity or improvisation: The traffickers have human  accomplices and warehouses; they know roads that bypass  potential checkpoints; and they have contracts signed for boats  providing transportation. For months, PUBLICO attempted to  reconstruct many of those routes, and to assess the Portuguese  component in this business. The results are surprising. At  least, it can never again be claimed that Portugal has been  relegated to a passive role in the international drug traffic.    J. works for everyone, provided that they come suitably  "recommended." From Sito Minanco and Laureano Oubina to Andelo  Casas, who, two months ago, escaped from the Braga penitentiary  (he sawed the bars), any Galician drug dealer known on the  market can use the "passageway" in the central Portuguese city  where J. is established. With good contacts in the ex-Customs  Guard [GF] and the Maritime Police, J. prepares for the landings  after clearing an area adjoining some naval shipyards. The  "uniformed ones" close their eyes on the sand bar, at their  posts, and on the surveillance motor boat, also guaranteeing  "protection" for the landing. Even the guard at the shipyards  himself closes his eyes, when he is paid a lump sum of 20 contos.    However, J. not only guarantees the landing, but also  provides warehouses for storing hashish and tobacco (cocaine is  less common, but not excluded from the business). Furthermore,  he ensures transportation to Spain on light trucks with  refrigerated bodies.    J.'s system is to some extent repeated along the entire  Portuguese coast. Minho is everyone's territory: a kind of free  trade zone for the groups that have increased since the  annihilation of some of the oldest Galician "families" in  Operation Necora.    In the district of Viana do Castelo, all the groups in the  territory have good contacts. The Viana do Castelo mountain  ridge, an area controlled by a sergeant from the defunct Customs  Guard, is a site used as an alternative to other landing points,  especially Belinhos, in Esposende, when the sea is choppy.    In Belinhos, where the GF post was deactivated, the landings  occur often, because it is considered one of the safest sites on  the Portuguese coast. Here, too, protection is guaranteed by  members of the paramilitary forces, who bar the access roads,  order the movement of vehicles parked in the area (lovers, those  spying on them, etc.), and monitor the landing operation from a  distance.    The boxes (of hashish, cocaine, and tobacco) are unloaded,  and then continue their journey on light trucks along municipal  road 1794, or on other alternative dirt roads adjoining the  area's small farming establishments. All of this is well  disguised, and follows strict timetables.    The "product" is delivered to the purchaser in Spain, with  its safe passage guaranteed at the border in Valenca, Moncao, or  some other border locality where the contacts are more than  plentiful.  <H5>  On the Customs Guard Motor Boats </H5>   One of the most sophisticated systems has been adopted on a  beach north of Mondego. Next to a shipyard, they unload hashish,  cocaine, and tobacco that the paramilitary forces' motor boats  will search for on the so-called "mother ship," at anchor two  miles from the sand bar. There could be no better protection.  The system is totally controlled by members of the paramilitary  forces stationed in the area.    PUBLICO is in a position to claim that these incidents  described are not isolated. The groups guaranteeing the  reception of drugs and tobacco and their transportation to Spain  are organized along the Portuguese coast, which is divided into  areas of influence.    Nearly all their members are former maritime smuggling  bosses  who have started working for the Spanish purchasers of large  volumes of hashish and cocaine in Morocco and South America.  They have vessels at their disposal, cheap labor, warehouses for  storing the drugs, light trucks for carrying them to Spain, and  protection given by members of the paramilitary forces: all just  as it was in the "old" contraband.    One of the differences from the past lies in the  sophistication of the methods. And it is not merely that of  speedboats, which were all the rage in the late 1980's, but are  less often used now.    On a site located north of Douro, one of the most active  groups in the landing business has a radar system, installed in  a residence, which covers a distance of 25 miles. Of course, it  is accompanied by very powerful communications equipment that  facilitates the monitoring of the operations on board, also  affording great accuracy in logging the date, time, and  conditions of the landing. Once they are on land, the drugs are  transported to Spain, using a dozen alternate routes.  <H5>  From Minho to Algarve </H5>   There are routes and systems leading down from Minho to the  Alentejo and Algarve coast which, during recent months, have  been given preference by Spanish and Portuguese drug traffickers  because they have seas and shores with little surveillance. The  presence of the Italian "Mafioso," Emilio di Giovinni, in  Algarve, as well as in southern Spain, between 1991 and 1992,  prompted an increase in the landings in this area.    An importer of hashish and owner of a production farm in  Morocco, with entry into Italy ensured by contacts that he had  in Calabria, Giovinni activated the southern part of the  peninsula, which began acquiring a kind of "new market" in this  Italian. Up until that time, the Spaniards, some of whom had  good partners in Portugal, with names that remain a mystery,  were almost the only large purchasers operating.    The Alentejo coast (over 50 km of beaches and small coves  with few or no visitors and without surveillance) has been in  great demand by traffickers during recent years. This is,  moreover, quite obvious in cases reported among the population  of small fishing communities.    In Rogil, a village south of Odeceixe, a fisherman who  recently committed suicide following an emotional episode had  several tens of thousands of contos in a bank. This was an  abnormal situation, considering the income that his occupational  activity earned him, and the lack of any inheritance. The  explanation was discovered by the police: he had been retrieving  packages of hashish and cocaine left at marked fishing floats,  and later delivering them to a contact in Faro.    Early this year, also near Odeceixe, in Azenhas do Mar, a  fisherman was arrested with 700 grams of hashish in his house.  The amount of drugs in C.'s possession was not large, but the  volume of information held by the police on his landing  activities was considerable.    C. was one of the main contacts for recruiting unloaders or  enlisting boats to receive the product on the high seas, in the  Odemira area. However, there were also indications of his  involvement in drug distribution following the temporary  "storage" of large amounts of hashish and other smaller  quantities of cocaine, which he was selling directly. A few  weeks before his arrest, he had offered 20,000 contos in "cold"  cash to a friend, to give up "that life." Now he is to be tried,  and will hardly escape a stiff sentence.    In the fishing communities of Vila do Bispo, Odeceixe,  Azenhas do Mar, Milfontes, Porto Covo, and Sines, it is now  difficult to evade this reality: the landings yield far more  than fishing does. A local merchant confided: "The gang comes  here on some winter nights, wearing rubber boots and all bundled  up; and I know they aren't going fishing."    People hereabouts have always made their living from  smuggling tobacco, "until one day, the boxes began to be  heavier." This comment was made by a fisherman, indicating the  shift from tobacco to drugs. Everyone is aware of this, but no  one is willing to discuss the subject. There are stories without  names or faces.    At one particular juncture, the activity was so appealing,  enjoying impunity, that some recall "certain incidents"  involving persons known to them who suffered "accidents" for  trying to enter the business on their own, in defiance of the  groups established in the territory for a long time. They cite  an episode that occurred over five years ago, involving a  "buddy" who showed up in a deserted area with his legs broken  and his face "turned into pulp." He reportedly tried to "go it  alone with the landings."    On the Alentejo coast, as in Minho or Algarve, certain small  fortunes appear and disappear as if miraculously. In some  localities fortunes, always owned by the same persons, are known  to have been converted into real estate and land, and lost  through the vice of card-playing. A few months later, the rumor  of certain businessmen going bankrupt is dispelled, because they  begin showing new outward signs of wealth.  <H5>  Alentejo Summit </H5>   On the night of 18 August 1992, the heat was stifling, both  at the Luz Stadium, where the Benfica team was facing Real  Madrid in a game preparing for the new season, and at the Monte  Mouro nightclub near Odeceixe.    At the stadium, Portuguese and Spanish policemen were  embroiled in old Iberian soccer rivalries, after a lengthy work  session to prepare for the seizure of 3 tons of hashish.    At the nightclub, a "summit" meeting was being held by  traffickers attempting to reach an understanding on this  business of the 3 tons of hashish, owing to problems that arose  with the contacts for Spain, after the landing. They had to  determine who was the middleman for that country, and the  purchaser (there were several interested parties, with different  middlemen).    The drugs ended up not reaching Spain, and were intercepted  at Vila Verde, following a police operation in which one of the  traffickers was killed.    But this "summit" involved another fundamental issue: the  reorganization of the maneuvering space for the traffickers "on  the periphery" of the major groups operating in the area, to  prevent wars between them. The south, because it had little  surveillance, would gain ground in comparison with the Minho  coast, where both the Portuguese and Spaniards had reinforced  their surveillance.    PUBLICO has learned that the penetration of Portugal's air  space and sea by Spanish police surveillance aircraft and ships,  because they consider the national patrolling inadequate, is a  fact known to the Portuguese police authorities. The "aviocars"  and vessels regularly heading down to the vicinity of the  Mondego Basin or entering by way of the Algarve coast belong to  the Customs Surveillance Services.    Some results emerged from the "summit" in terms of  reorganizing the contacts through middlemen between the landing  groups and the Spanish purchasers. An investigator specializing  in information gathering told PUBLICO: "It was essential for  them (the traffickers) to find out who was talking to whom,  because there was much confusion there, and suspicions between  them."  <H5>  The Minho Clan </H5>   The territory in Minho has belonged to the Viriatos clan.  Jose Manuel Alonso dos Santos and Antonio Alonso dos Santos are  two brothers to whom the police have attributed the status of  the most powerful group in the north moving illicit merchandise.  It ranges from tobacco to drugs, received in Portuguese waters  and destined for Spain.    Jose Alonso has a permanent residence in La Guardia, and his  brother, Antonio, in Caminha: houses almost in view of one  another, although located in different countries. Separating  them is only the Minho River, an old smugglers' route, every  bend in which is familiar to the Viriatos brothers.    In 1991, however, life did not go well for them. During that  year, they agreed to work with the Spaniards, Francisco Javier  Oubina Pinero, Ramon Buballo Martinez, and Jose Constante Pinero  Bua, all from Cambados, in the Pontevedra district. They  proposed to import hashish from Morocco. The Viriatos were to  ensure the transport by sea and the reception, jointly with the  Spaniard, Jose Casas Andelo.    For this purpose they had a trawler, registered in Nazare,  and owned by Jose Manuel Alonso. Since it had already become  well known to the authorities for having made other landings,  particularly of tobacco, its former name of Fe was changed to  Joi.    The business (the continued hashish dealing activity) fared  badly, because the boat was apparently jinxed. It was damaged on  several occasions, and ended up being seized with 2,200 kg of  hashish on the high seas at Vila Real de Santo Antonio. The  Alonso brothers were arrested and sentenced to 10 years in  prison.    After their capture, other groups emerged in Valenca,  Moncao,  Cerveira, and Caminha, ensuring the transportation and  "protection" of the merchandise on its passage to Spain. They  have good contacts in the Customs Guard and the Civil Guard in  Tuy, Porrino, Pontevedra, Valenca, and Moncao.    Most of these groups have been engaged in contraband for  decades, and are familiar with all the historical figures linked  with this criminal activity in Galicia. Virtually all of them  find a way of camouflaging their real activities with businesses  connected to the hotel sector or night life. They have coffee  shops, bars, and restaurants useful to them for making contacts;  but also strong logistical support structures, such as light  trucks, cars with good cylinder capacity, houses, and storage  places, on both sides of the border.    Inside the grounds of one of their houses, PUBLICO saw, on  one evening, five luxury vehicles, as well as two jeeps and a  light truck with an open chassis, also a four-wheel drive type.  We were later able to confirm that all of them belonged to the  same family.  <H5>  The Kingdom of Peniche </H5>   In central Portugal there are several options for landings  which, as a rule, are controlled by a powerful group in Peniche.  It has a long-standing complicity (dating from the tobacco  times) among agents assigned to the local Customs Guard post.    According to the DEA (an agency specializing in combating  the  drug traffic) report sent to the Spanish police in 1989, Peniche  had, for many years, been a strategic locality for the Galician  drug trafficker, Laureano Oubina, and for his presumable  Portuguese "partner," mentioned in the document, Eduardo Maria  dos Santos.    Owner of Edumar--Shipping Agents, a company that ceased its  activity in 1991, Eduardo Maria dos Santos is a businessman in  the fishing sector, with headquarters in Peniche and Lisbon.    The U.S. police, and later the Portuguese, identified  Eduardo  Maria dos Santos as a representative of Laureano Oubina, and  Edumar as a kind of support facility for repairs to speedboats  belonging to the Galician trafficker. The vessels were detected  in cocaine landings made on the northern coast.  <H5>  South Divided </H5>   Southern Portugal is a good example of the country's  division  by the Portuguese trafficking groups, and of how they have  developed their business with the powerful clans of Galicia and  even in Latin America. The coast extending from Vila Real de  Santo Antonio to Setubal is controlled by three stronger groups,  with headquarters in Setubal and Vila do Bispo. They have close  contacts with other peripheral organizations in Portimao, Faro,  and Sines.    The activity of their principal members has long been  documented by national and foreign police, given the major  dimensions of the contacts that they maintain. The latter exist,  specifically, with the Galician group headed by Laureano Oubina  (now under arrest in Spain), and with some South American  cocaine producers.    Fishing boats have been operating in the service of the  three  groups, with emphasis on a trawler that has had its name changed  several times. A few years ago, it was registered in Cascais in  the name of Jose Manuel Viegas.    During 1992 alone, the vessel, with the name Estrela do Mar,  was mentioned in three hashish landings, until its seizure in  northern Portugal with a shipment totaling several tons.    Some of the preeminent figures in the south were mentioned  in  prior investigations by the Portuguese and Spanish police, as  well as the DEA .    In 1989, the Americans sent a report to the Spanish police  identifying Vital Nunes de Carvalho, a former local government  official in Vila do Bispo, elected by the PCP [Portuguese  Communist Party], as one of Oubina's contacts in Portugal.    At the time, Nunes de Carvalho denied any involvement with  Spanish drug traffickers or with the former owner of the Estrela  do Mar, Jose Manuel Viegas, nicknamed "Grego." The latter was  also a defendant in the contraband proceedings relating to what  is known as the Setubal Connection.    The main defendant in those proceedings was Jose Ribeiro,  identified as one of the historical figures in contraband, on a  par with the "Serafins" clan, currently being tried in Aveiro  for involvement in the network running the tobacco and whiskey  trade there.    Viegas maintains economic interests in Algarve, where he  owns  several hotel enterprises, including the hotel at Salema beach  (he even has a partnership with the Sporting establishment  president, Sousa Cintra, according to Spanish police documents).  He was also owner of the vessel, Micheline, seized by the  Maritime Police in 1979 during an unloading of contraband.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UMPIRE TALKS, EXPANSION FEES ARE '91 ISSUES: VINCENT  </P> <P> Commissioner Fay Vincent today listed negotiations with the umpires and  expansion fees allocation as baseball's toughest problems heading into 1991.  </P> <P> Vincent was unable to attend the winter meetings because of a respiratory  illness, but a text of his speech was made available.  </P> <P> The contract with the umpires expired after the season and talks will start  soon.  </P> <P> "These negotiations are right around the corner and the potential for another  dispute is very real," Vincent said. "I have been working with our league  presidents -- Bill White and Dr. Bobby Brown -- who will be conducting these  negotiations, and will continue to follow this process in our effort to reach  an equitable and sound agreement for the leagues as well as the umpires."  </P> <P> Vincent said there could be a problem in dealing with the allocation of  expansion fees. The National League is scheduled to expand by two teams in  1993.  </P> <P> "Traditionally, expansion fees have been paid directly to the expanding league,  and then divided equally among the teams of that league. Also, in the past  expansion endeavors, only those teams in the expanding league shared the burden  of supplying players for the expansion draft.  </P> <P> "In the current expansion process, the American League has requested that it  receive a share of the expansion fund and, in return will make its players  available in the expansion draft."  </P> <P> Vincent said he has asked that each league form a committee to discuss the  proposal.  </P></p>

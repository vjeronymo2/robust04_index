This program authorizes SBA to use its guaranty authority to provide the Agency's full faith and credit support to loans made by approved lenders that finance the short term, cyclical working capital needs of small businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The establishment of GreenLine is in response to information obtained over a two year period demonstrating the need for a nationwide revolving line of credit loan guaranty program. Many lenders acknowledged that this type of financing was generally available in the commercial marketplace to only larger businesses with a need for larger lines of credit. Small businesses would require the guaranty from SBA in order for lenders to provide them with the same opportunity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GreenLine shall serve as the umbrella for all the Agency's short term lending programs with the exception of the Export Revolving Line of Credit (ERLC) and the Export Co-Guaranty programs. Under GreenLine, authority to provide a revolving feature to the Agency's traditional Contract, Seasonal, and Contractors loan programs is added. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> July 22, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Michael J. Dowd, Chief Loan Policy &amp; Procedures Branch, (202) 205&hyph;6490. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The predecessor for this program was tested on a pilot basis in selected local markets beginning on October 1, 1992 when SBA began piloting two revolving line of credit loan programs. Both Programs were designed to assist small business in obtaining cyclical working capital financing through the authority of SBA's 7(a) guaranty loan program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first pilot, called the Green Line Revolving Line of Credit Program (GRLC), was implemented in the Agency's South East and South Central Regions, while the second, called the Domestic Revolving Line of Credit Program (DRLC) was tested in all SBA Regions not served by the Green Line pilot. The predominant distinction between the programs dealt with the maximum maturity permitted on the loans: GRLC loans had a maturity of up to five years, while the DRLC loans had a maturity of only one year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Case files were collected from field offices active in the two pilot programs which were reviewed in order to determine the creditworthiness of the businesses seeking this financing, as well as to identify various terms and conditions which would be prudent for inclusion in the new loan program's approval documents. The reviews and program formation meetings also revealed that the new program would need servicing guidelines designed to provide maximum assurances that the line would revolve and the losses minimized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since October 1, 1992, 531 loans have been approved under the GRLC pilot for a total of $130.0 million, while for the same period, 327 loans have been approved under the DRLC pilot for a total of $71.0 million. It is important to note that this volume of GRLC activity was generated in only two regions, while the DRLC volume was generated in eight. This activity indicated that a much keener interest exists for the extended terms available under Pilot GRLC than under the Pilot DRLC Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this program, advances will generally be made against a borrower's certified level of inventory and accounts receivable, while repayment will be derived from the sale of that inventory and the collection of any resulting accounts receivable. Participating lenders will be expected to monitor the disbursements of funds from the line and control the payment of funds back to the line. Primary collateral will consist of a senior lien position on the assets being financed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SBA will consider all applications submitted by approved GreenLine lenders which seek up to a 75% SBA guaranty of the GreenLine financing, not to exceed $750,000. Lender's desiring to participate need to complete a Lender's Qualification Survey which can be obtained from their local SBA District Office. The processing of GreenLine applications can only be done by SBA personnel from offices which have completed SBA sponsored training, and received approval from SBA's Office of Financial Assistance (OFA). Training material has been developed and the training schedule set. Once the staff in a field office completes the required training, and is designated by OFA, it will be eligible to process GreenLine applications received from approved participating lenders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All field offices which have processed either GRLC or DRLC loans under the respective regional pilots will continue to be able to accept and process these loans under their existing pilot guidelines until training has been offered to their office by the SBA Associate Administrator for Financial Assistance (AA/FA), but in no event later than August 30, 1994. After this date, offices will only be able to accept GreenLine applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Fees Permitted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In recognition of the additional servicing and monitoring required to adequately protect the interest of the lender and SBA, the Agency is temporarily waiving its limitations on service related fees in order to permit the lender to offset the costs associated with increased servicing required to prudently monitor the lines, and to provide a program that relates to the lending practices of the private sector. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of SBA's Regulations presently in effect relative to 7(a) guaranteed business loans (see 13 CFR, paragraphs 120 and 122) will also govern the implementation of GreenLine, provided, however, that the limitation on processing and servicing fees as found in &sect;&sect;120.104&hyph;2(a)(3) and 120.104&hyph;2(e) of SBA regulations (13 CFR 120.104&hyph;2(a)(3) and 120.104&hyph;2(e)) will be waived for a maximum two year pilot period. Notice of this pilot is issued pursuant to &sect;120.1&hyph;2 of SBA regulations (13 CFR 120.1&hyph;2). In addition, SBA will ascertain whether this type of loan can be sold on the secondary market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SBA will require that participating lenders fully disclose to both the borrower and SBA the fees they intend to charge the borrower, and that the borrower acknowledge these fees in writing to the lender and SBA prior to the time the guaranty of the loan is authorized by SBA, and every six months thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SBA is waiving the fee restriction for GreenLine for up to two years provided the Lender charges their SBA supported borrowers the same fees and charges for services they would normally charge their non-SBA borrowers with similar types of revolving lines of credit for similar services. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

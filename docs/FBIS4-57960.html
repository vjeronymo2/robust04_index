			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edwin Gongora from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] head Enrique  Ter-Horst confirmed that his group will verify the training of  National Civilian Police [PNC] members in the face of alleged  departures from the original initiative. Salvador Sanchez  Ceren, FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] leader,  said the creation of the joint commission tasked with  investigating the alleged irregularities within the PNC, is part  of the latest rescheduling of the peace agreement.    The last report by the UN secretary general to the Security  Council, in which he underscores irregularities in PNC training,  has already been acted upon by those involved. On Monday,  Ter-Horst said the group is already doing verification work to  report, by 30 June, whether the new security corps has  militarized.    [Begin Ted-Horst recording] I believe that right now it is  not practical or constructive to describe whether the PNC is  militarized. The government has a clear resolve to correct any  error or irregularities detected in June. [end recording]    Ted-Horst said that like any new institution, the PNC has  its  problems, however, these are being quickly faced and resolved.    Salvador Sanchez Ceren, FMLN representative to the National  Commission for the Consolidation of Peace, expressed confidence  in the commission tasked to evaluate how civilian the PNC is.    [Begin Sanchez recording] All the irregularities the UN  secretary general lists will be investigated. We have also  verified this on site and have been able to confirm that the  academy is militarized, starting with the monitor corps, and  that there is an imbalance in the chain of command. The academy  is made up of a majority of national policemen, and this creates  an imbalance. [end recording]    The new scheduling between the government and the FMLN  mentions, among other dates, 15 March 1995 for completing the  National Police demobilization and the full deployment of the  PNC, with an average of 8,000-10,000 policemen. The land  transfer process is scheduled to be 70 percent complete by 30  April 1995. With this new schedule, the head of Onusal said  President Cristiani has cleared all pending peace matters.  Nevertheless, for Sanchez Ceren, Cristiani leaves instead a  more specific schedule, which the new Calderon Sol  administration shall be unable to elude.</p>

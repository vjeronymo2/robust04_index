			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Pressure mounts on smaller delegations SUPPORTERS of Mr John Smith's reform proposals were yesterday involved in a frantic last-minute scramble to persuade union delegations and constituency party delegates to switch their votes behind the Labour leader, David Goodhart writes. Mr Neil Kinnock, the former leader, addressed the seven delegates of the Northampton-based knitwear workers' union NKFAT who were said to be impressed by his visit but still undecided. The left-led engineering section of the National Communications Union was also visited by Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, general secretary of the Nupe public services union, and his deputy, Mr Tom Sawyer, both of whom still carry influence with the left in the unions. The NCU is expected to take a final decision today. The MSF technical union, which also has a left-dominated delegation, has still not reached a final decision on the crucial rule change, and is sure to come under further pressure today. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, last night appealed to leftwing unions and undecided delegates at the annual Tribune rally, saying that the recent clarification of the one-member-one-vote policy allowed mandated delegates to change their positions. Earlier the GPMU print union, another small union opposing reform, was also subjected to strong pressure from the Labour leadership but refused to budge. There was also dismay from reform supporters when it was discovered that the Fabian Society, usually associated with party modernisation, was unable to cast its small number of votes for the leader because of a policy of remaining above factionalism in the party.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- The Party of Democratic Socialism  [PDS] expects to enter the European Parliament and the  Bundestag. The Federal Government does not have any "feeling"  for the east Germans, PDS Bundestag Group chairman Gregor Gysi  said on Friday [11 March] shortly before the opening of a party  congress in Berlin. Therefore, he is optimistic that his party  will exceed the 5-percent threshold.    The party sees "realistic prospects" for getting a direct  mandate in 10 east German constituencies. Therefore, it will  "struggle very vehemently for first votes" there, Gysi said. In  the old laender, the struggle will be pursued for the second  votes. Andre Brie, the party's election campaign leader,  calculated that the PDS wants to get 18 to 20 percent of the  votes in the east and 1.5 to 2 percent in the west and thus jump  over the 5-percent threshold. In the Bundestag election  campaign the PDS will put the topics of mass unemployment, basic  social safeguards, as well as the opposition against social  cutbacks and a shift to the right into the center of its  activities.    At the three-day party congress the 524 delegates, who  represent 131,406 members, intend to adopt their ticket of  candidates for the European elections as well as the programs  for this election and for the Bundestag election. It is  considered certain that Bundestag Deputy Hans Modrow, the former  GDR premier, will head the ticket. The announcement that the  Dresden public prosecutor's office will indict him for  intentional false statements under oath threw a shadow on his  nomination. Nevertheless, the PDS will nominate Modrow, PDS  Chairman Lothar Bisky stressed.</p>

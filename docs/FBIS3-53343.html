			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Salim Tayah] </F>   [Text] Tulkarm, QUDS PRESS -- A Palestinian leader has said  that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] supports "the launching  of a comprehensive national dialogue."    Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, a leader of the Hamas deportees in  south Lebanon, added that such a dialogue "will constitute a  means for the Palestinian people, inside and outside, to avoid  the calamities of the coming period, the self-rule period."    Al-Zahhar doubted the seriousness of Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat's invitation to conduct such a dialogue, and said:  I hope that the intention is not merely to hold a meeting." He  urged the Palestinian factions "not to participate in this  dialogue unless its objective is explained to them in advance."  He called on the Palestinian leadership to formulate "a  political program vis-a-vis the program of the opposition  factions for retrieving full Palestinian rights."    Al-Zahhar added that "many previous meetings with 'Arafat  were just maneuvers in advance of participation in the ninth  round of talks, which led to circumventing the issue of the  deportees."    A series of meetings between PLO leaders, headed by Yasir  'Arafat, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad failed to adopt a unified  stance on the peace talks and the deportees' issue.    Al-Zahhar vehemently denied reports that Hamas intends to  participate in the self-rule elections. He said: We will  neither take part in self-rule elections nor in self-rule  institutions. He added: However, in the past we participated  and will participate in every professional and popular elections  that serve the Palestinian public, without any relation to the  self-rule authority.</p>

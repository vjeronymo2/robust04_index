			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / People: Adding up the nuclear stocks Ross Chiese may have limited scope in his new job for using the acquisition skills he has learnt at Hanson in the past 12 years. But he believes the financial control techniques he has acquired at the conglomerate should stand him in good stead at BNFL, the nuclear fuel reprocessing company where he has started work as finance director. 'It is a big ship to turn round,' he says. 'There is unsophisticated financial information. The company is very successful technologically and scientifically. But financial accountability needs improving fast or BNFL will get left behind.' Chiese, 44, is one of two recent appointments to the BNFL board; the other is Alistair MacFarlane, vice chancellor of Heriot Watt University, as a non-executive. Chiese qualified as a chartered accountant in 1972 after attending school in Harrow, Middlesex. His first job was with Ranks Hovis McDougall, where he worked in a variety of accounting assignments before joining Hanson as a financial controller. He was promoted to deputy finance director in 1986 and dealt with many of the company's acquisitions and subsequent disposals as well as being responsible for financial control budgeting and capital expenditure requirements. His final Hanson job was assistant chief operating officer for the UK, which also includes Hanson's interests in Australia and South Africa.</p>

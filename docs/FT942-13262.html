			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Breakthrough on home front: The UK mortgage market is at a turning point Phillipa Harris is looking forward to moving into her first home - a two-bedroom terraced house in Banbury, Oxfordshire - this weekend. After studying mortgage offers from several lenders, she is taking out one with Coventry building society - fixed for two years at 4.99 per cent in a special deal for first-time buyers. But the 'cashback' offer which attracted her to the Coventry - a Pounds 250 refund if she took out a house insurance policy through the society - had been withdrawn by the time she applied. Subsequently, the Coventry also stopped offering the fixed rate mortgage deal she agreed. Her experience highlights the current confusion in the UK mortgage market. Last week, mortgage-holders with the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society were told that they would receive an unexpected Pounds 500 windfall  -their share in the Pounds 1.8bn which Lloyds bank announced it was prepared to pay to acquire the society. But even before the bid, the market's apparent unpredictability had been illustrated by a flurry of mortgage packages being launched and then quickly withdrawn as lenders tested various products to attract customers. Beneath this activity, however, there are signs that the market may be at a turning point. First, 'mortgage wars' between different lenders are heating up and are likely to become fiercer. Lloyds' offer for C&amp;G is intended to make the high street bank a significant force in the mortgage market. Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, forecast that the deal would intensify competition further, and would tilt the 'competitive equilibrium' Lloyds' way. Until the Lloyds' move the battle this year had appeared to be going the societies' way. Figures published on Friday showed societies were regaining some of the market share of new lending lost to the clearing banks last year. In part that reflected a cautious approach by building societies in 1993, when the mortgage market was generally flat. Even the Halifax building society, which has substantial financial muscle, settled for just a small increase over its 1992 market share. Many smaller societies had a net mortgage repayment as they concentrated on strengthening their balance sheets. This gave banks an opportunity to snatch market share. Even before the Lloyds/C&amp;G deal, clearing banks were expressing determination not to lose now the ground they gained. Some centralised lenders - which are neither banks or building societies - such as the Mortgage Corporation, are also back with a vengeance after a period of not going after new business. Mr John Garfield, managing director of John Charcol, the financial adviser which specialises in mortgages, believes the Lloyds/C&amp;G deal, by highlighting the profitability of mortgage lending, will make other banks more aggressive in the market. 'The banks will be looking hard at the market. We will see the clearing banks in there as a very, very large presence now,' he said. The fiercer competition is also apparent from the range of offers for new mortgage customers launched in the past couple of months: Nationwide building society is offering the chance to win an exotic holiday with some mortgages; the Alliance &amp; Leicester last week launched a new offer giving some borrowers up to Pounds 700 towards the costs of moving. The second factor suggesting that the mortgage market may be at a turning point is the revival in interest among potential borrowers. Bank of England figures to be published next week are expected to show the value and number of mortgage loans approved in the first three months of this year were substantially higher than a year before. Separately, figures for loans approved by building societies in March showed the amounts approved rising sharply for the second month running to reach, at Pounds 3.7bn, their highest level since October 1991. The revival in activity is also evident in house prices. Earlier this month, the Halifax building society's house price survey showed prices firming across all the UK regions. There is also anecdotal evidence of pent-up demand, held back by a dearth of properties that potential purchasers want to buy. Consumers are likely to benefit from the more vigorous contest for their custom. But it is clear that mortgage lenders are not prepared to sacrifice profit simply to gain market share. Though fixed rate loans have become increasingly popular, lenders have not been slow in recent weeks to withdraw some of the lowest rates and replace them with higher rates that reflect the increased cost of borrowing on wholesale money markets. Nor is it a coincidence that special offers have focused on variable rate mortgages, where lenders' margins tend to be wider. Lenders are also determined that there will be no return to the generous lending of the mid-1980s housing boom, either in terms of multiples of salary or readiness to lend 100 per cent of the value of properties. The sharp increases in provisions for bad debt which they had to make as a result of such lending policies are branded on lenders' memories. While the official line from many lenders is that the criteria have not changed, in private they admit that the way these are interpreted has altered. The emphasis is on ensuring that customers can afford the mortgages they are taking out. 'The last thing I want to do is to lend money to people who can't afford it,' said the head of mortgages at one leading bank. All of this suggests that lenders and borrowers agree that there is a definite recovery in the mortgage market, albeit slow and fragile, but that there will not be a return to the rapid house price rises of the mid- to late 1980s. One stabilising influence comes from the would-be house sellers who are holding on to properties in the hope of getting a higher price when the market has picked up some more. Mr Michael Pattison, chief executive of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, said: 'Purchasers remain hard-headed about price, frustrating the hopes of vendors who, although keen to sell, wait for significant rises in values.' Certainly those going into home-buying believe that the boom and bust in house prices during the 1980s will not recur. 'I think I'm buying at the right time,' said Ms Harris. 'I'm pleased I waited and I'm pleased with my mortgage deal.' Lenders will hope there will be enough people like Ms Harris to justify their renewed interest in the mortgage market  - and put the industry back on a clearly upward growth path.</p>

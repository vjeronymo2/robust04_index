			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Well, Fox has done it again with another Sunday night comedy that really makes  me laugh loud for a full half-hour. The new show "Get a Life" is a breath of  fresh air and outrageous comedy in these days of lame generic sitcoms.  </P> <P> Shane A. Erickson, Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OJAI VALLEY INN LANDS SENIORS' TOURNAMENT SPURNED BY LOCAL CLUBS  </P> <P> The GTE West Senior Golf Classic, blown off the Wood Ranch Country Club in Simi  Valley by 2 years of ego-flattening winds, has landed at the Ojai Valley Inn  and Country Club in Ventura County and will be played Dec. 1-3, tournament  officials have announced.  </P> <P> The new site of the event is 30 miles east of Santa Barbara and just a mile  from Lake Casitas.  </P> <P> The course -- built in the 1920s -- was designed by Billy Bell and George C.  Thomas Jr., the same architects who designed Riviera Country Club, Bel-Air  Country Club and Los Angeles Country Club.  </P> <P> The tournament, which has attracted the top seniors players, including Arnold  Palmer, Billy Casper, Chi Chi Rodriguez and Gary Player, was played at Wood  Ranch the past 2 years. But the powerful winds that often rake the Simi Valley  layout caused many players to complain about the course.  </P> <P> Tournament officials offered the event to 2 other Valley-area country clubs --  North Ranch in Thousand Oaks and Lakeside in North Hollywood -- but the boards  of directors at those clubs rejected the tournament.  </P> <P> The new winter tournament is expected to have a field of 72 senior golfers.  </P></p>

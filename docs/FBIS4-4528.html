			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- The government plans to  send Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata to a ministerial meeting of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Marrakech,  Morocco, from April 12 through 15, the chief cabinet secretary  said Monday [4 April].    Masayoshi Takemura told reporters Hata will have an  opportunity for talks with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor about ways to reopen stalled trade negotiations between  Japan and the United States. "We hope this will provide us a  chance to achieve a breakthrough," Takemura said.    Takemura denied a news report that Japan and the United  States will have unofficial talks as early as this week aimed at  breaking the stalemate in bilateral trade negotiations. "We  haven't decided on such a specific plan," he said.    Takemura also said that Tokyo will continue to seek a  breakthrough in the stalled "framework" trade talks with  Washington while carrying out a market-opening package announced  last month.    The bilateral trade talks have been deadlocked since  February  11, when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President  Bill Clinton failed to reach agreement on a U.S. demand for  numerical targets to gauge the openness in Japanese markets.    A Japanese newspaper reported Sunday that Japan will send a  senior official to Washington as early as this week to hold  unofficial talks in hopes of breaking the impasse over the trade  negotiations.</p>

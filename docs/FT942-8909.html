			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Nightfreight raises Pounds 16.1m to cut debt - New issues The family interests of Mr Peter Johnson, chairman of Park Food and Tranmere Rovers - and prospective chairman of Everton Football Club - will get about Pounds 1.75m from the flotation of Nightfreight, the express parcels group, of which he is also chairman. More than 16m shares are being placed at 105p to raise Pounds 16.1m, giving a market capitalisation of Pounds 47.3m. Existing shareholders are selling 4.72m shares. Of the placing 400,000 are being placed with preferential applicants including existing shareholders, employees and associated companies operating within Nightfreight's UK network. Another principal beneficiary will be 3i, the investment group, which is selling 2m shares worth Pounds 2.1m. The company will raise a net Pounds 11.2m to eliminate debt. Nightfreight distributes The Independent newspaper and specialises in industrial packages for the just-in-time market. It was founded by Mr Russell Black, who bought Hernway Transport, a former regional newspaper distributor, from the receiver for Pounds 180,000 in 1984. Mr Johnson became involved in 1990 when Mr Black needed capital and negotiations with a venture capital provider broke down. Mr Johnson, who knew Nightfreight because it once distributed Park Food's Christmas hampers, put in Pounds 500,000. Forecast earnings per share of 7.5p for the year to November 30, compare with 4.12p. The historical p/e was 25.5; the forecast is 14. Notional gross dividend yield at the placing price is 4.03 per cent.</p>

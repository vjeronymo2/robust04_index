Taking this into consideration, what can you say  about this organization?    [Me'simov] The Independent Economists' Association is a  public organization. This organization, which began its  activities as the Independent Economists' Group in 1988, became  active under its present name after having expanded its ranks  following the founding conference in April 1992.    The basic goal of the association is to unite the efforts of  scholars, specialists, enterprise workers and businessmen with a  new economic concept in the name of Azerbaijan's socio-economic  progress, coordinate their activities and direct them toward one  goal. The organization unites not only economists, but also  those of other specialties capable of uniting economics with  problems in their own sectors under its aegis. In the five years  the association has been active our specialists have prepared a  number of scientifically-based concepts and programs  ("Azerbaijan's Concept of Economic Independence," "Program of  Measures Taken Against the Economic Crisis in Azerbaijan,"  "Program of Azerbaijan's Economic Revival") on privatization,  agricultural reform, the organization of social processes,  foreign investment policy and other important economic issues,  among them many which have been valued quite highly by foreign  specialists. We have also participated closely in the  preparation of legislative acts and other state programs and  documents, and in terms of expertise. The number of association  members, their variety of expertise and competence, has provided  much practical advice, proposal preparation and expert opinions,  and makes it possible to prepare alternative documentation for  important economic problems, and short-, middle- and long-term  prognoses.    [Question] After having stepped down from your post as first  deputy Prime Minister and having revived your activity in the  Independent Economists' Association, what directions will you  give priority in the work of the Association?    [Me'simov] The major priority in the Association's work has  been defined by the dictates of our disturbance created from the  tension created in the economic situation of our republic as a  consequence of the present economic policy of the government.  Some confusion in the government's economic policy and the  inconclusiveness and mistakes stemming from this are felt  clearly. If the government attempts to build economic policy  with the help of incorrectly evaluated measures, the situation  in all sectors of the socio-economic life of the country could  worsen in the next few months. Every organization and economist,  no matter what the position or function in society, which  foresees the harm these tendencies could do to our economy,  standard of living of the population and statehood must  understand that the responsibility falls on the present extreme  conditions, and must direct his activities towards getting out  of the situation which has been created.    Whether one emerges from the situation which has been  created  at maximum or minimal cost depends primarily on whether economic  policy is correctly or incorrectly structured. The goal of  independent economists who are always trying to be objective in  their views and who made known their constructive relationship  to the steps taken in the economic sector even when I held high  positions in government structures was and is unambiguous. Our  goal is to influence legislation and other state documents of an  economic character by providing expertise, preparing  alternatives, making known an objective relationship to steps  taken by the government in the economic policy sector, and  avoiding mistakes, as well as influencing the correct  structuring of economic policy to the extent it depends on us  and our abilities. In connection with this, members of the  Association regularly inform the mass media on their views on  economic policy and related problems. This is a very important  question because it occurs to a person sitting within the  government structure that he sees and knows everything, and that  he is in control. Unfortunately, there are such things that are  seen better from a distance.    The Association of Independent Economists, taking into  consideration the direct influence of every step taken in the  economic policy sector on the living standards of the people,  will provide help and expertise in the preparation of drafts of  state documents on reforms in an unbiased manner, will not  intrigue against anyone, and its members will not declare  beforehand that they will not take a post in the administration.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COURT DENIES APPEAL OF PEYER CONVICTION  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to hear an appeal by former  California Highway Patrol Officer Craig Peyer, who was convicted of  first-degree murder in June, 1988, for the strangulation death of Cara Knott.  </P> <P> "The court denied a petition for review," said a clerk.  </P> <P> Peyer, 40, killed Knott, 20, on Dec. 27, 1986, near the Mercy Road off-ramp and  Interstate 15 and tossed her body into a dry creek bed. The body was discovered  the following day.  </P> <P> He is currently serving a sentence of 25-years-to-life in state prison. A  previous appeal to the state 4th District Court of Appeal was denied in June.  His first trial ended with the jury deadlocked 7 to 5 for conviction in early  1988.  </P> <P> A 13-year CHP veteran, Peyer is the first CHP officer convicted of committing  murder while on duty.  </P> <P> Christopher Schatz, Peyer's appellate attorney, was not availble for comment  Thursday.  </P> <P> Deputy Atty. Gen. Janelle Davis said that Peyer has exhausted his appeal rights  in the state courts. Davis, who represented the state in Peyer's appeal to the  4th District, said the only legal avenue left for Peyer is to ask the federal  courts to review the case.  </P> <P> "But he really doesn't have any more appeal rights," Davis said.  </P></p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / BR order may save 1,500 Brel jobs in York THE government yesterday said British Rail had found the money to place a Pounds 130m order which could save 1,500 jobs at Brel, Britain's biggest railway carriage maker, in York, the most marginal Conservative seat. Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, has written to Mr Conal Gregory, the Conservative candidate who won York in 1987 by only 147 votes, revealing that BR planned shortly to place an order for 188 Networker coaches for Network SouthEast. The government had been under pressure from Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, who had urged Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, to allow BR to place an immediate order with Brel. BR confirmed yesterday that it expected to place the order by mid-April, although it may not necessarily go to Brel. The only other competitor is Metro-Cammell, part of GEC Alsthom. British Rail also announced that it and Brel had ended a long-running dispute over the cost of modifications and repairs to the 447 Class 158 trains being built, mainly for regional services. The settlement was announced as Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, acquired Trafalgar House's 40 per cent stake in Brel, to double its own shareholding to 80 per cent. The other 20 per cent is owned by Brel's management and employees. British Rail sold Brel in April 1989. Although the terms of the deal were not revealed, it is understood that the Swedish-Swiss group, paid a nominal sum, believed to be Pounds 1, for the stake. Trafalgar's loan stock in Brel, worth about Pounds 13m, is due to be repaid by Brel in 1994-95. Trafalgar, the property and shipping conglomerate, recently reported a Pounds 26.5m provision against its investment and had made no secret of its unhappiness with its involvement in Brel. Its investment has been written down to Pounds 1 because of Brel's mounting losses and adverse publicity arising from defects in the Class 158 express trains. Brel's York works will complete its current contract for 200 Class 465 trains for Network SouthEast in a year's time and badly needs the follow on order to remain viable. ABB and Trafalgar House installed Mr Bo Sodersten, an experienced railway executive, as Brel's new chief executive to replace Mr Peter Holdstock six months ago. Since then, Brel has cut 1,000 jobs and substantially reorganised its new construction division. Mr Bill Beaman, secretary of the works committee at York, welcomed ABB's purchase of Trafalgar's stake, while Mr Sodersten said the deal would produce much greater synergies between Brel and ABB's transport division. About 70 per cent of Brel's business is with BR and it has had very little success at winning overseas orders in a market plagued by overcapacity.</p>

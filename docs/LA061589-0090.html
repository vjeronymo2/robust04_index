			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FBI EXTENDS ITS INSPECTION OF ROCKY FLATS ARMS PLANT  </P> <P> Federal investigators extended their search of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons  facility for 10 days longer and established a special telephone line to receive  scores of tips flooding in from whistle-blowers, angry neighbors and other  concerned citizens, the FBI said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The search warrant was being renewed because "the size and number of documents  involved make this a very voluminous, monstrous operation," Bob Pence, special  agent-in-charge of the FBI in Colorado, said.  </P> <P> Additional agents from both the FBI and the Environmental Protection Agency  have been brought in "from around the country" to help look for evidence of  environmental crimes allegedly committed at the plant 16 miles northwest of  Denver.  </P> <P> Pence said the Department of Energy and its Rocky Flats contractor, Rockwell  International Corp., were cooperating in the investigation.  </P> <P> Both the Energy Department and Rockwell are suspected of illegal dumping,  burning of hazardous wastes and falsifying documents.  </P> <P> Agents in special protective clothing have been posted around the clock at the  plant, which manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons, since a  massive raid was mounted there nine days ago.  </P> <P> Pence said that the FBI and the Environmental Protection Agency have received  well over 100 calls from people offering new information about suspected  wrongdoing at the plant, Pence said.  </P> <P> "Some of it seems to be pretty significant," he said, but he would not discuss  any of the tips in detail.  </P></p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Equitable demutualisation moves closer THE Equitable Life Assurance Society, the fourth largest insurance company in the US, moved a step closer to successful demutualisation yesterday when policyholders approved the transaction. Demutualisation is the process whereby a mutual insurer, essentially controlled by policyholders, turns itself into a 'conventional' shareholder-owned company. Equitable is the largest US insurer to have taken this route, but  - given that the need to raise new capital is fairly widespread in the insurance sector  - others may follow suit. Equitable's policyholders were asked to vote on the matter on Wednesday. Some 888,338 policyholders returned ballot cards  - out of a maximum of 2.2m  - of which 819,964 were in favour. This 92.3 per cent vote in favour easily surpasses the minimum two-thirds majority needed. Equitable now needs the go-ahead from the New York State Insurance Department, which is overseeing the process, and a sale of shares to investors should proceed this summer. The demutualisation process is of intense interest to Axa, the large French insurer; it stands to receive up to 49 per cent of Equitable's equity in return for a Dollars 1bn capital infusion last year, assuming all goes smoothly.</p>

			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDSU RAISES $1 MILLION FOR ATHLETIC DEFICIT  </P> <P> San Diego State President Tom Day announced Monday that local residents and  businesses have donated or pledged a total of $1 million over the next seven  years in an effort to eliminate the $518,000 budget deficit facing the Aztec  athletic department.  </P> <P> The announcement puts a successful end to the school's nine-week fund drive  designed to aid a department that has been operating in the red for nearly a  decade. But, it doesn't mean that the deficit is immediately eliminated.  </P> <P> Walt Turner, a 1954 SDSU graduate who led the fund drive, said his group has  collected $300,000 in cash -- the remaining $700,000 is in pledges. And, of the  cash in hand, $125,000 is committed to a marketing campaign for Aztec  athletics.  </P> <P> The department also faces the probability that the deficit has increased after  the 1989-90 fiscal year, which ended Saturday.  </P> <P> Jim Herrick, SDSU associate athletic director for business affairs, is in the  process of finishing the paperwork but said he expects the athletic department  will once again wind up owing money -- although he said he didn't yet know how  much.  </P> <P> "It's not going to be much, though," he said.  </P> <P> Mary Garretson, California State University system controller, said that in  Nov., 1989, the chancellor's office and SDSU agreed the school was committed to  reducing the deficit on the state books to $375,000 by June 30, 1990, and then  reduce the deficit by $125,000 in each of the next three years so that the  deficit would be eliminated by June 30, 1993. Garretson said the state  considers SDSU's debt to be $500,000. By obtaining the $300,000 in cash, SDSU  will be able pay the $125,000 owed the state.  </P> <P> "From our standpoint, that was the contract and they've met that goal,"  Garretson said.  </P> <P> Fred Miller, SDSU athletic director, said SDSU plans to continue covering what  is left of the deficit by borrowing against the pledged money.  </P> <P> Despite the fact that SDSU isn't obligated to pay off its financial debt to the  state until 1993, school officials were happy and relieved Monday as they  talked about the $1 million they raised. The elimination of the deficit was one  aspect of a three-part plan introduced by Day in April -- better marketing of  SDSU athletics and an investigation into conference affiliations other than the  Western Athletic Conference were the other two.  </P> <P> "Today we're very pleased to announce that we've had a successful completion of  a key part of our effort -- the elimination of the deficit that for years has  been sapping the image and the strength of our intercollegiate athletics," Day  said. "It's really a tremendous achievement, particularly since we've been  doing this in a very short period of time. We announced that we intended to do  it in April, and we're announcing at the beginning of July that we've done it."  </P> <P> Neither Turner nor Miller said they were concerned that some of the money  pledged to the SDSU athletic deparment would not arrive.  </P> <P> "The caliber of people and pledges are such that you really are not nervous  about any collection problem," Turner said. "The experiences that the athletic  department has had with Golden Aztec Ring and other significant contributions  or pledges have identified very little collection problems. The 39 persons or  companies are all substantial individuals, otherwise they wouldn't be pledging  this money."  </P> <P> Turner said that there is not much overlap between the people his group  contacted and people who normally contribute to SDSU via groups such as the  Golden Aztec Ring or Aztec Athletic Foundation. Of the 39 people who will be  donating money, Turner said, only between six and eight would overlap.  </P> <P> "That would not really amount to that much (money) each year," Turner said.  </P> <P> Turner added that a potentially large area was left relatively untapped in his  group's effort -- SDSU alumni.  </P> <P> "A good portion of the people who made the commitment were people who were not  SDSU alumni, but were individuals within the community who felt San Diego  deserved a strong collegiate athletic program," Turner said.  </P> <P> One, Rod Wells of Arthur Andersen, said his company donated $25,000 -- to be  paid over seven years -- because of its community standing.  </P> <P> "As a public accounting firm, we see SDSU as a major resource for us," he said.  "We didn't like the fact that SDSU is not a major player."  </P></p>

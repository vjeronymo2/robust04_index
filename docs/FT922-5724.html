			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Two cables are better than one Electricians have long known that current in electrical systems can be monitored by measuring the magnetic field around conductors in the circuit. But there is no method of monitoring current in twin or multiple cables without disturbing the protective sheath, writes Andrew Baxter. Now Mike Watson, a British inventor, has developed a cable coupling transformer which provides the long sought-after non-contact method of monitoring current in twin-cored cables. The Watsonline system can send or receive electrical information without picking up interference, allowing a high level of amplification. Watson, who is managing director of Paraphone, the group set up to exploit the product commercially, sees a range of applications for the device apart from providing a simple way for electricians to check currents or do fault diagnosis. Connected to a loudspeaker, it could replace inductive loops for people with hearing difficulties. Alternatively, it could be used as an instant pocket telephone loudspeaker or for underwater voice communication. Paraphone, 0932 220612.</p>

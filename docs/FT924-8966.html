			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Property: Deep in the Italian countryside - a village prepares to dance again - Audrey Powell meets a developer who stumbled on an opportunity in Le Marche IT IS rare in these recession-ridden times for a developer to promote a project and come out on the winning side. David Coates is a director of Edinburgh-based design consultants McIlroy Coates (which planned the bookshop in the new Sainsbury wing of London's National Gallery). He and his wife, picture restorer Josephine Maxwell, decided to buy a holiday retreat in Italy. They discovered the Le Marche region, east of Umbria, green and hilly and reaching to the Adriatic, The Coates looked at a dozen houses, but none was right. Then they were shown a large property with dusty-terracotta coloured walls and faded blue shutters. It was locked. This was late evening. They could not see inside. But this, in its rural setting, was the house they wanted. By now they had learnt of the usefulness of a geometra, whom David Coates describes as 'part architect, part quantity surveyor, part planning consultant' - a profession with no direct equivalent in Britain. The geometra had shown them the properties and explained that with the blue-shuttered house, once the home of an Italian general, came three vacant farm houses, one inhabited farm and 100 acres. It was beyond the Coates' budget. They returned to Scotland and put advertisements in several newspapers. The geometra took his own line of action. He asked the tenant farmer if he would like to buy the farm - for a fraction of its worth. He offered agricultural land, similarly cheaply, to tenants or neighbouring farmers. Deals were struck. Coates, also asking attractive prices, found buyers through friends or the advertisements, for the dilapidated farm houses, with suitable amounts of land. One went to an accountant, another to the head of a midlands green grocery chain. In five months the estate was split and sold and Coates had effectively bought his own house, and the six acres he kept, for nothing. However, the old property, with its cellars with huge casks for wine and presses for extracting olive oil, its numerous rooms with brick-paved floors, will need a host of modern additions to turn to the home they visualise and will take a lot of money. Meanwhile, friends, and friends-of-friends, kept asking Coates about the Italian properties that he was 'offering for knockdown prices.' Coates asked the geometra to look for something suitable for another project. He came up with an abandoned hamlet, deep in the Marche countryside, called Campodanzo ('field of dance'). Its 40 acres include a collection of rural buildings, some 200 years old, which Coates is turning into 15 mostly small and mainly detached leisure homes, grouped in two sections. As is the practice in much of Europe, the land and property had been passed down through families and ownership had become fragmented. It took the geometra a year to trace the 23 people who had rights over the property and get them to agree to sell. Then planning matters had to be dealt with. Coates, in his new part-time occupation of developer, is using local materials, local tradesmen and traditional building materials and the authorities are happy to see the hamlet come to life again. It has been empty for 25 years. Campodanzo is for those who like a true country setting. Its meadows sweep down to a shallow river in a gorge. Its fields produce up to three crops a year. Plums, apricots, apples, figs and vines grow close to the houses. There is the scent of jasmine. The occasional bat is disturbed . . . The houses take their shapes from the original uses of the buildings and all are different. Some were always cottages, some were homes where animals occupied the ground level. Some were barns. They are mostly of stone with beamed ceilings and interior shutters, They are getting modern kitchens, bathrooms, double-glazing. Each property will have a small private garden area. Prices range from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 98,000 for one to three bedrooms. There will be swimming pools and tennis courts, hidden in woods where sounds of their use will not annoy residents. Ownership of the properties is freehold. The land and amenities are owned jointly. A maintenance company to look after these will be run by the geometra and there will be an annual charge. A nearby village caters for simple needs. A little farther away are such as like Sarnano, which has both its boutiques and its restored 'old town.' The nearest beach is about 45 minutes from Campodanzo and there are ski slopes about 30 minutes in the opposite direction. In summer charter flights go from Gatwick (London) to Ancona, an hour's drive from the estate. Scheduled flights go to Rimini, two hours' drive away, and Bologna, half an hour further. Coates says he can catch the daily 2pm Sabena flight from Edinburgh to Brussels, then fly on to Bologna. With the two-and-a-half-hour motorway drive, he can be at his property near Campodanzo, by 10.30 pm. The return fare is Pounds 250. Italy's autostrada network is being extended. Within a few years links should be built from the route along the Adriatic coast across to Assisi and Perugia and the Rome-Florence autostrada, to bring Le Marche further out of obscurity.

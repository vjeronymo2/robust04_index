			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / President orders Chiapas ceasefire President Carlos Salinas of Mexico yesterday ordered an immediate unilateral ceasefire in the conflict areas in the southern state of Chiapas. The suspension of military action came after the army had claimed to have regained control of the former rebel strongholds. Mr Salinas offered an amnesty to rebels who had acted under duress or from desperation, and who now accept peace. The rebellion in Chiapas by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, which began on January 1, has already cost more than 100 lives. On Monday, it led to a re-shuffle of the national cabinet after the hard-line interior minister, Mr Patrocinio Gon-zalez, was forced to resign. In a televised speech to the nation, the president said the army would only respond if attacked. He hoped the decision would be 'the first step to save lives and find new ways of conciliation'. He indicated that the government would respond to the social demands of the local population. The defence ministry said civil authorities had regained control of the towns which had been seized by rebels. The army yesterday opened roads to the conflict areas which had been sealed.</p>

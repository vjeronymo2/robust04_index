From  27 to 30 May, the "Seminar on Use of Foreign Capital To Reform  State-Owned Enterprises and on the `China Strategic Investment  Limited' Phenomenon," was held in Hangzhou, nearly 100 experts  and scholars from Chinese government departments, economic  circles, and news circles gathered together to seek proper ways  to reform state-owned enterprises and discuss the advantages and  disadvantages of the joint reform efforts by Hong Kong's China  Strategic Investment Limited and the mainland's state-owned  enterprises in recent years. They unanimously thought that one  effective ways to invigorate state-owned enterprises is to use  foreign capital to reform them.    The seminar was jointly proposed and organized by the  Zhejiang Province Committee for Restructuring Economy,  Zhejiang's GAIGE YUEKAN [Reform Monthly], and ZHEJIANG JINGJI  BAO. Among of those attending the seminar were An Zhiwen,  president of the Society for Research on Restructuring the  Economic System; Wang Yuzhao, Standing Committee member of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and vice chairman of the Economy  Committee of the CPPCC; Liu Guoguang, vice president of the  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Yang Qixian, vice president  of the Society for Research on Restructuring Economic System;  Huang Daoxia, researcher at the State Council's Development  Research Center; and economics professors and theorists from  various universities, including Fang Sheng, Wang Jue, Zhong  Mingrong, Wei Jie, and Liu Wei, in addition to journalists from  some 20 central, provincial, and city news organizations. Yang  Bin, vice chairman of Zhejiang Province People's Congress,  Hangzhou Mayor Wang Yongming, and Lu Yongxiang, member of the  CPC Central Committee and president of Zhejiang University, also  attended the seminar.    Huang Hong-nien, chairman of the broad of directors of China  Strategic Investment Limited in Hong Kong, and the persons in  charge of the joint-venture enterprises set up by the company on  the mainland, also came to the seminar to hear expert opinions  and give briefings on the great changes in joint-venture  enterprises after their company injected funds into them. They  cited a series of figures and facts to illustrate that  importation of foreign capital has not only enabled state-owned  enterprises to change mechanisms, but also promoted  technological transformation and reform of management systems in  the enterprises, aroused workers' enthusiasm for production, and  enabled enterprises to swiftly stop losses, earn profits, and  have marked economic returns.    Wei Jie, a professor from the People's University of China,  fully affirmed the "China Strategic Investment Limited  phenomenon" from the perspective of development of productive  forces. He pointed out that when the shares of state-owned  enterprises are controlled by foreign investors, state assets,  enterprises, entrepreneurs, and the labor force have their  positions fixed, then the big problem which has hindered  state-owned enterprises for a long time, namely mixing up of  government and enterprises and separation of authority and duty,  has been solved.    Professor Wang Jue from the Central Party School thought  that  the "China Strategic Investment Limited phenomenon" is not  accidental, but is an inevitable phenomenon in the course of  deepening of reform of state-owned enterprises. An absolute  majority of the state-owned enterprises taken over by China  Strategic Investment Limited for reform have cast off poverty  and embarked upon the road of development and have changed  losses to profits; this is good for individuals, collectives,  and the state as well, and this has provided a lot of  enlightenment about the reform of state-owned enterprises. He  also said that the reform of state-owned enterprises is now an  urgent task, and that if initiative is still not actively taken,  then many state-owned enterprises will collapse. After carrying  out enterprise reform, other steps such as financial and  taxation reforms must be swiftly implemented, otherwise the  functions of enterprises after reform cannot be further  developed.    Wang Yuzhao, vice chairman of the CPPCC Economic Committee,  said when he addressed the seminar that the crux of the current  difficult situation of state-owned enterprises is a system  problem and the basic way out is a reform of the system.  Therefore, borrowing the strong points from the enterprises  under non-state-owned system, especially non-public-owned  system, to reform state-owned enterprises, should be an  important way to invigorate state-owned enterprises. The "China  Strategic Investment Limited phenomenon" is precisely this kind  of exploration and creation. Its practice has helped  enterprises clarify property rights, promoted separation of  government from enterprises, expedited enterprise technological  transformation, upgraded the degree of enterprise participation  in the international market, and, at the same time, maintained a  dominant position of party work. At present, society has  different opinions on the "China Strategic Investment Limited  phenomenon," but this situation is not strange at all. Since  reform and opening up, no innovative practice has avoided  causing controversy and criticism. However, an innovation which  has real vitality is not afraid of controversy and criticism.    During the seminar, the experts and scholars also visited  China Strategic Hangzhou Brewery Company Limited and China  Strategic Hangzhou Rubber Company Limited, to examine the  changes and benefits brought about by importation of foreign  funds to these enterprises.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: TV-am chief warns about the future of Sunrise MR BRUCE Gyngell, chairman of TV-am, the commercial television breakfast station, warned yesterday that its successor, Sunrise, could be out of business within 18 months. Mr Gyngell was speaking after announcing that his company had made pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.5m for the 11 months to December 31, against Pounds 26m for the previous full year. The taxable figure was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 4.2m (nil) related to redundancy and other contractual payments incurred by the termination of TV-am's news operation. The TV-am chairman said he accepted that Sunrise, which won the breakfast franchise with a bid of Pounds 34.6m, would probably have lower costs than TV-am's. But he warned that Sunrise - its main shareholders include London Weekend Television, Scottish Television, Disney, The Guardian and Carlton Communications - would run into trouble on the revenue side. Mr Gyngell said that Sunrise was expecting revenues of Pounds 117m in 1995 compared with TV-am's forecasts of Pounds 82m and had to pay 15 per cent of advertising revenue on top of the bid. 'I feel it is important to stress that the Pounds 14m that the company (TV-am) bid for the franchise was the maximum that the board considered we could responsibly make and continue to have a profitable company,' he said. He believes that satellite television will make increasing inroads into both the breakfast television audience and advertising revenues. Mr Gyngell predicted that Sunrise would have to hand back its licence and that the Independent Television Commission would get no other takers at the current bid level. TV-am's turnover for the 11 months was Pounds 79.4m (Pounds 89.4m for the 12 months) and an unchanged final dividend of 10p maintains the total at 14p. TV-am has cash reserves of Pounds 48m and is likely to take the figure to about Pounds 70m when its franchise runs out at the end of this year.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound and dollar easier INTERNATIONAL currencies traded quietly yesterday as the foreign exchange markets paused to take stock following volatility in Europe and a stronger US currency, writes Peter John. The dollar was broadly easier, despite hints of another tranche of positive economic news today, while sterling failed to reflect the good news from yesterday's money supply figures. Even the beleaguered Irish punt stayed on the sidelines and picked itself up from the floor of the exchange rate mechanism. Dealers said that the dollar was not attracting attention and there was a feeling that its recent rise might have been overdone, at least in the short-term. This was borne out by the lack of reaction to the latest figures from the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index. The rise to 54.2 per cent from 49.7 per cent was greater than expected and suggested good news today from the more significant National Association of Purchasing Managers. Nevertheless, the dollar traded sideways against the yen closing at Y124.45 against Y124.35 and slipped against the DMark to DM1.5935 from DM1.5980. However, the German currency was also subdued as economics minister Mr Juergen Moellemann said that the global recession had finally caught up with the country. Third-quarter figures due on Thursday are expected to confirm the gloomy standpoint. Sterling might have been expected to receive a lift from the news that money supply, at least the narrow measure that comprises notes and coins in circulation, had increased. However, the implication that people were finally beginning to spend was countered by suggestions in the market that the influx of new, smaller 10p coins was at least partly to blame. Also, any auspicious news was overshadowed by the negative weekend press stories surrounding the UK chancellor and most dealers took the money supply figures with a pinch of salt. The pound was marginally easier against the German currency, slipping to DM2.4125 from DM2.4150 and closing slightly lower at Dollars 1.5135 against Dollars 1.5115. The Irish punt survived against the expectations of many and although the devaluation fears remain it climbed two places up the ERM ladder above the French franc and the Danish krone. However, France maintained its intervention rate at 9.1 per cent and there was a conviction in the market that the franc did not deserve to be so low on the ERM scale. The Portuguese escudo remained at the top of the ERM as Mr Miguel Beleza, the governor of the Bank of Portugal, distanced himself from the possibility of devaluation. Outside the European basket of currencies, the Norwegian krone was helped by an inflow of currency which enabled the Norwegian central bank to cut its overnight lending rate to 17 per cent from a six-year high of 25 per cent. The cut follows a raise a week ago after the currency was hit on the foreign exchanges by devaluation pressures.</p>

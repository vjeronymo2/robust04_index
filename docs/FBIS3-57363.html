			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Alexandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 25 TASS -- A concept of the draft  law "On Political Parties" was criticized today by the majority  of speakers at hearings of the Russian president's commission  for legislative proposals.    The five-page concept gives the notion of "an all-Russian  political party", specifies conditions of party formation and  registration, enumerates party rights and control over party  activities.    The majority of party representatives opposed an idea to  describe a party as all-Russian only in case of "its support by  over five per cent of voters in the state Duma elections" and a  strength of no less than 5,000 members. The commission  suggested to consider all- Russian only the parties represented  in the parliament although many of them won the elections within  larger electoral coalitions.    The idea was most severely criticized by parties that did  not  gain the five per cent of votes at the recent elections -- the  Constitutional-Democratic Party, the Conservative Party, the  Party of Consolidation, the Socialist Party of Working People,  the National-Republican Party and others.    Deputy Russian Labor Minister Vladimir Varov said the  document is "a worst concept of draft laws discussed by the  former Supreme Soviet". In his opinion, the body registering a  party should proceed from party deeds and not its rules or other  documents which may be written in a way to meet all the  criteria. "Otherwise, we will soon have dozens of paramilitary  organizations named `parties'," he stressed.    Leader of the Association of Russian Independent  Professionals Pyotr Filippov called for "application of tougher  norms to political parties". In his opinion, all parties --  including those which exceeded the five per cent limit and those  which did not -- should constantly confirm their right to  existence. He said regular re-registration of party members is  necessary.</p>

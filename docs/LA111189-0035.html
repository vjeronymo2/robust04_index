			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CARPENTER, BURRIDGE LEAD BRUINS  </P> <P> Bobby Carpenter and Randy Burridge have been linemates for only three games,  but it looks like a good match.  </P> <P> Carpenter scored two goals and an assist, and Burridge had a goal and two  assists Friday night in Landover, Md., as the Boston Bruins extended their  unbeaten streak to four games with a 5-3 victory over the Washington Capitals.  </P> <P> "Three games, and we've played three great games," Carpenter said of the line  that also includes Bob Sweeney. ". . . We play well together. We complement  each other. I think there's a real good work ethic there."  </P> <P> The Bruins, 3-0-1 in their last four games, scored on three of their first  seven shots as they built a 3-0 lead in the opening 13:17 of the game. By the  time they reached the third period, they were just trying to hang on.  </P> <P> Even though the Bruins were outshot, 13-4, in the final period, they ended  Washington's four-game unbeaten streak as the Capitals fell to 3-3-2 at home.  </P> <P> Mike Ridley's third-period goal pulled Washington within 4-3, but Boston  defenseman Garry Galley put the game away with a goal with 3:31 to play.  </P> <P> Carpenter has four goals in his last four games.  </P> <P> Buffalo 4, Vancouver 2 -- The Sabres, last in the NHL on the power play, scored  three goals with the man advantage at Buffalo.  </P> <P> Buffalo scored on three of four power-play opportunities to remain unbeaten at  home this season (7-0-1). The Sabres are unbeaten in their last seven games,  with six wins and a tie.  </P> <P> Dave Andreychuk, Alexander Mogilny, Pierre Turgeon and Scott Arniel scored for  Buffalo.  </P> <P> With the teams tied, 1-1, Mogilny turned in an outstanding individual effort to  give Buffalo the lead.  </P> <P> The Soviet rookie took a pass from Doug Bodger near the Vancouver blue line,  skated around two defenders and lifted a backhand past McLean for his third  goal of the year.  </P> <P> Hartford 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Dave Tippett made his first goal of the season a  game-winner for the Whalers at Winnipeg.  </P> <P> Tippett picked up a rebound off the end boards and beat Jet goaltender Daniel  Berthiaume with just 2:39 left in the third period to snap a 2-2 tie.  </P> <P> Mike Tomlak added an empty-net goal with 43 seconds left.  </P> <P> Scott Young and Kevin Dineen also scored for the Whalers.  </P> <P> Dale Hawerchuk broke out of a six-game pointless streak with two goals for  Winnipeg. The third period was filled with fights, with Dan Marovelli handing  out 33 minutes in penalties, including a high-sticking major and game  misconduct to Pat Verbeek.  </P></p>

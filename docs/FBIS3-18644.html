			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 19 February Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO  published an interview by Jose Vegar with Socialist Party (PS)  leader Antonio Guterres in which the latter rejected an  electoral alliance with the Communist Party (PCP). In addition,  he stressed that an "autonomous" PS would attract many communist  voters, for he sees no reason why those who voted for the PCP  should vote instead for the PS. Asked to comment on his belief  that the PS's support comes from the middle class, Guterres  noted that for the PS to win an election, it must attract a  significant share of those who voted for the PSD in 1991 and did  not vote again for it in the last municipal elections.  Consequently, the PS must appeal, not only to the less  privileged classes, but also to the "dynamic sectors" of  society, without being "the party of the excluded." Asked  whether this means the center-left, Guterres agreed, noting that  this is where his party belongs. He stressed the view that there  is no distinction today between democratic socialism and social  democracy, despite the fact that his party does not resemble the  PSD, which "for historical and accidental reasons has a name  that does not correspond to its ideology." Guterres expressed  his belief that the state's role is to "regulate and promote  social justice and equality of opportunity," for the market,  without which it is "impossible to guarantee the efficient  functioning of the economy," cannot achieve these goals.    Guterres was also queried on his recent statement that  Portugal must have a strategy vis-a-vis Spain. The PS leader  replied that Lisbon must defend Portuguese interests and should  not accept a "regional and peripheral" position within Europe  with regard to Spain. Finally, when asked whether Portugal ought  to participate actively in a possible NATO intervention in  Bosnia, Guterres said that while Portugal should not refuse to  contribute to peace missions, Portuguese Armed Forces should  have a greater role to play in peace processes in the former  Portuguese colonies than in the former Yugoslavia, whose  relations with Lisbon are not of primary importance.</p>

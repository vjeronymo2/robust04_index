			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / World Trade News: Brussels says Gatt criticism is unbalanced THE EUROPEAN Community dismissed suggestions that its trade policy is dominated by restrictive measures as unbalanced. Criticism in Gatt's review failed to recognise the basic openness of the EC market and the contribution to the growth of world trade in recent years, Mr Roderick Abbot, EC director for external trade relations, told the Gatt council. In a written report to Gatt, in which it listed the problems it faces with the US, Japan and some leading developing countries, the Commission said the EC was operating in a far from perfect world - which might explain some unjustified barriers. In some sectors, in which the EC had been criticised the most, there was another story to tell, Mr Abbot said. The Community was the world's largest importer of farm products and over half the imports entered duty-free. Community imports of textiles and clothing had more than tripled since 1976. About 85 per cent of steel imports entered with no other obstacle than normal low or preferential zero tariffs. Even for cars the level of import penetration was already relatively high. The EC's fundamental objective was to support and strengthen the multilateral trading system and Gatt, Mr Abbot said. But the multilateralism defended by the Gatt secretariat was not antithetical to preferential, regional and bilateral trading arrangements, all of which were allowed under Gatt rules and complemented the multilateral system. Trade preferences could be of value for certain products from an individual country but did not in themselves alter the overall pattern of trade flows in an open economy. The EC gave greater preference to the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, but their share in EC imports from all developing countries had fallen from 20 per cent in 1970 to 14 per cent in 1989. Brussels used bilateral export restraint agreements because the safeguard action permitted by Gatt against imports threatening domestic industries was difficult to apply and of too short duration to be effective in restructuring industries like textiles. Changes to the Gatt safeguard rules foreshadowed in the Uruguay Round could result in fewer bilateral agreements being struck.</p>

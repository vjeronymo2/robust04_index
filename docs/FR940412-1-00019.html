These draft proposed regulations, however, do not include the provisions relating to order of selection under 34 CFR 361.36 that were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  for comment on July 16, 1993 (58 FR 38482). Final regulations relating to the order of selection requirement will be published as a separate document later this year. In addition, these draft proposed regulations do not implement section 106 of the Act relating to evaluation standards and performance indicators for The State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program. Proposed regulations implementing section 106 will also be published separately for public comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Staff from OSERS and other offices of the Department of Education will be available at the meetings and teleconferences to discuss the draft proposed regulations and provide technical assistance and clarification of the proposed provisions.

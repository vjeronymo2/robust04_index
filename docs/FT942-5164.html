			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / International Company News: Papua New Guinea reviews mining policy Mr John Kaputin, Papua New Guinea's mining and petroleum minister, cast a new shadow over the future of mining projects in the country when he announced at the weekend that he intended to review national mining and petroleum policy and would need the next six to 12 months to do so. Speaking to mining executives at PNG's annual geology, exploration and mining conference in Lae, Mr Kaputin indicated that after the large ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 857m) Lihir gold mine project was finalised, there would be a moratorium on further mining project decisions. 'Let me advise you that after this project (Lihir), we will hold everything and I have been instructed to use the next six to 12 months to come up with a new policy,' Mr Kaputin said. 'I am not, at this stage, in a position to let you know what my terms of reference are going to be, but we will be visiting a number of countries to examine their respective mining and petroleum policies in order to re-examine our own national policies.' Already, the PNG government has kept the international investment community on tenterhooks over Lihir. Originally, there were hopes that the necessary special mining lease for the project - a joint venture between Britain's RTZ group and Niugini Mining, which is controlled by Canada's Battle Mountain - would be granted by the government at the beginning of 1994. However, the matter has subsequently been bogged down in the PNG cabinet for months, with the dispute apparently centred on whether the state-owned Malaysian Mining Corporation should be brought into the project at an early stage, and what share of the equity should be given to local landowners. Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, recently told parliament that the deal would be concluded 'properly and . . . at the right time'. He added that 'we will not be pressured by lobby groups.' The decision by Mr Kaputin, who took over the mining portfolio in a ministerial reshuffle at the beginning of this year, to put future projects on hold while he reviews PNG's mining policy seems likely to jeopardise further PNG's already-strained relations with parts of the international investment community. RTZ in London could not be contacted for comment.</p>

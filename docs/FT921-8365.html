			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Perrier loses some sparkle as equities rise in Paris SENIOR bourses saw thin trading in the absence of Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS closed near the day's highs but volume was thin with just FFr1.6bn worth of shares traded. The CAC 40 index ended up 16.96 at 1,882.07. Peugeot was the day's most active share, rising FFr17 to FFr705 and accounting for about 10 per cent of total turnover. But dealers could find no reason for the rise. Perrier was in the limelight, falling FFr45 or 2.86 per cent to FFr1,530 with 48,855 shares traded, as news that the French government had approved the FFr1,475-a-share bid from Nestle and Indosuez dampened hopes of a rival bid. Several brokers are also advising investors to take profits in view of the stock's recent run. However, Exor, the main shareholder in Perrier, jumped FFr53 or 3.7 per cent to FFr1,486 in unusually heavy volume of 23,580 shares on rumoured buying by Suez in order to help the Nestle-Indosuez camp. Credit Local de France was another gainer, adding FFr5.20 to FFr229.70 with a heavy 258,630 shares traded. The stock has made a steady recovery from its unsuccessful flotation in December last year. FRANKFURT remained subdued, the DAX index closing 4.59 higher at 1,681.07 after a 1.10 decline to 685.61 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume was unchanged at DM4.4bn. Among blue chips there was support for Siemens, up DM4.70 to DM668, and for Volkswagen which reported that its January global car and van sales were up 2.3 per cent to a record high. VW shares rose DM2.50 to DM338.30. Construction stocks were mostly weaker in spite of an industry association forecast of 15 per cent growth in construction volume in east Germany this year, against 2 per cent in the west. Hochtief fell DM18 to DM1,162 but observers said that the setback was technical, with dealers getting out of the sector after a period of relative strength. Second-liners saw Ava up DM61 to DM751 on new rumours of buying by Asko, which confirmed last week that it held an Ava majority. Asko rose DM13 to DM747 following an appreciative note from County NatWest. MILAN opened the March trading account on a sour note, failing to rise by the 1 per cent expected at the start of a new account. Dealers said that political uncertainty and fears of a shortfall in financing the public debt this year weighed on the market. The Comit index rose just 1.97 to 533.18 in turnover estimated at L100bn after Friday's L132.2bn. Pirelli, which launched a L520bn capital increase yesterday, rose L6 to L1,116 at the fixing as operators covered their short positions but the stock then fell back to L1,080 after hours. Pirelli rights were settled at L37 but then fell to L27 after hours. Dealers said Pirelli's rights issue was not going well but that this should not affect the market as a whole because take-up of the new shares, priced at L1,000 each, was guaranteed by the underwriting consortium led by Mediobanca. AMSTERDAM drifted, the CBS Tendency index gaining 0.2 to 122.0. Philips shed Fl 0.70 to Fl 32.70, partly on rumours, later denied by the company, that it was considering a rights issue. There is also uncertainty ahead of Thursday's 1991 group figures, with some analysts forecasting a dividend of 50 cents against the last payment of Fl 2.00 in 1989. Fokker moved ahead Fl 1.30 to Fl 30.50 after Friday's announcement that it had won an order to supply a Chinese airline with seven aircraft. MADRID was steady, the general index ending up 0.47 at 259.24 with volume estimated at Pta10bn (Pta12bn). Electricals recorded the most activity. STOCKHOLM recovered from morning losses of over 1 per cent to close with the Affarsvarlden General index 1.9 higher at 940.8, but dealers noted that volume was low and sentiment cautious. Astra B shares closed SKr3 higher at SKr578 ahead of Thursday's results but Volvo B shares fell SKr5 to SKr370 after the company said that the proposed merger with Procordia might still be able to go ahead. HELSINKI recorded its highest level for five months. The HEX Index closed up 3.1 to 905.0 in turnover of FM33.3m, against FM20.2m on Friday. OSLO fell on news of weaker prices for North Sea oil following the Opec ministers meeting in Geneva. The all-share index lost 5.40 to 421.51 in turnover of NKr180m. Hafslund Nycomed, the pharmaceuticals group, shed NKr8 to NKr255 after reports in a medical journal questioned the benefits of one of its products. VIENNA continued its upswing in high turnover. The 18-share ATX index rose 27.44 to 1,094.29, its highest since mid-September last year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 17  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1132.21  1132.68  1132.52  1132.96  1133.46  1134.81  1134.87  1135.65  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Day's High  1135.65    Day's Low  1132.21  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Feb 14    Feb 13    Feb 12    Feb 11    Feb 10   1130.78   1136.68   1136.12   1137.74   1137.68  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

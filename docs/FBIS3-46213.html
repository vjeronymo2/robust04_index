A municipal government official in charge of economy said  that the co-operation will be in the fields of petrochemicals,  metallurgy, complete sets of power generating units,  telecommunications, electronics, tires, computers and bearings.    Shanghai will list 100 key industrial projects, each  scheduled to use over 10 million U.S. dollars, for co-operation  in the forms of joint venture and co-operation.    "This is aimed at helping the city to update its products so  as to better compete in the international market," the official  noted.    While welcoming foreign investment in Shanghai, the  municipal  government will probe for new ways to use foreign capital in the  construction of its second batch of urban infrastructure  facilities, including power-generating units, a subway, the  Pudong International Airport, the outer city ring road and a  garbage treatment plant.    It will co-operate with foreign chain stores in the forms of  joint venture and co-operation and try to set up Sino-foreign  foreign trade, commercial and wholesale companies, and trading  companies with sole foreign investment as well as share-holding  firms.    According to statistics, Shanghai has absorbed a sum of 13  billion U.S. dollars and approved the setting up of more than  6,000 foreign-funded projects. Included are enterprises run by  a total of 126 transnational companies.    One third of the 100 major transnational industrial  corporations have set up subsidiaries in the city.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Court trims EC anti-cartel fines A European court yesterday upheld the bulk of anti-cartel fines imposed on seven chemical companies by the European Commission, which has recently lost several competition cases for sloppy procedure, writes David Buchan in Brussels. The Court of First Instance, which is the European Court of Justice's lower tribunal, was ruling on appeals against fines which the EC executive imposed in 1986 on companies for running a market-sharing cartel in polypropylene between 1977 and 1983. The court reduced the fines on Shell from Ecu9m (Pounds 6.39m) to Ecu8.1m, on ICI from Ecu10m to 9m, and on Huls of Germany from Ecu2.7m to 2.3m, because it said these companies were not part of the cartel for as long as the Commission had claimed. But fines on Hoechst (Ecu9m), Montedipe (Ecu11m), Solvay (Ecu2.5m) and Lindz (Ecu1m) were upheld.</p>

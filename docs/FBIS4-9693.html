			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano for "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli  Rivas has confirmed the appointment of Vice Admiral Radames  Munoz Leon as defense ministry adviser in the United States.  Burelli Rivas explained the post has no diplomatic status. The  appointment was requested by the Defense Ministry.    [Begin recording] [Burelli] It is not a diplomatic post.    [Unidentified reporter] Precisely, but within the Armed  Forces...    [Burelli, interrupting] The Defense Ministry made the  decision, and the Foreign Ministry is not authorized to discuss  this.    [Reporter] If this is not a diplomatic post, why is he being  given a diplomatic passport?    [Burelli] Well, this status is provided when any function is  carried out abroad on behalf of the Venezuelan state, to  facilitate things and provide an advantage during a mission. The  only assistance provided by the Foreign Ministry is the issuance  of a special passport, or a diplomatic passport. [end recording]    As expected, the foreign minister was asked how statements  by  [Lieutenant Colonel Hugo] Chavez, who has said he does not rule  out the possibility of a military coup, would affect the  country's image. The minister minimized these statements and  said the fact that Chavez has joined politics strengthens  Venezuela's democratic position.    The Venezuelan foreign minister declined too much comment on  criticisms surroundeding the recent election of the OAS  secretary general. But Burelli Rivas did say he wants to address  the Congress to explain what happened with regard to Venezuela's  candidate.</p>

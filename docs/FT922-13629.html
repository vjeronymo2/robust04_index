			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Spanish gas deal signed ENAGAS, Spain's state-owned natural gas distributor, will begin importing liquefied natural gas from Nigeria in 1997 under the terms of a 22-year-long agreement worth in excess of Pta200bn (Pounds 1.1bn) that was signed yesterday in Lagos with a consortium formed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Shell, Elf and Agip. The contract, part of a package negotiated by the consortium with Italy's Enel, Cabot of the US and Gaz de France, represents a further step in the diversification and increase of Spain's LNG imports. Enagas, which has traditionally bought from Algeria and Libya, will be receiving Norwegian natural gas through a new trans-Pyrenees pipeline in October next year. Towards the end of the 1990s a second pipeline will supply Spain with LNG from Algeria via Morocco. Spain wants to increase its use of natural gas from 6bn cubic metres a year to 15bn in the year 2000. The agreement specifies that, in an initial phase, Spain will annually ship 1bn cu m of Nigerian LNG for domestic distribution.</p>

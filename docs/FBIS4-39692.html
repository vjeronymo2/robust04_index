			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia and Malaysia intend to continue their talks  on military cooperation, Interfax was informed by Sergey  Chumachenko, head of the Rosvooruzheniye state company's foreign  economic relations department, told Interfax. The company  signed a contract worth 600 million US dollars on June 7 for the  supply of 18 MiG-29 fighter planes to Malaysia.    Chumachenko said that the two countries would, "after a  short  breather," continue talks on a broad range of issues, which  could include upgrading Malaysia's navy.    He denied that Moscow had sold the fighters on the cheap. He  said representatives from the Dementiyev Aviation and Industrial  Association, which manufactures the aircraft, had been present  at the talks and when the contract was signed and they would  hardly have agreed to under-price their own products.    The contract with Malaysia also provides for the supply of  facilities to service the aircraft before the end of the year,  training for staff, and spare parts both during and after the  guarantee period runs out. Approximately 75 pct of the total  cost of the contract will be paid off in hard currency, and the  remainder in supplies of palm-oil for sale by Moscow to other  countries.    Rosvooruzhheniye, Russia's leading exporter and importer of  arms and military hardware, was set up at the end of last year  after a decree by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.</p>

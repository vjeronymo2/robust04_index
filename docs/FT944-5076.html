			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Israel to launch satellite in 1995 Spacecom, an Israeli company, has announced plans to launch a Dollars 250m communications satellite called Amos 1 before the end of next year. The satellite will provide direct broadcasts into homes. Amos 1 will immediately compete against the outdated Saudi-backed Arabsat which is due to be replaced in 1996. Mr Shlomo Tirosh, Spacecom chief executive officer, said Amos 1 would be able to relay video, voice and data services from Iran to Libya but would concentrate on Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Gulf. The new satellite will beam to customers equipped with 60cm dishes and will operate in the KU band which uses transponders more powerful than the previous generation of transmitters. Spacecom will lease segments in Amos's seven transponders to Arab and Israeli customers as well as international clients such as HBO, the pay-TV subsidiary of Time Warner, CNN, the Atlanta-based world TV network and Canal Plus, the French media and pay-TV company, which will directly market their programmes in the Middle East. Spacecom is a joint venture between Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), one of Israel's largest companies, and three other Israeli companies, Gilat Communications Engineering, C Mer, a telecommunications company and GSSC, a satellite venture. The lightweight-class satellite will be launched by a French-made Ariane rocket and will stay in orbit for 10 to 11 years. It was manufactured by IAI with Deutsche Aerospace and Alcatel. Amos 1 will also seek telecommunications business and provide data, voice and oral telephone on the VSAT (very small aperture terminal) market, which is being used increasingly to provide two-way communications in the US and Europe. Mr Noam Fink, Spacecom operating officer, said Gilat would eventually transfer its services including data broadcasting to Amos 1. Among the services currently provided by the company are distribution of financial information and satellite services for paging companies.</p>

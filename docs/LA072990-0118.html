			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CANYON'S FATE: LEAVE IT TO THE VOTERS  </P> <P> Congratulations on your editorial "The Canyon's Fate Is Up to the Voters" (July  8).  </P> <P> I could not agree more with your conclusion that "it all comes down to money."  </P> <P> I sincerely hope the residents of Laguna Beach can learn a lesson from San Juan  Capistrano.  </P> <P> In my opinion, the residents of San Juan Capistrano gave the rest of Orange  County a (somewhat overlooked) lesson this past April 10. By an overwhelming  majority (71%), our residents voted to tax themselves to acquire approximately  140 acres of open space and farmland.  </P> <P> Why? Because they wanted to preserve a certain, quantifiable quality of life,  prevent the development of these areas and create play fields and a community  center for both present and future generations. It would have been easy to vote  "no." It took vision, courage and a true sense of community to say "yes."  </P> <P> We do not live in a world where "someone else" will solve our problems. The  federal, state and county governments do not have the money.  </P> <P> We have all chosen to live in a very popular area of the world. That choice has  also brought public responsibilities along with our jobs, homes and wonderful  climate.  </P> <P> One of these burdens is to collectively invest in the future of Orange County  and, from time to time, in our own communities.  </P> <P> GARY L. HAUSDORFER  </P> <P> Mayor San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "rwue": "Issing: The Tanker Sets Course"] </F>   [Text] Frankfurt, 28 December -- Bundesbank Directorate  member and chief economist Professor Otmar Issing said in an  interview with this newspaper that everything indicates that  next year we will take a large step forward toward reducing the  rate of inflation. In the meantime, a two will appear before  the decimal point in the current rate. Such a favorable figure  will, however, not be the rule.    The Bundesbank's inflation projections are based on the  assumption that the oil price will not increase considerably.  Nothing indicates at this point that it will. In addition to  the oil price, the exchange rate constitutes another short-term  factor of uncertainty. If no problems emerge here, further  progress on the inflation front is likely, because wage policy  in particular is currently moving in the right direction, says  the Bundesbank chief economist.    Issing compared the German national economy with a large  unwieldy tanker that needs a lot of time to change course. In  1991, the tanker moved in the totally wrong direction. With  business and industry booming, the problems that were known at  that time were not reflected in the pay settlements. As a  result of German unity, the labor-capital ratio has dramatically  changed in favor of the factor of capital. Acting against  economic realities will, in particular, be punished with higher  unemployment. In 1992, the corrections made were also  inadequate. Meanwhile, the groups involved in the economic  process have recognized the symptoms of our times. Corrections  are being made everywhere. So the tanker has set course. The  upcoming pay negotiations for civil servants will have a  signalling effect.  <H5>  Additional Wage Costs! </H5>   In view of the costs involved of approximately 80 percent,  one should not speak about ancillary wage costs but about  additional wage costs, said Issing. The Bundesbank already uses  this more accurate term in its monthly reports. Given the high  additional costs, nothing can be expected over the short term.  On the contrary, in addition to an increase in old age pension  contributions, there is a possibility of nursing care insurance.  All sides concerned must be deeply aware that the introduction  of the nursing care insurance means that the end of the pole has  been reached for this decade. Regarding burdens through  additional wage costs, the other direction must be pursued again.  <H5>  Stabilizing Services </H5>   According to Issing, the cycle has probably reached the  nadir. The service sector is increasingly gaining in importance  as a stabilizing factor. In certain industrial branches,  however, the picture is still very gloomy. In interpreting the  current economic data, one should not exaggerate. In many  cases, a number of positive signals are interspersed with  negative ones. For instance, retail trade sales declined in  October. Export orders increased, whereas inland orders  decreased. Above all, the German labor market will show a  downturn for quite a while.    The Bundesbank will continue to keep to its  potential-oriented money-supply policy, which has an implicitly  stabilizing effect. With a weak economic cycle, a policy that is  oriented toward the growth of the potential will always lead to  a good money supply. However, when capacities are fully used,  the lack of money will have a decelerating effect -- especially  on the price level. The Bundesbank assumes that high investment  activities in eastern Germany will continue in 1994. This will  also clearly increase the potential of the eastern federal  laender. The Bundesbank is taking the new money supply target  for 1994 seriously. Even though it expected to miss the target,  it also took the planned money supply target for 1993 seriously,  said Issing. Regarding individual interest policy measures, the  considerable credit expansion has always made caution advisable.  The Bundesbank's money supply policy has above all proved  successful in difficult times. With a decrease from clearly over  7 percent to 6.8 percent in October, it seemed that M3 was  moving along the right track. However, the November result, with  a plus of 7.2 percent on an annual basis, was a flash in the pan.  <H5>  Revival of Savings Bank Books </H5>   Among all the factors influencing M3, credit expansion,  which  has been unusually high for a recession, plays the most  important role. This credit expansion is above all attributable  to subsidized credits for eastern Germany and credits for  housing construction. In addition, the development of savings  deposits with a three-month term of notice has played a major  part since the summer. Because savings certificates are  virtually dead, owing to the interest yield tax, savings bank  books have become attractive again. Banks have an interest in  keeping savers, above all with a view to Principle II of the  Credit Law. This is being done through savings deposits on  which bonuses are granted.  <H5>  Eastern Europe Increases Circulation of Cash </H5>   The development of the circulation of cash corresponded to  Bundesbank estimates until the summer. Subsequently, it  increased steeply, showing a monthly rate of over 15 percent.  Very many things indicate that this is attributable to an  increased use of the German mark in Central and Eastern Europe.  Presumably the fact that the new German mark notes are more  forgery-proof than the dollar also plays a role. This increase  in the circulation of cash could distort the short-term result;  over the long term, the effect distorts little, because contrary  to the previous indicator -- the Bundesbank money supply -- the  share of the circulation of cash in M3 is rather small.  <H5>  Keeping To M3 </H5>   Without intervention in the European Monetary System [EMS],  there was a swing from October to November of 40 billion German  marks [DM] in the net foreign position. In this respect, it  could have been of importance that national, private, and public  institutions (not the Federal Government) built credit stocks  [Vorratskredite], parked them in the Euro market, and  repatriated them in November. This example shows the close  substitute relationship between Euro deposits and M3 in the  traditional delimitation. However, the Bundesbank notes that M3  expanded is inferior to M3. This is, however, a point where  every money supply delimitation has become more sensitive.  <H5>  Breach in the System </H5>   Because the Federal Government is no longer obliged to  deposit funds with the Bundesbank, there will be a new situation  regarding the M3 system next year. Since the federal assets,  which so far have not formed part of the money supply, will now  be invested in the money market, there will be a basic effect of  half a percentage point with M3. Statistically, it can be  easily coped with. However, M3 monthly rates could be influenced  by the Federal Government's way of acting. The question above  all is what the Federal Government will, in the future, be doing  with its cash funds. The Bundesbank will watch M3 in its  traditional delimitation and M3 including Federal Government  assets. Many factors make it advisable to keep federal assets  out of M3. The Bundesbank will deal with this problem in its  monthly report of January. Issing said that this is a technical  rather than a monetary policy problem.</p>

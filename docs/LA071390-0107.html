			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> L.A. MODERN DANCERS TO DEBUT IN S.D.  </P> <P> Variety is the byword of Los Angeles-based Pacific Dance Ensemble, one of the  few repertory companies in modern dance today.  </P> <P> The thematic range of the four dances the troupe is packaging for its San Diego  debut this weekend runs from the boy-meets-girl romanticism of "Full Circle" to  the primordial ritualism of "Crow" to the hybrid style of "A Wrinkle in Space."  </P> <P> The company even delves into the recesses of the human mind (albeit with a  comic perspective) in "The Curse of ESP," the closing work on the mixed bag  scheduled for 8:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at Three's Company's Hillcrest  studio.  </P> <P> "Diversity has been sort of the color of the company since we started two years  ago," said artistic director Danielle Shapiro, by phone from her Los Angeles  studio. "We have 11 works in our repertory, and they're generally by younger  choreographers. I'm trying to support artists by commissioning works."  </P> <P> Unlike most modern dance company directors, Shapiro has no designs on creating  her own dances. She prefers to leave the dance-making to kindred spirits.  </P> <P> "I find people I really like, and then I commission new works from them. I try  to balance each program with dark and light pieces, but, when I premiere,  sometimes it's hard to know what I'm going to get. What we're really trying to  do is reach out to a broader audience than just dance (buffs). We like to work  with musicians and sculptors."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, Three's Company's space is too bare-bones for such elaborate  productions. As a result, local aficionados will have to settle for the  obligatory canned music and no-frills decor that has become the mainstay of  Lo-Tec concerts for years.  </P> <P> Otherwise, nothing about this weekend's concert would look familiar -- not the  dancers, not the choreography.  </P> <P> A "ballet-poem," conceived and directed by Dusan Bogdanovic and Gilberte  Meunier, was the impetus for the mythological-based "Crow." This abstract  dance, which attempts to evoke "the animal, human, and god-like facets of the  crow," will feature the full 10-member troupe, and an original score by  Bogdanovic.  </P> <P> In Young-Ae Park's "A Wrinkle in Space," mundane movement, modern dance and  ballet all take on a surreal quality, while Lisbeth Davidow's "Full Circle"  follows a man and woman through the cycles of a relationship.  </P> <P> "The Curse of ESP" is a collaborative effort with choreography and text by Karl  Schaffer and Erik Stern.  </P> <P> "Modern dance repertory companies are not the in-thing now," said lo-tec  organizer Jean Isaacs, artistic director of Three's Company. "Most modern dance  companies are the vision of their artistic directors.  </P> <P> "But this troupe gives us a chance to see a lot of modern dance. That's why I  started these lo-tecs in the first place -- so I could get to see modern dance  that would never be performed here otherwise."  </P></p>

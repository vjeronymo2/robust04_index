			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICIAN WATCH;  </P> <P> STINGING MESSAGE  </P> <P> Another shock wave is going through Sacramento with the conviction of former  state Sen. Paul Carpenter on charges of racketeering, extortion, conspiracy and  bribery.  </P> <P> Carpenter, a Democrat who represented Orange County before his election to the  State Board of Equalization, follows in the muddied footsteps of state Sen.  Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who was sent to federal prison for selling his  vote to special interests.  </P> <P> Both were targets of an FBI sting that could ensnare other legislators as well.  </P> <P> The political nose dives taken by both men aren't viewed with surprise or even  much regret in the Capitol; both legislators were known for blatantly  pressuring contributors.  </P> <P> What's sobering about their indictments is that they stepped over the line in a  process that all successful politicians must know well: campaign fund-raising.  </P> <P> And money to fuel ever-more-costly elections comes mostly from those who have  something to gain from the Legislature. As a result, elective politics has been  drawn into an ethical quagmire.  </P> <P> Of course, Carpenter is a bad apple. He admitted at the trial that he gave  special "access" to big contributors he didn't give to others. Federal  prosecutors said this was illegal, and jurors agreed.  </P> <P> In June, voters passed Proposition 112, imposing new ethical standards on  legislators and other state officers. That should help define limits for the  necessary evil of campaign fund-raising.  </P> <P> But an even stronger and more sobering message has been sent by Carpenter's  conviction.  </P></p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Rhino advances to Pounds 2m Rhino Group, the fast-growing USM-quoted specialist video and computer games retailer, yesterday reported a sharp increase in full year profits boosted by acquisitions and strong organic growth. Pre-tax profits for the group, which acquired 30 Virgin Games Stores for Pounds 12.5m from Richard Branson's Virgin Group and WH Smith in November and now has 77 stores in the UK and Ireland, jumped to Pounds 2.03m in 1993 from just Pounds 154,000 last time, on sales of Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 4.81m). Basic earnings per share increased to 2.49p (0.39p), equivalent to 2.33p on a fully diluted basis, and an initial 0.5p final dividend is proposed. The Virgin Games Stores deal, funded through a 5-for-9 rights issue priced at 44p, has enabled the group to accelerate its own development plans which set a target of 130 stores in three years. Commenting on the outlook Mr Bev Ripley, chairman, said; 'Our plan is well under way to open a further 40 Future Zone stores in 1994. The board is confident we will have another excellent trading year'. Last year the group pursued an aggressive opening programme increasing the number of Future Zone stores from 5 at the start of 1993 to 47 stores by Christmas. Despite gloomy comments from some high street traders about video game sales in the run-up to Christmas, Mr Ripley said Future Zone's like-for-like sales were up about 20 per cent. He said there has been a substantial shift in market share away from non-specialist retailers to Future Zone and other specialists, 'who have increasing competitive advantages as the product range becomes more complex'. After climbing to a peak of 67p in December, Rhino's shares had slipped back to trade under 40p in recent weeks. Yesterday they closed up 5p at 43p.</p>

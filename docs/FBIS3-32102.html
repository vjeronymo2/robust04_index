			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ericka Ramirez from the "National" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta pointed out  that the National Police are capable of ensuring unrestrained  traffic and will provide all necessary protection to every  transportation sector worker who decides to continue providing  service to the community.    Minister Mendieta added that the National Transportation  Commission [CNT] must honor agreements signed between the  government and the various transportation chambers and  federations. Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta indicated that  the National Police will work toward completely normalizing the  capital city. As an example of regions where unrest persists,  the government minister pointed toward Rubenia, Ciudad Sandino,  and, as of today, the Metro Center sector where the interference  of Tomas Borge, FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Force]  National Board member, has been proven.    [Begin Mendieta recording] I believe that since it was Mr.  Borge himself who pointed to the need for a demonstration, such  as the one that took place today and which was supported by  Sandinist groups, he should then also guarantee, just as I  personally requested, that there will be no further protests  such as those that have been occurring. Therefore, I believe  that if he is willing to defend the demands of these groups,  then he must also be willing to prevent these groups from  overstepping boundaries established by the law. [end recording]    Mendieta confirmed having confiscated weapons from the  transportation sector workers currently supporting the strike.    [Begin Mendieta recording] This morning we seized several  weapons and arrested several people. We know they are also  using some type of homemade mortar. The police have very  specific information on this issue. We hope they do not attempt  to use these weapons and that we can end this situation without  further problems. [end recording] [passage omitted]    The government minister indicated that CNT spokesman Gustavo  Aguiluz could face charges because of his constant calls to  violence, thus threatening citizens' safety.    [Begin Mendieta recording] If necessary, he will have to  answer for that decision to the courts. I also understand that  some of the persons who were directly mentioned by Mr. Aguiluz  are preparing to file lawsuits against him, forcing him to prove  the charges he made. [end recording]    The National Police have coordinated security measures for  the members of the federations and chambers who are still  operating in order to guarantee their safety and security.    [Begin Mendieta recording] We are in a position to guarantee  the free movement of their vehicles and the assurance that their  offices will be secure. I would like to be absolutely clear in  stating that we are going to act as forcefully as the law allows  to prevent any attempts against these persons just because they  decided to sign an agreement with the government. The  government is not going to take any steps beyond these  agreements; on the contrary, I repeat, the CNT must abide by  these commitments. [end recording]    Public order will be diligently guarded by the state's  security organizations.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTS LOBBY FOR CORNER TO EXPAND STUDIO CITY LIBRARY  </P> <P> Studio City residents lobbied the Los Angeles Board of Library Commissioners on  Thursday to buy a vacant corner for future expansion of the community's branch  library and its parking lot.  </P> <P> The Studio City Library, 4400 Babcock Ave., is crowded by at least 58,000 books  -- more than twice its intended capacity -- and its 19-space parking lot is  usually full, said Gerald A. Kurland of the Studio City Residents Assn.  </P> <P> When a gasoline station next door was torn down earlier this year, Kurland said  library patrons began wondering if the land could be purchased to ease the  crowding.  </P> <P> Conversations with the property owner were encouraging, he told the library  board Thursday. "But any day he could change his mind. We need to act swiftly."  </P> <P> Commissioners offered the residents little encouragement. They asked the  board's staff to review the proposal, but said long-term plans adopted last  year call for moving the branch to a commercial location.  </P> <P> In general, library board members believe that small branch libraries fare  better in commercial centers, where there is better security and more parking,  said board Vice President Sanford P. Paris.  </P> <P> "We find that we get more use out of libraries in a commercial facility, where  parents can come, drop off the kids . . . and do other things with one parking  stop," Paris said.  </P> <P> Also, money for land purchases and library expansion is short because older  libraries that need earthquake strengthening have funding priority, he said.  </P> <P> Far from being discouraged, Kurland said after the meeting that the residents  -- who have letters of support from Councilmen Michael Woo and Joel Wachs, who  represent the area -- plan to take the issue to the City Council.  </P> <P> They already have 1,150 signatures on a petition endorsing the idea. Kurland  and Fred Gaines, representing Friends of the Studio City Library, said they  would continue distributing the petition and contacting community  organizations, including the Parent-Teacher-Student associations at local  schools.  </P> <P> "We need to get the kids involved," Kurland said. "They really feel the impact  probably most of all."  </P></p>

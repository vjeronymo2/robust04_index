Chang Si-pom, secretary of the party committee of the State  Commission of Light Industry, said that the New Year address of  the respected leader President Kim Il-song is a militant banner  which indicates the path of leading the cause of socialism, the  cause of chuche, from one victory to another under the  fast-changing situation.    Noting that the New Year address powerfully inspired the  party members and other officials of the commission responsible  for the development of the nation's light industry, he said:  "We will conduct the party work in a fresh and ambitious manner  as demanded by the chuche-based theory and method of party work  so as to make a positive contribution to carrying into a  brilliant reality the far-reaching plans and intentions of  President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il."    Kim Pong-chu, chairman of the Anak County, South Hwanghae  Province, Cooperative Farm Management Committee, had this to say:    "The great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year  address put forward a militant task to consolidate the successes  achieved in the irrigation and electrification of the rural  areas, raise the level of mechanization and application of  chemicals, implement the chuche farming method thoroughly and  thus boost grain and all other agricultural production this  year, a meaningful year which will mark the 30th anniversary of  the publishing of the socialist rural theses.    "Our county will produce 50,000 more tons of grain than last  year by cultivating crops as required by the chuche farming  method."    Han Chang-kon, vice-chairman of the State Commission of the  Electric Power Industry, said:    "It is a task before the officials and working people of our  electric power industry to strongly support the party's  strategic agriculture-first, light-industry-first and foreign  trade-first policy with an increased production of power.    "We officials of power industry will launch a powerful  production drive, giving precedence to the political work in  accordance with the requirements of the Taean work system and  thus make a better contribution to making the party's  revolutionary economic strategy bear fine fruits."</p>

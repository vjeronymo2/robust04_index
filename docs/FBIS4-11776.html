			<p>BFN     [Text] Gonaveh (Bushehr), March 31, IRNA -- Scores of Iraqi  families have been made homeless as a result of the Iraqi  regime's fresh offensives on the southern marshlands, reported  reliable sources here today.    According to the fresh arrivals, the people in the Iraqi  marshlands especially the women and children, are suffering  through shortage of foodstuffs and medicine.    The radio "Voice of Iraqi People," operating from somewhere  inside Iraq, reported today that scores of refuge families in  al-Basrah, Nasiriyah and al-Amarah have left their homes for  safe havens, near the Iranian borders in the southeast.    The Iraqi Arabs betrayed by the U.S. and its coalition  forces  which incited them against Saddam Husayn and then deserted them  in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, have been  subject to rigorous economic sanctions.    The Iraqi regime launches periodical attacks on the  southerners and other opponents in the central and northern  parts.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Redrow plans listing to fund expansion Redrow, which claims to be Britain's biggest private housebuilder, yesterday announced plans for a stock market listing. The company is expected to be valued at about Pounds 350m under the flotation, which is likely to involve the issue of about Pounds 50m of new shares. Mr Steve Morgan, the founder, is expected to raise a further Pounds 100m by selling part of his 98 per cent stake. Mr Morgan, who started the company in 1974 when he was 21, is expected to be left with just over 50 per cent of the shares following the transactions. Originally the company's activities were mainly in north-west England. They have spread to Yorkshire, east Midlands, south Wales and south-west England. Last year it acquired Costain's former housebuilding business in south-east Emgland in a deal worth up to Pounds 24m. The money raised will be used to acquire land and finance expansion. Some 2,000 homes are expected to have been sold in the year to June 30. During the six months to the end of December, Redrow increased pre-tax profits by 81 per cent to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 6.8m) on turnover of Pounds 104m (Pounds 64.3m). The number of homes sold in the period rose by 81 per cent from 636 to 1,153. Profits included a Pounds 1m gain from the sale of its 12.7 per cent stake in Bellwinch, a rival housebuilder. The company traditionally does better in the first half. Even so it should be capable of producing pre-tax profits of approaching Pounds 20m for the full year. This would compare with Pounds 13.3m in 1992-94 and a peak of Pounds 16.3m in 1989-90. Annual output in the medium term is likely to be lifted to about 3,500 homes. The landbank of 6,700 plots with planning permission will need to increase as the business expands. The average purchase price of each plot is Pounds 11,400, equivalent to 13.5 per cent of the current average selling price of a Redrow home. This was Pounds 80,000 in the first half, but is expected to be nearer Pounds 90,000 in the next financial year as the former Costain first-time buyer business is moved up-market. Net debt of Pounds 13.8m at the end of December represented 21 per cent of capital reserves of Pounds 65.1m. Barclays de Zoete Wedd is organising the issue, Cazenove is acting as broker.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva January 13 TASS -- The expectations that the  second round of Georgian-Abkhazian talks in Geneva would be  promptly completed have not been justified. The U.N. Secretary  General's special envoy Eduard Brunner, who chairs over the  meeting, had to cancel a news conference scheduled for Wednesday  since the discussion dragged out.    The consultations arranged under the U.N. auspices are  attended by a Russian delegation headed by Deputy Foreign  Minister Boris Pastukhov. Both Brunner and Pastukhov, who are  working in close cooperation, face considerable difficulties in  mediating the talks.    TASS learnt from sources close to the participants in the  meeting that the Georgian and Abkhazian negotiating teams had  put forth a number of proposals and specifications concerning  the final document, which is to reflect the key problems of the  conflict settlement, specifically deployment of peace-keeping  forces. The two sides also expect to draw up a special  agreement on refugees. One of the options under consideration  calls for creating conditions for their return originally to  Abkhazia's one area only (most probably the Gali district).  This issue is to be solved with the participation of experts  from the U.N. High Commissionnair for Refugees' office.    Members of the negotiating teams told TASS that the  discussion was of a constructive and businesslike character.  However, it is not easy to surmount the differences in the two  sides' positions, given that such critical problem as Abkhazia's  future political status has not yet been solved. To all  appearances, this issue is unlikely to be settled during the  present round of talks. It is to be addressed by Georgian and  Abkhazian experts who are expected to meet in Moscow on February  8.</p>

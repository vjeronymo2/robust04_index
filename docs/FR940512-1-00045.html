			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Clarity of the Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are easy to understand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary invites comments on how to make these proposed regulations easier to understand, including answers to questions such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the proposed regulations clearly stated?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Do the regulations contain technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Does the format of the regulations (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity? Would the regulations be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section'' is preceded by the symbol ``&sect;'' and a numbered heading; for example, &sect;364.10.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Is the description of the regulations in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this preamble helpful in understanding the regulations? How could this description be more helpful in making the regulations easier to understand?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) What else could the Department do to make the regulations easier to understand?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of any comments that concern how the Department could make these proposed regulations easier to understand should be sent to Stanley M. Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW. (room 5125, FOB&hyph;6), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;2241.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The small entities that would be affected by these proposed regulations are centers receiving Federal funds under these programs. However, the regulations would not have a significant economic impact on the centers affected because the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 364.10, 364.11, 364.12, 364.13, 364.20, 364.21, 364.22, 364.23, 364.24, 364.25, 364.26, 364.27, 364.28, 364.29, 364.30, 364.31, 364.32, 364.33, 364.34, 364.35, 364.36, 364.37, 364.38, 364.39, 364.40, 364.41, 364.42, 364.43, 364.51, 364.52, 364.53, 365.2, 365.10, 365.30, 365.31, 366.2, 366.12, 366.15, 366.21, 366.22, 366.23, 366.24, 366.25, 366.27, 366.28, 366.29, 366.32, 366.33, 366.37, 366.38, 366.39, 366.40, 366.41, 366.42, 366.43, 366.44, 366.45, 366.50, 367.10, 367.11, 367.22, 367.31, 367.32, and 367.42 contain information collection requirements.

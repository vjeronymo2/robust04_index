			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Public Participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of interested parties provided comments on EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> March 1, 1991 NPRM. These comments and other documents relevant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the development of this final rule are contained in the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> docket. The Agency has fully considered these comments in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing today's final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following section presents a brief summary of the major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments received on the NPRM and EPA's responses to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments. A separate and more detailed Summary and Analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments on the NPRM has been prepared and is contained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public docket. The interested reader is referred to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document for a more complete discussion of the comments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including some of the more minor concerns that have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated, but are not presented here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Options To Include Alternative-Fueled Automobiles in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fuel Economy Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of the Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposed to establish the CAFE incentive mechanism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (credit calculation procedures) provided by the AMFA for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methanol, ethanol, and natural gas-fueled automobiles in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. EPA also proposed fuel economy measurement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for methanol-fueled automobiles. The current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that fuel economy data vehicles be covered by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate demonstrating compliance with emission standards was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed to be revised so that it applies only when the vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are subject to emission standards. The Agency requested comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on how test procedures for alternative-fueled vehicles other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methanol could be promulgated on a timely basis, and whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are any alternative fuels other than those addressed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative Motor Fuels Act, that could be included in the CAFE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program in a manner consistent with the need of the nation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conserve energy. More specifically, EPA requested comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether the Agency would have good cause to dispense with prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice and comment (i.e., direct final rule), if necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgate test procedures in time for manufacturers to obtain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits for vehicles designed to run on alternative fuels not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already covered by established test procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association (MVMA) agreed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the proposal to revise the current requirements so that fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy data vehicles be covered by a certificate of conformity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only when such vehicles are subject to emission standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Atlantic Richfield Co. (ARCO) took issue with this proposal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stating that equal treatment is preferred for all the fuels, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that fuel economy determinations should be made on vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting emission standards both for gasoline and any alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuels considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of comments were received regarding the importance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a level playing field for alternative fuels and that a lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal regulations may impede the development of alternative-fueled vehicles. Particularly, a number of commenters urged that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the establishment of emission standards and fuel economy test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for natural gas vehicles not be delayed. Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were also received recommending that a timetable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of ethanol-fueled automobile standards and test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures be established as this technology develops. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer further commented that it is working on electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles and urged the EPA to work with the Department of Energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to establish a CAFE credit mechanism for electric vehicles. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Northeast Sustainable Energy Association (NESEA) expressed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they were very concerned that the proposed amendments did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address electric vehicles and that electric-powered vehicles and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric dual-fueled vehicles should be included in fuel economy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. The NESEA also encouraged EPA to pursue emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for solar, hydrogen, and electric powered automobiles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ARCO stressed that gasoline reformulations should be included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when working toward a level playing field for alternative fuels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters recommended that California's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing alternative-fueled vehicle test procedures could be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to generate fuel economy data until federal regulations are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments were received in response to EPA's request for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on a direct final rule type approach. Ford stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers should be allowed to comment on both test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures and standards before they are finalized. Ford  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that EPA schedule workshops to discuss proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking, which would be advantageous in allowing manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and EPA to raise questions and concerns before test procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are published. The Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition (NGVC) believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that sufficient ``good cause'' exists for EPA to take immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action to establish emission standards and procedures for natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas vehicles based on California's standards and procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA recognizes ARCO's concern that fuel economy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations be made on vehicles meeting emission standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both for gasoline and alternative fuels. EPA has promulgated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards and test procedures for methanol-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles and is currently developing standards for gaseous-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (CNG and LPG) vehicles. In addition, EPA will continue to assess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the need to develop emission standards for other alternative-fueled vehicles. However, in the event that emission standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not developed and promulgated for alternative-fueled vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by the AMFA before a manufacturer produces and enters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such vehicles into commerce, the current regulations that require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that fuel economy data vehicles be covered by a certificate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrating compliance with emission standards would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide a mechanism for obtaining CAFE credit. Therefore, EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revising the current regulation so that it applies only where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles are subject to emission standards. This will serve as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an interim policy to ensure that manufacturers receive the CAFE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit provided by the AMFA for natural gas-fueled vehicles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ethanol-fueled vehicles and other alternative-fueled vehicles in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the event that such vehicles are entered into commerce before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards are promulgated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA agrees with the comments received regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importance of a level playing field for the alternative fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by the AMFA as well as other promising alternative fuels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of EPA is to establish emission standards for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative-fueled vehicle design before such vehicles are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercially produced or, at the latest, before their sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume could significantly impact a manufacturer's CAFE. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed previously, the EPA has promulgated emission standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and test procedures for methanol-fueled vehicles and is currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing emission standards and test procedures for natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas-fueled vehicles. The notice of proposed rulemaking for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards and emission test procedures as well as fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy calculation procedures for natural gas-fueled vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was published on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52912). EPA expects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this rule will be finalized in advance of the completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1993 model year annual production period after which CAFE for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1993 model year is calculated, thereby allowing manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to obtain CAFE credits for 1993 model year and later natural gas-fueled vehicles. In the event that this rulemaking cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgated in time, EPA will expect to finalize those portions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding fuel economy test and calculation procedures in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure fuel economy credits are available for 1993 model year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural gas-fueled vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is currently developing a timeline for the development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of emission standards and test procedures for ethanol-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles. In the event that manufacturers introduce ethanol-fueled vehicles into commerce before federal fuel economy test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures are established, EPA will consider proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California test procedures or procedures similar thereto and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel economy equation to ensure that a mechanism is in place for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ethanol-fueled vehicle CAFE credit as soon as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Sterling fall forces shift in Ford pricing FORD, the leader of the UK new car market, announced price changes across its whole range yesterday in response both to continuing weak sales and the recent devaluation of the pound. It is increasing the price of its main imported models but cutting the prices of a large part of its UK-built cars. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, was gloomy about the development of UK new car sales, which he forecast would total no more than 1.55m this year compared with 1.59m last year and 2.3m in the peak year of 1989. He said: 'There is still no sign of any significant upturn in demand, and I do not believe we can expect any real growth before the second half of 1994, as the impact of interest rate cuts and the devaluation work their way through the economy.' While overall new car sales have fallen by 2.6 per cent in the first nine months of the year, retail sales had dropped by 7 per cent, Mr McAllister said in a speech at the opening of the British motor show in Birmingham. Fleet sales had 'remained remarkably resilient' with a rise of 4 per cent. Ford announced an order for 18,800 light commercial vehicles from BT, the UK telecommunications company, worth Pounds 220m at showroom prices, the biggest van order it has had in the UK. The actual value of the order would be much lower, however, taking into account the large discount available to fleet customers, which can be as much as 30 per cent or more on large contracts. The BT order is for 8,300 Transit vans and chassis cabs, 9,000 Escort and 1,500 Fiesta vans. In spite of the BT contracts, Ford has increased short-time working at its Transit van plant at Southampton in the face of the continuing weakness of demand. Ford's Halewood and Dagenham car assembly plants are effectively working three-day weeks throughout October. The confusion over car prices in the UK was intensified by Ford's announcement of price cuts of up to Pounds 520 on some of its Escort/Orion models and up to Pounds 955 on some of its Fiesta models, only two months after announcing a general price increase of 1.8 per cent across its range in mid August. Ford has been forced to increase the prices of its main imported models, the Sierra, made in Belgium, and the Granada Scorpio, made in Germany, by an average of 2 per cent as a 'first response' to the 15 per cent devaluation of the pound. Ford said it was developing an inexpensive device to summon emergency assistance from inside a car, also to track a stolen vehicle, based on a satellite navigation system.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Letter: Cadbury not looking to boost earnings Sir, You report that research shows the latest innovations in corporate governance have had little effect in improving the performance of British business ('Governance changes not productive', April 22.). Sadly, it seems there is no correlation between earnings per share and the number of non-executives on British boards. Would that we could find a simple ratio and all would be well. The research is rather misplaced, however. The purpose of good corporate governance is to ensure the accountability of directors to their shareholders, who by turn have responsibilities as the owners of large sectors of the economy in which employees and wider society have an interest. The Cadbury Committee was not looking to boost earnings per share, but to re-establish confidence in a governance process that was open to abuse. It sets out advice to ensure that power is not concentrated, that checks and balances exist within board structures, that proper procedures for financial reporting are established. Each should contribute to high standards of administration in public companies and meet the goal of accountability expected by shareholders. Perhaps corporate governance standards should be regarded as an intangible asset, rather than a short-term drive towards cash earning. Our research shows that half of FT-SE 100 companies still withhold key executives from retirement by rotation and only in rare exceptions are shareholder proxy votes reported. It is still hard going on corporate governance issues in the UK. Cadbury should not be set up as a straw man for a separate set of problems in business - its fascination with short-term financial results - when the key challenges facing business are long term.

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Treasury - masterminding the UK's decline Sir, So we are told that an influential committee of MPs is recommending that the Post Office should be free to raise money outside the public sector borrowing requirement to help it compete ('MPs urge more access to funds for Post Office', March 18). At the same time the Cabinet is reportedly deadlocked on a leasing deal that would provide London Transport's Northern Line with badly needed new rolling stock, with the chief secretary insisting that it would be a flagrant breach of public borrowing rules. We hear also the armed services are considering leasing vehicles in order to save money, although doubtless the rules will be broken. I thought the Ryrie rules were dead, and that the prime minister, when in a previous post, claimed to have done away with many of the restrictions that blur public/private sector investment decision-making to the country's disadvantage. Or do we have to wait for Sir Alastair Morton's committee to come up with miracles? No, the truth of the matter is that even if they do produce some good ideas Treasury orthodoxy will see them off. Even were there are good infrastructure projects that earn a decent rate of return they fail to go forward because of the dear old public sector borrowing requirement, and our inexorable decline goes on, masterminded by the Treasury. And these are the guys who got us into and out of the exchange rate mechanism, achieving the proud feat of bad timing on both occasions, and who have consistently mis-managed interest rates and exchange rates in both good times and bad. I would like to support Sir John Banham's reported view that the Treasury should be abolished as part of a drive to re-focus policy making ('Banham calls for Treasury abolition', March 21).

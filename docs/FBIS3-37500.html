The document confirms that Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy  Churkin, special envoy of the Russian president at the talks on  the settlement of the Yugoslav conflict, has managed to get the  Bosnian Serbs' consent to withdraw their heavy weapons from  Sarajevo. The message also states readiness to deploy a Russian  UN contingent, currently in the conflict zone, in the Bosnian  capital.    According to sources close to the Italian Government, Rome  expressed great interest in Boris Yeltsin's message. In  particular, Russia's efforts aimed at achieving guarantees for  the demilitarization of the zone around Sarajevo and putting it  under international monitoring received high appreciation.</p>

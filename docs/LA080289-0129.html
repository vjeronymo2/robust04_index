			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> PROSPECT FOR JAPAN LEADER EMERGES  </P> <P> A former education minister who served a reform-minded government in the 1970s  emerged today as front-runner in the race to become Japan's next prime  minister.  </P> <P> Toshiki Kaifu became the leading choice to replace Sosuke Uno, who has been in  power only two months, after 78-year-old Toshio Komoto said he would not run  for president of the deeply troubled Liberal Democratic Party.  </P> <P> Kaifu acknowledged receiving about $110,000 in political funds from the Recruit  Co., at the center of the influence-buying scandal that has rocked Japan's  political Establishment. But he said that all the donations had been reported,  and that he had stopped receiving money from the company after the scandal  burst last year.  </P> <P> The Liberal Democrats are to choose a new leader on Tuesday to replace Uno who  was forced to resign in a sex scandal.  </P></p>

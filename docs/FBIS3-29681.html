			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Sa Tong-sok] </F>   [Text] The government yesterday announced a detailed  schedule for the privatization of state-owned corporations and  the sale of shares it holds in already-privatized companies from  this year through 1998. Under the plan, about 7 trillion won of  state shares will be sold to the public through the stock market  or open bidding, the Economic Planning Board [EPB] said. Of the  7 trillion won, the Korea Development Bank holds 1.5 trillion  won worth.    Thirty state-owned corporations will be privatized,  including  the Citizens National Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea, Korea  Housing Bank, Korea Tobacco &amp; Ginseng Corp., Korea  Fertilizer,  Korea Heavy Industries and Construction or Hanjung and National  Textbook Printing Co.    The selling of state stocks is planned for the Korea  Exchange  Bank, Kia Steel, Lucky Metals, Dongbu Chemical, Daewoo  Shipbuilding, Asiana Airlines and Samsung General Chemical. In  addition, 11 companies including Daehan Coal Corp. and Korea  Mining Promotion Corporation will be subject to merges, EPB  officials said.    The privatization plan came in response to President Kim  Yong- sam's call for reforming the state sector late last year.  Kim, who has overseen wide-spread economic reforms since taking  office a year ago, had ordered "major surgery" for poorly  managed state firms.    The EPB said it reached a consensus with the Finance  Ministry  to privatize the Citizens National Bank [CNB] this year by  abolishing the law governing the establishment of the CNB.    Privatization of the Industrial Bank of Korea and Korea  Housing Bank will take place after 1996.    The Korea Tobacco &amp; Ginseng Corp. whose annual sales  amounted  to 2.75 trillion won in 1992 will be privatized in 1998. Its  net profit reached about 274 billion won in the same year.    Industry analysts said the massive privatization plan will  spark cut-throat competition to take over the state corporations  among the chaebol or large business conglomerates as seen in the  hectic battle for the business license for the nation's second  mobile telephone network.    Government officials, however, ruled out the possibility of  special favors for enterprises, saying companies will be subject  to regulations envisaged in the credit control rule and the  antitrust law.    Analysts fingered such corporations as Korea Heavy  Industries  and Construction or Hanjung, Korea Tungsten and Korea Fertilizer  as those which will draw keen attention from the business  community.    Hanjung, emerging from its prolonged business downturn, has  been posting net profits since 1991 and will be privatized in  late 1995. The company, which is engaged in the manufacture of  power generation and industrial facilities, recorded sales of  1.4 trillion won in 1992.    Also at the center of public attention is the Korea Tobacco  &amp;  Ginseng Corp. [KT &amp; G] which monopolizes domestic production  and  distribution of tobacco and ginseng. Analysts say the company  taking over KT &amp; G will gain a stable income source.    The business community says there also are numerous  financial  firms which will be profitable for the companies taking them  over.    Pending privatization and mergers, the government has  ordered  all public firms to freeze recruitment, cut pay-rolls and  drastically reduce various fringe state benefits, such as  interest-free loans to purchase apartment houses and  scholarships for employees' children.</p>

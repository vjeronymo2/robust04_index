			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / CBI looks into company fears over planning THE Confederation of British Industry is to set up a task force to investigate how to speed up and improve the planning system, which many industrialists regard as a handicap to business growth and competitiveness. The group, to be chaired by Mr Ian Prosser, chairman and chief executive of Bass, the brewer, is being organised jointly with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). It will prepare a report for the CBI national conference in November. The initiative will be concerned with strategic planning issues for business development. More immediately, it will contribute to the government's review of the structure, role and functions of local government, which has important implications for the future of the planning system. Land use and the planning system have been of concern to companies for some time and the inquiry will consider the planning implications of road and rail links, the location of plant and buildings and the needs of the extractive industries. Mr Prosser said yesterday: 'Many firms believe that we are faced with planning decision-making which has been overtaken by the mix of requirements of modern life and is ill-suited to business needs in the 1990s and to the development of the internationally competitive transport infrastructure that will be essential in the single European market. 'Our first step will be to identify exactly what the problems are by consulting the CBI's 13 regional councils. RICS views will be taken into account at this stage.' The purpose of the task force, which comprises 20 business leaders and chartered surveyors, is to improve the use of the development planning system and reduce the delays in planning decisions while also securing environmental improvements. At present it can take up to 12 years to plan and build a new road. Of that time, only two to three years are spent on construction. Mr Ted Watts, president of the RICS, said that the economic effects of planning decisions were of great concern to chartered surveyors. He said he was confident that the task force initiative could draft constructive and practical measures designed to help British business to compete more effectively in European and world markets.</p>

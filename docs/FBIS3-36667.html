"No matter what economic and  other agreements may be signed by the executive, they are  difficult to translate into life without a legislative basis  which provides a firm foundation," Shumeyko said in an exclusive  interview with ITAR-TASS.    "This foundation can be created only by the parliaments of  the Commonwealth member states. If we learn to consider  coordination of legislation of all CIS states at IPA sessions,  we shall be able to remove unnecessary barriers hampering the  development of market economies and combine the national  economies of the Commonwealth member states quite soon. I mean  legislation concerning taxes, export/import duties and the  customs union," Vladimir Shumeyko said and added that much work  was lying ahead.    As concerns IPA's political significance, it is also great,  according to the assembly chairman. Interparliamentary  assemblies have long existed in Europe and Asia, he said. Now  an Interparliamentary Assembly has also appeared on the  territory of the former Soviet Union. "It must have a  significant weight in the world because is has brought together  countries which have embarked on the path of democratic  reforms," Shumeyko said. He stressed the need of establishing  contacts with other, older interparliamentary assemblies.</p>

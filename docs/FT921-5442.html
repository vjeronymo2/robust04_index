			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: Keppel posts 22% rise in net profit KEPPEL, the Singapore shipbuilder, yesterday announced a 22 per cent rise in 1991 group net profits to SDollars 144.72m (USDollars 88.2m), up from SDollars 118.20m a year earlier. Turnover rose 20 per cent to SDollars 1.68bn from SDollars 1.4bn on the back of the completion of several large contracts at Ship-repair and Offshore Specialised Shipbuilding, the group's main subsidiary. Keppel benefited in the second half from strong revenue from ship repair, at SDollars 459.6m against SDollars 385.1m. Keppel Bank, the banking and financial services, saw a strong advance, boosted by a newly acquired subsidiary. The group's property activities also had better results. Group operating profit expanded 19 per cent to SDollars 243.4m from SDollars 204.5m. Net interest income increased to SDollars 18.5m from SDollars 15.4m, while associates' contributions lifted pre-tax profits to SDollars 270.7m from SDollars 225.0m. However, attributable profits fell to SDollars 160.8m from SDollars 181.2m due to lower extraordinary gains. With large contracts in hand and demand for most of the group's services remaining strong, Keppel expects to maintain the 1991 level of operating results, although the business environment may be somewhat uncertain this year. Keppel will continue to seek opportunities locally but will place greater emphasis on overseas expansion, particularly in the Pacific region. Its operations include a ship repair centre in Singapore, profitable shipyards in the Philippines and a joint venture in India.</p>

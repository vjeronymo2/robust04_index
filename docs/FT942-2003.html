			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Romania moves on new law to return property The Romanian Senate yesterday passed a controversial property law, granting limited restitution rights to former owners of around 250,000 residential properties confiscated after 1945 by the former communist regime. Under the bill, which must be passed by the lower house before becoming law, former owners or their descendants may only claim back properties they still live in as tenants. Those living elsewhere or with more than one confiscated residence can claim cash compensation up to the equivalent of the annual average salary for the past 20 years. Funds for compensation will come from sales to tenants of unclaimed properties. The proposed law will only compensate Romanian citizens resident in the country. Former owners living abroad will have six months in which to return to Romania and register their claims. Centre-right opposition parties, which boycotted the debate and voting on the law, said the bill violated property rights enshrined in the constitution. The National Peasants party, the main opposition grouping, said it would challenge the bill in the constitutional court if, as expected it becomes law. The opposition and former owners' groups say the move favours former communists living in confiscated properties, who under the bill will be able to buy their homes for a fraction of their market value.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (1): Reforms hit turbulence - Poland's ambitious drive to become a prosperous, capitalist democracy has run into political problems. But the country remains basically stable, strategically secure and strongly pro-European. In spite of its economic difficulties, it boasts a dynamic entrepreneurial culture and a lively civil society which is determined to succeed THE UPHILL nature of Poland's struggle to turn itself into a moderately prosperous, tolerably democratic and stable member of the European Community by the end of the decade has been underlined over the past six months by economic retrenchment and political manoeuvering. The goal remains clear. But all winter long Poles lived with a dispiriting government crisis as inexperienced politicians, elected at last October's first free elections since the Second World War, struggled to form a government and draw up a budget consonant with the limited resources of the post-communist state. As feared, the elections, which were conducted on a complex proportional representation system, returned a plethora of parties. In marked contrast to the passionate interest with which Poles participated in the events which led to the end of communist rule in summer 1989, only 42 per cent of the electorate bothered to turn out. The outcome was a confusing and fragmented parliament with 29 parties represented in the Sejm, the 460-seat lower house of parliament. Without a clear mandate from the electorate for any party or leader it was two months before Mr Jan Olszewski, a former Solidarity lawyer representing a right-wing Catholic party, managed to put together a coalition capable of gathering enough support in parliament. He then spent much of his time trying to put together a broad coalition capable of providing a stronger political base for the painful economic sacrifices. Such hopes were dashed last week when Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first post-communist prime minister, and leader of the Democratic Union, the largest single party, said the three opposition parties he represented in the talks would not join the government. This left the government unsure of its ability to push through parliament the cuts in social welfare spending deemed essential to keep the budget on target and restrain inflation. Worse, the blow to Mr Olszewski's government was accompanied by a fierce press attack on President Lech Walesa which underlined the depth of the political crisis facing the country. The attack in Gazeta Wyborcza, whose editor Mr Adam Michnik is a former Solidarity stalwart, accused the president of surrounding himself with advisers linked to the Soviet KGB and being unable to rise to the level of his responsibilities. The tension between President Walesa and most of his former Solidarity allies, including the prime minister whose appointment he opposed, underlines not only the fragility of Poland's post-communist institutions but also the ambiguous relationship between the newly-elected parliament and the president who was elected a year earlier. The unresolved constitutional and political issues, partly inherited from the communist period and partly a product of Mr Walesa's own complex personality and leadership ambitions, have diverted attention from economic and institutional problems and now threaten to aggravate them. The economy is already 'at a crossroads', according to a recent World Bank report. This underlined the deeper rooted structural weaknesses of the public administration, banking, taxation and other structures as well as drawing attention to more immediate budgetary pressures. It warned that hyper-inflation could return without cuts in government spending and faster progress towards the privatisation or closure of inefficient, loss-making state enterprises. Privatising the still largely state- or municipally-owned industrial sector is proving much more difficult than expected. Cutting government spending and closing bankrupt state companies has also been affected by the political atmosphere and doubts over the government's ability to stick to tough economic targets. The result was a fast-rising budget deficit last year which faced the new government with an unavoidable but painful need to cut spending, raise taxes and revert to the tough monetarist policies which most of those who form the newgovernment had critised during the election campaign. The decision to bite the bullet came in mid-March after Mr Andrzej Olechowski, one of Poland's most experienced trade and central bank officials, became finance minister. After a quick visit to Washington for informal talks with the IMF and the World Bank he came back to Warsaw to secure government approval for a revamped budget. This established a limit of 65,500bn zlotys, or 5 per cent of gross domestic product, to the permissible budget deficit. Mr Olechowski is now a key figure in the increasingly shaky government. In effect he has made the deficit limit the principal anchor for economic and financial policy. Domestic consumption will be cut back in favour of an export-led recovery by allowing the zloty to devalue sufficiently to boost export competitiveness and restrain imports. Mr Olechowski's appointment reassured the international institutions whose support is essential for Poland's reform programme. The World Bank, along with other institutions such as its affiliate the International Finance Corporation, has earmarked well over Dollars 2bn for Polish projects. But the bank and the IMF need reassurance that government spending is under control before the IMF agrees to resume payments from its three-year, Dollars 1.7bn extended loan facility. A green light from the IMF, in turn, should open the way for negotiations later this year with the London Club of commercial bank creditors. Here, Poland is seeking a reduction of the Dollars 11bn bank debt similar to the 50 per cent reduction in the Dollars 33bn official debt already agreed last year with the Paris Club. The close attention to Polish events being paid by western institutions reflects the awareness of Poland's strategic importance as the largest of the former Soviet satellites, and the post-communist country which embarked most enthusiastically on market-orientated reform in 1990. Poland's success or failure will have a profound effect on the stability of a region racked by political uncertainty, ethnic strife and economic recession. The omens are better than the present crisis would allow. In spite of the current malaise this ethnically homogeneous country of 38m people remains fundamentally stable. Most Poles are enjoying their regained liberties and recognise that they are infinitely better off than their neighbours in the former Soviet Union. They are also vividly aware of their good fortune in escaping the ethnic tensions which have provoked such bloodshed in Yugoslavia and which threaten the stability of other countries in the region. Ideally Poles would like to be fully-fledged members of Nato and the European Community. But realistically they acknowledge that the collapse of Soviet power and this year's association agreement with the EC have given them greater security and independence than they have enjoyed for decades, if not centuries. Living conditions have also improved substantially for many, in spite of the seemingly catastrophic collapse in state sector output over the past two years. Decades of empty shops are just a bad memory while millions have found new jobs in the most dynamic entrepreneurial culture of post-communist Europe. All this, of course, has been watched enviously by Russian and other reformers. The essence of a country poised between two worlds is well summed up in a joke doing the Warsaw rounds. It tells of two travellers, one from Paris and one from Moscow, who alight by mistake at Warsaw. The traveller from Paris takes one look at the Stalinesque skyscraper and the crumbling buildings and is convinced he has arrived at his final destination. The traveller from Moscow - noting the new western cars, the cheerful new restaurants and fully stocked shops - is convinced he has arrived in Paris.</p>

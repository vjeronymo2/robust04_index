			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BROWNE CONCERT  </P> <P> Regarding Randy Lewis' review of Jackson Browne's "World in Motion" (Calendar,  June 4):  </P> <P> In a world so full of blatant hate, greed and destruction, there are only a few  people willing to open their hands, hearts and/or talents to those in need.  Jackson Browne is one of those rare few who has dedicated his life and,  currently, his career to making a difference. Through his music, Jackson  reaches out, even if only to a group of his admirers, in an effort to spread an  awareness of, and a desire to question, the wars, our leaders and even  ourselves.  </P> <P> Perhaps Jackson's last two albums have more "passionate views on a plethora of  topics" than his prior albums, but they are no less poetic or artistic. "Lives  in the Balance," the title cut off his 1986 album, is an extremely powerful and  well-written song; it did not receive the recognition it deserved. His new  album contains several outstanding songs, including but not limited to "When  the Stone Begins to Turn," "Enough of the Night," and the title cut.  </P> <P> It is uncertain to me why Randy Lewis' review was so critical of a man who --  as another journalist, Steve Hochman, indicated in his Nov. 6 article ("Jackson  Browne, Mr. Benefit") -- professionally has everything to lose with his  politically motivated songs.  </P> <P> JOYCE V.

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Arts: Today's Television There is a hearties/aesthetes split this evening which will be irritating for some. Apart from EastEnders and the news, BBC1 is devoted entirely to the Commonwealth Games starting at 7.00 and continuing until 1.30 in the morning. Scheduled events include the men's and women's 100 metres, with Linford Christie looking for yet another victory, the men's and women's 3000 metres, men's and women's 400 metres, and the men's 110 metres hurdles which will presumably be won by Colin Jackson. Channel 4, however, offers an interesting competitive attraction. After Episode 2 in their repeat of Lipstick On Your Collar (10.00) which was not the best series ever created by the late Dennis Potter, they offer the first full length showing on television of Potter's 1993 Edinburgh Festival lecture (11.10). This was the occasion when he attacked the BBC's top men, Duke Hussey and John Birt, whom he called 'croak-voiced Daleks', and Rupert Murdoch whose very name stuck in his throat. On the occasion of the 90th birthday of China's aged leader Deng Xiaoping Julian O'Halloran provides a profile on BBC2 (9.30).</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES WIN, 5-1, LOOK UP  </P> <P> It hardly seems possible, but it was just a week ago, remember, that these guys  were out of the race.  </P> <P> Why, there was Tony Gwynn sitting in the clubhouse in Philadelphia giving a  concession speech in midst of the Padres' 4-5 trip east.  </P> <P> Tim Flannery was drafting a retirement statement, planning to leave two days  before the end of the season.  </P> <P> The Padre hierarchy was on the phone, shopping position players and pitchers to  contenders, never mind their own immediate needs.  </P> <P> This was a team that had lost seven of its past 11 games (including three of  five to the likes of Atlanta and Philadelphia), was 10 games out of first place  and was just a bad home stand away from dropping into fifth.  </P> <P> "A week ago, I'm not sure any of us would have believed this," Gwynn said. "But  now, I don't think there's anyone in here that doesn't believe we can win this  thing."  </P> <P> The secret is out.  </P> <P> Once hoping to sneak up on Houston and San Francisco, these giddy Padres are  letting it be known to anyone who cares to listen that they will have to be  reckoned with in the final month.  </P> <P> Take a peek: The Padres, 5-1 winners Thursday afternoon over Philadelphia,  enter September 6 1/2 games behind the division-leading Giants, 2 1/2 behind  the Astros.  </P> <P> It's the closest they've been entering September since 1985, when they were six  back before losing 11 of their next 13 to fall out of the race. In fact, except  for 1984 -- when they won the only division title in their 20-year history --  the Padres have never been within four games of the division lead at any time  in September.  </P> <P> "It's time to change our history around here," Flannery said. "We've got a  chance to do something, and we can't wait to come to the ballpark to find a way  to win it.  </P> <P> "Even in '84 when we won it, we had it clinched so soon (Sept. 20) that there  was no real pennant stretch. This is what guys play their whole careers for.  Playing in a losing season is useless. We've had enough of those."  </P> <P> The Padres (69-65), who certainly have had plenty of those -- finishing above  .500 just four times in their history -- have won seven of their past eight and  nine of 11 to create this euphoria.  </P> <P> Oh, the fans don't yet believe it, with just 15,541 showing up Thursday at San  Diego Jack Murphy Stadium and a total of 57,362 coming out for the past four  games. But you have to remember, this is the same town in which just 15,766  came out the night the Padres clinched the title in 1984.  </P> <P> "Certainly we're disappointed in the fan turnout," Padre General Manager Tony  Siegle said, "but I don't think in any way this reflects the attitude of the  city. I went to get a haircut the other day, and everybody was wearing Padre  shirts.  </P> <P> "I think this town's buzzing, and I know it sure is in this clubhouse."  </P> <P> Heck, even Charger Coach Dan Henning jumped on the bandwagon, coming to the  stadium Thursday before the game and visiting with Manager Jack McKeon.  </P> <P> "Times sure are changing, aren't they?" said McKeon, unable to suppress a grin.  </P> <P> The Padres, who went out and acquired pitching depth Wednesday when they  obtained Calvin Schiraldi, were awfully grateful Thursday that hadn't become  impatient and traded Dennis Rasmussen to another contender for the stretch.  </P> <P> Rasmussen, who had a 4-8 record and 4.41 ERA three weeks ago, has emerged as a  vital cog to the Padre pennant hopes, winning his third consecutive start and  the fourth of his past five. He's 4-1 with a 2.87 ERA in those five starts.  </P> <P> But for a while Thursday, it looked as if this would be much more than just  another victory. For 5 1/3 innings, he pitched a perfect game. For six, he had  a no-hitter.  </P> <P> "I started thinking about it when I got out there in the seventh," said  Rasmussen (8-9). "When you get that far along in the game, you can't help it."  </P> <P> Rasmussen, pitching carefully to leadoff hitter Lenny Dykstra in the sixth, was  unable to throw a third strike past him and eventually walked him on eight  pitches. He fell behind to Tommy Herr, two and one, and then watched his  no-hitter vanish when Herr drilled a fastball into right. John Kruk followed  with another single, ending the shutout. Not wanting to risk any further  erosion of the Padres' 4-1 lead, pitching coach Pat Dobson went to the mound  and summoned Mark Grant.  </P> <P> Grant induced Ricky Jordan to hit into a double play on his second pitch,  struck out Von Hayes to end the inning and wound up finishing for his second  save.  </P> <P> "After last night's loss broke our winning streak," Rasmussen said, "I know  everybody thought we had to have a win going into our off-day. Winning breeds  confidence, and right now, I think we all have that.  </P> <P> "You look at my numbers, and they're not spectacular, but I feel as confident  as I've ever been. It's contagious."  </P> <P> Said Grant, who has pitched 8 2/3 innings without allowing a run in his past  three outings, picking up a victory and two saves: "This is the best time I've  ever had. It's really the first time in my major league career I've had  success. I know what it's like to be on a brutal team, being on the '84 Giants  (66-96).  </P> <P> "Just look at us now. Everybody's having fun. The whole outlook of the club is  awesome. It's funny. Well, it's fun is what it is."  </P> <P> The victory, aided by Benito Santiago's three-run homer in the sixth, also  helped ease the emotional pain of Wednesday's trade, in which the Padres dealt  Marvell Wynne and Luis Salazar for Schiraldi, outfielder Darrin Jackson and a  player to be named.  </P> <P> "It wasn't an easy night last night," Gwynn said. "There was some tears in  here, particularly from the younger guys. Marvell was a pretty popular guy."  </P> <P> The players understood, particularly considering that starter Eric Show (back)  is on the disabled list, and Bruce Hurst (aggravated groin muscle) missed his  last start. The concern is that the trade depleted the bench, particularly for  left-handed hitters when third baseman Mike Pagliarulo starts. But that  weakness could be shored up early next week.  </P> <P> The player to be named likely could be left-handed-hitting first baseman Phil  Stephenson of the Cubs' triple-A club in Iowa, Siegle confirmed. Stephenson --  of whom one scout on Thursday said, "Has a swing resembling that of Mark Grace  and Wally Joyner but doesn't have the power" -- is hitting .301 with 12 homers  and 60 RBIs and also has 26 stolen bases in 29 attempts for Iowa.  </P> <P> Stephenson, 6-feet-1, 195, could be Clark's backup at first and also used as a  pinch-runner.  </P> <P> "I think this club is still two, three players away from where we ideally want  it to be," Siegle said, "but there's also no doubt in our minds that it's quite  capable of winning the division, and maybe even more."  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Padre pitcher Bruce Hurst, who missed a start because of an aggravated groin  muscle, will make his next scheduled start Saturday against the Phillies. He  pitched on the side Thursday and said that he experienced no pain. "I don't  know if I'm 100%," Hurst said, "but I'm going to pitch like I'm 100%."  </P> <P> </P> <P> PADRES AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Scorecard  </P> <P> SECOND INNING  </P> <P> Padres -- Clark doubled to left. James singled to right, Clark scoring, James  thrown out attempting to take second. Templeton doubled to left. Santiago  grounded to shortstop. Jackson was intentionally walked. Rasmussen forced  Jackson. One run, three hits, two left.  </P> <P> SIXTH INNING  </P> <P> Padres -- With one out, James singled to center. Templeton singled to left,  James stopping at second. Santiago homered to left, his ninth. Jackson flied to  right. Rasmussen grounded to second. Three runs, three hits.  </P> <P> SEVENTH INNING  </P> <P> Phillies -- Dykstra walked. Herr singled to right, Dykstra stopping at second.  Kruk singled to right, Dykstra scoring, Herr stopping at second. Grant replaced  Rasmussen. Jordan grounded into double play, Herr taking third. V. Hayes struck  out. One run, two hits, one left.  </P> <P> Padres -- McDowell took the mound. With one out, Alomar bunted safely and stole  second. Gwynn was intentionally walked. Alomar stole third and scored on the  second baseman Herr's throwing error, Gwynn taking second. Clark struck out.  James grounded to third. One run (unearned), one hit, one left.  </P></p>

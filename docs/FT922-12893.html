			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand details expansion MR Jan Erik Langangen, the president of the Norwegian insurer Uni Storebrand, yesterday gave further details of his planned international expansion programme. He said that if approval was granted for the newly announced deal with Skandia, Sweden's leading insurance company, he would seek an international partner or raise up to NKr1bn (Dollars 155m) in fresh equity before the end of 1993 to expand the group's international reinsurance business. As part of the deal, announced last Thursday, Skandia would acquire Hafnia, the troubled Danish insurer. A new company - Christiania International Insurance - would then be created, combining the international business of Uni Storebrand and non-US reinsurance business of Skandia. Christiania International would become one of the world's leading reinsurers, the Uni Storebrand president said. Uni's acquisition of Skandia's non-US reinsurance business represents tangible and liquid assets valued at NKr3bn. Mr Langangen explained that the acquisition also represented an additional NKr1bn in 'embedded value' from Skandia's life reinsurance portfolio and from the net present value of investment income related to Skandia's non-US reinsurance business. Embedded value comprises shareholders' net equity assets and the present value of future surpluses - net of taxes  - expected to arise from the existing portfolio of the life insurance business. According to the terms of the deal, Uni is exchanging 18.2m Skandia shares valued at an estimated Nkr4bn for the Skandia assets which are valued at about the same. Mr Langangen said all risk attached to business written before June 30 this year would remain with Skandia. 'This means that Uni Storebrand has acquired an option for Skandia's non-US reinsurance market positions. Since the financial transaction provides full coverage for the shares, the strategic transaction can be seen as free of charge for Uni Storebrand,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS TO ENFORCE STRICT SMOKING BAN  </P> <P> Beginning in January, smoking will be prohibited on all school campuses,  including offices and football fields, in one of the most restrictive smoking  bans in the county.  </P> <P> Only the school district's maintenance yard in Laguna Canyon was exempted from  the rule.  </P> <P> To this point, teachers and staff members have been allowed to smoke in  designated areas at each city school, Supt. Dennis Smith said. But the Laguna  Beach school board voted unanimously last week to prohibit all campus smoking  as of Jan. 7. Students were never allowed to smoke on campus, he said.  </P> <P> Smith said there was virtually no opposition to the proposal, which the board  began discussing about six months ago.  </P> <P> "This isn't the result of controversy," he said. "Everyone has agreed this is a  positive move on the district's part."  </P> <P> Board President Jim Kreder agreed that the prohibition was widely supported.  "Our feedback from our teacher representative is that even those teachers who  smoke supported the idea and have been very cooperative," he said.  </P> <P> In October, the Ocean View school board in Huntington Beach banned smoking on  all school district grounds, including the maintenance yard and transportation  facility. That policy will become effective Feb. 1.  </P> <P> Although other school districts have not banned smoking, according to an Orange  County Department of Education official, the trend is in that direction.  </P> <P> "I think you're going to find that more school districts are going to be  reviewing and looking at that potential," said Vicki Walker, a department  spokeswoman. "It's a risk factor for the kids." LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

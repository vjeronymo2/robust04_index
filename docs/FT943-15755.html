			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (2): Focus is turned on smaller businesses - Andrew Hill looks at the politicians' promises If Italy's myriad small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs in the current Euro-jargon) had received L1,000 for every political promise or piece of praise received over the last six months, they would have amassed quite a tidy sum by now. Candidates from right and left in Italy's March general election - many of whom were themselves small-scale entrepreneurs - held out promises of assistance to the SMEs and lauded smaller businesses as the backbone of the Italian economy. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, now prime minister, and his supporters bandied around back-of-envelope figures suggesting that if one in four of Italy's small businesses were to employ just one extra person, his party's ambitious target of 1m new jobs could be met. Even President Bill Clinton, at the Detroit jobs summit this spring, alluded to the innovative drive of north Italian small business as an example for the world economy. This emphasis on SMEs is nothing new. Indeed, Mr Berlusconi's focus on smaller businesses as a potential source of jobs echoes ideas already broached by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, in the white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, launched last year. But the theme has a particular relevance to Italy because of the importance of small businesses in the economy. Based on 1991 census figures, Confindustria - the Italian employers' federation - estimates that businesses with turnover of less than L10bn represent 86 per cent of all industrial companies in Italy, while those with sales of over L100bn account for less than 1 per cent. Some 39 per cent of Italian companies have fewer than 100 employees, compared with 24.9 per cent in France, or 21.1 per cent in the UK. As Confindustria's research unit pointed out in a recent report on SMEs*, the development of Italy's smaller businesses would benefit the whole economy, because they are sources of innovation and generally employ younger workers than larger companies. In the 1970s, Italy's small business sector grew far more quickly than larger enterprises: the number of companies employing between 10 and 19 people, for example, increased by more than 70 per cent between 1971 and 1981, as did the number of people employed by such companies. But in the 1980s, growth stagnated. The number of businesses employing between 10 and 50 people grew slightly, but employment in larger companies slipped below the 1971 level. Small entrepreneurs lay much of the blame at the door of previous Italian governments, which paid lip service to the promotion of SMEs, while bowing to the demands of much larger companies (and, in some cases, gratefully accepting illicit party funding from the same enterprises). This was the period in which a vast bureaucracy was constructed, imposing a particular burden on smaller companies. Entrepreneurs estimate that about 200 different taxes and charges have to be paid out by each individual business. The financial impact of this is bad enough, but the administrative burden is also hard to bear. For example, Mr Luigi Tessera Chiesa, managing director of Tepak, a small company making padded envelopes near Turin, reckons that of his 38 employees, two or three could switch to more productive work if they did not have to devote themselves to tackling red tape. As chairman of the small business unit of the Turin employers' federation, he echoes the Confindustria call for less bureaucracy, fewer taxes and more tax breaks, plus incentives for training, research and innovation. Mr Tessera Chiesa approves of one step that the government has already taken by cutting the taxation of reinvested profits for 1994 and 1995, a measure which he says will particularly benefit SMEs. 'Large companies can't change their investment strategy to take advantage of this two-year window, but small and medium-sized companies can respond rapidly to the opportunities offered,' he points out. However, the bosses of SMEs are calling for further measures, in particular those aimed at encouraging alternative means of financing business growth. At the moment, for example, small companies rely on bank financing. That means that at a certain point further expansion is hampered, because entrepreneurs do not want to add to debt already accumulated at higher than average rates. 'Many companies refuse to invest because they are afraid that if they overinvest, the company will be put into the hands of the banks,' says Mr Giuseppe De Carolis, head of corporate finance with Price Waterhouse in Italy. 'Credit institutions tend to overestimate the riskiness of granting credit to a small company,' adds the Confindustria report. 'In a number of cases, SMEs have financing costs which are too high relative to their credit risk, which indicates a failure of the market.' Small companies hope that continued reform of the banking system will help ease the situation. They are also backing the establishment of a second nationwide stock market which would allow smaller companies to finance themselves through equity issues, and stimulate the emergence of a new layer of Italian venture capitalists and small merchant banks prepared to back SMEs at realistic rates of interest. Competition from the stock market, entrepreneurs believe, would also put pressure on traditional banks to reduce their charges. The snag may be persuading owners of family businesses to give up some of their hard-earned shares. Mr De Carolis believes it will require strong incentives to persuade small family companies to seek a stock market listing. The government, Confindustria, local chambers of commerce and the stock market authorities are all working on formal proposals which should be tabled in the next few months. By then, it should be possible to assess whether the governing parties' campaign promises can and will be fulfilled. Meanwhile, Mr Tessera Chiesa and his counterparts around the country have a further simple request: 'We're also hoping that the new government does another thing that few governments in the past have known how to do, and that is govern,' he says. * Una politica per le piccole imprese (Previsioni dell'economia italiana, June 1994: L50,000, Confindustria Centro Studi).</p>

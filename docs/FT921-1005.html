			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: SMH seeks to boost capital to DM180m SCHRODER Munchmeyer Hengst &amp; Co, the German investment bank which is about 75 per cent-owned by Lloyds Bank of the UK, is holding its first capital-raising exercise in eight years. The bank announced yesterday it was planning to increase its equity capital from DM140m (Dollars 87.5m) to DM180m in the middle of 1992, in a move which will not lead to any change in the shareholding structure. It will be subscribed to by Lloyds, by the five personally liable partners, and by senior management. SMH also announced that profits for the 1991 financial year were 'satisfactory', business in the first 12 weeks of the year had progressed well, and profits were considerably higher than for the same period last year. The bank did not disclose any figures, saying only that operating profits for 1991 almost reached the record level of 1990, while net profits fell slightly below the previous year's results. Although net interest earnings rose by almost one-fifth, commission profits were down by 12.5 per cent, reflecting reduced level of turnover on Germany's stock exchanges last year.</p>

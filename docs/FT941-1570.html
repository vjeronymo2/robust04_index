			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: BNP hit by sharp rise in provisions on bad loans Banque Nationale de Paris, the French banking group that last autumn staged a highly successful privatisation, yesterday announced that net profits fell by 53 per cent to FFr1.02bn (Dollars 172.9m) in 1993 from FFr2.17bn in 1992. Mr Michel Pebereau, who last summer was appointed chairman of BNP to spearhead its sale to the private sector, had warned the stock market of the fall in profits. Mr Pebereau said yesterday that the group had been affected 'by the difficult economic environment across continental Europe, particularly in France, our main market.' In spite of the pressures on the French banking sector, which has for the past two years been depressed by weak demand for credit, BNP managed to increase its net banking income by 4.9 per cent to FFr41.46bn in 1993 from FFr39.52bn in the previous year. The group made progress in cutting costs and, like other French banks, benefited from a strong performance in market trading, notably during the summer currency crisis. As a result, operating profits rose faster than revenue, increasing by 8.5 per cent to FFr12.46bn in 1993 from FFr11.48bn in 1992. However, BNP was forced to make large provisions on its sour loans to corporate clients and on the fall in value of some investments, principally in the property sector. It raised its total provisions by 43.8 per cent to FFr10.81bn in 1993 from FFr7.52bn in 1992. The scale of this increase was exaggerated by the absence of a FFr1.59bn writeback on previous sovereign risk provisions in 1992. BNP was forced in 1993 to make an additional writedown of FFr176m on sovereign risks and raised provisions on its commercial banking business by 16.7 per cent to FFr10.63bn.</p>

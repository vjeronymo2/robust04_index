			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] At a regular Executive Yuan session yesterday [17  February], Premier Lien Chan instructed ministries and  commissions to implement plans for bilateral and multilateral  economic cooperation and trade initiated by President Li during  his southern tour. Premier Lien noted that President Li's  unofficial visit is of positive significance to prosperity and  progress in Southeast Asia. The premier also instructed  ministries to compile the results and cooperation plans achieved  during the tour and assign them to ministries for  implementation. Yuan Tung has filed the following report:    [Begin Yuan recording] Foreign Minister Chien Fu; Hsiao  Wan-chang, Chairman of the Council for Economic Planning  Development [CEPD], and (?Tai Yue-ming), deputy secretary  general and spokesman of the Presidential Office, made reports  or offered explanations of President Li's unofficial visit at  the 17 February regular meeting of the Executive Yuan. Premier  Lien Chan said: The President's visit is indeed very fruitful.    (?Wu Chung-li), deputy director of the Government  Information  Office [GIO], relayed Premier Lien Chan's comments:    [Begin (?Wu) recording] Taiwan does not have official  diplomatic ties with the three countries. The visit is,  therefore, historic. This is particularly so in view of the  deteriorating diplomatic situation our nation has faced in the  past decade or more. The tour represents a rare feat. [end  (?Wu) recording]    Premier Lien also pointed out: The themes of President Li's  tour were peace, progress, and prosperity and its principal goal  is to promote the common welfare in the region. It will have a  positive impact on development in the Asian-Pacific region as a  whole.    GIO deputy director (?Wu) relayed Premier Lien Chan's  instructions:    [Begin (?Wu) recording] Our main goals are to promote the  common interest and welfare of the region. Every country or  individual that genuinely cares about that region should support  such an idea. For this reason, Premier Lien commented, it is  hard to understand why the Chinese Communists voiced objections.  The premier said regional cooperation and ties of this kind are  conducive to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and  the world. Under the themes of peace, progress, and prosperity,  the countries concerned in Southeast Asia can help one another  and obtain many cooperation projects through bilateral or  multilateral cooperation. Once the foreign ministry and CEPD  compile the list of cooperation projects and sort out the  opportunities and plans, the work can be divided up among the  ministries and commissions concerned for implementation. [end  (?Wu) recording]    Premier Lien also thanked the countries and heads of state  that accorded hearty hospitality to President Li. He also  thanked the personnel of the foreign ministry and CEPD for their  hard work in connection with the trip. [end Yuan recording]</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Motoring: On the road with Little and Large - Stuart Marshall tests a stately Mercedes and the cheeky Subaru Vivio IF SIR Edwin Landseer had seen them together, he would have dashed off another version of Dignity and Impudence. As it was, my neighbour said I really had gone from the sublime to the ridiculous. He was looking at the two cars standing side by side in my drive; a massive Mercedes-Benz 500SE in which I had just made a 1,200-mile (1,930 km) return trip to Geneva, and a tiny Subaru Vivio. Sublime is a good way to describe the kind of motoring the 500SE offers. Its five-litre, 308-horsepower V8 had propelled its two tonnes on autoroutes, N and D roads, over the Col de la Givrine and in Geneva's traffic without ever flexing its muscles or raising its voice. To my surprise, it returned 20.63 mpg (13.69 l/100km) on the autoroutes and 19.61 mpg (14.41 l/100 km) elsewhere, making 20.12 mpg (14.04 l/100km) overall. For so majestic a car, driven fairly briskly, I thought this not at all bad: a 3.2-litre 300SE did little better (21.48 mpg/13.15 l/100 km) on an identical trip last year. But French unleaded petrol is FFr5.52 (around 71p) a litre, or Pounds 3.23 a gallon, making the fuel cost 16p a mile (nearly 10p a kilometre). You can see why large-engined cars are few and far between in France. And why, with gazole two-thirds the price of unleaded petrol, well over 40 per cent of all newly-registered French cars are diesels. Mercedes-Benz S-Class salesmen must be like Rolls-Royce dealers, telling prospective customers who enquire about miles a gallon that, if they have to ask that kind of question, they cannot afford the car. In town - even more so in a multi-storey car park - you are aware of the S-Class's bulk; but on an autoroute, it reigns supreme. High gearing (nearly 30 mph/48kmh per 1,000 rpm in top), double-glazed side windows and minimal tyre rumble make the interior quieter than club class in a 747. From standstill, it takes off with similar vigour to a Bentley Turbo R - but such foot-hard-down antics are discouraged the instant the driver sees the fuel consumption indicator drop into low single figures. It rides superbly and handles with an agility that belies its size. The air-conditioned interior provides four people with lounging space, and a fifth is not cramped. The doors and the lid of the vast boot are closed silently by electric motors. All cars should have rear-view mirrors like the 500SE's. A single knob power-adjusts the interior and exterior mirrors, folds the outside ones flat (ideal when parking on a ferry or in a narrow street) and restores them to their original position. The Pounds 61,800 asked for a 500SE is a lot of money but a 500SE is, undeniably, a lot of motor car. But expensive, luxury-class saloons will not be so important to Mercedes-Benz in future; it has announced plans to make high-quality cars for all market segments. People who reckon to travel first-class everywhere will still want large - and large-engined - luxury cars. While they do, the S-Class has a secure future. No volume-produced rival can match it at present for performance and prestige. But no maker is keeping a closer watch on the formidably good Toyota Lexus 450 than Mercedes-Benz. From the sublime to the Subaru. Stepping out of the 500SE and into the Vivio was a bit like dismounting from the heaviest of hunters and throwing a leg over a Shetland pony. The Pounds 6,999 Vivio is tiny: shorter than a Rover Metro, not much longer than a Mini, narrower and higher than either of them. This makes it ultra-handy in traffic and parkable almost anywhere; yet, four people can fit inside without their heads touching the roof. Tailgate (and fuel filler) open from inside and the boot holds a supermarket trolley full of groceries. All controls, steering included, are very light. The 658 cc, four-cylinder engine accelerates up to high revolutions with an electric motor's smoothness but pulls so well that fourth, even fifth, gears are usable in town. Although the little wheels tend to magnify potholes and drain covers, the ride is not in the least teeth-jarring. And with a top speed of 83 mph (134 kph), the Vivio driver need not fear motorway speed cameras. Although I would not choose one for a long journey, it is more than just a town car-cum-shopping basket. Let the eager little engine spin fast and the Vivio holds its own well enough not to be an embarrassment on the open road. Drive it gently and the fuel consumption will be around 50 mpg (5.65 l/100 km). The only real snow I have seen outside mountain areas this winter was on the A26 autoroute between Calais and the A1 interchange last week. So, I cannot speak from personal experience of the Vivio's unique in-class feature of four-wheel drive, selectable at the touch of a button in the gear lever knob. But I know that its similarly-equipped, slightly bigger brother, the Subaru Justy, copes most competently with snowy roads and muddy car parks alike. Many commuting businessmen burden themselves with large, load-carrying and fuel-thirsty on/off-road 4 x 4s because, they say, they want to be sure of getting to a country station in winter. They would be better off providing the nanny with a Vivio instead of a Metro as a runabout. Then, they could have a nice big estate as the company car - and commandeer the Vivio when they need four- wheel drive on snowy mornings.</p>

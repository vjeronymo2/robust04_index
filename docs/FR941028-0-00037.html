			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, the clear provisions of section 507(b)(4) of the Act require, in substance, that permit applicants identify most of those people who are considered owners or controllers for purposes of section 510(c) of the Act and 30 CFR 773.15 and 773.5. As OSM observed in the preamble to the ownership and control rules published in 1988: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The legislative history of section 507(b)(4) includes the statement that ``[t]he information required by [section 507(b)(4)] is a key element of the operator's affirmative demonstration that the environmental protection provisions of the Act can be met as stipulated in Section 510 and includes: (1) Identification of all parties, corporations, and officials involved  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> to allow identification <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  of parties ultimately responsible *&blank;*&blank;*.'' H.R. Rep. No. 94&hyph;896, 94th Cong., 2nd Sess. 111 (1976). (Emphasis added.) See also S. Rep. No. 94&hyph;28, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 206 (1975). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38875 (October 3, 1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With the ownership and control rules published in October of 1988 and with these final rules published today, OSM is simply implementing sections 510(c) and 507(b)(4) of the Act. None of these provisions impose retroactive responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, related to their due process concerns, industry commenters argued that the proposed rules also violate the Act by not providing conditional permits during the appeal of ownership or control links, the current status of the violation, or the existence of the violation at the time it was cited. They pointed to the provisions of current 30 CFR 773.15(b)(2) which allow for a permit to be conditioned upon a good faith, direct administrative or judicial appeal to contest the validity of the current violation as indicative of the agency's longstanding recognition that such an appeal is consistent with the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with the commenters' analysis and rejects the view that OSM's historic interpretation of the Act requires that owners or controllers be entitled to permits conditioned upon the appeals of ownership or control links, the status of the violation, or the existence of the violation at the time that it was cited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM's regulation at 30 CFR 773.15(b)(2) does not constitute the agency's recognition that all appeals form the basis for conditional permits. Such a blanket interpretation would negate the clear mandate of the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act and of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) which require the denial of permits to applicants who own or control surface coal mining operations in current violation of the Act. As has been discussed previously in this preamble, the issuance of permits conditioned upon the appeal of ownership or control links thwarts the effective implementation of section 510(c) of the Act. OSM has never interpreted its regulations to allow for such a result. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contrary to commenters' assertions, the regulation at 30 CFR 773.15(b)(2) only allows a limited exception for good faith, direct administrative or judicial appeals contesting the validity of the violation as the basis for conditional issuance. An appeal of an ownership or control link which tests a person's relationship to a violator or to a violation does not test the validity of the underlying violation. To the extent that the provisions of a State program allow for conditional issuance based upon the appeal of an ownership or control link, those provisions must be considered less effective than comparable Federal provisions. See 30 CFR parts 730 and 732. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, in many instances, the existence of ownership or control links in AVS may be readily discovered by the presumed controllers, and the accuracy of those links administratively challenged prior to the actual denial of a permit by a regulatory authority. An appeal challenging the current status of a violation does not constitute a direct challenge to the validity of the violation at the time that it was cited. Instead, it would test whether the violation is currently abated or not. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An appeal as to the existence of the violation at the time it was cited could constitute a challenge as to the validity of the violation. Nevertheless, there is nothing in the Act or OSM's regulations which requires that such an appeal, undertaken by an owner or controller of a violator after standard appeal times have run, be the basis for conditional issuance. Conditional issuance is particularly inappropriate when the controller's ability to compel the controlled entity to act is taken into account. A controller has the capacity to force the controlled entity to abate or to appeal and would have had such rights at the time that the violation was cited. Thus, a timely appeal of the violation, directly made through administrative or judicial tribunals, could have been made at that time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter argued that due process protection in the proposed rules should be enhanced. In substance, this commenter asserted that it is unfair to deny permits to applicants or to subject active permits to treatment as improvidently issued permits where the applicants or permittees are subjectively unaware of their ownership or control links to violators or of the import of such relationships. Accordingly, this commenter proposed that such persons should have extended opportunities for ``corrections and questions'' without the risk of permit denial or revocation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

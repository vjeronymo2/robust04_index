			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Scotland and Swabia lead the crusade to a new life - Continental venture MR PAUL GRACE is not an ambitious linguist. He admits that when he wants to order two beers in Catalonia - where he has a house - he finds the easiest way is to say una birra twice. Yet the deputy chief executive of Scottish Equitable, the Edinburgh-based life assurance company, is leading one of the bolder drives into the continental European market. Last month it founded a joint venture with a large German insurance group. It also has a foothold in the Italian savings market and is working on a project in France. Scottish companies have done well out of the life assurance and pensions market in England, but few have developed further afield. For Scottish Equitable the impetus to move on to the Continent came in 1988 when the Department of Trade and Industry started advertising the single European market. 'Our non-executive directors started urging us to take Europe seriously,' says Mr Grace. 'They thought our policy holders would benefit from the economies of scale we would be able to exploit.' The company first commissioned an audit of its strengths and weaknesses from Mrs Odile Pilley, a French academic at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. She found its staff to be strong in developing insurance products and in fund management, but weak in foreign languages and cultural awareness of other countries. Yet Scottish Equitable has remained in no doubt of the opportunity offered on the Continent, particularly once the EC's third life assurance directive comes into force in July 1994. This should lead to deregulation and greater competition in closely controlled markets such as Germany, Italy and France. Governments there are finding their state pension operations increasingly expensive, while German companies are worried about funding their pension schemes. Mrs Pilley drew up what Mr Grace calls 'a CV of the company'. This was translated into the main continental languages, plus Dutch and Swedish, and mailed to 200 insurance companies and financial institutions. One of the respondents was Stuttgart-based Wurttembergische, one of Germany's largest composite insurers with a big life assurance arm. It wanted to gain British expertise in developing new products to supplement the highly standardised endowment policies that predominate in Germany. The relationship, which began in July 1990, was handled by Mr John Waterton, a fluent German speaker. Aged 58, he joined Scottish Equitable after a career in industry and, being married to an Italian, passed the cultural awareness test. He says the Germans were prepared to overlook Mr Grace's lack of fluency in their tongue. Even with this disadvantage, the reassuring actuary had made them feel 'he could help them adapt quickly to the deregulated environment'. The German company soon decreed that all relevant executives learn English. A further factor helped. According to Mr Grace, the Wurttembergische executives are very conscious of being Swabians, the people who inhabit the state of Baden-Wurttemberg of which Stuttgart is capital. 'Just as Scottish Equitable has expanded all over Britain from Scotland, they have done the same in Germany from Swabia. Like the Scots, the Swabians enjoy a reputation for canniness and thrift,' says Mr Grace who, like Mr Waterton, is English. The two companies announced the joint venture in October 1991 and launched it last month under the name Allgemeine Rentenanstalt. The venture still needs authorisation and will not start operating until the second half of 1993. Although the single market should in theory mean that British-designed life policies can be sold in Germany, this is not practicable because of different tax structures. Instead, the venture will design products for the German market which will be sold through Wurttembergische's sales network. Its first target will be the personal pensions market.</p>

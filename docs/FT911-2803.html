			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Motoring: Audi launch AUDI COULD hardly have picked a better moment to launch its new executive saloon, the 100, on the British company car market. At a time when money is tight, it can point to its car prices rising by less than the rate of inflation in the last year. Although the new ones cost about 7 per cent more than the outgoing models, the price now includes ABS anti-lock brakes as standard. So, too, is Procon-Ten, Audi's unique crash protection system. It pulls the steering wheel away from the driver and tightens the front seat belts in an impact severe enough to shift the engine backwards. Three of the cars - the 100 2.0E with manual or automatic transmission (both due in the UK in June) and the 100 2.3E manual - are priced below the Pounds 19,250 tax break figure. First to go on sale - they will be in UK dealerships on May 8 - are the 133 horsepower 5-cylinder 2.3E and the 174 horsepower 2.8E (pictured), which has a brand new, narrow angle V6 engine. Having sampled two of the new 100s, an automatic with front-wheel drive and a manual gearbox quattro, I rate them attractive alternatives to class rivals such as Mercedes 190, 200 and 230 and the BMW 320 and 325. Coming in September are Avant estate car versions, automatics with quattro transmissions and a super-economy direct-injection turbo-diesel.</p>

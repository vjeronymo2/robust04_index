In the meantime, college cooks  have been using an outdoor barbecue to prepare food for the students.  </P> <P> Sandra Sarr, a spokeswoman for the college, said fire investigators determined  that the blaze, which caused about $500,000 damage, was sparked by an  electrical short in a kitchen refrigerator.  </P></p>

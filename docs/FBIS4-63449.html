			<p>BFN     [Text] The Azerbaijani leadership seeks peace, Azerbaijani  President Geydar Aliyev stated at a meeting with refugees from  the Karabakh Region on Saturday. His address to the refugees  was televised.    Aliyev said that the Azerbaijani leadership had been  maintaining contacts with the CSCE and the Russian leaders in  order to ensure permanent ceasefire and to eliminate the  consequences of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.    Aliyev commented on relations with the opposition and on its  reaction to the Bishkek protocol. "The leadership made the right  move having signed this protocol. For Baku it meant only  ceasefire," he emphasized.    Aliyev condemned activities of the opposition deputies who  had recently left the parliament and had organized a rally in  Baku on Saturday. "Political parties should not act through  rallies and mass actions of protest. They must consult the  official bodies and interact with them," he pointed out.    Aliyev announced that people had been sending telegrams and  calling from many Azerbaijani regions asking for an opportunity  to come to Baku and to settle the accounts with the opposition.  He said the fear of the opposition that Russian troops could be  brought to Azerbaijan was in vain. "No Russian troops will be  brought to Azerbaijan," Aliyev reassured.    Press Secretary of the National Independence opposition  party  (led by Etibar Mamedov) Rauf Mirgadyrov suggested in an  interview with Interfax that after his statement Aliyev would  have practically no chance to achieve any accord with the  opposition.</p>

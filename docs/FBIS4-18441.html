			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Serdar Turgut: "Clinton Objects to Delivery of Tanker </F> Aircraft at the Last Moment" -- punctuation as published]    [Text] Washington--President Clinton has ordered the  suspension of the delivery of U.S. tanker aircraft to Turkey at  the last moment. The tanker aircraft would have increased the  operational range of Turkey's military aircraft. The  development, which even surprised the U.S. State Department  officials, was the result of the significant pressure the Greek  lobby in Washington put on President Clinton. It will be  recalled that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller persistently insisted  on Turkey acquiring several U.S. tanker aircraft in order to  increase the operational range of its military planes.  <H5>  Warning to Clinton </H5>   The leading members of the Greek lobby, who were  disappointed  by Washington's decision to recognize The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], warned Clinton that: "We shall  withdraw our support for you if you continue to adopt decisions  against us."    President Clinton had to yield to the Greek lobby's pressure  when his adviser, George Stephanopoulos, who is of Greek origin,  advised him to keep in line with the Greek lobby's demands.  Later, Clinton instructed the U.S. State Department and the  Pentagon to "suspend the delivery of tanker aircraft to Turkey."  He also informed his close associates as follows: "We already  have a problem with Greece on matters related to the FYROM. Let  us not allow the tanker aircraft issue to become another  problem."    The developments that forced Clinton to make that decision  began on 9 March when he received Archbishop Iakovos, head of  the Greek Orthodox Church, and 14 members of the Greek lobby,  including Senator Paul Sarbanes, who supports Greece in the U.S.  Congress. The Greek lobbyists asked to meet President Clinton  after he disclosed that the United States would recognize the  FYROM. Vice President Al Gore and National Security Adviser  Anthony Lake attended the meeting. The delegation maintained a  very firm approach and urged President Clinton to reconsider.  It also accused the U.S. State Department of systematically  acting against Greece and supporting Turkey.    The Greek lobbyists recalled Washington's decision to supply  several tanker aircraft to Turkey. They said: "The delivery of  tanker aircraft, which will enable the Turkish military aircraft  to refuel in flight, constitutes a move hostile to Greece."    President Clinton disclosed at the end of the meeting that  he  had decided to postpone his decision to recognize the FYROM.  Shortly after his back down on this decision, he suspended the  delivery of tanker aircraft to Turkey.</p>

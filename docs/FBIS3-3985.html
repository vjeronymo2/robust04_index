They referred to the Japanese colonization of the Korean  peninsula before and during World War II.    During their talks, Kim told Hosokawa that the  future-oriented bilateral ties would impose great impact on  Asian nations as well as the rest of the world.    The two leaders also agreed that Japan, South Korea and  Russia should make efforts to adopt measures to solve the  problem of returning Koreans left behind on the Russian Far East  island of Sakhalin to their homeland.    They exchanged their views about political and economic  reform efforts and discussed the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    A second round of talks between Kim and Hosokawa is  scheduled  on Saturday. They are expected to discuss economic issues.    Later this evening, Kim attended a state dinner hosted by  Japanese Emperor Akihito.    Kim and his wife, Son Myong-sun, arrived in Tokyo this  morning for a three-day visit to Japan.    He will deliver speeches in the Japanese Diet (parliament)  and at Wasoda University on Friday.</p>

Zuyev] </F>   [Text] Today, radar early-warning and control aircraft are  an effective means of supporting combat operations, which is  confirmed by the results of recent military conflicts.  Therefore, many countries are working on creating new and  improving existing radar early-warning systems.    The Israeli firm Elta has developed a fundamentally new  radar  early-warning system, which has been given the name Falcon. The  first experimental model is already undergoing ground and flight  testing, and series production is scheduled to begin in 1994.  The American Boeing 707 has been chosen as the platform for the  new system. As Israeli military experts claim, the equipment for  the Falcon system costs less than half the radar early-warning  and control equipment installed on the E-3A Sentry.    The radar antenna for the E-3A aircraft is positioned above  the upper part of the fuselage, which disrupts the aircraft's  aerodynamics. This adversely affects handling and stability  (especially on takeoff and landing), as well as fatigue of  mounting points, limiting aircraft operating life. The onboard  radar of the Falcon system has six conformal antennas: One is  located in the forward part of the fuselage, and the other five  are positioned along a longitudinal line along the skin of the  fuselage on the left and right sides and in the tail unit.    The E-3A's radar for detection, discrimination, and  classification of air targets requires two to three complete  rotations of the antenna (about 30 seconds), but the new radar  needs 2-4 seconds, which increases the accuracy of determining  coordinates several-fold.    If a target is maneuvering, the radar uses a special  operating mode. Depending on the size, altitude, speed, and  angular rotation of the target, the pulse repetition frequency  is selected automatically, which makes it possible to classify  the target (helicopter, fighter, transport, etc.). When radar  early-warning aircraft is flying at medium altitude, the  detection range is 150 km for a helicopter or cruise missile,  350 km for a tactical fighter, and up to 500 km for a bomber or  surface ship.    The Falcon radar's technical capabilities make it possible  to  obtain a high degree of accuracy in determining target  coordinates in any, even extreme, weather conditions. The  radar's operating mode with a variable pulse repetition  frequency makes it possible to accomplish constant observation  in a specific sector, which is very important when supporting  combat operations in an individual areas.    The onboard equipment includes the EL/L 8312 communications  and electronic intelligence collection equipment, making it  possible to detect mobile and fixed sources of radar emissions  with a high degree of accuracy. The Elta firm has also developed  several variants of onboard electronic warfare equipment for  specific clients.    In addition to NATO, states of the Middle East and Southeast  Asia are showing an interest in acquiring the Falcon system.    The radar early-warning and control aircraft based on the  Boeing 707 has the following characteristics: 12,000 km flight  range; 12-13 hours flight duration without aerial refueling;  40,000 kg payload. Its 33.8-meter long cabin accommodates 17  operators. The Boeing 757 and C-130 transport aircraft, which do  not have great flight range, can also be used to house this  equipment. Any airliner that can transport 50 passengers or 5  tonnes of cargo can be a platform for the Falcon equipment.</p>

The major change would implement a provision of the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act as set forth in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The provision would increase Program benefits to households that have no elderly or disabled members by gradually increasing and then, in 1997, removing the limit on the amount of excess shelter expenses these households can deduct from their income to determine eligibility and benefits. The changes in provisions for standard utility allowances would allow State agencies to use allow use of additional standards and would simplify requirements for determining entitlement to a standard. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before January 23, 1995 to be assured of consideration.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should be submitted to Judith M.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by reporters Li Zhurun (2621 4554 3387) and Li </F> Jun (2621 7165): "China Attracted Worldwide Attention With its  Achievements in Intellectual Property Rights Protection" ]    [Text] Beijing, 20 May (XINHUA) -- In conformity with the  principle of seeing to it that "laws already enacted are  observed, violators are brought to justice, and laws are  enforced to the letter," people's courts at all levels in China  and relevant administrative organs have solemnly and impartially  enforced law and scored achievements, which attract worldwide  attention in protecting the legitimate rights and interests of  Chinese and foreign holders of intellectual property rights.    According to statistics, people's courts at all levels from  1986 to 1993 accepted and held first-instance hearings on 3,505  intellectual property rights cases, including 1,783 patent  rights cases, 1,168 copyrights cases, and 554 trademarks cases.    Liu Jiyang [0491 3423 2254], secretary general of the China  Intellectual Property Rights Association, said: Because they  have adhered to the principle of being strict and impartial when  protecting intellectual property rights, and because they have  drawn on the successful experiences of other countries, China's  law- enforcement departments are getting close to international  standards on law enforcement.    Before July 1993, no special judicial courts that try  intellectual property rights cases existed among China's courts;  such cases were tried separately by judicial courts that handle  economic or civil affairs. Because Beijing Municipality has the  highest occurrences of disputes over intellectual rights among  China's cities, the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court and  the Municipal Intermediate Court finally established,  simultaneously, judicial courts to handle intellectual property  rights cases in July 1993. Those were the first courts of such  nature to be established in the Chinese court system.    Since the beginning of this year, higher people's courts and  some intermediate people's courts in Shanghai Municipality,  Guangdong Province, Fujian Province, and Hainan Province  successively established judicial courts to handle intellectual  property rights cases.    According to Su Chi [1372 6688], president of the  Intellectual Property Rights Court of the Beijing Municipal  Intermediate People's Court, his court accepted and heard all  types of intellectual property rights cases: patent rights,  trademarks, copyrights (including copyrights over computer  software), technical disputes unrelated to patent rights, and  all other cases of disputes arising from unfair competition  brought about by failure to observe the principle of honesty and  trust and by acts infringing on other people's business credit  and trade secret.    Following its establishment, the intellectual property  rights  court accepted and heard 271 cases concerning all types of  intellectual property rights, including 21 involving foreign  nationals. The amount of money under dispute totaled 156  million yuan renminbi.    Su Chi said: Our court, without exception, uses a collegiate  bench to try intellectual property rights cases. It even  employs experts as jurors when the collegiate bench tries cases  that are highly technical, or which involve disputes over patent  rights and copyrights over computer software. However, most  cases are tried by a collegiate bench of judges. When it comes  across technical problems, the judicial court will invite two or  more experts to provide explains and assessments on technical  issues.    He pointed out: Without exception, all cases involving  intellectual property rights are tried in public unless  stipulated otherwise by law. In addition to announcing in  advance the schedule for each court session according to legal  procedures, the Beijing Municipal Intellectual Property Rights  Court also informs society in advance about its monthly  schedules for court sessions and expresses the wish to see  people from all sectors of society come and witness the court  sessions. According to statistics, over 3,000 people came to  the court sessions in over half a year.    Rights-infringement cases account for over 80 percent of all  intellectual property rights cases tried by the Beijing  Municipal Intellectual Property Rights Court. When handling  lawsuits over rights-infringement disputes, the court abides by  this principle: Once evidence proves that a case constitutes  rights infringement, the court will act in accordance with the  proposition of relevant rights holders and in accordance to the  law, and will order the person who infringes rights to  compensate relevant rights holder the total amount of losses  suffered by him due to rights infringement. The amount of  compensation paid will be in accordance with the criteria that  it is sufficient enough to compensate the losses incurred on the  rights holders and to prevent future rights- infringing acts.    Su Chi said: During the trial of a case involving disputes  over trademark infringement, filed by the Beijing-Paris Damofang  Food Company Limited against Beijing Sun City Bazaar, the  Beijing Municipal Intellectual Property Rights Court had, for  the first time in its court decisions, made clear that the  rights-infringing party had to pay the rational amount of fees  incurred on the rights- holding party during the rights-holding  party's investigation of rights-infringing acts and when the  party initiated legal proceedings.    He explained: The court made that decision because it fully  carried out the principle of "leveling up," which is provided  for by Chinese civil laws. This is so the person whose rights  has been infringed upon can be compensated fully for his losses,  and that he will have less to worry about financially when he is  in a legal tussle with rights-infringing acts. The decision was  also made in reference to relevant stipulations on the  intellectual property rights agreement reached at the Uruguay  Round.    Over the past 14 years, China established a complete legal  system to deal with intellectual property rights. The National  People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee successively  promulgated the Trademark Law, the Patent Rights Law, the  Copyrights Law, and the Anti-Unfair Competition Law.    From 1992 to 1993, the NPC Standing Committee successively  adopted the amended Patent Rights Law and Trademark Law to  extend patent rights protection to chemical substances,  medicines, food, drinks, and condiments; to expand the scope of  patent rights to include imports rights and the scope of patent  rights over production methods to include products; and to  extend trademark protection to service trademarks.    China has also participated actively in international  cooperation in intellectual property rights, performed its  international duty, and joined relevant international  organizations.    Dr. Arpad Bogsch, director general of the World Intellectual  Property Organization, once offered this appraisal: "In terms of  intellectual property rights protection, the speed with which  China accomplishes everything is unparalleled."</p>

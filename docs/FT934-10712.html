			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Photo-cards 'cut credit fraud' THE USE of photographs on credit cards had cut losses through fraud by more than 90 per cent in the five months since its introduction, the National &amp; Provincial Building Society said yesterday. N&amp;P, the eighth largest society, said losses on its 120,000 Visa photocards in circulation between May and October were Pounds 9,000 compared with more than Pounds 100,000 on a similar number of ordinary cards. It claimed that if all UK plastic cards were issued with a laser-engraved photograph and signature of the holder, fraud could be cut from Pounds 165m a year to Pounds 15m. A third of its 350,000 Visa cards are now photocards.</p>

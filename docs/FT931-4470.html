			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Assemble Nationale, Election '93: Mitterrand in 'jobs for the boys' row PRESIDENT Mitterrand yesterday came under a barrage of opposition criticism for using the civil and diplomatic service to find jobs for Socialists facing defeat in this month's parliamentary election. Mr Pierre Joxe, defence minister, was yesterday nominated president of the Cour des Comptes, the body which vets public spending. Responsibility for the defence ministry was assigned to Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy. Le Figaro newspaper quoted a military officer as suggesting the opposition should take over the defence ministry immediately, in anticipation of its inevitable victory in the two rounds of voting on March 21 and 28. Mr Alain Juppe, secretary general of the RPR gaullists, said it was shocking to see a defence minister abandon his post when 14,000 French soldiers were out on often-risky operations. The RPR leader complained that every morning was bringing news of Socialists being 'stuffed into diplomatic jobs, prefectures, central and local government'. From the left, a communist deputy commented wryly that by taking care of his 'chums', the president wanted to make sure that he was not adding to unemployment. Elysee officials countered that Mr Joxe had started his career in the Cour des Comptes, was not standing for election and that the timing of his appointment had been dictated by the previous financial controller reaching statutory retirement age this week. Amid all the campaign-trail accusations, however, it is clear that President Mitterrand is getting ready to exercise his constitutional right to run foreign policy, in anticipation of a RPR-UDF centre-right victory. Both the Elysee and the foreign ministry yesterday flatly rejected opposition allegations that Socialist sympathisers were being favoured in the reassignment of some 30 ambassadors since the start of the year. All those appointed are career diplomats, they pointed out, though it was admitted that those who have substantially made their careers during two five-year stints (1981-86 and 1988-93) of Socialist government may be seizing new posts for fear of being victimised by the incoming administration. The Elysee also denied allegations that a new computer system hooking the presidential staff into the foreign ministry's diplomatic cable traffic is designed to enable Mr Mitterrand to bypass a future conservative foreign minister by issuing his own instructions direct to France's embassies abroad. Elysee officials said that the system was planned two years ago and is just designed to keep the president informed. But there are strong rumours that Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign minister, may go to the Elysee as foreign policy adviser if he is defeated in his parliamentary seat. Mr Juppe warned that, just as in 1986-88 when the centre-right governed, foreign policy would be 'the most difficult element of the cohabitation' with the president. The RPR leader indicated that the incoming conservatives might want to be even more protectionist towards the outside world than the Socialist government. There was, he said, a growing consensus in France that the rules of international trade needed to be changed. Inside the EC, it was fruitless to alter Britain's pro-free trade stance which, he said, had been 'catastrophic' for that country, but France had 'political cards' to play in influencing Germany. Paris, for instance, could support giving Germany a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. From the other end of the political spectrum yesterday came a denunciation of Gatt and British social policy from the 'quadras' group of Socialist ministers and deputies in their forties. They effectively backed Mr Michel Rocard's call for a 'big bang' reorganisation of the French left.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Ford operations behind Vardy's rise to Pounds 4.38m REG VARDY, the multi-franchise motor dealer, increased its pre-tax profit by nearly 11 per cent, from Pounds 3.95m to Pounds 4.38m, in the year ended April 30 1993. The main factor was a rise from Pounds 260,000 to Pounds 660,000 in the contribution from Ford operations. The specialist division, where the market saw a significant downturn, maintained its level of profitability. There was no significant contribution from disposal of property. A sale was expected during the year. Sales totalled Pounds 205m (Pounds 178m) and operating profit came to Pounds 5.02m (Pounds 4.78m), with acquired operations accounting for Pounds 9.21m (Pounds 9.43m) and Pounds 159,000 (Pounds 9,000) respectively. Earnings per share were clipped to 7.1p (7.4p) and the final dividend is 2.9p for a total of 4.2p (4p). Mr Peter Vardy, chairman, said five dealerships had been added to the group since the beginning of May, and further acquisition opportunities were being explored. There was almost Pounds 3m cash in hand.</p>

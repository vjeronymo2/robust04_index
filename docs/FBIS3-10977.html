At  1030 this morning, 31 members of the caravan, including the  Reverend Lucius Walker, arrived in Santiago de Cuba. Their  arrival was welcomed in this way [cheers heard in background]  and it couldn't have been any different.    For the first time, caravan members are visiting several  provinces. According to the Rev. Walker, the group had to be  divided. He said that everyone wanted to visit Santiago de Cuba.    [Begin Walker recording, in English with superimposed  translation into Spanish] We had a little revolution among us,  and of course we won; therefore, it is our privilege to be here  with you. [end recording]    Speaking on behalf of Cuba, Politburo member Esteban Lazo  Hernandez said:    [Begin Lazo recording] We embrace you wholeheartedly and  greet you on behalf of all the people of Santiago de Cuba. [end  recording]    Jose Marti's mausoleum was the first place they visited, but  the historical heritage and a cemetery like this have prompted a  longer visit. They also toured several parts of the city:  Antonio Maceo Revolution Square, then Cespedes Park. A group of  citizens who were aware of their visit was waiting for them.  [cheers and shouts]    At the municipal government building, Mayor (Luis Estruch)  welcomed Walker, who received the city's coat of arms on behalf  of the group. In the afternoon, the Siboney minifarm and the 26  de Julio school were included in their agenda.    This caravan will be in Santiago de Cuba until next  Wednesday. For a province with so many things to show, the  agenda is rather tight and cannot be extended because of the  tiring trip. Members of the caravan said, however, that they had  rested sufficiently on the first day to continue.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 ROB FASHION ISLAND STORE OF $100,000 IN GEMS  </P> <P> Three armed bandits robbed a Newport Center Fashion Island jewelry store  Tuesday, escaping with more than $100,000 in diamonds and other valuables,  police said.  </P> <P> "It appeared to be smooth, professional and well-planned," Police Sgt. Andy  Gonis said.  </P> <P> The robbery occurred about 6:25 p.m. when the three masked men entered Moboco  Fine Jewelry &amp; Gems in the 200 block of Newport Center Drive.  </P> <P> The bandits -- at least two of whom were armed -- walked into the store's outer  lobby and kicked in a security door to gain access to the showroom area, Gonis  said.  </P> <P> Eight employees and customers were held at gunpoint while the bandits grabbed  several pieces of jewelry from the top of the display cases.  </P> <P> No shots were fired and no one was injured, Gonis said.  </P> <P> An employee activated an alarm that signaled a robbery in progress, and police  arrived at the store about a minute later, Gonis said. "But they (robbers) were  gone," he said. "No one saw a car leave. They were in and out in a flash."  </P> <P> Last Thursday, three men attempted to rob a jewelry store at South Coast Plaza  in Costa Mesa but fled empty-handed.  </P> <P> It was not known if the two incidents are connected.  </P></p>

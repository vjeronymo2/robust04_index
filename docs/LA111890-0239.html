			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MIRA COSTA GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL TEAM IS DEFEATED BY CORONA DEL MAR  </P> <P> The Southern Section 5-A girls' volleyball championship plaque took a brief  detour on the way to the Corona del Mar High trophy case.  </P> <P> After Corona del Mar defeated Mira Costa, 15-12, 15-9, 15-8, Saturday night in  the 5-A championship game at Cerritos College, the Sea King players presented  the plaque to their former coach, Charlie Brande.  </P> <P> Middle blocker Lara Carlsen had 18 kills and outside hitter Tracy Schriber  added 13 as the top-seeded Sea Kings won their 22nd consecutive match.  </P> <P> The victory was a bright spot in a somewhat frustrating season for the Sea  Kings. Brande resigned two weeks before the season began in the wake of an  investigation by the Southern Section.  </P> <P> The players practiced on their own for a week before interim Coach Dale  Flickinger was hired.  </P> <P> "We've dedicated the season to Charlie," Carlsen said. "He means a lot to all  of us. This is the greatest feeling."  </P> <P> Flickinger said Brande "was the guy who did all the work with this team. It's a  shame he couldn't have been out here."  </P> <P> Brande watched from the stands as Corona del Mar's avenged a three-game loss to  Mira Costa in last year's final.  </P> <P> The 5-A title was the first since 1978 for the Sea Kings. Corona del Mar (24-1)  advances to the state Division I playoffs, which start this week.  </P> <P> Cindy DeGarceau had 19 kills and Jennifer Smith 12 to lead Mira Costa (20-2).  </P> <P> Corona del Mar trailed in the first game, 12-11, but three kills up the middle  by Carlsen and a block by setter Prentice Perkins gave the Sea Kings the  victory.  </P></p>

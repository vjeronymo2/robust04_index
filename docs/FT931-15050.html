			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Laidlaw gains 20% in first term LAIDLAW, the Ontario-based waste services and school bus operator, lifted first-quarter earnings by 20 per cent. Profits were helped by improvements in its hazardous waste business, lower interest costs, and a rising contribution from 28 per cent-owned ADT, the security and vehicle auction group. Laidlaw said yesterday that relations between the Canadian company and ADT had improved. ADT has complied with the bulk of the demands made by Laidlaw following an acrimonious dispute between the two companies in 1991. These include a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, quarterly reporting and greater representation on ADT's board. The Bermuda-based company is considering using US accounting principles in its financial reports. Laidlaw's earnings rose to USDollars 48.9m, or 18 cents a share, in the three months to November 30, from USDollars 40.6m, or 16 cents a year earlier. Revenues dropped by 2 per cent to USDollars 513m, mainly because of a decline in the Canadian dollar. Equity earnings from ADT and 35 per cent-owned Attwoods, the UK-based waste management group, rose to USDollars 11m from USDollars 8.4m. Laidlaw did not specify the contribution of each company, but said the increase came primarily from ADT. Operating income from hazardous waste rose to USDollars 19.3m from USDollars 15.3m, thanks to the first improvement in volumes and prices in several quarters. But income and margins in the solid waste and school bus operations continued to slide. Laidlaw is restructuring its solid waste operations in the US and Canada. Two businesses have been sold in the past year and further disposals are expected.</p>

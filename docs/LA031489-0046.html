			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P> Business is booming at Loral Conic, a Kearny Mesa manufacturer of telemetry  transmitters used in missiles and satellites. The subsidiary of New York-based  Loral Corp. expects a 50% increase in bookings over the previous year for the  fiscal year ending this month and plans to add 100 employees before Dec. 31,  bringing payroll up to 500.  </P> <P> Loral Conic, which was founded as Conic in 1961 by five scientists who left  Cubic Corp. and acquired by Loral Corp. in 1975, declined to specify revenue  and profit figures. But the company said its bookings, running at a $50-million  annual rate, are typically delivered over an 18-month to two-year period.  </P> <P> Revenue in 1989 will represent a 12% to 15% increase over 1988, President Joel  Schindall said last week. The company has no plans to expand its Balboa Avenue  plant, however. Parent Loral Corp. reported a $74.3-million profit on $1.4  billion in revenue for fiscal 1988.  </P> <P> Loral Conic's telemetry transmitters enable engineers to track the flight of  space vehicles. The company also makes data encoders, space transponders and  "flight termination receivers," or units that scientists use to destroy  missiles when launches go awry.  </P> <P> Loral Conic customers Ford Aerospace, General Electric, Boeing and Martin  represent 60% of the company's total business. The company in November received  an $18-million contract to provide satellite-control equipment to Ford  Aerospace, the largest contract in Loral Conic's history.  </P> <P> The company has spawned two other divisions since 1961: Loral TerraCom and  Loral Instrumentation, both based in San Diego.  </P> <P> The federal Defense Contract Administration recently cited Loral Conic for  awarding 9% of its subcontracts to small businesses, a share that is  significantly above the 5% goal of the agency, Schindall said.

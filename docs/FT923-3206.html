			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / UK fund managers confident of Yes vote UK INSTITUTIONAL fund managers overwhelmingly believe the French will vote Yes in next week's referendum on the Maastricht treaty, according to a survey carried out last week for Smith New Court, the stockbroker. Almost two-thirds of the managers did not expect sterling to be devalued within the European exchange rate mechanism if the French rejected the treaty. The survey confirmed that the Italian lira was the most vulnerable currency in the ERM before yesterday's 7 per cent devaluation; 81 per cent of the fund managers believed a French No vote would have led to downwards realignment of the lira. Most also believed Germany's internationally important Lombard rate would start to fall from near-record levels of 9.75 per cent within the next three months. The investors expected a Lombard rate of 9.58 per cent in three months and 8.41 per cent in a year. The Bundesbank said yesterday it would cut official interest rates today. Falling German interest rates may relieve some of the pressure on Mr John Major, who last week committed himself to a policy of not devaluing sterling. But with French opinion polls indicating that the vote is more finely balanced than institutional investors believe, the survey suggests UK equity markets could be in for a sharp shock if the treaty is rejected. Smith New Court's view is that a No vote would immediately hit equity markets but that longer term rejection could be good for UK companies if it led to a break down of the ERM. The survey, by Gallup covered 99 institutional fund managers who together handle Pounds 531bn of investment funds. In the last month, the fund managers have become more confident that the French will vote Yes; 87 per cent believed the treaty would be accepted compared with 80 per cent who took that view in August.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / People: Transatlantic traffic in directors James Kinnear, a former chief executive of Texaco, and Eric Clark, an executive director of BICC, are the latest examples of the growing trend of companies on both sides of the Atlantic to pick more internationaly-minded directors. Kinnear, 65, who stepped down last year as Texaco's chief executive after nearly 40 years with the US oil giant, has been appointed an advisory director of Unilever with effect from March 1. He joins a ten-strong advisory board which the Unilever board consults on business, social and economic issues. He will also serve on at least one of three committees: audit, remuneration and external affairs. Clark, 59, managing director of BICC Cables, a subsidiary of one of the UK's leading international engineering businesses, has been appointed a non-executive director of Dana Corporation, which provides equipment for the transportation industries and is based in Toledo, Ohio. Clark (right), who has been on Dana's European advisory board since 1991, is the first European to serve on Dana's main board. Dana says that Clark's 'demonstrated commitment to achieving growth through continuous improvement in technology, engineering and lean production techniques is in perfect synch with Dana's own global growth initaitive'. Before joining BICC in 1985, Clark spent 15 years with Plessey.</p>

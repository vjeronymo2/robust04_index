			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 27 Jun (AFP) -- Nigeria's powerful oil and  gas workers' union on Monday [27 June] threatened to call a  strike from next week unless the country's military government  handed over power to Moshood Abiola, the imprisoned  pro-democracy leader.    In a statement, the National Union of Petroleum and Gas  Workers (Nupeng) said it would call a strike from July 4 if the  military did not meet its demand. The statement said that the  military should "quit the political stage now, and permanently."  "The military should restore all the dismantled  democratic/political structures that were in place in 1993, and  call on the acclaimed winner of June 12, 1993 presidential  election to negotiate a peaceful hand-over of the reins of  government to satisfy the yearnings of the teeming millions of  Nigerians who voluntarily gave him that historic mandate."    Abiola has been imprisoned since last Thursday after he  declared he was forming a government to coincide with the  anniversary of the June 12, 1993 elections which were annulled  by the military government. He is widely believed to have won  last year's poll.    Nupeng said that if the government failed to meet these  demands, the union would call a strike "pending the resolution  of the national crisis in order to avoid a situation which may  lead to a bloody revolt."    The strike threat came as military leader General Sani  Abacha  said that a constitutional conference, which opened here Monday,  would determine the date when the ruling military junta will  turn over power to civilians. "This administration will not  `perpetuate' itself in power as insinuated by some people," he  added. "We are committed to a steady process of democratisation.  We are ready to surrender power through a peaceful and orderly  process." But the conference, a cornerstone of the  administration's blueprint for a return to democratic rule, is  viewed by the opposition as "a ruse" for the military to  perpetuate its hold on power.</p>

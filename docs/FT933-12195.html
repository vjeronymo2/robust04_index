			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Support expressed for reform of tenancy tax A CHANGE to the tax regime governing service-charge sinking funds would be supported by nearly 90 per cent of property owners, users and advisers, says a survey by the law firm Cameron Markby Hewitt. It found that reform of taxation on sinking funds - the sum put aside by tenants each year to pay for large items of capital expenditure - to permit a better spread of service charge costs was the most popular of several potential changes to commercial lease law. The next most popular reform would be the removal of empty rates on unlettable buildings, a move backed by nearly eight out of 10 of the respondents. The survey also found that there was strong support for an improvement to the landlord's right to enforce breaches in a tenant's obligation to repair the building. The 120 respondents to the survey were landlords (34 per cent), tenants (8 per cent), companies that combined the functions of landlord and tenant (14 per cent) and others (44 per cent). The government is considering reforms to several aspects of commercial lease law, covering upward-only rent review clauses, confidentiality clauses and dispute resolution procedures. A consultation paper governing these issues was published in May. It has already announced plans to reform the law of privity of contract. What Future for the Institutional Lease?

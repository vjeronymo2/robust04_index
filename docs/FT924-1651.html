			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Delay in telecoms directive sought France will today ask its EC partners to delay applying a directive to create open competition for public telecommunications equipment contracts until European suppliers obtain better access to US and Japanese markets, writes William Dawkins in Paris. Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry and trade minister, said the government had asked the British EC presidency to propose discussion of such a delay at a meeting today of internal market ministers. 'We cannot open our markets if the countries to which we open do not behave in a reciprocal way,' he said. The directive, to take effect from January, will let foreign suppliers bid on equal terms with Community producers for public telecommunications equipment contracts.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Trace Computers Poor market conditions and the cancellation of the Stock Exchange's Taurus computerised settlement system contributed to a decline in profits at Trace Computers. The pre-tax figure for the year to May 31 fell from Pounds 502,000 to Pounds 211,000; turnover was down from Pounds 19.3m to Pounds 18m, mainly as a result of scaling down the computer supplies business. Earnings per share came out at 1.12p (2.87p), and a maintained final of 0.9p is proposed, to give a same-again total of 1.45p.</p>

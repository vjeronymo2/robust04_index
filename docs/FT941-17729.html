			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Black gunmen kill four in attack on crowded Cape Town bar Black gunmen killed four people and wounded five in an attack on a crowded Cape Town bar on Thursday night, the second such attack in the city in six months, Reuter reports from Cape Town. Two men purporting to speak for separate black underground groups - the Azanian People's Liberation Army and the Azanian National Liberation Army - yesterday claimed responsibility for the attack. The authenticity of these calls could not be confirmed yesterday. South African President F W de Klerk said the attack appeared to have been designed to undermine the transition of the country to majority rule. 'There could be no justification for this barbaric deed,' he said. The Law and Order Ministry said claims would be thoroughly investigated. Police offered a R200,000 (Pounds 40,000) reward for information leading to the capture of the killers and set up barriers on all main roads out of Cape Town. Three of the victims were young women shot at close range as they huddled in a corner of the bar, witnesses said. The fourth victim, a man, was cut down by gunfire as he tried to halt the carnage. Several of the dead and wounded were white, witnesses said. The tactics used were similar to those adopted by black gunmen who killed 10 worshippers at St James's Church in Cape Town in July. More than 30 people were wounded and one later died. The gunmen are believed to be still at large.</p>

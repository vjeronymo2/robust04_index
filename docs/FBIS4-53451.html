			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Leading Japanese newspapers  in their editorials Thursday [19 May] supported Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata's freezing of the planned hikes in public service  charges until the end of the year. The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  called the government 's decision "a natural measure." The  business daily said it welcomes the decision because "raising  public service charges has the same effect as raising taxes, and  the government is facing a necessity to reduce taxes to promote  consumption and get over the recession." It also said the  recent rush of planned hikes in public service rates seems to  have been done easily without satisfactory explanation, taking  advantage of the disorder in the government to hoodwink the  public. It called on public utilities to take rationalization  measures as private companies do, and to disclose their business  structures and try to obtain public understanding when they plan  to increase charges.    The ASAHI SHIMBUN also said the decision to shelve the  planned increase in public service charges is natural, although  it was abrupt. The ASAHI said the decision came late because  postal charges and the tolls for Tokyo expressways have already  been increased, but said it supports the decision. It urged  public service companies to work on a drastic restructuring  during the time the freeze is in effect.    The MAINICHI SHIMBUN said it understands the decision by  Hata  although his aim is not so clear, and said not many citizens  object to it. But the MAINICHI warned Hata that consumers will  be very angry if public service charges are raised by a margin  higher than the current increase plans after the freeze ends.</p>

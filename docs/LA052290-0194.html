			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UPDATE / ORLANDO BOSCH;  </P> <P> TERRORIST? PATRIOT? HE VOWS A MARTYR'S DEATH BY FASTING  </P> <P> Six months after he decided to give up his fight to remain in the United States  and accept deportation, Orlando Bosch, the Cuban-born anti-Castro pediatrician  the U.S. government calls a terrorist, remains locked up here in a federal  prison. A State Department source said Monday efforts continue to find a  country willing to take Bosch.  </P> <P> But Bosch's daughter maintains that U.S. officials are lying. "They're not  looking for any place to send him," said Myriam Bosch. "They're just holding  him. They just want him to rot in jail."  </P> <P> Now Bosch, 64, is three days into a seven-day hunger strike designed to put the  U.S. government on notice. If no action is taken within 30 to 60 days after the  week-long strike ends, he said in a statement released by his daughter, he will  fast until death.  </P> <P> "I fear he will starve himself to death," said Myriam Bosch. "And if this  government lets that happen, it will be beyond comprehension. But it's  possible."  </P> <P> The story of Orlando Bosch -- called a patriot by many in Miami's Cuban  community, and a national security risk by the U.S. Justice Department -- has  been a 30-year saga here, and in most accounts it's a tale filled with  intrigue, politics and violence.  </P> <P> After leaving Cuba for exile in Miami in 1960, Bosch briefly practiced medicine  until he was discovered storing explosives in a hospital where he worked. After  that, he became a full-time anti-Castro activist.  </P> <P> In 1968 Bosch was convicted of firing a bazooka at a Polish freighter in the  Miami harbor in what was said to be a protest against that country's trade with  Cuba. Sentenced to 10 years in prison, he was paroled after four. But he fled  the United States in 1974 after being subpoenaed to testify in an inquiry into  the assassination of a controversial exile leader in Miami.  </P> <P> Bosch first turned up in Venezuela, and later, in the employ of the Chilean  secret police. He was back in Venezuala in 1976 when a bomb ripped through a  Cubana airlines plane, killing 73 people, including several members of the  Cuban national fencing team. Bosch was charged with being involved in the  bombing, and although tried three times, he was never convicted.  </P> <P> In February, 1988, after 11 years in Venezuelan jails, he returned to the  United States and was immediately arrested for parole violation. Last November,  after a federal court upheld the government's decision to deport him, Bosch  declined to appeal, saying he would take his chances in a third country.  Although the United States says he will not be sent to Cuba, Bosch's family has  long argued that he would be a target of Castro agents anywhere outside the  United States.  </P> <P> Recently, Bosch has drawn support from Florida Republicans such as U.S. Sen.  Connie Mack and U.S. Rep. Illeana Ros-Lehtinen, and within the Cuban community  people have often taken to the streets to demand he be freed. But his hunger  strike has attracted little notice -- in part, according to his daughter  Myriam, "because there are certain leaders in the Cuban community who don't  want him out; they feel threatened by him."  </P> <P> Myriam Bosch hopes that her father's hunger strike may bring about his release.  "He's kind of weak," she said. "He has bleeding ulcers, angina, and he should  be on a special diet. But what's he going to do, rot in jail for not having  done anything? Frankly, I think the U.S. government has some sort of deal with  Castro. Why else would they not find a country to take him?"  </P></p>

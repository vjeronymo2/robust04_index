			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pressure builds on Spring Ram chief PRESSURE IS mounting on Mr Bill Rooney, chairman and chief executive of Spring Ram, the bathrooms and kitchens group which has seen its share price plunge after three profits warnings within eight months. Institutions led by the Prudential Corporation, Spring Ram's biggest shareholder, are now believed to have the support of 35 per cent of the shareholders for their demand that Mr Rooney resign from the company which he co-founded. Mr Rooney will be under intense pressure to stand down at a board meeting of Spring Ram today. He has said he would be prepared to give up the role of chairman or chief executive, but not both positions. Company sources have suggested that other executive directors would not be prepared to work with an imposed chairman. However, institutional investors believe that they would fall in line with the wishes of shareholders, in spite of their loyalty to Mr Rooney. A key role is likely to be played at today's meeting by Mr Roy Barber, Spring Ram's only non-executive director. A specialist in reviving financially troubled companies, Mr Barber was appointed in April following the first bout of pressure from the Prudential. Mr Rooney and his family trusts own 16 per cent of the group's shares. Other large stakeholders are Baillie Gifford with 6.8 per cent and Schroders with 3.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N. Glukhoyedov, department chief of mineral and </F> raw material base of the Russian Federation State Committee for  Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources and L. Oganesyan, chief  of the Information and Analytical Department of the Russian  Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral  Resources: "The Mineral-Raw Material Base and Geological Service  of the Russian Federation"]    [Text] Around 20,000 mineral deposits have been discovered  and explored in Russia. The inventory of reserves, however, was  conducted under conditions created by a totally different price  system, low-cost energy sources, and cheap shipping services.  Now it is anticipated that the amount of profitable reserves  will decrease by 30-70 percent as a result of re-evaluation of  the various types of raw materials.    Reserves of natural gas, gold, silver, and diamonds in  Russia  are higher than world reserves, but for lead, zinc, and antimony  they are very low--less than 20 years. Its territory lacks  explored reserves of manganese, chrome, and zirconium ores,  high-grade kaolin, barite, and Muscovite mica meeting  contemporary industrial demands.    The mineral and raw material base of oil, gas, pit coal,  iron, nonferrous and noble metals, diamonds, and agrochemical  raw materials, and production capacities and infrastructure that  were formed in past years so far are meeting the needs of Russia  and even yield up to 70 percent of the foreign currency proceeds  of the country through the export of mineral raw material.    At present 37 percent of the best projects are undergoing  industrial assimilation, including the absolute majority of  unique and large deposits which, comprising around 5 percent of  their total number, contain almost 70 percent of the explored  reserves and account for 50 percent of the raw material that is  extracted.    The problem concerning development of the raw material base  of the fuel-energy complex remains a highly important priority  for the geologists. At present 76 percent of oil fields, which  include 93 percent of the reserves, have already been assigned  to oil-producing enterprises. A sharp decrease in the size of  new deposits is taking place. In Western Siberia, for instance,  in 1975 reserves of one deposit amounted on the average to 53  million, in 1985--to 15 million, and in 1991-1993--to 11-13  million tonnes. The average daily extraction of oil per well is  shrinking correspondingly: from 29 tonnes in 1975 to 19 tonnes  in 1985, and 10 tonnes in 1991-1993.    Deposits of pit coal are being exploited to a much smaller  degree (around 14 percent of the recorded reserves and 23  percent of the total number of deposits with an overall volume  of 202 billion tonnes--12 percent of world reserves). The share  of explored reserves of high-grade coking coal and anthracite,  which are in short supply, however, amounts to just 12 percent  of the total reserves in Russia.    Assimilation of deposits of lead, zinc, mercury, zirconium,  and titanium is being delayed for a variety of reasons,  including low quality of the ore, and technological and economic  limitations.    The mining of gold is dominated by placer deposits (71.4  percent of the total extracted), the explored reserves of which  amount to only 26 percent of those recorded in the state  balance. Reserves of placer gold in the main gold-mining regions  will be exhausted in three to 15 years if high rates of  extraction and the lag in geological prospecting work continue,  which, on the basis of world criteria, is evaluated as a deep  crisis of the raw material base.    At the same time, some of the largest indigenous gold ore  deposits have not been assimilated (Sukhoy Log in Irkutsk  Oblast, Vorontsov in Sverdlov Oblast, a number of deposits in  the Northeastern region, Kamchatka, and Khabarovsk Kray). The  bulk of the gold (around 60 percent) is mined in regions of the  Russian Far North. The sharp rise in cost of energy sources,  transportation, and other services may lower that share to 20-30  percent in the immediate future. Compensation of such decreased  extraction by other regions is impossible, because the raw  material base is not prepared.    The needs of Russian industry for manganese, chrome,  mercury,  antimony, titanium, and a number of other types of mineral raw  material is satisfied almost in full by deliveries from former  Union republics. In 1993 884,000 tonnes of chrome ore was  delivered to Russia from Kazakhstan, along with 10-12 million  tonnes of commercial-grade iron ore and 206,000 tonnes of  manganese ore from Ukraine. Mineral raw material imported in  1993 cost Russia a total of $2 billion.    Reserves in the old raw material regions are running out.  The  annually expanding reserves are worked by oil extracting  enterprises of the North Caucasus and the Volga Region, and by  many lead, zinc, tin, and gold mines and mining combines.    There is a lag in the preparation of reserves of  ecologically  protected underground water to be supplied for drinking. Until  now, around 50 percent of the cities and populated points in  Russia, including up to 80 cities with a population of over  250,000, utilize surface water unprotected from pollution  (Moscow, St. Petersburg, Vologda, Kostroma, Kirov, Astrakhan,  Kurgan, Chelyabinsk, Perm, Omsk, and other cities). The rate at  which reserves of ecologically protected underground water  sources are being prepared remains low.    Complex and specialized geological enterprises, as well as  those that have paid orders to satisfy state needs and direct  contracts are being preserved.    One of the most important directions in the development of  geological prospecting work is the creation of modern  enterprises and performance of work for foreign clients. The  joint venture Polyarnoye Siyaniye company for the development of  the Ardalin group of oil fields is the largest one. Geological  prospecting work was performed on the basis of contracts with  foreign firms by the state enterprise  Krasnoleninskneftegazgeologiya ($1 million) as well as  geophysical work by the government enterprise Yeniseygeofizika  ($1.5 million), and by others. In 1993 the joint venture  Dalpacific Minerals in Khabarovsk Kray concluded contracts for  an overall amount of more than $250,000.    The joint venture Geoylbent and the SANK [expansion not  given] Urengoyl were also established in 1993. A number of other  joint ventures are in the stage of formation. This year it is  planned to increase the volume of foreign investments fourfold.    In 1991-1992 several geological expeditions whose workers  get  higher wages and benefits received at mining enterprises as  compared with geological enterprises of the Russian Federation  Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources, were  transferred to the group of mining enterprises.    The most important premises for structural transformation  consist in privatization and auctioning of enterprises. At  present a decision has been made regarding privatization of 27  geological enterprises and materials on 45 organizations are  being prepared by the GKI [State Property Committee] of Russia  and its local organs.    A legislative and standardization base was created for the  use of mineral resources, which is founded on joint management  of mineral resources of the Russian Federation and its subjects,  and on the licensing of the use of mineral resources, including  paid use, (as of 1 April 1994 6,591 licenses were issued for the  right to use mineral resources).</p>

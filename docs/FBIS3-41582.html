Dlouhy was giving a lecture on the problems of the north  Bohemian region, organized by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation for  leading figures of the region.    Dlouhy recalled that over 7.7 billion crowns (about $260  million) had been allocated from the state budget and the State  Environment Fund in 1991-93 for improving the environment. This  contributed to a 36-percent decrease in sulfur-dioxide emissions  compared with 1987, a 32-percent drop in nitrogen-oxide  emissions, and a 58-percent decrease in fly ash emissions.    Dlouhy said that the heritage from the past could only be  removed step-by-step, and added that the completion of two  reactors at the Temelin nuclear power plant in south Bohemia  would be a positive solution also for north Bohemia. He said  the goal in north Bohemia is to shut down 1,600-MW units in  thermal power plants by 1996. Only four of the present eight  north Bohemian mines are to remain in operation in the year  2005, according to Dlouhy.</p>

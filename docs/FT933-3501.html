			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Israel sounds note of caution on future MR YITZHAK RABIN, Israel's prime minister, last night delivered a markedly sober assessment of the next stages of negotiation with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, just hours after the emotionally-charged signing ceremony with the PLO at the White House. In a joint press conference with Mr Shimon Peres, his foreign minister, Mr Rabin laid out Israel's conditions during the installation of an interim period of Palestinian rule in the West Bank and Gaza strip, while issuing a challenge to the international community to back peace - notably the Gulf states. A tired-looking Mr Rabin also acknowledged the commitments made by Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, which enabled Israeli recognition of the organisation. But he said it would represent a change from the past only if the PLO meets these conditions. 'I believe it's a change if the commitments will be fulfilled,' he told reporters. 'We have decided to take a chance, to put him into a test.' Mr Rabin said Israel would insist on several 'key issues' during the next round of discussions with the PLO. He said 'united Jerusalem must remain united under Israel's sovereignty and our capital forever,' adding that the issue of Jerusalem's status could nevertheless be discussed in negotiations towards a final settlement. 'They are allowed to raise it,' he said. He also said he wanted no existing Israeli settlements to be uprooted. In addition, Israel would insist on keeping full responsibility for all Israelis in settlements in Gaza and the West Bank. 'None of them (the settlers) will come under the authority of the Palestinians in the council,' he said, referring to the authority to be elected in nine months of the start of the declaration of principles signed yesterday. Mr Rabin also sketched a sombre picture of the economic needs of the West Bank and, particularly Gaza, where he said: 'All the miseries - you can find there.' He said Israel already spent Dollars 350m (Pounds 227m) a year on basic needs there, but said international aid would be necessary to make peace work. In a direct appeal to the Gulf states, whose relations with the PLO have been icy since Mr Arafat's pro-Iraqi stand in the Gulf war, he said: 'Will the world, which speaks so much about peace, will it be ready to take even more than that?' Then he added: 'It can be done,' he added. 'It depends on the realisation of the Arab rich countries who don't like Arafat . . . at least to give money to the territories.' In what had become a downbeat coda to the sunlit euphoria of the morning signing, Mr Rabin said: 'If we do not create a hope, a real one that is based on realities to the Gazans, that as a result of this agreement their conditions will be improved - I don't know if this whole ceremony will lead to a solution.'</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (4): Britain leads the pack - Deborah Hargreaves compares the runners in the 'dash for gas' HIGH HOPES of a rapid European 'dash for gas' in power generation have collapsed. But the drive to replace coal- or oil-fired electricity stations with new environmentally-friendly gas plants remains a potent force in continental Europe - it is just not happening as fast as in the UK. The EC's large combustion plant directive which forces governments to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions by 60 per cent by 2003 is prompting a move towards gas-fired power on the continent. However, in the past two years, prices for heavy fuel oil - which is burned in some power stations - with low sulphur content have dropped considerably. In addition, in many countries electricity demand has declined with the recession, delaying the need for new capacity. The Netherlands, Germany and Italy are the three other European countries to burn a significant amount of gas in power stations, apart from the UK. The three continental countries use between 8bn and 11bn cubic metres of gas a year for gas-fired electricity generation. The UK will reach usage of around 8bn cubic metres by the end of next year. 'There is a general widespread assumption that there is large demand for gas on the continent driven by the conception that gas is the fuel of choice for power stations, but when you go through the countries one by one you realise that there are not that many projects,' said one industry consultant. However, views vary considerably about whether the rest of Europe will jump on the gas bandwagon. Arthur D. Little, the management consultants group, estimates that gas demand in Europe will rise by 55 per cent over the next 20 years from 300bn cubic metres to 450bn cubic metres with much of the new demand coming from power stations. 'The dash for gas is not just a British phenomenon. We see the power generation market as being the fastest growing sector of gas demand across Europe,' said Mr John Wood-Collins, managing director of Arthur D. Little. According to Caminus Energy, the energy consultancy group, the EC Commission is expecting the use of gas to double in the power sector across the EC. But this means gas will still only meet 16 per cent of electricity supplies by 2000. This compares with up to 25 per cent in the UK by 1998 - up from nil in 1990. Italy has been planning a significant increase in gas-fired plant for some time with Enel, the state electricity generator, predicting a big switch from heavy fuel oil into gas. Plans have been scaled back as fuel oil prices have declined, but Italy still plans to convert to 25 per cent gas-fired power by 2000 compared with 18 per cent in 1990. Germany is currently building one gas-fired station in Dresden and another in Stada on the north coast. But Ruhrgas, the country's major gas supplier, has said recently that most of Germany's new power demand will be met by coal-fired generation. The International Energy Agency, the west's energy monitoring body, expects gas to meet 14 per cent of Germany's electricity supply needs by 2000, an increase from 7 per cent in 1991. Two plants are planned in the Netherlands with start-up due in 1996 and Belgium is building two gas-fired stations. This compares with plans for 20 plants in the UK - and even this has been scaled back from earlier projections. Elsewhere in Europe, the biggest gas turbine equipment in the world has just been completed outside Paris, but the plant will burn gas at peak times only which could be as little as 20 hours a year. France remains committed to its nuclear programme, and appears more interested in clean coal technology than additional gas plant. Spain is looking at augmenting its electricity capacity with gas-fired stations which will use Algerian gas from the new Maghreb pipeline which is expected to start running by 1996. Algerian gas will double Spain's gas capacity and the country's electricity industry is looking at constructing gas plant. Portugal is currently building a large coal-fired power station in the north and has no immediate plans for gas. Eastern European countries are looking to replace some of their highly-polluting, coal-fired stations with gas capacity, but few concrete projects are under consideration. In Scandinavia, Sweden has committed itself to phase out nuclear power stations by 2010 - nuclear currently provides around half of the country's power needs - and some of it could be replaced by gas. The dash for gas in the UK was prompted initially by the privatisation of the electricity industry and the resulting industry structure, but cheap gas prices also created huge demand. The creation of the duopoly of National Power and PowerGen as England's and Wales's (not Scotland's) only non-nuclear generators left many of the regional electricity companies eager to escape the yoke of the generators and build their own power stations once they were privatised. By March 1991 the dash for gas was turning into a stampede, forcing British Gas to ratchet up its prices in an effort to cut off demand. By the end of April 1992, the National Grid was predicting 60 per cent surplus capacity in the market if all 28 stations which had applied for grid connections were built by 1997 as planned. However, since then some companies have dropped out: National Grid says eight stations have either been cancelled or deferred, putting the surplus capacity at between 24 per cent and 37 per cent by 1995 to 1996. Three of the remaining 20 stations have already been opened: Lakeland Power's Roosecote plant in Barrow-in-Furness, Enron's Teesside station which is one of the largest CHP plants in the world at Teesside and was opened in April, and PowerGen's Killingholme plant on Humberside. The Teesside plant which has four regional electricity companies as partners provides graphic evidence of the attractions of gas-fired generation. The station is fully computerised and employs just 65 people compared with 650 workers at a coal plant of similar size. In addition, Teesside emits half the carbon dioxide of a coal plant, its sulphur emissions are negligible and it produces one-ninth of the nitrous oxide waste of a coal plant. The environmental benefits of gas-fired electricity generation are overwhelming. But gas must compete on price with other sources of fuel and it is not as easy to transport as oil and coal. The use of gas in power stations is on the increase in Europe, but a fully-fledged dash for gas on the continent is still some way off.</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Swedish Social Democrats look to form coalition government Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Sweden's prime minister-elect, last night held out the possibility of forming a broad-based coalition government following his Social Democratic party's general election victory on Sunday. The speaker of the Swedish parliament, the Riksdag, called on Mr Carlsson to form a government with the 'widest possible base'. A spokeswoman for Mr Carlsson said he would discuss forming a coalition with other party leaders, including Mr Bengt Westerberg, the Liberal leader and member of the outgoing right-centre coalition, before reporting back to the speaker today. A Social Democrat-Liberal government would be widely welcomed by the financial markets and Swedish industry as being likely to produce tough action to curb Sweden's big budget deficit and fast-growing public debt. However, both Mr Carlsson and Mr Westerberg played down the chances of such an alliance because of the Liberals' weak performance on Sunday, when their share of the vote fell to 7.2 per cent from 9.1 per cent in the last election. Mr Carlsson indicated he could instead form a minority government which would seek co-operation on individual issues with other parties. 'My aim is to build an effective government of co-operation,' he said. The Social Democrats emerged winners over the four-party coalition led by Mr Carl Bildt's conservative Moderate party but fell 13 seats short of a parliamentary majority. The former communist Left party and the Environment party made significant gains. Fears that the Social Democrats might rely on the left prompted a sharp rise in long-term interest rates and a fall in the Swedish krona on the Stockholm stock exchange when markets opened yesterday. Markets steadied later after Mr Carlsson said his priorities were strong government, correcting the crisis in public finances and winning the referendum on November 13 on Sweden's entry to the European Union. Social Democratic officials said Mr Carlsson, who is expected to take office in two weeks' time, intended to unveil a budget strengthening package in the autumn, before the annual budget due in January.

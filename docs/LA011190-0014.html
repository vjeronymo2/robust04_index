			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KOVIC STATEMENT  </P> <P> I am writing in response to Ron Kovic's statement (Jan. 9) that he is " . . .  asking people to write to me, to call me, to come up to me on the street. . . .  "  </P> <P> I have not forgotten Vietnam or the connection of Vietnam to what is happening  with the United States today, both in domestic and international arenas.  </P> <P> Robert Dornan is an epitome of the worst of this country. I thought your  characterization of him as appealing to people's fears was exactly right. I  also think it showed considerable political acumen about how you might pitch a  campaign to defeat him.  </P> <P> NANCY PRESS  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

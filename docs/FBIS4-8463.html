			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gezim Qinami] </F>   [Text] This morning Public Order Minister Agron Musaraj  and Deputy Foreign Minister Arian Starova summoned the military  attaches and diplomats of foreign embassies in our country to  inform them about the criminal act of the Greek special commando.    Describing the circumstances of the criminal act on the  basis  of the evidence and presenting those present with the facts and  indisputable evidence, Musaraj cited arguments to show that this  act was committed by a Greek commando unit. He stressed that  proceeding from the way the crime was committed, the number of  the participants, the automatic weapons used, which resulted in  the killing of two militaries, the wounding of three others, and  much material damage, it is clear that we have to do with a  terrorist act organized and committed by Greek special forces.    Starova informed the military attaches and diplomats about  special aspects of the Albanian Government's position on  Greece's serious act of infringing Albania's sovereignty and  territorial integrity. He stressed that the Albanian Government  has not yet received an official response from the Greek  Government.    Regarding the statements of Greek Government spokesman  Venizelos, Starova said that these cannot be considered a  response. He pointed out, however, that in his second statement  Venizelos finally remembered to console the families of the dead.    He added that we are expecting an official response from the  Greek Government on this criminal act committed by the Greek  special forces. Without this, it is difficult to conduct a  dialogue between the Albanian and Greek sides. Starova also  stressed that the only answer from the Greek side has been the  expulsion of the first secretary of the Albanian Embassy in  Athens, a vengeful and very unfair action.    Musaraj and Starova answered many questions. At the end, the  military attaches and the diplomats of the embassies expressed  their condolences to the dead and wounded in this criminal act  committed by the Greek special forces.</p>

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Growing worries on Irish punt THE DOLLAR failed to make new headway against the D-Mark and sterling yesterday, although the underlying tone for the US currency remains bullish into the new year, writes James Blitz. After peaking at DM1.6235 in Tuesday's trading, the dollar yesterday closed unchanged on the day at DM1.6140. Sterling also managed to gain some lost ground against the dollar, peaking at around Dollars 1.5150 in European trading. But it later fell back to close slightly weaker on the day at Dollars 1.5125. With the approach of new year, the dollar was never likely to make much more headway because of thin trading in markets. Many European centres, including Germany, Belgium and Denmark, are closed today for the traditional holiday. Thin trading was also cited as a reason why the dollar failed to gain yesterday from another good set of US indicators. The currency was unaffected by the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index, which rose to 59.75 per cent in December from 54.2 per cent the previous month. US leading indicators also rose by 0.8 per cent in November after a revised 0.5 per cent gain in October. The end of the dollar rally partly explains the D-Mark's firmer performance inside the European Exchange Rate Mechanism yesterday. The German currency was helped by comments on Tuesday night from Mr Lothar Muller, a member of the Bundesbank council, who said that short-term German rates were unlikely to come down until the country's performance on inflation allowed them to do so. The French franc weakened slightly against the D-Mark, closing at FFr3.410 from a previous FFr3.404. Operators continue to believe that there will be active speculation against the French franc early in 1993 unless German monetary policy eases significantly. The French bank, Societe Generale, was quoted as saying that the franc would be fragile in the first quarter of 1993. The Irish punt continued to languish at the bottom of the ERM grid. It remained weak against the Belgian franc, at BFr54.10, compared to a floor of BFr54.025. There was speculation in markets yesterday that the Irish authorities may abandon plans to abolish exchange controls today in line with the European Community's Single Market programme. However, an official at the Central Bank of Ireland confirmed yesterday that the move would be removed. Mr Steve Barrow, an economist at Chemical Bank in London, believes there could be heavy speculation against the Irish punt from Monday, and that a devaluation as early as the following weekend cannot be ruled out. However, Mr Nick Hunt, head of foreign exchange at the Bank of Ireland in Dublin, said the currency would not fall victim to huge selling because the Irish punt market remains fairly illiquid.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 142;  </P> <P> HELPING VETERANS  </P> <P> Proposition 142 on the Nov. 6 ballot, the Veterans' Bond Act of 1990, can be  unreservedly recommended. Continuing a remarkably successful program that first  began in 1921, Proposition 142 authorizes a $400-million bond issue to finance  the Cal-Vet program of home and farm purchases by veterans.  </P> <P> Over the last 69 years California voters have approved 23 veterans' bond issues  totaling about $7.1 billion. Throughout its long history, Cal-Vet has been  entirely self-supporting. There has been no direct cost to taxpayers.  </P> <P> Money raised by the sales of Cal-Vet bonds is used by the Department of  Veterans Affairs to buy homes, farms and mobile homes for resale to qualifying  veterans. The state, because of its heavy participation in financial markets,  is able to borrow money at interest rates considerably below those charged  individuals. These advantageous rates are passed along to Cal-Vet program  participants.  </P> <P> Monthly payments made by participating veterans to the Department of Veterans  Affairs cover all principal, interest and operating costs. Besides directly  benefiting veterans and their families, Cal-Vet contributes to the larger state  economy by generating jobs in the construction industry and promoting economic  activity in those trades and professions that serve the housing market.  </P> <P> More than 392,000 California veterans have been able to finance homes and farms  under the Cal-Vet program. The 1990 Veterans' Bond Act will open the housing  market to thousands of additional veterans. We urge a yes vote on Proposition  142.  </P></p>

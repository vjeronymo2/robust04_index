			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 17 (CTK) -- The Petition Committee  which organized a petition drive for a referendum has accused  President Michal Kovac of "grossly dishonoring the sacred  constitutional, human and natural rights of citizens" and  questioning the will of citizens, who did not set their exact  address in the petition list".    In a statement published by the daily REPUBLIKA today, the  committee says that checking regularity of the petition lists by  an accounting company is a gross violation of protections of  citizens' personal data. The committee urges Kovac, "in line  with the Constitution, the legal order, his conscience and his  constitutional oath, to enable citizens to realized their basic  human, civic, political and natural rights".    On Wednesday [16 March], the Presidential Office announced  that the referendum on early elections and other questions,  pushed for by the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS),  would not take place, since the constitutionally required  350,000 valid petition signatures had not been attained.    The petition drive was launched in late February. On March 2  the Petition Committee handed to the Presidential Office 21,000  lists with 422,054 signatures. However, the Presidential Office  found many of them invalid.</p>

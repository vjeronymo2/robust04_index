			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (3): The nuances of protest - The state's labour relations In Calcutta's crowded business district, traffic not infrequently comes to a halt so that a protest march of workers can go by. After 16 years of Marxist rule, it is not surprising that trade unions in West Bengal are more powerful than their counterparts in other Indian states. A long history of industrialisation and trade unionism has made West Bengal's workers more aware of their rights yet, contrary to popular belief, more disciplined. 'Labour unions in West Bengal are professionally run, and fears that they are more militant than in other states are imaginary,' says Mr AC Majumdar, labour adviser to the Bengal Chamber of Commerce of Commerce and Industry. 'On the contrary, managers say they would rather deal with West Bengal labour because they are more mature, and understand the nuances of unionism.' Mr Majumdar, who until recently was director, personnel, at Andrew Yule, a Calcutta-based government undertaking, says that he managed 20,000 workmen and saw no unrest in the 20 years he worked with the company. He points out that labour, especially in the traditional engineering industry in the state, is highly skilled, and adapts to new skills very quickly. 'The composition of industrial workers is also clearly defined here,' he says. Workers usually have industry-wide settlements to determine wage structures. In the engineering industry, most of the 400,000 employees work for state concerns, and are not migratory, unlike the 300,000 workers each in the tea and jute industries and the 100,000 workers in cotton. 'This fosters a sense of belonging and responsibility to the state,' says Mr Majumdar. 'They have coped well in the switchover from conventional to modern industry.' In a state where industrial decline has been the norm for nearly two decades, the unions face a grim task in fighting plant closures, especially of public sector undertakings that are declared sick by the central government. The Delhi directive that there should be no new recruitment has only added to the state's already heavy burden of unemployment. There are 5m registered unemployed in the state, with 400,000 more unemployed being registered each year. Mr Shanti Ranjan Ghatak, West Bengal's labour minister, says that though unions in the state have different ideologies, depending on which political party they are affiliated to, they work as a united force to take up the genuine grievances of workers. The Left Front government is often called upon by the unions and employers to intervene, and has successfully mediated in recent labour problems in the jute industry, and at such large companies as Bata India and ITC's Tribeni Tissues. Last year, the government's conciliatory machinery handled 8,365 disputes, solving 4,058 cases, 1,028 of them through conciliation alone. The labour ministry has admonished industry for using lock-outs because of financial or internal problems. 'The working class showed commendable restraint, maturity and unity in the face of provocation,' a Department of Labour report noted last year. However, Mr Krishan Lal Chugh, chairman of ITC, an associate of BAT Industries, says that the best strategy for the state government would be to make a pro-business statement, instead of merely interpreting labour acts. 'What's good for business is good for labour' he says. Commending the workers in the state for their high degree of discipline, skill and intelligence, Mr Chugh says that the best agreements to resolve labour disputes are ones that are linked to productivity. Tribeni Tissues, a paper company which amalgamated with ITC in 1990, faced labour strife and a lock-out for over three months before negotiating a satisfactory settlement, with a productivity incentive plan at its core. Mr RN Sen of IFB Industries, which manufactures washing machines in technical collaboration with Siemens, the German engineering company, says the attitude of labour in the state has changed, with the government as a watchdog. 'The image that labour is full of strife in West Bengal was acquired with the wave of militancy in the late 1960s and early 1970s,' says Mr JP Chowdhary, managing director of Titagarh Steels and a staunch advocate of industrial revival in the state. 'That image is changing, and what distinguishes West Bengal labour is that once you sign a settlement, it is honoured. There is no hit and miss with them, because labour unions have evolved in this state.' Mr Chowdhary says he is amazed by the degree of knowledge that most labour leaders exhibit. 'I don't think there are many other places in the country where you can hear a union leader discussing contributional analysis, or optimum product mix planning,' he says. The labour unions themselves are threatened by the government's new attitude to liberalisation. 'We are not opposed to foreign investment in certain areas,' explains Mr Chittabrata Majumdar, secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, which is affiliated to the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) and has a membership of 1.1m. 'But the core sector, like heavy industry, steel and power generation must remain in the hands of the government. The private sector is interested only in selling capital and consumer goods, and their unchecked entry will ultimately destroy our industrial sector.' The unions are fighting to revive West Bengal's sick public sector enterprises. They blame the state's rampant unemployment on the unwillingness of the Delhi government to revive loss-making units. 'Opening the floodgates to foreign companies is not the answer,' says the trade union leader.</p>

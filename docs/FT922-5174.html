			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: The accountants' audit Judging by yesterday's figures from the big UK accountants, the Accounting Standards Board has a strong case for extending its brief. As usual, the various partnerships declined to volunteer how much they profited from the vicissitudes of their clients. The largest among them quietly slipped in a prior-year adjustment to give the appearance of a flat performance, when the truth was slightly worse. Legal obligations aside, when it comes to disclosure they are up there with the worst of their clients. All the same, one gathers that accountants are not much different from other service companies. Granted, they were late into this recession, while their greater diversity of operations gave a degree of protection at group level - Arthur Andersen increased fee income in its consulting business by 30 per cent. More generally, UK demand for insolvency and tax advice was steady enough to offset some of the pressure on the basic audit business, while corporate finance for smaller companies was surprisingly resilient. Nevertheless, lower corporate activity and increased competition led to some painful adjustments last year. Price Waterhouse, for example, reduced its UK cost base by nearly Pounds 30m. In the absence of recovery among its clients, it is unable to rule out a further round of cuts. But until they disclose profits, only the partners will know whether they are doing a good job.</p>

The chances of a Prime Ministerial visit to Washington will  also depend on the outcome of the talks here between Indian  officials and Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel from  Tuesday, and Deputy Secretary of State Strove Talbott in the  first week of April.    The fact that the U.S. is despatching two senior officials  to  India within a fortnight has given rise to hope as well as  apprehensions. There is hope that the Clinton Administration  may be seriously trying to improve relations and clear up  misunderstandings arising from certain unfortunate observations  regarding Kashmir, human rights and the "Sikh rights". At the  same time there exist apprehensions that the officials may only  articulate the now-too- familiar stand of the Administration and  attempt to bring pressure to bear on NPT [Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty], MTCR [Missile Technology Control  Regime] and other such issues.    The Indian side expects the two senior officials to clarify  the U.S. Administration's stand on all these issues. New  Delhi's serious concern at the possible supply of more F-16  aircraft to Pakistan as a "one-time exception" through a  Congressional waiver of the Pressler Amendment has been voiced  in strong terms by the Prime Minister, the External Affairs  Minister and the Chief of Air Staff. Such an act will upset the  balance of power in the region, escalate the arms race and force  India to divert more resources to defence to safeguard its  security. That will not be a friendly act, Ms. Raphel and Mr  Talbott will be told.    A visit by the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, to  Washington is still in the realm of uncertainty though officials  on both sides have been talking about it in the hope that an  Indo-U.S. summit will help clear up the misunderstandings and  also expand the already strong economic relations between the  two countries. But the fact remains that no formal invitation  has so far been extended by the Clinton Administration to Mr Rao  to visit Washington. This being the case, Indian side does not  want to give the impression that it is keen on such a visit  while the Clinton Administration is not or that success of such  a visit would be ensured if India fell in line as regards the  U.S. suggestions on NPT, MTCR and Kashmir.    The U.S. Secretary of State, Mr Warren Christopher, has  tried  to put the issue of Indo-U.S. relations in perspective by  referring to United States' "great admiration" for India and  "very high respect" for it. At the same time he has pointed out  that "as with many friends we have problems with India" on  issues like nuclear non-proliferation and human rights. The  Indian side recognises that differences on several issues  between the world's two largest democracies have persisted over  the decades and will continue in the future. But observations  like questioning the legality of Kashmir's accession to India  and excessive concern for human rights have conveyed the feeling  that there is a decisive U.S. tilt in favour of Pakistan.    Following the passage of the unanimous Parliamentary  resolution, it is not open to the Indian Government to negotiate  the status of Kashmir, and the Prime Minister has already said  that there is no question of a dispute between India and  Pakistan over Kashmir. Political opinion in the country is also  sharply divided on the question of India trying to make up with  the United States regardless of the existing controversies.    Many ruling party members feel that the fate of Indo-US  relations should not hinge on the statements of a few foreign  office officials, and that the two countries should cooperate  with each other in economic and other fields. However, another  section in the party as also in the Opposition, has accused the  Government of prevaricating in responding to the provocative  statements made by U.S. officials and by President Clinton  himself. They feel that the Government should strongly resist  U.S. interference in India's internal affairs, its encouragement  to Pakistan which is sponsoring terrorism against India and its  bolstering Pakistan's strength by resuming the supply of F-16s  under the pretext of capping its nuclear programme. Although  Pakistan's former Chief of Army Staff General Aslam Beg is on  record saying that Islamabad's nuclear programme has already  been capped, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has recently declared  categorically that "there is no question of Pakistan capping its  nuclear programme."</p>

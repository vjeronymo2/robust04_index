			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: Voters find no heroes to elect FRANCE'S imagination this weekend has been caught far more by the courage of its General Philippe Morillon in Bosnia, standing firm by the besieged inhabitants of Srebrenica, than by the first round of its parliamentary elections at home. With no such heroes to vote for, the French electorate seemed during the campaign indifferent to the Socialist government's quiet death and unexcited even by the prospect of a landslide victory for the centre-right parties. France's leading political commentators reckon this has been one of the dullest election campaigns for years. Early exit polls indicated a surprisingly high 69 per cent turnout. Yet the campaign itself was lacklustre for several clear reasons. For one thing, the result has been a foregone conclusion since the Socialists' humiliation in last year's regional elections, in which they pulled in an ignominious 18.3 per cent of the vote. For another thing, voters are tired of being asked to choose between parties led by the same old figures who have dominated French politics for 15 years. Proof of this is the fact that polls show the UPF alliance of conservative RPR plus centre-right UDF has taken only very slight advantage from the Socialists' steep decline in popularity. Socialists and allies won 37.5 per cent in the last general election, down to around 20 per cent according to the most recent opinion polls, while the UPF has inched up from just over 40 per cent to around 42. The gainers have been the two ecology parties, up from almost nothing in 1988 to 16 per cent by the end of last year then down to 8.5 and 9 per cent according to the first exit polls yesterday evening taken before polling closed in the big cities, where their support is high. Apart from this change in their fortunes, the campaign held no last-minute surprises, though exit polls showed a small recovery in the fortunes of the extreme right-wing National Front to 12 per cent of the vote. Not only the personalities, but their ideas too, have failed to galvanise the electorate. For the campaign has underlined how the general thrust of the policies of right and left have been broadly similar. Where there has been a debate on the big problem of the day, the 10.5 per cent unemployment rate, it has centred on details. The Socialists have talked of encouraging work-sharing, while the right has called for cuts in social charges on employers - reinforcing the impression that neither side really knows what to do about joblessness. Mr Michel Rocard later tried to grab attention by calling for a political 'big bang', the creation of a centre-left grouping, only to lose the public relations advantage a few days later by publicly criticising President Francois Mitterrand. The right's campaign has been cautious, because it knew all along that the only thing it had to do to win was to avoid mistakes. On top of this, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF, and Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR, are interested less in yesterday's outcome than in the presidential election in 1995, when both could be fighting to succeed Mr Mitterrand.</p>

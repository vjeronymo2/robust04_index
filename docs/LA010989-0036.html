			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUARD CALLED, CLEANUP BEGINS AFTER TORNADOES STRIKE 3 STATES  </P> <P> National Guardsmen were called out in Illinois and Kentucky as cleanup began  Sunday in three states struck by tornadoes that injured more than 50 people and  damaged or destroyed scores of homes and businesses.  </P> <P> Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson toured Allendale and said he planned to declare  the town a state disaster area today. He also sent about 100 National Guardsmen  to prevent looting and help clean up the town, where more than a third of the  homes and commercial buildings were destroyed in the Saturday evening storm.  </P> <P> In southwestern Indiana, the same storm system spawned a twister that injured  three people and damaged or destroyed 30 homes and about 25 to 30 farm  buildings in the St. Thomas area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Damage in Central Indiana  </P> <P> Later, near Forest Hill in central Indiana, the storm damaged several houses  and farm buildings in a sparsely populated area, causing an estimated $500,000  damage, Sheriff's Deputy Jim Baylis said. No injuries were reported.  </P> <P> In south-central Kentucky, a tornado struck near midnight in outlying areas of  Franklin, causing an estimated $10 million to $12 million in damage to  businesses and homes, Simpson County Judge-Executive Ken Harper said Sunday.  </P> <P> Gov. Wallace Wilkinson authorized sending Kentucky National Guard troops to  help prevent looting and keep traffic flowing, said David Adkinson, operations  manager for Kentucky Disaster and Emergency Services.  </P> <P> In Allendale, the tornado cut through a 10-block area that makes up about half  the town of 600.  </P> <P> "The east half of the town's gone," said Marvin Jones, an ambulance driver.  "Most of the streets are blocked by wires and trees and debris . . . .  Belongings are scattered everywhere."  </P></p>

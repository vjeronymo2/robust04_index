			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Zou Jiahua's televised speech on safe production; from the </F> "National News Hookup" program]    [Text] A safe production week campaign will be launched  across the country 16-22 May this year. Vice Premier Zou Jiahua  delivered a television speech on the campaign.    [Begin Zou Jiahua recording] During the safe production week  campaign, the people's governments and the departments concerned  at all levels should firmly seize the opportunity. Leading  cadres at various levels should set an example in treating it as  an important task. The safe production week campaign should be  unfolded truly in an organized, well-guided, and down-to-earth  way. It is necessary to stress actual results and prevent  formalism. It is necessary to use the news and propaganda media  and adopt lively and effective measures to give a concentrated  publicity to the principles and policies of the party and the  government concerning the safety in production.    People should be commended for good deeds in safe  production.  Anyone who neglects safety in production should be exposed. The  wrongdoing of acting recklessly and violating the operating  rules should be resolutely stopped. We should guide and  supervise enterprises so that they pay great attention to safety  at all times.    We should mobilize all quarters of society so that they  attach importance to safety in production and be concerned about  it. In this way, we will create a good social climate in which  everyone is concerned about safety and ensures safety in  everything.    All enterprises should regard production safety as very  urgent work and do it well. They should take up the  responsibility for safe production. In light of the reality of  their own trade, they should mobilize the masses to check  loopholes and adopt measures to eliminate hidden danger, solve  conspicuous problems concerning production safety, and ensure  safe production.    Ensuring production safety is very important work and of  benefit to both the country and the people. It is also a  protracted, complex, and arduous task. We must constantly  stress it, pay attention to it everyday, and do it daily. We  should do all we can to perform our duties on our jobs and take  the initiative in making even greater contributions to safety in  production and to the long-term peace and stability in our  country. Thank you! [end recording]</p>

The seller shall delay delivery of the handgun(s) until 5 business days (meaning days on which State Offices are open) have elapsed from the date the seller has furnished notice of the contents of the statement to the Chief Law Enforcement Officer. (Unless within the 5-day period the seller has received notice from the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the place of residence of the buyer that the buyer's receipt or possession of the handgun(s) would not violate the law.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. After the seller has provided notice of the contents of the buyer's intent to obtain a handgun(s) to the Chief Law Enforcement Officer, this form must be maintained as part of the seller's permanent records, regardless of whether the transfer occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. If prior to the expiration of the 5-day waiting period or prior to actual delivery of the handgun(s) to the buyer, the seller receives notification from the Chief Law Enforcement Officer that the officer has information that the possession or receipt of a handgun by the buyer would violate the law, the seller is prohibited from transferring the handgun(s) to the buyer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Any seller, who after the transfer of an handgun(s) receives a report from a Chief Law Enforcement Officer containing information that the receipt or possession of the handgun(s) by the buyer would violate the law, shall within 1 business day communicate all information that the seller has about the transfer and the buyer to a) the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the place of business of the Seller and b) the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the place of residence of the buyer.

After the seller has provided a copy of this form to the Chief Law Enforcement Officer, any subsequent proposal(s) made by the same buyer to obtain a handgun(s) requires the execution of a new ATF Form 5300.35.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. After the seller has completed the handgun(s) transaction, the original ATF Form 5300.35 becomes part of the seller's permanent records. ATF Form 5300.35 must be attached to the ATF Form 4473 that reflects the handgun transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Instructions to Chief Law Enforcement Officials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. This form contains the statement of intent to obtain a handgun(s) by the person identified in Section A. The seller may not lawfully deliver the handgun(s) to the buyer until 5 business days have elapsed from the date the seller furnished notice of the contents of this statement to you, or you have notified the seller within the 5-day period that you have no information that the buyer's receipt or possession of the handgun(s) would violate Federal, State, or local law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. You are required to make a reasonable effort to ascertain within the 5-day period whether the buyer's receipt or possession of a handgun(s) would violate the law, including research in whatever State and local recordkeeping systems are available to you, and in any national system designated by the Attorney General. For your information, the receipt or possession of a handgun by a person who falls within any category of persons listed in Section A, Item 5, would violate Federal law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. At the earliest possible time, you should advise the seller if the buyer's receipt or possession of the handgun(s) would violate the law. Unless you notify the seller that the buyer's receipt or possession of a handgun(s) would violate the law, the seller may deliver the handgun(s) to the buyer. Notification either during or after the 5-day waiting period may prevent the unlawful receipt of a handgun(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Unless you determine that the buyer's receipt or possession of the handgun(s) would violate the law, you shall, within 20 business days from the date of the buyer's statement, destroy this form, any record containing information derived from this form, and any record created as a result of the notice of the contents of this form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. If you determine that the buyer is ineligible to receive or possess a handgun(s), you should maintain this form. The buyer may request that you provide the reason(s) for such determination and you must provide such reason(s) to the buyer within 20 business days after the receipt of the request. Your retention of this form may assist you in responding to such inquiries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

[Al-Darawshah] The incident is tragic. Around 40 of our  Palestinian sons were martyred in Hebron and adjacent areas.  This incident, which was planned and was carried out by the  extremist settlers, is chiefly aimed at torpedoing the peace  process and at killing the largest number of our Palestinian  people. This is a tragedy. The Israeli Government is  responsible for this incident. The settlers are also  responsible. I believe the consequences will be grave.    I contacted Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin twice today and  asked him to withdraw the army from Hebron and the Palestinian  towns and to guarantee that the settlers do not enter the  Palestinian areas. I also asked him to disarm the settlers, the  thugs, who attack the Palestinians. Regrettably, the killings  are continuing. The martyrs who fell in these past few hours  were not killed by settlers' guns but by the army forces.    [Husayn] What was Yitzhaq Rabin's response?    [Al-Darawshah] Rabin said he was studying the issue and that  he is in constant contact with the army. He said he instructed  the army not to shoot to kill. But this response is not  sufficient, because, regrettably, the killings are continuing.  A curfew has been declared in Hebron and the adjacent area.  But this is not normal, because the Palestinian people are  entitled to demonstrate and to express their sorrow and pain for  the incident. That is something natural. This is what I told  Rabin during my discussion with him. I told him the Palestinian  people have the right to demonstrate and to voice their anger  and extreme pain. He must withdraw the army from the towns.</p>

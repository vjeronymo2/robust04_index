			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARTINEZ'S 'LOVE IN THE LIGHT'  </P> <P> When Al Martinez came on the scene, I surmised another person who will give  dialogue and anecdotes about "the good old days" of Los Angeles. While amusing  and factual, The Times was not torn apart to get to Page 2 of the Metro section  to read his column.  </P> <P> With reading his column "Love in the Light" (May 15), concerning Paul Monette  and his book "Borrowed Time," this man became a talisman. The strength to open  himself up and look around and ask, "This picture of life around me, is it what  I want to see, if not, where change can be made?"  </P> <P> From my bed here in the AIDS ward of the Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center,  I salute you, Mr. Martinez.  </P> <P> Hopefully, with the willingness, compassion and understanding of humans like  you, the prejudice, misunderstanding and indifference toward persons with AIDS  and gay people as a whole will be slackened enough so that there won't be any  "gay brother" or "straight brother," just "brother."  </P> <P> JOHN BRINKMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

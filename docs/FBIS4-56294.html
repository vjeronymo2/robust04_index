			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a reliable source, there will be new  food distribution aid to the victims of Cite-Soleil, beginning  on 2 May. This distribution of food products is aimed at  relieving the population of Cite-Soleil, victims of a violent  fire on 27 December 1993.    Furthermore, on 27 April, a note from the Ministry of Public  Health pointed out the importance of a vast program to rebuild  the small houses destroyed during the fire, which will require  the sum of 35 million gourdes. MSPP [Ministry of Public Health  and Population] had since promised the distribution of food to  the victims.    Many victims of the 27 December 1993 fire in Cite-Soleil  demand that the Ministry of Public Health provide them with  efficient help. In a news release dated 30 April, the Committee  for People Whose Houses Burned in Cite-Soleil protested the  meagre portions of rice and cooking oil distributed to the  victims. It is also demanding sanitary conditions adequate for  survival. Those signing the news release are threatening to  demonstrate their dissatisfaction today in Cite Soleil during  the food distribution planned by MSPP.</p>

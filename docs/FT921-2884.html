			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: The markets take cover - City Watch AT THE first sound of electoral gunshot the stock market has posed a far from valiant spectacle, with the FT-SE 100 Index losing 104 points since last Wednesday when the April 9 poll was announced. There was little sign of serious resistance yesterday, with rallies petering out and the Footsie closing 5.7 points down at 2,470.7. There are apparently two intermingled problems. First, big investors are starting to have doubts about their long-held assumption that somehow the Conservatives would squeeze back into power with a small but working majority. Second, the Budget last Tuesday turned out to be a sad disappointment: it failed to include convincing vote-catching proposals, and at the same time it promised a flood of gilt-edged issues. According to Mr Richard Kersley at broker Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the stock market had got a little ahead of itself, closing on Budget night at the year's high. Dashed hopes for interest rate cuts helped to undermine this level. But he argues that at around 2,400 and a 5 1/2 per cent yield, the market would start to look attractive, come what may in the polls. If the Tories win, he thinks the market would soon threaten its all-time high of 2,679.6 last September and could reach 2,900 by the autumn, assuming a decent economic recovery. Mr Nick Knight of Nomura says 'the political outcome is probably largely irrelevant'. A cautious message comes from Mr Tony Dye, strategist at Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management. 'Last week there was a realisation that a Tory win was not a 90 per cent certainty,' he says, adding: 'There is quite a lot more vulnerability in the market.' Labour's threat looms larger in London. Kleinwort Benson's chartist Mr Nick Glydon says that on average the market has risen 2.3 per cent the day after a Tory win but has fallen 2.6 per cent after Labour victories. After the two unexpected Labour wins in 1945 and February 1974 prices were nearly 10 per cent lower within a week. It is bound to be hard for the City's well-paid professionals to ignore their own forebodings about a jump in personal taxes under Labour. The shadow Budget yesterday confirmed a rise in the marginal income tax rate to 59 per cent for those earning more than Pounds 40,000. Labour's policies on sterling and government borrowing seem to be no different from those of the Conservatives. But this does not prevent the City from harbouring suspicions, and the investment institutions may demand a higher interest rate if they buy gilts from a Labour administration. Higher gilt yields would undermine equity prices, given that yield ratios are a key factor in market valuation. The nervous defenders of the equity market may be driven into their own minefield.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Observer: Conflicting While it is no surprise to see a voluble critic walking out of the door, nobody quite believes the reasons LWT chief Greg Dyke has offered for his resignation from the board of ITN. Citing conflicts of interest over bids for the new Teletext licence, Dyke pointed to a disagreement on the fact that ITN, shareholder in current franchise holder Oracle, also leads the consortium for rival bidder Update Teletext. But the bids were submitted a month ago, so why on earth has the normally irrepressible Dyke waited until now to voice his displeasure? Given that LWT has only around 6 per cent in ITN, Dyke can undoubtedly plead more pressing calls on his time - the ITV Association of which he is recently chairman, inter alia. More pertinently, just this week LWT and Carlton unveiled an important joint venture, initially a London regional news service - but, both parties no doubt hope, a serious competitor to ITN one day.</p>

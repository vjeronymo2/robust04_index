			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7): Be patient with the immature - Overseas investment 5 / Emerging markets / Some risk-analysis models suggest that a small percentage of your portfolio in what used to be thought of as the third world increases the return and reduces the risk Emerging markets have been the glamorous part of the world stockmarket scene recently. And like many glamorous ideas, they have proved dangerous to their fans. The Baring Emerging Markets World Index, which rose by over 80 per cent between January 1993 and its peak in February 1994, has since fallen by 12 per cent. And some individual markets, such as Turkey, have more than halved. Does this mean that investing in these markets was just another short-lived fad? The answer is almost certainly no. The basic arguments in favour of having a stake in emerging stock markets remain as strong as ever. The fact that they have recently been the victims of their own popularity shows two things. First, investors normally exaggerate, which is why markets tend to move in cycles of boom and bust, rather than a sober straight line. Second, it is foolish to expect immature markets to respond to vast new capital inflows as if they were as mature as the US. WHY INVEST?: The power behind emerging stock markets lies in their economies. Most of them are in what used to be thought of as the third world: countries whose economies were relatively undeveloped, with correspondingly poor inhabitants. Some, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, have already shown how dramatic the catch-up can be. Now others are claiming their place in the sun. The two biggest blocs are round the Pacific rim in south-east Asia, and in South America. But the picture is not static. China's renaissance will mean dramatic changes to the world economic order. New economic liberalisation has brought India into the frame. Not all emerging economies are equal. The great pull of the south-east Asian countries is that economic growth there is far faster than in the developed countries of the US and Europe. The countries of eastern Europe certainly have scope to catch up with the west, but they have yet to display the capacity to do so. The same doubts apply to most parts of Africa. Backing the right economies is the first prerequisite for successful investment. It is also obviously necessary to pick the right industries in which to invest: in many countries basic infrastructure - roads, telephones, electricity and power - are the priority. But picking stock markets which are capable of absorbing large quantities of investment is almost as important for the investor. Even relatively developed stock markets can seize up when too many people want to buy shares at once. London, for example, suffered from a severe logjam in early 1987, when the settlement and share registration systems could not cope with the flood of business. Investing in India produced similar problems early in 1994, even though India has a longstanding tradition of stock market investment. Countries in eastern Europe do not even have a developed corporate sector in which to invest, let alone a developed stock market through which to do it. The enormous enthusiasm for Pacific Rim markets in 1993 preceded a sharp shake-out in early 1994. And fund managers promptly turned to South America, India, and almost any country where they could find a new 'story'. But long-term growth prospects in Asia remain better than in most other areas. And any private investor wanting a stake in emerging markets should be thinking long term. HOW TO INVE The first point to consider is what proportion of your total portfolio it is sensible to commit to emerging markets. Some risk-analysis models suggest, surprisingly, that putting a small percentage of your total portfolio into emerging markets both increases the return and reduces the risk. For a middle-of-the-road investor, around 5 to 10 per cent is probably a maximum. If you are close to retirement, you might sensibly decide that the short-term risks are too great for any involvement. If you are young with few liabilities - or investing for your grandchildren - you can sensibly consider a higher proportion. Direct investment is not an option for anyone without special knowledge and strong nerves. So the next choice is between global funds, regional funds and single-country funds. As a general rule, the more specialised the fund, the higher the risk. But it is also important to pick fund managers who understand the local market. This is hard for the novice. One possible solution to the problem is to pick funds which invest in other funds. City of London Emerging Markets unit trust has shown considerable success in following this strategy. And the new Portfolio Emerging Markets trust intends to follow a similar approach. The snag to all funds-of-funds is that the investor is paying a double layer of management charges. But if the investment strategy works, it can be worth the cost.</p>

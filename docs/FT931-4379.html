			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Letter: Only long-term planning will halt downward cycle in UK Sir, Lord Howe's Budget remedies - cut spending, raise taxes - make sense as far as they go (Personal View, March 9). But they would be more bearable if they included one vital longer-term ingredient which successive chancellors have tended to overlook. I refer to the imperative need to raise levels of investment in the infrastructure of the country. The failure to prepare Britain's towns, urban areas, roads, railways and public facilities generally for the 21st century (or even for the 20th), in increasing contrast not just to the UK's European neighbours but more strikingly to the modern cities of Asia, is much nearer the root of the problem than economic policy-makers here realise. It explains why Britain overheats so quickly, why stops have to be more violent. and why after each phase in the cycle the UK drifts further behind, with lower revenue growth, and therefore more spending cuts, and so on down the plughole. Long ago we should not only have swept away the remaining obstacles to private investment in public services but should also have established a separate capital budget (as in Japan, for example) which could be protected and even expanded while current spending economics are rightly pursued. Please could chancellors and the Treasury look beyond one year ahead. David Howell, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

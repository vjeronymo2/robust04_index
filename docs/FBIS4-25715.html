			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of the government work report delivered by Tibet </F> Autonomous Regional Chairman Gyaincain Norbu at the Second  Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress  -- from the "News" program]    [Text] Discussing the tasks of 1994, the report points out:  In stepping up construction of the infrastructure, we should  deepen the fixed asset investment reform and gradually set up a  system under which investments are diversified to several  sources and decisions are made at different levels. Based on  the demand for using society's fixed asset investment, on the  investment scope of various investment sources, and on the  economic and social benefits and the markets of different  projects, investments will generally be allocated to  competitive, infrastructure, and public welfare construction  projects. Financial investment activities for the construction  and operation of competitive projects should be carried out in  the market and decided by the enterprises themselves, while  investment in infrastructure and public welfare construction  projects should be made mainly by the state and the autonomous  region. Regional budgetary appropriations should be invested  primarily in the construction of agriculture, animal husbandry,  transportation, energy, posts and telecommunications, and other  infrastructure facilities, as well as in education, science and  technology, urban, and other public welfare facilities.    The report says: The regional budgetary investment in fixed  assets this year has increased 50 million yuan compared to 1993.  This is the maximum amount that the region can afford to make in  view of Tibet's financial straits. Priority should be given to  key projects already under construction, as well as agriculture,  animal husbandry, energy, transportation, posts and  telecommunications, and other infrastructure facilities.  Particular attention must be paid to ensuring adherence to the  construction schedule for and the quality of the renovation of  the (Yanghuchalong) power station; the revamping of the  Qinghai-Tibet, Sichuan-Tibet, and China-Nepal highways; the  repair of the (Fangda) airport; and the comprehensive  agricultural development project for the Yarlung Zangbo, Lhasa,  and Nyang Qu River Valleys. We should deepen the enterprise  reform and continue to implement the regulations for changing  the operating mechanisms of state-owned industrial enterprises  and the regional procedures for implementing these regulations,  seeing to it that enterprises can exercise their autonomy in a  true sense. We should optimize the organizational structure of  enterprises through amalgamation, separation, shifts to other  lines of production, and the establishment of enterprise groups.  We should expedite the exploitation and utilization of  resources to transform our advantage in resources into economic  advantage. We should continue to pay close attention to the  development of animal, forestry, and mineral products while  increasing the variety, expanding the scale, and increasing the  value added to products through intensive processing.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Uri Revah] </F>   [Excerpts] Some 140 new families settled in the Qatif Bloc  since the Oslo agreement was signed nine months ago. Only 10  families left the Qatif Bloc during that period. The Hof 'Aza  Regional Council says today that expectations of compensation  are not a factor in the Bloc's new settlers' decision. These  details are revealed here for the first time by our  correspondent Uri Revah:    [Begin Revah recording] Were they motivated by the long-term  prospects of compensation or by Greater Israel ideology? What  are the motives behind the 140 families' decision to settle in  the Qatif Bloc after the Oslo agreement? For instance, 41 new  families joined Neve Deqalim, versus eight that left the place  during the period. [passage omitted]    In Nisanit in northern Gaza Strip, 61 new families settled  since the agreement. One of the reasons may be the fact that a  private house goes here for a mere 130,000 shekels. [passage  omitted]    Dozens of empty housing units are still available in the  Qatif Bloc, and these are expected to be inhabited within a  short time. [end recording]</p>

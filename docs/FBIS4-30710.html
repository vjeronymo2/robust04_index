			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by a "Japan-U.S. relations reporting team"; sixth </F> in a series entitled "Japan and the United States -- the Picture  Shakes": "Let's Get Them `To Compensate for Cold War' Efforts"]    Huge Current-Account Deficits    Over the period from late April to early May, there was  turbulence in the money market with the United States' long-term  interest rates rising sharply while the dollar fell. The United  States moved fast, and a brake was put on the fall of the dollar  by cooperating with Japan and Europe in making market  intervention. The rise in the long-term interest rates stopped  as well somehow, but it is said that all the senior officials of  the U.S. Government, known as the "MIT (Massachusetts Institute  of Technology) school," were pale during that period.    The MIT school means a group of people like Laura Tyson,  chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) under the  Office of President, and Blinder [name as published], former CEA  member, who received their doctor of philosophy degrees from  MIT, and Under Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summer, who  earned his bachelor of arts degree at the same school. They are  the people who think importantly of balancing market principles  and government policies. For them, this was an opportunity to  be reminded that the public uneasiness about the current-account  deficits at the root of the market turbulence remains."    In the real economy of the United States, business  performance is recovering, and the economy is back on the track  of growing at a rate of more than 3 percent a year. To have  this good trend continue for a long time, stability of interest  rates is essential. But if the country wants to stabilize its  interest rates, it has no other choice but to return to the  basic question of "reducing the current-account deficits."  <H5>  Passing Over Economic Burdens </H5>   For instance, if we take a look at the contents of the  current- account deficits, we can see that the reduction of  government deficits, which is a major element, is not making  progress as expected. Even in the area of family finances, the  savings rate went down to a post-war low of 4.0 percent in 1993,  and the condition of excessive consumption has not been  remedied. There has been no improvement in the structural  problem of upward economy meaning increased imports and thus  increased current-account deficits. As a result, the policy  line of "maintaining low-interest rates and achieving a high  economic growth rate" is not functioning properly. The market  has come to recognize these ills of the U.S. economy, and this  was precisely the reason for the gloom of the MIT school people.    How seriously does the Clinton administration regard these  ills? There is good material that is said to be "useful in  making judgment on that question." It is testimony U.S. Trade  Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor gave before the Senate  Finance Committee shortly after his nomination as USTR was  approved by Congress in January 1993. He said in that testimony:    -- In the post-war world, the top priority task for Western  countries, including the United States, was to win the Cold War  over the Eastern camp, which had the Soviet Union as its pillar.  To do that, it was necessary to win not only in armaments, but  also in the economic race.    -- To win an economic victory, the United States formed new  international frameworks like the IMF and the GATT, and has  opened up its market to other countries, thus helping Japan and  Europe to reconstruct their countries.    -- But the U.S. economy started to stagnate clearly as the  Vietnam war bogged down and the oil crisis hit it in the early  1970s. The trade deficit started to grow steadily. In spite of  the situation, the East-West Cold War at the time did not allow  the United States to retreat toward giving priority to the  economy.    -- What should have happened was for the United States to  switch its policy toward giving priority to the economy in the  Reagan era of the 1980s. But President Reagan chose the line of  expanding arms instead, thus expanding the government deficits  very rapidly.    -- Victory has been won in the Cold War by paying an  enormous  cost, but the U.S. economy has become a shambles. It has become  no longer possible for the United States to serve as the world  leader without any conditions. Unless the United States regains  its economy and re-establishes its "economic security," it will  not be able to guaratee the political and diplomatic safety of  the world.    Pressure To `Pay Up'    This testimony shows that the United States has analyzed the  causes for the current-account deficit problem, not from the  perspective of the current market turbulence, but by looking  back on the long span of time since World War II ended.  Besides, as far as Japan and Europe are concerned, aside from  the question of whether such a U.S. stand is correct or not, the  testimony seems to be saying to them: "You should pay for the  losses the United States had to suffer to secure security for  the world."    Of course, the fragile U.S. economy is no small matter for  Japan even when viewed from a short-term perspective. That is  because its impact on the money market can be more sensitive  than its real economy. The flip side of the coin of having a  cheap dollar is the high yen, and the rise in the U.S. long-term  interest rates puts upward pressure on the interest rates of  Japan. An investment consulting executive officer of a major  securities firm said, "If U.S. long-term interests rates go up  to the 8 percent level, Japan's stock prices will collapse."    But such a short-term view is not enough to understand or  explain all the intentions or agonies of the United States. If  the United States has come up with its present policies on the  basis of the roles it has played in the post-war period and on  the fact that the Cold War has now ended, then it may be  necessary for Japan to look at the thinking of "pay up," which  lies behind it all.</p>

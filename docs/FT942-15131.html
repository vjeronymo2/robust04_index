			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / The Week Ahead: Chunnel's misplaced optimism The numbers Eurotunnel will unveil for 1993 on Thursday will be largely academic but it must have hoped it could announce revenues from the first few months of operations. A full freight and passenger service will not now be running before September/October, a delay which is costing Eurotunnel tens of millions of pounds a month. Projected revenues of Pounds 224m for this year now look hopelessly over-optimistic. But if the past year has disappointed in this regard, at least considerable progress has been made towards resolving the many disputes which have affected the project. Morgan Crucible, the speciality materials group, is forecast on Monday to report full-year. pre-tax profits up from Pounds 61.3m to between Pounds 63m and Pounds 65m. The thermal ceramics business will have suffered badly from the recession in continental Europe but the group figures will be boosted by currency movements, recovery in the US, and growth in East Asia. On Thursday, SmithKline Beecham reports results for its first quarter - which might also be the best quarter of the year as the US patent on ulcer drug Tagamet expires next month. First quarter pre-tax profits should be Pounds 347m, up 13 per cent on last time. This month's income tax increases are expected to dominate the results of the raft of small retailers - such as Etam, Bentalls, Austin Reed, Tie Rack and Liberty - which are reporting next week. But it might still be a bit too early to get any meaningful indications from the present trading statements. Most company observers will be waiting for Sears' results on April 26. Etam, the fashion clothing company, will be the most closely examined of those reporting. It is expected to show a 33 per cent pre-tax profits advance to about Pounds 14.5m, excluding property losses.</p>

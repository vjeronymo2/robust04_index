The core of the Cfacs software package, which has been developed and based on Oracle's relational database products, is the General Ledger. To this clients can add various other modules to meet their specific accounting requirements. Some 25 modules are currently available. Since the launch of Cfacs turnover and profits have grown rapidly. In the year to March 31, pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.4m on turnover of Pounds 5.3m.

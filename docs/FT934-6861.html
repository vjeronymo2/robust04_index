			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Technology: Window opens for IBM IBM has just announced 'OS/2 for Windows', a version of its personal computer operating system that sidesteps Microsoft. Until now, IBM has been paying about Dollars 20 (Pounds 13.40) to Microsoft on each copy of OS/2 sold, for a total of about Dollars 80m. OS/2 for Windows will deny Microsoft tens of millions of dollars in future royalty payments as IBM puts its marketing efforts behind the 'Windowless' version of its operating system. IBM expects OS/2 for Windows to double the monthly shipments of OS/2 by the end of December. 'Most PC users already have a copy of Windows and have already paid the licensing fee. There is no reason why they should pay twice for software they already have,' says an IBM representative. OS/2 for Windows allows the IBM operating system to merge with a PC user's copy of Windows 3.1, allowing Windows, Dos and OS/2 applications to run on the same system. However, IBM could face potential problems with this approach. 'I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft produces a future version of Windows that prevents other operating systems from hooking into it,' says Jesse Berst, industry analyst and editor of Windows Watcher newsletter. John Roberts, group product manager for Windows at Microsoft, says that OS/2 for Windows users might face problems running some business applications that use Microsoft's Object Linking and Embedding technology, allowing different applications to share the same data. IBM says it has found no significant problems in running Windows applications. IBM will continue to sell a version of OS/2 that includes the current version of Windows, but once Microsoft releases new versions, IBM will no longer have the rights to include updated Windows software in OS/2.</p>

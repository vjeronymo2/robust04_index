			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara--Zhirair Liparityan, the deputy foreign  minister of Armenia, asked on Monday [21 February] for Turkey's  support to establish a cease-fire in the fighting between Azeri  and Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh.    But while Liparityan was in Ankara, Armenian forces have  bombed the Azeri city of Terter, 300 kilometers from the capital  Baku, ANATOLIA NEWS AGENCY reported from the region.  Liparityan, after holding talks in the morning with Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin and Deputy Undersecretary Bigin Unan, told  the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that "the first thing to do was to  establish a cease-fire" before efforts are made on a political  settlement.    He told Cetin during his talks that Yerevan "would like to  see what can be done to push the peace process" but added,  "there are steps ahead."    The unexpected visit was spurred by a phone call from  Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan who called Cetin over  the weekend. Diplomatic sources said Papazyan, apparently  worried by the Azeri offensive to gain back their territories  occupied by Armenian forces, told Cetin that fighting had  intensified and asked Ankara to "assist" in establishing a  cease-fire. Azeri and Armenian officials are presently in  Moscow, with the hope of signing a protocol on March 1. A  tentative accord, signed between the parties when Armenians and  Azeris, [as published] was signed on Feb. 17, when Armenians  promised to withdraw from the Azeri territory they occupied.    But the stumbling block has proved to be the Armenian  efforts  to buy time for the withdrawal and the mediating Russia's  attempts to place observers in Azeri territory.    The Azeri Defense Minister has returned from Moscow but the  talks are continuing through diplomatic efforts and by phone, a  spokesman for the Azeri government said.    In Ankara, Liparityan told reporters, before he engaged in a  new round of talks with Candan Azer, the Foreign Ministry's  deputy director responsible for Caucasus Affairs: "There are a  number of peace efforts on the table.    We have to see whether they can be combined."    Asked whether this would be done within the Minsk process,  he  replied: "We obviously want to do it in an international forum.  On the other hand, it should be something that works."  Diplomatic sources in Ankara have spoken about "giving the  Minsk process a kick start" through multilateral efforts of  "certain interested countries."    The same demand was made by Geydar Aliyev, the Azeri  president, during his visit to Ankara last week. Aliyev said  his country believed the Minsk forum of nine countries, under  the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE), was the adequate forum for a political  settlement. But he added that Baku would also welcome the  initiative of "major countries" for the settlement of the  problem.    Aliyev's words were interpreted in Ankara as a reference to  a  tripartite peace plan of Russia, Turkey and the United States  which was launched last year but was integrated into the Minsk  process.    Ankara, however, believes that there are gaps in the Minsk  calendar which endorses a plan for a gradual Armenian  withdrawal. The point was made clear to Jan Eliasson, the new  chairman of the Minsk Group who visited Ankara last weekend.  The Minsk Group aims to find a political settlement for the  problem of Nagorno-Karabakh, where Azeris and Armenians have  been fighting an undeclared war.    Another initiative which is on the table, but has so far  been  met with hesitation by Azeris, is a plan prepared by Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's advisor Aram Abramyan [Andranik  Migranyan].    Ways to establish a cease-fire and combine the plans will  also be discussed when Foreign Ministry Deputy Undersecretary  Bilgin Unan travels to Moscow on March 1 for political  consultations.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: LIG's cash call 88% taken up London International Group, the condom maker, saw its Pounds 115m rescue rights issue taken up by 88.3 per cent of its shareholders. The good result was helped by a strong last minute surge in the share price which has risen by 11p to 85p over the past week compared with the rights price of 70p. Mr James Tyrrell, finance director, said: 'We are very pleased with the result and now have to get on and run the company efficiently and realise shareholder value.' Market sources said the share price had been buoyed by significant buying interest, particularly from the US, and from improved sentiment in the stock market as a whole. The rump of the rights issues shares were placed at 85p, yielding a premium of 13.8p after expenses.</p>

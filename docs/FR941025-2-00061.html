Research on Child Abuse and Neglect With a Focus on the Impact of Community-Based Family Support and Family Preservation Programs on Child Abuse and Neglect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The research areas to be addressed in this priority are those that will expand the current knowledge base, build on prior research, contribute to practice, and provide insights into new approaches to the prevention of child maltreatment and preservation of families (i.e., physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional maltreatment, or neglect) by family support and family preservation services as defined by the newly enacted Family Preservation and Family Support Services Program (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Subpart 2 of Title IV&hyph;B, the Child and Family Services Program of the Social Security Act). Congress has noted its interest in the outcomes and effectiveness of this legislation. For definitions of these services, see the legislation and Program Instructions. The Congressional intent of the legislative definition was further clarified in the Conference Committee Report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the Family Preservation and Family Support legislation, Program Instruction, and additional information about family support and family preservation programs are available from the NCCAN Clearinghouse_Child Welfare Desk (1&hyph;800&hyph;394&hyph;3366). Copies are also available on the ACF electronic bulletin board system (1&hyph;800&hyph;627&hyph;8886).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States have reported to the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) that in 1992 their child protective service (CPS) agencies received and referred for investigation approximately 1.9 million reports involving approximately 2.9 million children who were the alleged victims of child abuse and neglect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over half of the reports were received from professionals in the community, including educators, social service professionals, health professionals, and representatives of law enforcement and justice agencies. Following investigations conducted by CPS agencies, nearly 1 million children, approximately 39 percent of those reported, were found to be substantiated or indicated victims of child maltreatment. Based on data from 37 States, it is estimated that approximately 18 percent of children who were the substantiated victims of maltreatment were removed from the home. Extrapolating this ratio to all States, it suggests that in 1992 an estimated 82 percent (800,000) substantiated victims of child maltreatment remained at home, where they may have received further services. These findings also suggest that, in 1992, 61 percent of those cases reported for child abuse and neglect are unsubstantiated and those children also remain in their homes. At this time, it is not known whether any follow-up, family preservation, or family support services are available for unsubstantiated cases to prevent the potential for future abuse and reporting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given this lack of knowledge about these families, NCCAN is particularly interested in four populations and four outcomes. The proposed research studies should examine one or more of the populations to examine service outcomes of family support and family preservation services. The first group consists of families who receive family support services, but have had no previous contact with child protective services, otherwise known as families who are not ``in the system.'' The second group consists of families who have been referred to child protective services, whose cases were unsubstantiated or unfounded, but were found to need services, and were referred to family support programs. The third group consists of families who have been ``in the system,'' whose child abuse or neglect cases were substantiated, who received family preservation or family support services, and whose cases are now closed. The fourth, and final, population would be those families whose child abuse or neglect cases have been substantiated, whose cases are ``open,'' whose children have not been removed, and who are receiving family preservation services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

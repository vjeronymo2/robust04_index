			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (9): Flood of gilts issues likely - The prospects for sterling bonds STERLING BONDS barely feature in the UK pension fund's portfolio these days: they have been crowded out by equities. However, given the government's borrowing requirements in the next couple of years, a flood of gilts issues is expected. As a result, pension funds may well be tempted to increase their holdings in sterling fixed income bonds. UK pension funds have run down their holdings in UK fixed interest investments in percentage terms over the last decade. In 1978, a typical pension fund had its assets split as follows, according to figures from Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps): 29 per cent in UK fixed interest; 56 per cent in UK equities; 4 per cent in overseas assets; 4 per cent in sterling cash and 7 per cent in property. At the end of 1990, a mere 4 per cent was invested in UK fixed income and 2 per cent in index-linked investments. UK equities accounted for 57 per cent while the proportion held in overseas assets had risen to 27 per cent. According to one manager, the main reason why pension funds ran down their sterling bond holdings, particularly over the last five years, was because of the equity market boom which tempted them to invest in foreign and UK equities at the expense of fixed income. The government's privatisation programme also attracted equity investors, while the shortage of gilts as the Bank of England was buying back stock meant that the supply was reduced. However, there was a very sharp turnaround last year in which bonds outperformed equities. Caps figures for 1990 show that the median return for pension funds was -10.5 per cent while the return on UK equities in their portfolios was -9.5 per cent, the return on UK fixed interest was +8 per cent. Some fund managers believe this could encourage pension funds to increase their holdings in bonds again, especially now that the government is borrowing in the market again. In the Budget last March, the government forecast a public sector borrowing requirement for 1991-92 of Pounds 8bn. Many economists believe this is an underestimate and put the figure at closer to Pounds 12bn. The result is that the government has returned to issuing gilts: already there have been three mini-taps and more issues are expected in the next two years. The question is: will pension funds buy them ? Midland Montagu, one of the leading market makers in gilts, reports an increased interest by pension funds, though this is yet to materialise in substantial purchases. However, some pension fund managers say they are reluctant to commit money to gilts at the moment. One manager points out that the attractions of sterling fixed income were more apparent at the start of the year than now: in his view, corporate sterling bonds (non-gilt fixed income) look more attractive than gilt fixed income because they are relatively cheap. One reason for this is that in a recession, many investors are worried about the creditworthiness of corporate bonds - especially given the number of companies which have either collapsed or which are facing serious difficulties in servicing their debt. Despite the Bank of England's plan to issue gilts again, not everyone is convinced that the new supply of gilts will be eagerly sought by pension funds. For a start, fund managers consider the prospective real returns available from other European bond markets - particularly France and the Netherlands - as more attractive than from sterling bonds. Fund managers are optimistic about prospects for the global bond markets this year as interest rates in most of the main world economies are expected to fall. Mr Lionel Hoare of Whittingdale, the fund management group, points out that with sterling's entry in the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS, investors should see higher yields available in sterling without suffering from currency risk, and so cannot see the advantage of investing in foreign bonds over sterling bonds. He thinks pension funds will have to increase their weightings in sterling bonds to match their assets with their liabilities. As the average age of the UK population is rising, pension funds may put their money into more secure investments such as fixed income.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Anglian paying Pounds 36m for Nordic Water  -Swedish diversification move will strengthen process engineering division ANGLIAN WATER, one of the slowest of the privatised water companies to expand into unregulated areas, is strengthening its process engineering division with the purchase of the Swedish-based Nordic Water. Anglian will pay SKR380m (Pounds 36m), including Pounds 8m of cash, for Nordic, which is part of the real estate and construction group NCC. Nordic will be combined with Anglian's existing, and smaller, process engineering subsidiaries to create a division with annual sales of about Pounds 110m. Mr Alan Smith, Anglian's group managing director, said the acquisition provided 'critical mass' and increased opportunities for international business, such as BOT - build, operate and transfer - schemes. He said Anglian had 'never been opposed to diversification, but we've been very cautious about it and have refused to pay silly prices'. Nearly all the 10 privatised companies have built up unregulated businesses, usually in process engineering or waste management. The companies claim they need to diversify before profits from water and sewage services starts to slow, but some companies have been criticised for paying above market prices. Nordic produced estimated pre-tax profits of Pounds 4m last year on sales of Pounds 83m. It had net assets of Pounds 7m, orders in hand of Pounds 67m and about 400 employees. Mr Goran Wijkmark, president, said the company was particularly strong in Scandinavia and the UK, where its customers include North West Water and Yorkshire Water. He said new ventures in eastern Germany and southern Poland were also promising. Last year more than 75 per cent of revenues came from contracting, where the company operates under the name Purac. The remainder derived from products like DynaSand filters which were developed by Nordic but are often manufactured by sub-contractors. In all, the company operates in 10 countries, mainly in Europe. Anglian's other process engineering subsidiaries include Rosewater Engineering, acquired last July. These will be merged with Nordic and managed by Mr Wijkmark from Sweden. The division's future growth was expected to be mainly organic, although Mr Smith said some further small acquisitions were possible. A UK-based analyst said the acquisition gave Anglian's process engineering business 'more credibility', but the division is still small compared to those owned by Thames or North West Water. Ofwat, the water regulator, was informed of the deal in advance. North West Water has bought Consolidated Electric of the US for an undisclosed price. Consolidated, which designs and makes controls and instruments for the water industry, had total sales last year of Dollars 5.2m (Pounds 3.66m) and net assets of Dollars 2.5m.</p>

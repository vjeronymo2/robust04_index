			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by Li Kuo-chung (2621 0948 1813): "Lu </F> Ping Clarifies Three Points in the Airport Issue and Stresses  That Franchises Come Under the Diplomatic Sphere"]    [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--Today, Lu Ping,  director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office [HKMAO] of  the State Council, clarified for members of the Economic Group  of the Preliminary Working Committee several points in the  dispute between China and Britain over the financial  arrangements for the new airport. The Group also put forward  over 20 suggestions regarding the Airport Corporation Bill and  will hand them to the HKMAO for reference later.    Sir Sze-yuen Chung, convener of the Airport Issue Study Team  under the Economic Group, said today after the meeting:  Regarding the financial arrangements for the new airport, Lu  Ping had clarified several points for them and disclosed that  the third proposal put forward by the British side was first  handed to the Chinese side in April 1993. The proposal included  the government pumping in HK$42.8 billion [Hong Kong dollars].  At the talks that followed, the British side agreed to add  HK$2.5 billion more, increasing the total amount to HK$45.3  billion, with the amount of debt coming to approximately HK$40  billion. The Chinese side estimates that according to the  financial proposal, the maximum debt can reach HK$45 billion.    The three points Lu Ping clarified were:    First, some people have misleadingly equated the  airport-related franchises and contracts straddling 1997 with  the other laws and regulations that do not conflict with the  Basic Law and that can apply after 1997. However, laws and  regulations are one thing and diplomacy is another. If the  franchises and contracts straddling 1997 did not need the  consent of the Chinese side, there would have been no need for  the Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] to include a paragraph  mentioning that the British side must negotiate with the Chinese  side over the franchises and contracts straddling 1997. This has  nothing to do with the Basic Law and is a diplomatic issue.    Second, the MOU provides that the government debt must not  exceed HK$5 billion. Some people argue that the HK$5 billion is  confined merely to the government and does not include that  incurred by the Airport Corporation and the airport railway.  But Lu Ping pointed out: In negotiating the MOU with Percy  Cradock, the then British special envoy, several years ago, the  British side did not say that the airport railway was to be  constructed by the government or by the Airport Corporation.  The two sides also understood that the Airport Corporation was  part of the government. The HK$5-billion debt includes the debt  for the airport railway and the Airport Corporation. It is only  a matter of "filling the right pocket from the left."    Third, regarding the 58 to 60 hectares of land along the  airport railway, both the Chinese and British sides have agreed  that the land should be approved by the Land Committee each  year. The Chinese have also agreed to approve all land along  the railway before 1997, and the size of the area to be approved  depends on the need.    Sze-yuen Chung maintained: The Airport Corporation derives  its assets from the government and the debt incurred by the  Airport Corporation is the debt of the government. If the debt  of the Airport Corporation is not included in the HK$5-billion  debt, the Hong Kong Government cannot sit and let the creditors  take away the land if the Airport Corporation has a debt crisis  in the future. Therefore, the debt of the Airport Corporation  should also be included in the government's debt.    Another group member, Vincent Hong-sui Lo, also held that  although the MOU did not deal with the question of debt very  clearly, by common sense, the Hong Kong Government cannot but  assume responsibility if the future Airport Corporation and  railway cannot repay the debt.    He said that the two sides already have the MOU on the  question of the Airport-related franchises and contracts, and  therefore they should negotiate using this means.    In addition, the Airport Issue Study Team also studied the  Airport Corporation Bill and put forward more than 20  suggestions. The relevant report will be handed to the HKMAO for  its reference after being passed by the Economic Group.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Union Carbide sells fluids subsidiary UNION Carbide, the large US chemicals group, announced yesterday that it was selling its OrganoSilicon subsidiary, which makes fluids and chemicals used in a wide range of industries, to a limited partnership run by Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenerette (DLJ). The sale is valued at about Dollars 300m. The consideration comprises Dollars 220m in cash, plus Dollars 80m of preferred stock - which is convertible into a 30 per cent voting interest in the silicones company. Union Carbide, which will realise an unspecified after-tax gain on the deal, said that the transaction effectively concluded the asset sale programme which it announced in December 1991. OSi had sales last year of around Dollars 350m, and has facilities in Belgium, Brazil, Italy, Korea and Switzerland, as well as in the US. The company employs around 1,100 people. DLJ, a New York investment banking operation, is part of the large Equitable insurance group, and the DLJ Merchant Banking Partners - which is making the acquisition - represents a Dollars 1bn acquisition fund.</p>

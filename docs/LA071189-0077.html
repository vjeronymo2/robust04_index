			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOUR DE FRANCE;  </P> <P> IN THE PYRENEES, LEMOND REMAINS IN FIRST PLACE  </P> <P> Greg LeMond of Minneapolis retained the lead in the Tour de France Monday after  the first mountain stage of the 23-day cycling race.  </P> <P> He stuck to the leaders along a route that went up and down four mountains. The  riders finished at an elevation of 4,330 feet along the French-Spanish  frontier.  </P> <P> LeMond finished eighth in the stage, almost two minutes behind Miguel Indurain  of Spain, who won the stage in 4 hours 32 minutes 36 seconds.  </P> <P> LeMond wasn't concerned when Indurain went ahead.  </P> <P> "It wasn't for me to ride behind Indurain," he said. "He is more than seven  minutes behind in the standings."  </P> <P> LeMond was more concerned with how his body would hold up through the difficult  mountain passes. At last month's Tour of Italy, he faltered in the steep  stages.  </P> <P> "Today's stage shows that I am in better form than the Tour of Italy," LeMond  said. "I had a good day, reassuring for me. But that doesn't say that the next  stage is going to go as well. Now it is a problem of recuperation, for me and  the others, too."  </P> <P> LeMond tailed 1983 and 1984 winner Laurent Fignon of France, who finished  seventh in the same time as LeMond and remained in second place overall, five  seconds back.  </P> <P> Fignon, who many regarded as the favorite in this year's race, thought LeMond  was taking it easy by sticking close to him and not helping the other cyclists.  </P> <P> "It's not for me to push, it's for Laurent," LeMond said. "I have to protect  the lead I have on him."  </P> <P> Last year's winner, Pedro Delgado of Spain, finished third in Monday's 91-mile  course over four steep mountain climbs, but gained only 29 seconds on LeMond.  </P> <P> Sill, Delgado has made a charge through the standings after starting the race  10 days ago almost three minutes behind schedule.  </P> <P> He was last in the standings going into the first leg and lost another three  minutes in the team time trial when he faltered.  </P> <P> Andy Hampsten of Boulder, Colo., was 14th, 2:28 back of Indurain, and lost half  a minute to LeMond in the overall standings.  </P> <P> Today's second stage in the Pyrenees is 82 miles from Cauterets to  Luchon-Superbagneres.  </P></p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Company boards reluctant to end long-term contracts: The campaign against big payoffs for directors POSTEL, BRITAIN'S largest pension fund, earlier this month fired a shot across the bows of the largest companies it invests in, telling their managements that it would vote against long-term contracts for directors. Whether the shot reverberates in boardrooms across Britain or merely lands with a plop remains to be seen. For while corporate boards are slowly giving in to shareholder pressure on some issues, they are showing few signs of budging on others. The chief executive of one leading retailer, himself on a long-term contract, said: 'You can't recruit executives unless you offer long-term contracts.' Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, the former Treasury adviser who is Postel's chief executive, wrote to the chairmen of all the FTSE-100 companies - in which Postel has about a 2 per cent stake - telling them that he was 'minded' to vote against three-year rolling contracts for directors whenever they occurred. Such contracts, unlike fixed-year contracts, are always assumed to have three years left before expiry. Not only do shareholders find them expensive, but they complain they lead to complacency among those who least ought to feel that way. Mr Ross Goobey said so far responses to his letter had not been hostile. 'Most of these have been 'holding' letters saying they thought the point was interesting and they would like to discuss it further,' he said. That, however, is a far cry from saying that boards will mend their ways. To date, none of Britain's leading shareholder groups has committed itself to voting with Mr Ross Goobey. The issue of how long a director's service contract should be is one that has exercised shareholders for some time. Typically, the matter rises to the top of the corporate governance agenda after the discovery that some particularly incompetent director has received a big payout after shareholders have sacked him. In most circumstances it emerges that the director was entitled to a large payout because he had up to five years remaining on a service contract. Pensions Investment Research Consultants, an organisation which advises shareholders on corporate governance matters, has found that 20 of the top FTSE-100 companies have directors with rolling contracts of three years or longer. The list includes Tesco, Kingfisher, Reuters and United Biscuits. Ironically, five of those named are themselves institutional investors - BAT Industries (parent of Eagle Star Insurance), National Westminster Bank, Prudential Corporation, Royal Insurance Holdings and Sun Alliance. Prudential, whose chief executive Mr Mick Newmarch has been outspoken on corporate governance matters, said the company had no intention of amending its contract to suit Mr Ross Goobey's objections. It said: 'We believe that we as a plc should act in the way that companies we invest in should act. But we don't think this is something which would give us cause for concern.' Mr John Hogan, chief operating officer at oil services group Lasmo, himself on a three-year rolling contract, said the terms were justified because 'there is more security for the employee and the employer'. If corporate directors were forced by their shareholders to sign shorter contracts they would inevitably seek more generous remuneration, he said. Mr Hogan said he would be willing to take on a shorter-term contract in exchange for a more generous performance-related element. 'Doubtless some companies will change their contract terms,' he said. Lasmo was criticised earlier this year for a Pounds 2.2m payoff to Mr Chris Greentree, its former chief executive. Under his three-year rolling contract he received a settlement worth two-and-a-half years' pay. Several shareholders recorded their objection by voting against the appointment of directors at the annual general meeting earlier this year. Yet prospects that such activities will quickly force companies to mend their ways are limited. One shareholder said: 'We registered our objections to the chairman and he told us that our views were duly noted and our votes counted.'</p>

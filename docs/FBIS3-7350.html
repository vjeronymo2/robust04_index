The statement expressed strong opposition to the resumption  of the Team Spirit war game and the introduction of Patriot  missiles, warning that they would only increase the danger of  war on the Korean peninsula.    It also criticized the "civilian government's" pro-U.S.  treacheries, saying that the Kim Yong-sam regime "is entrusting  important issues related to the existence of the nation to the  United States through an inconsistent diplomatic policy."</p>

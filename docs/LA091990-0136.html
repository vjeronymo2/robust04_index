			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAKING IT WORK;  </P> <P> SOME STEPS TO BUILDING LASTING LOVE  </P> <P> Infatuation may not last, but love can -- if you're willing to work at it.  David and Sheryl Aronson of Laguna Niguel, who counsel singles and couples in  their workshops and private practices, outlined the following basic ingredients  of success:  </P> <P> * Be self-reliant.  </P> <P> If one partner is overly dependent, the relationship suffers. Maintain your own  friends and interests so you won't need to be with your mate 24 hours a day.  </P> <P> * Be selectively dependent, not fiercely independent. Don't be afraid to allow  yourself to depend on your partner for support, love and tenderness. That's not  a sign of weakness. Strive for a healthy balance between dependence and  independence.  </P> <P> * Admit that you're not perfect -- and accept the imperfections in your  partner.  </P> <P> * Maintain a win-win mind-set. If only one person wins in a disagreement, you  both lose.  </P> <P> * Try standing in your partner's shoes. Your way is not always right.  </P> <P> * Be accepting, not judgmental -- and start by accepting yourself. If you're  hard on yourself, you'll be hard on your partner. SHERRY ANGEL  </P></p>

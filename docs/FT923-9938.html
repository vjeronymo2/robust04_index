			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Storm over contaminated-land register REVISED proposals for a contaminated-land register, issued yesterday, have provoked strong criticism from both sides of the environmental debate. Environmental activists accused the government of retreating from its commitment to identify contaminated land. The property industry said the changes were cosmetic and would depress land values and increase urban blight. Recommendations in a new consultation paper from the Department of the Environment are less stringent than previous government proposals. The new proposals would reduce the amount of land placed on a public register to between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of that included under the former proposals. Mr David Maclean, minister for the environment and countryside, said the new regulations placed the emphasis on the most contaminating uses. The consultation paper proposed a two-tier system to distinguish between land that has not been investigated or treated from land where the contamination has been assessed. Mr Christopher Jonas, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said the revised proposals would lead to 'unnecessary blight and distort the property market'. They would create added uncertainty in the property industry and deter investors and developers from regenerating inner cities. Mr Sean Humber of Friends of the Earth, the environmental lobby group, said the revised proposals excluded most of an estimated 100,000 contaminated sites.</p>

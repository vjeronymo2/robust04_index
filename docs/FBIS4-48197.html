			<p>BFN     [Text] Aid workers have said they fear as many as 500,000  people may have been killed in the Rwandan conflict, more than  double the previous estimates, and the killing was still going  on.    A senior aid official who in the past had given a figure of  20,000, said he believed up to half a million people had died  since the start of the current fighting at the beginning of  April. Other reports say the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front, the  RPF, has expressed support for the idea of a UN humanitarian  force in Rwanda but says it should be smaller than the one  proposed by the world body. The RPF said Rwanda's neighbors and  any country that had backed the government in Kigali should be  excluded from the force. The guerrilla group also stressed it  will not abandon the strategic positions under its control.</p>

The new tax system  which became effective early this year has seen its results with  the financial revenue in the country increasing by 86 percent  last month. The balance between revenue and expenditure in the  month was RMB 5.1 billion [renminbi].    Such sharp growth in financial revenue is mainly attributed  to a lower base figure for January last year on which the  calculation was based and the early submission to the state  coffers of proceeds from national bonds in addition to  continuous rapid economic growth. The national economy for last  January showed some points worth nothing.    Industrial production maintained its quick growth with a  sound balance between production and marketing. The industrial  output value rose by 33.2 percent last January, a daily gain of  19.9 [as received] percent on average when taking into  consideration holidays. The sales rate increased by 1.3  percentage points over the same month last year.    The domestic market was relatively stable last month when  the  retail value of consumer goods rose by 22 percent over the same  month last year, showing a 5 percent growth after taking into  consideration the price factor.    Consumers tended to buy products of high grade with various  kinds of famous brand and high-quality products seeing the best  sales. The rural market took a turn for the better with the  retail value there last January keeping pace with that in the  urban market.    Imports showed a rapid gain and exports registered a rebound  with a rise in foreign exchange earnings. Imports increased by  78 percent in January and exports by 43.1 percent with imports  surpassing exports by U.S.$900 million.    The State Statistical Bureau said that the economy was  proceeding at a steady pace at present while at the same time  some problems concerning the economic life remained. Market  prices, already at a high level, continued to climb last  January. Consumption prices in 35 main cities rose by 23.3  percent in January over the same month last year. Various kinds  of items saw their prices rise to various extents with food,  clothing, medical health care and leisure-time activities as  well as education showing a higher gain of price ranging between  4 and 6.4 percent over January last year.    The current economy is generally regarded as an extension of  that in the fourth quarter last year. It showed quick growth on  the one hand while on the other some problems were still  prominent and macro-economic regulation needed to be kept in  place.    Authoritative sources were convinced that a rather tight  policy on the macro-economy should be maintained. Fixed assets  investment underway should be kept under control in terms of  size and direction while the gross loan volume and financial  order should be maintained with a timely adjustment necessary in  order to keep a balance between supply and demand.</p>

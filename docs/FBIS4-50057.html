			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Yesterday afternoon the provincial party  committee held a monthly meeting, which was presided over by Yin  Keshing, secretary of the provincial party committee. Briefing  the meeting on the results of his recent inspection of township  and town enterprises in Jiangsu, he said: Jiangsu has superior  geographic conditions. Its drive of reform and opening up to  the outside world and its economic development program are  progressing rapidly. Particularly, township and town enterprises  in Jiangsu have played a leading role in the country as a whole  and have made important contributions in terms of development.  At present its township and town enterprises have made certain  achievements in terms of scope, quality, and level and have  occupied a decisive position in the province's national economic  development. Township and town enterprises have scaled new  heights in terms of quality, grade, scope, and efficiency.    The export-oriented economy has developed vigorously.  Jiangsu has utilized large quantities of foreign capital and is  home to many joint-venture enterprises. The development of  township and town enterprises is closely integrated with rural  construction. The grand prospect for a new socialist  countryside characterized by the modernization of agriculture,  industrialization of rural areas, urbanization of villages,  socialization of services, and education of peasants is  gradually being materialized.    Yin Kesheng said: Considering the development of township  and town enterprises in Jiangsu Province, our province must  learn from and use as a reference Jiangsu's experience in the  following areas:    1. We should always implement the leading principle of  grasping opportunities and accelerating development, firmly  foster the idea of development being the last word, and persist  in striving for rapid development with good results if  conditions permit.    2. We should persist in promoting development with reform  and place great stress on seeking solutions to the  contradictions and problems that crop up in the course of  economic operation by deepening reform.    3. We should encourage township and town enterprises to get  involved in the market so that they will decide their  development orientation, seek development, optimize their  structure, and establish their own operational mechanisms.    4. We should persist in simultaneously grasping the two  civilizations and strive for new breakthroughs in building  spiritual civilization while accelerating economic development.    Yin Kesheng pointed out: The development situation of  township and town enterprises in our province in the last few  years is fine on the whole, but, compared with the other parts  of the country, we still have a long way to go. 1) Our  province's township and town enterprises are small in scope; 2)  the strong points which ought to be brought into play have not  been duly brought into play; 3) fund and talent shortages are  relatively pronounced; 4) the level of enterprise management is  low. [passage omitted]    The provincial party committee will hold a township and town  enterprise work meeting at an appropriate time this year to  study, in a concentrated way, ways of developing our province's  township and town enterprises more rapidly and with better  results. [passage omitted]    Yin Kesheng urged the principal party and government leaders  of prefectures and cities to personally take up the work of  developing township and town enterprises and township and town  enterprise bureaus at all levels to strengthen themselves  organizationally by providing more and better leaders and  personnel, fulfilling their duties, and boldly carrying out  their work. [passage omitted]    Present at the meeting were the standing committee members  of  the provincial party committee, including Cai Zhulin, Doba, Tang  Zhengren, Wang Hanmin, and Yao Xiangcheng.</p>

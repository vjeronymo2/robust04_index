			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Drabinsky Seeks New Partners: Garth Drabinsky, chairman of Cineplex Odeon, said  he will try to form an investment group to make a tender offer for an  unspecified number of shares of the Toronto-based movie theater company. A deal  for an earlier Drabinsky group to buy a 30% interest from the Charles R.  Bronfman family of Canada was abandoned last week after it was opposed by  Canadian securities regulators and MCA, which owns 49% of Cineplex. Drabinsky  and Cineplex Vice Chairman Myron I. Gottlieb said in a filing with the  Securities and Exchange Commission that they will solicit former group members  and "other persons, firms and corporations" about forming the new group.  </P></p>

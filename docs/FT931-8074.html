			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Travel: At Angkor Wat, the heady whiff of danger lingers on  -Nicholas Woodsworth accompanies two heads of state on a watchful visit to Cambodia's crowning glory LIKE MANY of the people who fly into the little town of Siem Riep on United Nations' military transport planes these days, I was not strictly on business. Perhaps half the UN personnel in the aeroplane hold into which I had climbed at Phnom Penh were in uniform. The others  - soldiers, electoral officials, policemen, Foreign Legionnaires, interpreters, journalists, secretaries - were dressed as brightly and indiscriminately as sightseers anywhere. Given half a chance to visit one of the world's great attractions for free, the tourist that hides in us all comes bounding out. We were all taking a little time off to see that architectural wonder, the ruins of Angkor Wat. Cut-rate tourism in Cambodia does carry its risks. The night I flew into Siem Riep, several small groups of Khmer Rouge guerrillas made their way into town from the thick surrounding forests and began shooting. From the Grand Hotel, tourists were treated to the spectacle of tracer bullets flying through the dark from several directions. During the attack, the Khmer Rouge looted houses and shops and stole a dozen valuable statues from the warehouse of Angkor Conservation, the body responsable for preserving the ruins. Three people were killed and about 20 wounded. No one believed the action had any strategic object. In the smouldering conflict between Cambodia's four armed political factions, such incidents occur almost daily. Far more likely, however, was a symbolic value attached to the operation. Angkor Wat lies at the very heart of Cambodia's collective consciousness. In an age of social upheaval and chaos, it is material proof of Khmer civilisation, of a sophisticated, cohesive and artistic people who created architectural marvels 1,000 years ago. Far more than a tourist site, it is the one unifying national symbol on which everyone agrees. As Prince Norodom Sihanouk - head of Cambodia's royal family and the country's strongest link with the past - has acknowledged, whoever holds Angkor holds Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge might not be strong enough to launch a full-scale offensive against government positions around Siem Riep. But, in mounting such a raid three days before the arrival at Angkor Wat of that most distinguished of French tourists, President Francois Mitterrand, they were showing they could strike anywhere and at any time with impunity. Forty years ago, travel writer Norman Lewis noted that French colonial tourists and dignitaries visiting Angkor Wat - the centre-piece of any trip to French Indochina - felt a certain frisson of pleasure in being accompanied on their sight-seeing jaunts from the Grand Hotel by armed guards. They found that a slight whiff of danger and banditry added immeasurably to the exotic cachet of travel in foreign parts. The days of luxury travel are over and the Grand Hotel no longer lays on armed guards. None the less that whiff, somewhat sharpened now, continues to add a certain thrill when you visit the ruins. Cambodia's long string of wars and civil disturbances over the past two decades have had one positive, unintended effect: they have saved Angkor Wat from gross commercialisation. Had the country been at peace, there would now be as many souvenir shops and tourist bus-stands sprawled around Angkor as there are around the pyramids at Giza, the Moghul tombs of Agra, or the Mayan ruins of the Yucatan. The few visitors that do come to Angkor today are swallowed up by these vast ruins spread over many miles; on an ordinary day, you can tramp about for hours without seeing a soul. Angkor's 100 or so temple sites are in themselves exquisite: complex, finely detailed, geometric expressions of man's need to place himself firmly and eternally at the centre of the universe. What makes them more than simply exquisite, and gives them their ability to inspire mystery and supernatural awe, is their hard juxtaposition to nature in its rawest and most undisciplined form. The impression made by 11,000 bas-relief figures - as you find on the stone walls of the temple known as the Bayon - is heightened many times over by the fact that they sit lost in the middle of a tangled, tropical jungle. The world inside the temples is one of precision, order and the endless repetition of a limited number of Hindu and Buddhist themes. The world outside is one of abandon and natural disorder where no two objects - leaf or vine or slithering insect - resemble each other exactly. It is this contrast which makes Angkor's magic. Too much magic can overwhelm the simple soul. After two days of visiting one mausoleum, pyramid, temple, tower, terrace, pool and funerary complex after another, I began to feel a deep angst slipping over me. If the monumental efforts of eastern despots to find immortality - here translated into millions of man-hours of painstaking labour - now lay in ruin with origins forgotten and purpose ignored, what was the point of my own paltry efforts? What was the point of anything at all? I began looking once again at the temporal and impermanent, and found it just as interesting. On the day of my arrival, I rented a small motorcycle and began puttering about the roads linking one far-flung temple complex to another. Life rolled along in its slow, Cambodian country way. Girls in bright clothing and straw hats rode by on ancient bicycles. Old men sat by stone-carved friezes in the forlorn hope of selling coconuts to visitors. Government soldiers at Angkor's two dozen road-side military posts dozed over their rifles in the noon-time heat. On the second day, things picked up abruptly. On the three-mile road leading from Siem Riep to Angkor Wat, flags and banners were set out in profusion. The bases of roadside trees were given fresh daubings of white lime. At the newly renovated Terrace of the Elephants in the dead city of Angkor Thom, archeologists of the Ecole Francaise d'Extreme Orient hoisted a shiny new sign proclaiming their work. UN graders smoothed over pot-holed roads. Experts checked the undersides of bridges and spires of temple gates in case of mines. There could only be one reason for such a hubbub. Accompanied by Sihanouk, Mitterrand - the first foreign head of state to visit Cambodia in 23 years - was on his way. The following morning, four hours before the president was due at the ruins, I went out to see the sun rise at one of the loveliest of Angkor's temples. Ta Prohm sits in an isolated spot deep in the forest. Despite its distance from town, it is one of the most popular of all sites. Left unrestored, purposely, its slow invasion by the jungle exceeds even our most romantic image of what a lost civilisation should look like. I did not, however, see the sun come up over the misty green jungle and grey stones of Ta Prohm. Two hundred yards from the temple gate, I was stopped by a lengthy exchange of automatic gunfire that was far too close for comfort. A minute later, two Cambodian soldiers popped out of the woods onto the road clutching Kalashnikovs and calling in reinforcements over their walkie-talkies. 'Pol Pot] Pol Pot]' they shouted, pointing into the woods and waving me back down the road. I turned my motor-bike around and buzzed away. Where the Khmer Rouge is concerned, you take little time to heed warnings. A few hours later, though, no one would have imagined there was a single Khmer Rouge villain within 100 miles of Ta Prohm. The entire area was patrolled by 300 French soldiers. I sat by the temple gate in the company of half a dozen heavily armed Legionnaires with blue berets on their shaven heads and bright, tricolour flashes on their shoulders. Armoured personnel carriers lay concealed in the woods. Military helicopters droned through the sky. Camouflaged sharp-shooters waited calmly beside trees and on the tops of temple walls. Five minutes before his arrival, Mitterrand's communications team arrived and set up a mobile satellite dish by the roadside. A few seconds later, the president's personal security men roared up in a white UN jeep. Only the tell-tale wires behind their ears identified them as such; otherwise, they looked like fashion-conscious gangsters. They wore dark glasses, pale lavender or rose shirts, flower-patterned braces, and had snub-nosed .38s shoved into the waistbands of their trousers. They were sweaty, covered in dust, and seemed to be enjoying themselves. A Legion captain blew a whistle. 'Trois minutes, les gars]' he shouted. 'Dans le vert]' (Into the bush). The sharp-shooters melted invisibly into the background. Preceeded by white-uniformed policemen on white motor-cycles, the president's cavalcade pulled up at the temple gates in a cloud of dust. In the famous floppy hat he wears on all warm-weather pilgrimages, Mitterrand stepped from one side of a vehicle flying the French flag, Sihanouk from the other. He looked happier than the prince as they made their way about the ruins. Mitterrand chatted casually with straw-hatted Roland Dumas, his foreign minister, as they examined friezes and dancing temple girls carved on stone. 'Magnifique] Magnifique]' they murmured to each other. Sihanouk, looking grim, followed. Not even a return to the source of Khmer greatness could hide his own frailty and ill-health. Dabbing a hankerchief to his mouth occasionally, and supported under both elbows, he was led about by dead-eyed North Korean bodyguards who made the temple carvings look animated. It was all over inside 15 minutes; as a piece of tourism, it was something less than spectacular. But Angkor's strange civilisation had once again served its eternal symbolic purpose. As a security operation and public relations exercise in an area risky enough to have delighted even Frederick Forsyth's Jackal, it was, quite simply, magnifique. As satisfied as the Legionnaires who emerged from the bush to quaff cold drinks, I hopped on my bike and followed the cavalcade back down the dusty road towards our own strange civilisation.</p>

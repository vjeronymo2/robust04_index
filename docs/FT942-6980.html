			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Arts: User-friendly 'Pygmalion' George Bernard Shaw's line 'Walk? Not bloody likely' stopped the original performance of Pygmalion for a full minute at His Majesty's Theatre in April 1914: shocked silence, then guffaws. But the stalwart Herbert Tree and the delicious Mrs Patrick Campbell promptly lost control of the last two acts. Shaw fled home to read Shakespeare to avoid the final curtain and the cries of 'Author] Author]' There are no such high moments in Patrick Garland's production at the Chichester Festival Theatre. But there are no low ones either. Chichester's first Pygmalion is like reliable TV costume sitcom: speech therapist finds and treats a patient; their life together and apart is intolerable; she outgrows him as they fall in love - or do they? Garland offers the sombre ending. Higgins realises he has blown his chances with Eliza by making her hate more than need him. This is the best English play to distinguish between manners (how you treat others) and etiquette (how you behave in social circles). Shaw reacted against the Victorian phonetics and elocution movement, and also against the etiquette guides designed to make the middle classes more genteel. Eliza is a woman refined out of her class. The design and costumes (Dierdre Clancy) have a solid air: pre-war styles and a fine arts and crafts interior for Mrs Higgins' Chelsea flat make the characters believable, even if the set is cumbersome. The background to Higgins' phonetic interests features in the voiceovers which cover the lengthy scene changes. Peter Bowles' perky performance as Higgins starts off at a ripping pace, stuffing wax rolls into the phonograph, twirling his glasses, savouring the situation at every turn: 'She's so deliciously low.' Bowles is a good TV actor, master of the quiet shrug. But the space on the Chichester stage draws expansive gestures from him, like a doubles player cajoled into a lonely singles match - in fact, the quintessential Bowles gesture is a topspin backhand which starts by his left hip and finishes above his right shoulder. Since this denotes for him everything from triumph to disaster, he can now play Wimbledon as well as Chichester. Fiona Fullerton as Eliza goes boldly into received pronunciation with wit and verve, shedding her giveaway vowels for a takeaway manner. Her excellent performance tempers Eliza's dependency with distaste, but never too much to rule out Higgins as a partner. She carries the serious message of the play into the last two acts. And she is walking out on Higgins at the end. Around the two principals, Freddie Jones as Doolittle, the 'undeserving pauper', is a feast of chopped logic and handles his scenes well enough to be unpredictable. Dulcie Gray as Higgins' mother develops the over-filial relation with Higgins and presides in the 'At Homes' with aplomb. Michael Denison as Higgins' pal, Pickering, gives firm but bewildered support, not least because the staging still needs to be streamlined so the actors can talk to each other and the audience. In repertory at the Chichester Festival Theatre until July 14.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At 1500 on 10 March, the first day of the Second  Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], the  Henan NPC Delegation held a news conference at the Guoli Hotel,  its Beijing residence.    Li Changchun -- provincial NPC delegation leader, provincial  party committee secretary, and provincial people's congress  standing committee chairman -- took the floor first at the  conference, briefing reporters from many news units on the  situation in Henan Province. Li Changchun said: Located in the  hinterland, Henan is a populous, agricultural, and interior  province. Since reform and opening up, and especially over the  past few years, the Henan Provincial CPC Committee and People's  Government have made unreserved efforts to attain the strategic  goals of raising Henan's gross national product to a level  higher than the country's average and of lowering Henan's  natural population growth rate to a level lower than the  country's average. They have called on the Henan people to  follow the Red Flag Canal Spirit of the people of Linxian County  by carrying out diligent and pioneering work in a down-to- earth  manner; holding aloft the banner of enhanced unity and constant  rejuvenation of Henan; inviting advanced foreign technology and  expertise; and establishing lateral economic associations with  other provinces and regions. As a result, Henan's economic  growth has been pushed forward to a large extent, as well as on  an extensive scale. Now Henan has been rated the ninth largest  industrial province in the country. Speaking of Henan's  development prospects, Li Changchun stated: Henan is rich in  natural resources, boasts convenient communications, and  promises excellent development prospects. Henan's development  prospects can be boiled down to good momentum and great  potential, coupled with enormous difficulties.    In answering questions raised by the reporters, Li Changchun  noted: Henan is a large interior and agricultural province.  The total population in Henan's old liberated areas,  mountainous areas, and areas along the Huang He amounts to 7  million. Henan still lags far behind the country's coastal  areas in terms of economic development, partly due to the lack  of good policies, but mainly due to the lack of internal  dynamism. We hope to be granted more preferential policies so  as to push forward Henan's economic development.    Provincial leaders -- such as Fan Qinchen, Zhang Zhigang,  Qin  Kecai, and others -- also attended and answered reporters'  questions at the news conference.</p>

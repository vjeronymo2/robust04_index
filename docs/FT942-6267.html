			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of the Computer Industry - Battle for the Desktop (11): Surprises abound / The computer printer industry is one of the most dynamic segments of the office equipment sector and has been growing at double digit rates - Printers The printer may not share the glamour of the personal computer or demand the respect traditionally accorded to the mainframe or the departmental server, but the changes under way in printers and print technology are scarely less dramatic. Today, the printer market includes humble dot-matrix machines at the low end, low cost ink-jets for low volume and colour work, high quality personal desktop laser printers, network lasers connected to local area networks, and high speed digital copier-printers in the print room. In terms of manufacturers, Mr Graham Salmons, a senior industry analyst in Dataquest's European document management group, says, 'Hewlett Packard 'owns' the European printer market.' HP has around a 33 per cent market share by volume and a similar percentage share by value - worth an estimated Dollars 2.65bn.( Pounds 1.81bn) The US manufacture's dominance of the market in part reflects a marked shift in the sales product-mix. Sales of printers based on older impact technology  -such as dot-matrix and daisy wheel printers - are falling while sales of printers based on non-impact technologies like ink-jet, laser and Led (Light Emitting Diodes) are growing strongly. This shift has been driven by the clear advantages which laser printers have over their rivals including convenience, print quality, high speed operation, advanced text and graphics capabilities and the rapid erosion of the price premum they once commanded. As a result, the 30:70 balance in favour of impact printers across Europe in 1991 is expected to be reversed over the next couple of years - 1993 was the first year when non-impact printer volumes exceeded those for impact devices. Despite this, most analysts believe the dot-matrix printer will retain a role as the office workhorse for a limited number of high volume applications including those requiring continuous paper such as orders and invoices. For low-volume work, particularly in the home market, European users in particular have eagerly embraced ink and bubble jet printers which offer fast, virtually silent printing at very low cost. Ink-jet printing technology has also provided a cost effective means of introducing colour to both business and technical graphics. According to Dataquest, HP has over 90 per cent of the European colour ink-jet market and over 50 per cent of all injet sales worth Dollars 1.13bn last year. Cannon ranks number two with around a 20 per cent share worth about Pounds 420m (Dollars 613.20m). Mr Salmons believes that injet printers will continue to replace dot-matrix at the low volume end, and that they will move away from mono to colour as lower priced laser printers are developed. Nevertheless in the personal printer market, ink-jets also face a challenge from lower cost laser printers, particularly the Windows GDI printers which have recently appeared - some costing less than Pounds 400. These printers take advantage of Microsoft Windows software and PC processing power eliminating the need for costly 'intelligence' to be built into the printer itself. Although print speeds are relatively slow, they offer high quality laser printing at low prices. More generally two distinct markets for laser printers are emerging - low-end personal printers capable of around 6ppm (pages per minute), and high-end heavy duty desktop printers capable of 16-20ppm for shared use. The trend towards networking of PCs has clearly fuelled laser printer sales over the past few years although recent research conducted by Dataquest shows that even where PC users are connected to Lans, many of them still prefer to have a personal printer. Dataquest estimates that HP has about 48 per cent of the European market for page and non-impact printers up to 6 ppm (pages per minute) and more than 60 per cent of the 16-20ppm network printer market. The main trends among the network printers are towards easier installation, simpler operation and greater paper capacity. Although HP also dominates this market segment, the projected growth of network and workgroup printing is attracting new entrants such as Rank Xerox which introduced a range network printers recently. 'Users in network environments are demanding robust, fully featured workgroup printers optimised specifically for multi-user applications,' says Mr Richard Gibbs, Rank Xerox' business team manager at a recent product launch. The company's new 4220 network printer offeres enhanced 300dpi (dots per inch) print quality at speeds up to 20ppm and seamless automatic emulation switching between print languages. Multifunctional devices combining the roles of digital facsimile, scanner, printer and copier units are also beginning to appear - although much less quickly than some had predicted. At the low-volume or 'personal' end of the office equipment market this is epitomised by the DOC-IT systems from Oki, the Japanese office machine manufacturer, which were launched last year. These systems combine an 8ppm printer with a plain-paper fax machine, digital copier and a 10ppm flatbed and hand-held scanners - all accessible through Microsoft Windows-based software running on a PC. Similarly, a growing number of xerographic copiers use digital technology which in turn enables some of them to double up as colour printers and scanners. At the top end of the office equipment spectrum Rank Xerox was the first manufacturer to introduce a high speed multi-function copier and printer. The Docutech Production Publisher prints at a rate of 135cpm (copies per minute) and can be linked up to work with any computer system thereby providing true 'printing on demand.' High speed electronic printers take output directly from a PC and come equipped with powerful raster image processors which allows them to process extremely complex documentation at very high speed. Meanwhile, although most companies have traditionally sent their high quality colour work out to offset printers, the launch of the Indigo E-Print 1000, the world's first digital offset colour printer, last summer holds out the prospect of bringing at least short-run colour work back to the office print room.</p>

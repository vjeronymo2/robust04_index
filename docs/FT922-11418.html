			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: How loans can save tax LOANS to private companies can bring tax and interest savings, but you need to plan ahead, write Ian Grant and Tony Foreman. Sometimes, when clients have made loans to a nephew's business or a son-in-law's company, they find the business has folded and the loan will have to be written off. The lender's first thought is that tax relief might mitigate some of the financial loss. The sad thing about these situations is that, very often, tax relief could have been available if the loan had been set up in the right way, The basic difficulty is that a loan is not normally a chargeable asset for capital gains tax purposes. Originally, this meant that a loss on such a loan being written off was not allowable for CGT purposes. The law was changed some years ago; now, section 136 of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979 gives relief where a lender makes a loss on a loan extended to a person carrying on a trade in the UK. But relief is available only if a range of conditions is satisfied, and this is often a problem in practice. Furthermore, even where relief is available, the allowable loss is confined to the amount of the loan which proves to be irrecoverable. There is no indexation relief. Contrast this with the situation where a loan is made to a private company by way of a debenture, with the loan stock being transferable and carrying a right to conversion into shares. Such a loan usually will qualify as a 'debt on security,' which means that it is a chargeable asset for CGT purposes. Because it is convertible, it does not fall within the definition of a qualifying corporate bond (on which no CGT relief is available). If the loan has to be written off, the allowable loss for CGT purposes is increased by indexation. This still does not give income tax relief. A capital loss can be set only against capital gains, which may be in short supply at present. There is, however, a way in which income tax relief can be secured. The secret is to put money into a private company by way of redeemable participating preference shares rather than as a loan. You should bear in mind that, in commercial terms, there will often be little to choose between the two types of investment. Whether you put in money as loan stock or participating preference shares, normally you will find that, if there is a liquidation, you rank for payment only after secured creditors and the banks have been paid off. Very often, that will leave nothing for anyone else. But if there is, then a preference shareholder will have higher priority than ordinary shareholders. A participating preference share is a special type of preference share where the holder is entitled to a fixed dividend plus a variable one. The variable element can be quite small, so that shares would qualify as participating preference shares if they carried a right to a fixed dividend of 9 per cent plus a variable dividend of 1p for every Pounds 1 dividend paid to ordinary shareholders. Why does the fact that shares are participating preference shares make so much difference? The reason is that they count for tax purposes as 'ordinary share capital.' Where a person has subscribed for ordinary share capital in a private trading company, and the shares eventually prove to be worthless, he can claim income tax relief under section 574 of the ICTA 1988. Ian Grant and Tony Foreman are tax partners with chartered accountant Pannell Kerr Forster.</p>

The resignation offer published by the Tbilisi-based  "IBERIA-EXPRESS" newspaper today was confirmed to TASS by  officials in the Defence Ministry who failed to provide  explanations on the reasons of the resignation.    The press service of Eduard Shevardnadze also refused to  give  any comments.    Karkarashvili, 28, is the symbol of the national-liberation  movement. A former Soviet Army captain, he fought in  Afghanistan and was one of the founders of the Georgian Armed  Forces.    He participated in the ouster of late President Zviad  Gamsakhurdia, fought in rebel Georgian regions of South Ossetia  and Abkhazia.    Karkarashvili replaced Tengiz Kitovani as defence minister  after a major military defeat near Gagra in Abkhazia.    He was the defence minister when Georgia lost the war to  Abkhazia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Major General Aleksey Kozhevnikov, </F> deputy commander in chief of the Russian Border Troops, by V.  Kostomarov; place and date not given: "Border Across the  Vyshtynetskoye Lake or Russia Is Ready To Compromise"]    [Text] As YANTARNIY KRAY has already reported, a working  meeting of delegations of the Russian Border Troops and the  Lithuanian Border Guard has been held.    "The negotiations were constructive, we resolved all issues  included on the agenda." This is how the head of the Russian  delegation, Major General Aleksey Kozhevnikov, deputy commander  in chief of the Russian Border Troops and chairman of the  Department for Holding International Negotiations within the  Russian Border Troops, assessed the recent developments.    The priority directions in the continued cooperation have  been detailed. This, in particular, includes exchanges of  information, investigations in the interests of guarding the  state border, the implementation of measures preventing the  illegal transfer of weapons, drugs, and other goods banned for  transborder shipments, and other illegal activities across the  border and through border checkpoints, as well as the exchange  of expertise in protecting borders and maintaining border  control.    It was agreed that to draft an intergovernmental agreement  on  cooperation in border issues, the Lithuanian side will file a  report on these negotiations with the Lithuanian Government. If  this position is approved, appropriate working groups will be  formed. They will probably meet in July-August of this year.    Anyone who attentively observes developments in relations  between Moscow and Vilnius shares, of course, the viewpoint that  one of the most complicated issues at the negotiations is the  military traffic between Russia and Kaliningrad Oblast, which  must cross Lithuanian territory. The protocol states that  during the meeting the parties exchanged opinions on transiting  goods across the territory of Lithuania to provide for the  maintenance of the Kaliningrad Group of the Russian Border  Troops. Major General Aleksey Kozhevnikov does not rule out  that they will finally resolve this issue by singling it out  from the entire block of military traffic issues.    One more thing. Participants in the meeting agreed that it  is necessary to install a direct telephone (telex) line between  the Kaliningrad Group of the Russian Border Troops and the  Lithuanian Border Guard, between units and some checkpoints, as  well as between certain border outposts and checkpoints.    I asked Major General Aleksey Kozhevnikov after the  completion of the talks to answer some of my questions.    [Kostomarov] Aleksey Vladimirovich, you mentioned that you  recently signed some border agreements with Poland. Will the  agreements with Lithuania be of a similar nature?    [Kozhevnikov] They will differ due to some peculiarities in  the conditions of the territory. Our border with Poland was  established a long time ago, it is comprehensively equipped  because for dozens of years it was guarded in cooperation with  the Polish side. Our border with Lithuania is new, unequipped,  and, in addition, has not yet been delineated. These days,  according to the press, a special commission is dealing with the  delineation issue.    [Kostomarov] Is it also addressing demarcation issues?    [Kozhevnikov] No, demarcation issues are still awaiting  their  resolution. A regular, seventh round of talks on delineation  was held in Vilnius on 27-28 May. The parties agreed on the  provisions of the planned agreement on state borders. There  are, however, two moments which demand a rapprochement of  positions.    [Kostomarov] What are they?    [Kozhevnikov] The first is the delineation of the economic  zone and the maritime area. We should discuss the initial point  from which we would proceed based on available international  agreements.    The second is connected with Vyshtynetskoye Lake. Before,  there was an administrative border -- currently, it is declared  the state border -- which ran along the Lithuanian shore. We  are ready to alter this configuration. In other words, the  Russian side can compromise in the interests of our friendly  relations with Lithuania. At the same time, we asked the  Lithuanian side to allow our ships to travel along the Neman --  Lithuanian territory -- to the Baltic Sea. At the end of the  talks, however, the position of Lithuania changed somewhat. I  believe that the commissions of the two states will establish a  point of contact.</p>

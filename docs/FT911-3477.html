			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Northern Telecom record STRONG markets, especially for central office switching equipment, and inclusion of Britain's STC's results brought record profit, revenues and orders for Northern Telecom in the first quarter. Northern, controlled by BCE, the Montreal telecommunications holding company, reported earnings of USDollars 88.1m, or 36 cents a share, up 20 per cent from USDollars 73.5m, or 30 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of USDollars 1.85bn against USDollars 1.57bn. Mr Paul Stern, chairman, said that, despite the recession, world political and economic uncertainties and tough competition, demand was good for virtually all Northern's products. STC and Northern have been integrated 'to support our strategy of growth through globalisation.' Overall expenses were up slightly to 19.8 per cent of sales, but this ratio should improve later in the year. Total research spending was USDollars 207m, against USDollars 176m, or 11 per cent of total revenues, about unchanged.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Phelps Dodge rises to Dollars 307.9m PHELPS Dodge the world's second-largest copper producer, posted earnings of Dollars 307.9m in 1992, or Dollars 4.37 a share before special accounting charges. This compares with Dollars 272.9m, or Dollars 3.93, for the same period last year. Sales for the year rose to Dollars 2.6bn from Dollars 2.4bn in 1991. The previously-announced sale of a 20 per cent interest in the LaCandelaria copper project in Chile increased company's 1992 earnings by Dollars 36.4m, or 52 cents a share. For the fourth quarter, excluding special charges, earnings were Dollars 67m, or 95 cents, up from Dollars 75.2m, or Dollars 1.08, in the 1991 fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 653.4m, up from Dollars 613.3m in 1991. Strong demand for carbon black helped lift fourth-quarter sales. The earnings gain came in spite of soft copper prices and a first-quarter closure of its Tyrone, New Mexico concentrator. Mr Douglas Yearly, chairman, said low mining costs and an improving operating environment increased profits. Net operating cash flow was Dollars 431m for the year. The company said it had entered into forward pricing agreements for 1993 that provided for a minimum average annual price of 95 cents per pound for 475m pounds of copper cathode, approximately 45 per cent of the company's anticipated 1993 production.</p>

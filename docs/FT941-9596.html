			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: French supermarkets Oddly for this stage in the cycle, French food retailers have been among the strongest performing stocks on the Paris bourse. Defensive consumer companies would normally lose ground as industrial companies promise the greater recovery prospects. But food retailers should deliver robust earnings gains themselves, despite tough trading conditions. International investors, disillusioned with the UK grocery scene, have certainly been tempted by what is on offer across the Channel. The promise is that French grocers will be able to replicate the margin expansion enjoyed by their UK counterparts in the 1980s. More efficient use of computers, the centralisation of distribution functions and the development of own-label products may enable retailers to double operating margins. This trend should be hastened by the industry consolidation which is already under way. Stricter planning restrictions may choke off superstore developments while leaving smaller discount chains more room to expand. But France already has a high density of hypermarkets. The big retail chains should still boost profits through productivity gains, even if actual turnover does not grow. Besides, some sales will come from foreign markets as retailers diversify. It is, of course, possible that UK grocers may consider themselves best able to teach the French the productivity game. Tesco has already dipped its toe in the water by acquiring Catteau. As the UK market tightens further, the leading food retailers may well be tempted to take a bigger plunge. After all, the English always were a nation of shopkeepers.</p>

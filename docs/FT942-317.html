			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Renewed weakness in bonds took the shine off a tentative recovery in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The opening on the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 at 2,922 was at a discount to cash. However, a continuation of bear closing of short positions first seen towards Monday's close helped the contract advance steadily. That early strength faltered briefly following the release of Treasury economic forecasts. But confident predictions on UK inflation helped to steady nerves and boosted gilts, helping September advance to 2,939, the peak of the day. However, the mood in the sector was changed by the release of poor US economic data. The subsequent retreat in US bonds and on Wall Street spread to London, halting the advance of the contract. September closed at 2,911, at parity with the cash market but at a 13-point discount to its fair value premium to cash. Volume was 15,086 lots. In traded options, a big trade in Lasmo was the most significant feature. There was a seller of some 2,000 of the 154 calls at 3.5p. Total volume in the stock option was 2,756 contracts and volume in the sector as a whole was a poor 24,862, of which 8,408 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,905 in the Euro FT-SE option.</p>

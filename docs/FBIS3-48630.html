But they stressed that the extension of new official  development assistance (ODA) to Myanmar, formerly Burma, awaits  more "tangible developments" in terms of its moves toward  restoration of democracy and improvements in its human rights  situation.    "In principle, our bilateral assistance remains suspended,  except for humanitarian and emergency assistance rendered on a  case-by-case basis," said one source.    The sources said Japan welcomes the Myanmar military junta's  holding earlier this month, after a four-month break, of a  national convention charged with drawing up a new constitution.  But they said the timetable for completion of the constitution  and a transfer of power to a new democratic government remains  unclear.    The sources said that while some political prisoners have  been released by the junta, it is not known when Nobel Peace  Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi will be released from house  arrest. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won a  landslide victory in parliamentary elections in May 1990, but  the junta, governing as the State Law and Order Restoration  Council (SLORC), nullified the results. She has been under  house arrest since July 1989.    SLORC leader Lt. General Khin Nyunt told Japanese  journalists last week that a five-year limit on house arrest  would be reached in July, but did not clarify if Suu Kyi would  be released then.    One ministry source said the Myanmar junta "should be  commended to some extent" for its recent moves in the direction  of openness.    "But to more seriously consider resumption of ODA we need to  see more tangible developments," the source said. He said Japan  wants "to encourage Myanmar to further open its society and  ameliorate the human rights situation, and to promote the  transfer of power."    Japan, long Myanmar's largest benefactor, joined other major  donor nations in suspending economic assistance in 1988 after  the army killed hundreds of pro-democracy protesters. But early  the following year it broke ranks and decided to continue with  economic assistance already pledged, which by some calculations  totaled in excess of 100 billion yen.    There are views in the Japanese Government that new official  yen loans should be resumed if Suu Kyi is released and allowed  to undertake some measure of political activities, the sources  said.    They said there also exist views that the restoration of  such  assistance would help stabilize the Myanmar economy, which would  in turn facilitate the promotion of democracy. Between 1973 and  1988, Japan provided more than two-thirds of all bilateral ODA  disbursements to Myanmar.</p>

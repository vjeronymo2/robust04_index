			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 20 Apr--No agreement has been reached yet  and no protocol signed on the legal status of the Russian  military mission in Poland that supervises the transit of its  troops from Germany to Russia, Maj-Gen Zdzislaw Ostrowski,  Polish Government plenipotentiary for the stationing of Russian  troops in Poland, announced today. In the first quarter of this  year, the transit of Russian Federation troops from the FRG  through Poland proceeded according to plan.    The problem of the mission's legal status has been dragging  on since the last meeting of the Polish-Russian mixed commission  in September of last year, when no protocol was signed. Among  the matters at issue was the question of expanding the mission's  competences, as suggested by the Polish side.    The Poles proposed the setting up of a new commission  attached to the military mission, which would deal with claims  concerning damage caused by the troops stationed in Poland and  unpaid bills for communal services. The Russians suggested that  the matters at issue should be dealt with through diplomatic  channels; they also claimed they had paid their dues.    There were six claims by Polish citizens and institutions in  the first quarter of this year for damage totalling over 2  billion zlotys [Z]. In March, the Polish-Russian mixed  commission examined 12 cases with claims exceeding Z3 billion,  one claim for $331,000, and one for 122,000 DM [German marks].  Eleven of these cases were directed to diplomatic channels.    The last subunit of the Russian Army left Poland on 18  September of last year. About 25 servicemen stayed in the  military mission. It is expected that in May of this year eight  members of the mission, together with their families, will leave  Poland.</p>

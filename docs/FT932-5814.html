			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Holiday company clients face loss SIX HUNDRED holidaymakers are in danger of losing money following the collapse of Oxford-based SFV Holidays last month, according to the company which has bought the SFV client list. Kingsland Holidays, a Ply-mouth-based company that organises holidays in France, said yesterday that it had bought the client list from liquidators Berley and Co for an undisclosed sum. Mr Simon Law, a Kingsland director, said: 'We have not bought SFV Holidays in full, nor are we in a position to take on its debts. Our main responsibility is to facilitate completion of endangered holiday bookings.' The company estimates that 650 of SFV's 820 bookings in French villas were made by credit card, which would enable customers to receive refunds. As each booking was for a party of holidaymakers, Kingsland estimates the total number of people who made bookings was 3,000. About 20 per cent did not book by credit card and their only redress will be as ordinary creditors. SFV was an unbonded company and had not arranged protection for customers. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had told the company it was not required to protect clients' money because it was not a package operator. This was because it allowed clients to choose their own ferry crossings without assistance from the company. Kingsland, a fully bonded member of the Association of Independent Tour Operators, said it had been in touch with owners of self-catering accommodation in France who had taken bookings from SFV. Mr Law said property-owners were co-operating with Kingsland, even though some had not received any payment from SFV.</p>

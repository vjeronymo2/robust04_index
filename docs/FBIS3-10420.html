			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The UN Security Council president, French Ambassador  Jean-Bernard Merimee, said he acknowledged the necessity for the  formation of a new government headed by a new prime minister.  However, he said that would not suffice to resolve the crisis.  It is therefore necessary to reinforce the sanctions against the  country. Furthermore, Ambassador Merimee says that a new draft  resolution aimed at reinforcing the embargo was referred to the  UN Security Council and that this draft resolution, which  includes personal sanctions against the military, will become  effective between now and next week.    [Begin Merimee recording] Finally, we have a draft  resolution  that [words indistinct], which establishes personal sanctions  [words indistinct]. There must be a government. But that would  certainly not be sufficient to bring the situation to normal.  This is why the council has decided to go into action. [end  recording]    It should be noted that a draft resolution providing for  reinforcement of the international sanctions against Haiti was  referred to the UN Security Council on 4 March by the group  called Friends of Haiti. This draft resolution provides for a  total commercial embargo except for food products and medicines,  a ban on noncommercial flights to and from Haiti, and  restrictions on travel abroad by the Haitian military and their  close relatives.    Those measures will reportedly add further to the oil and  arms embargo that has been in effect. Except for the clauses  relating to travel restrictions, they will reportedly be  implemented immediately; the new sanctions will reportedly come  into effect 15 days after the adoption of the resolution. If  this text is accepted, it will be the first time the United  Nations has imposed a total commercial embargo on Haiti.    We recall that, in an article by Robert Novak and published  on 2 March, THE WASHINGTON POST wrote that the effects of the  embargo on Haiti are devastating and irreversible.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Books: When anti-semitism ruled in Italy BENEVOLENCE AND BETRAYAL: FIVE ITALIAN JEWISH FAMILIES UNDER FASCISM by Alexander Stille Jonathan Cape Pounds 20, 365 pages THOUGH THE Jewish population of Italy before the Second World War was numerically small (approximately 47,000 in a country of 45 million), it was disproportionately important in Italian life, not only - as might have been expected - in commercial life, but also in the worlds of culture and politics. There were Jewish members of Parliament, Jewish mayors, Jewish cabinet members; there had even been a Jewish prime minister. There were Jewish musicians, artists, scientists, and a whole array of brilliant writers, from Italo Svevo in the early years of the century to the young Alberto Moravia. Since ancient Roman times the Italian peninsula had served as a place of refuge for Jews, though there were alternating periods of repression and tolerance, until finally - with the unification of the country in 1870 - the last traditional restrictions were abolished, the gates of the last ghettos were torn down, and a period of what promised unlimited opportunity for assimilation began. The coming of Fascism in 1922 seemed, at first, to effect no changes in the situation. Indeed, much of the solid, conservative Jewish bourgeoisie joined the Fascist Party, and was welcomed into it. Like many Italians, the Jewish leaders applauded what looked like a new national stability, and if this came at the price of a certain amount of bombast and regimentation, it was worth it, as the nation gained self-respect and convincingly assumed the guise of a world-power. Even in those early years, of course, there were Italians, including a number of Jews, who distrusted Mussolini's hollow rhetoric, who suffered at the suppression of freedoms, and were aghast at the real lawlessness - as the murder of the Socialist parliamentarian Giacomo Matteotti made clear - concealed behind Fascism's jerry-built facade. After Hitler's rise to power, Mussolini at first distanced himself from his German epigone, especially from his anti-semitism. But a few years later, when political expediency demanded it, Mussolini fell in line and promulgated the 'racial laws' of 1938. For many Jewish anti-fascists, this was a signal, and a number of them began leaving the country. Those who could not leave soon adapted to the anti-Jewish restrictions, which in the beginning were generally applied without great vigour. But then came the Allied invasion, the collapse of the Italian government, the German occupation of the country (except for the South, now in Allied hands); and at a certain point, the round-ups, the mass murders began. Jews and many Italian non-Jews lived in a world of hunger and delation. Partisan resistance grew stronger, as die-hard Fascists regrouped around the resuscitated Mussolini; soon Northern Italy was engaged in what amounted to a sanguinary civil war. This cruel period of Italy's history is not well known outside the country, and even Italians prefer not to think about it. It has served novelists - like Elsa Morante, for her epic novel History, and Giorgio Bassani, for his poetic, but harrowing stories of Ferrara - more than it has served historians. Now the young American writer Alexander Stille has revisited that time and its mortal problems with the investigative eye of a skilled reporter, but also with the compassion and sense of the individual more characteristic of the writer of narrative. On the most immediate level, Stille tells stories: the lives of five Jewish families, some of whom survived, some of whom succumbed. All are Jewish, but some are more Jewish than others; and all are Jewish in different ways. To begin with, the privileged life of the rich Ovazza family of Turin is in dramatic contrast with the close-to-the-bone existence of the poor inhabitants of Rome's ghetto, while the glamorous Genoese playboy-aviator Massimo Teglio, not a very observant Jew, as the Nazi and Fascist anti-semitic activity worsened found himself elbow to elbow first with the saintly rabbi Riccardo Pacifici, then with a young priest - another unlikely Scarlet Pimpernel - Don Francesco Repetto, involved in rescuing Jews and smuggling them into Switzerland. Stille tells these and other stories almost without editorialising. The events - and, where possible, the survivors - speak for themselves. And the result is a vivid, eloquent page of history: not just Jewish, not just Italian, but human. The individuals emerge, often heroically; but the context is also clearly presented. No mean task, for boundaries are blurred: there were good Fascists, there were bad Jews, some Germans were more understanding than others. Though half a century has passed since the mass-deportations from Italy, the subject is still sadly timely, as racism and anti-semitism seem resurgent. A new generation has to learn the lessons that cost its parents and grandparents so much. Stille's admirable study can provide a vital - and irresistibly readable - text.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mirka Velinovska: "Season of Confederations"] </F>   [Excerpts] Even if it is proven that most of the world's  media have assessed the United States' and Russia's performances  badly, saying that they only appeared to be participating in the  settlement of the Balkan problems and that it was not actually a  rerun of Yalta, the unavoidable conclusion is that the changing  world has been caught in a contradiction. It needs a break to  gain time and see where and how to go on. Forces are once again  gathering, the process is reversed. The blocs fell apart, the  problems that had existed before transformed themselves into  mutant forms after the balance of the bipolar world was  disturbed, and neither now nor in the near future will there be  any efficient mechanisms for their solution. Therefore, there  will probably be, if only for a short time, a return to the old  tried and tested experiences. That is why there is Russian  presence in the Balkans. The Russian Blue Helmets have been in  Croatia, as part of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces],  since the beginning of the mission, but they went to Bosnia at  Karadjic's request. This was an excuse, they took advantage of  the good opportunity. One of the political anomalies is that  Russia has now achieved something it could never do before [the  Russian presence in Bosnia] -- neither in czarist times, nor  through ideology, let alone during Tito's lifetime -- with UN  sponsorship and as a partner of the United States.    Maybe the world is trying to dress its ranks, to think in a  different way, but it is a fact that it is still following the  pattern it has shaped and that is the reason for us, in  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM],  to believe that all solutions are possible, and expected, in the  still undefined political territory that is the Balkans. Let us  not forget that Macedonia is not in the CSCE system of  collective security, it is not on the list of countries with a  ticket for the Partnership for Peace plan, the United States has  frozen the establishment of diplomatic relations, and in that  sense, all options are still possible.    What was the role of Greece in urging Russia to enter the  Balkans -- practically at the gates of NATO? Logically, there  should not be many reasons, but just take a look at what is  going on: Andrey Kozyrev was in Athens at precisely the time  when Greece announced the introduction of the economic blockade  against Macedonia and not only did he say nothing regarding the  blockade but, until the present day we have not yet heard any  official Russian stance on this issue, except for its readiness  to mediate in the dispute. Probably Kozyrev knows that there is  already a mediator in the dispute with Greece; it is Cyrus  Vance, and the new dispute is not a problem of a bilateral  nature, but a problem the European Union has with one of its  members, and it is not a dispute, but a unilateral declaration  of economic war. Therefore, one gets the unavoidable impression  that Kozyrev thought it was good that that Russia has now  increased its activity on the territory of former Yugoslavia, it  could finish its job and extend the zone of Russian interest to  a point that Russia was never allowed to reach before. Even more  than that, because "we and the Russians are Slavs," and  moreover, we are orthodox. Russia has not abandoned its  legitimate interest in Bulgaria despite the altered milieu  there. Recently, in Bulgaria, as the concept of an  orthodox-western division strengthened, a "concern about the  possible transfer of the Bosnia syndrome to Bulgarian soil"  appeared and the Muslim (Turkish) minority was mentioned as a  danger, as well as Turkey itself, which is a sign that the  Orthodox-Slav concept has its supporters in Bulgaria, who  disturb the United States' interest in the East-West transversal.    Another subsidiary effect, no less important in such a  strategy if it is applied to Macedonia, is that Russia could  outflank Kosovo and Albania, which is totally different from  having the United States outflank Serbia. Somewhat below, some  200 kilometers to the south, there is Greece, a barrier to the  greater ambitions of the orthodox allies, under the full  protection of the United States and the European Union, a pet  that was given a role in the blocs' world. It is very well  thought of, and it has to be mentioned that it was well  prepared. It is not known what and how big the contribution of  major partner, the United States, was in all this, but that  Greece came up with this idea is perfectly well known. At times  through direct channels, at others through indirect channels,  official Macedonia received signals of "attractive" offers, and  as is always the case, they were followed by the threat that was  it not for Greece and Serbia, Macedonia would collapse. Just  take a look at the Serbian press lately, it is totally obvious,  just listen to the statements of the Serbian politicians and  "scientists" and everything becomes clear. Vuk Draskovic has  already opened the season of confederations, saying, or better  wishing, to see Macedonia in confederal relations with Serbia,  that is logical for him. In BORBA of 22 March, in the report  from Washington titled "Through Krajina to the Yugo-Basket" it  was written that "the agreement between Washington and Moscow on  Krajina is an announcement of their joint activity in finding a  loose confederal structure for former Yugoslavia (without  Slovenia, and Macedonia for now)." On the other hand, there is  the view of Croat journalist Gojko Marinkovic that "a long time  ago, the United States provided itself with a big aircraft  carrier in 'Eastern Yugoslavia' called Macedonia."    That seems to be the crux of Greece's dissatisfaction. It is  using direct, and other, means to marginalize Macedonia's  position in order to return to other questions of top national  interest -- Cyprus and the Greek minority in Albania, which were  referred to by the contradictory [Greek Alternate Foreign  Affairs Minister Theodhoros] Pangalos as even more important  than the border with Macedonia, for which he recommended another  policy, because the one implemented by Greece at this moment "is  understood by no one in the world." This diplomat, if  everything, is okay with his thinking machine [as published],  which allows him to make logical judgments, as shown by his  latest statement that "the border with our country will remain  closed because the embargo is just and the reasons deep," but we  should expect changes in Greek policy, as well as in the  behavior of the people.    Whatever it might imply, it seems to me that the Europeans  and the United States are rubbing our nose in it, just on the  eve of Papandreou's visit to Washington, which has now been  postponed three times, with a possibility of also being  postponed this time. If an expressedly anti-American rally of 1  million people is under preparation in Salonika, reinforced by  the possible visit of John Shalikasvili to Macedonia at the  beginning of April, the Clinton-Papandreou meeting will be at  risk. In any case, the integral statement of Pangalos should be  understood as an announcement of the agenda of the Washington  meeting and as a presentation of two additional open and awkward  problems in the White House Oval Office related to its zone of  interest. However, all this does not mean that Greece has lost  its favorable position in relation to Macedonia, or its interest  in us. Pangalos should not be trusted when he says that the  issue that his country has created is of a lesser importance  than the ones he announced, or the ones he defrosted. It would  be naive. Greece will still be engaged in marginalize Macedonia,  but this time with the help of other means. An example of the  directions of the "new Greek policy" may be the attempt at the  European Conference on Transport, where it [Greece] proposed the  construction of the Drac-Salonika-Istanbul corridor, with the  aim of by-passing Macedonia. The proposal was not adopted  because transport can not be influenced easily by one country's  wishes, and it is of great interest to many factors. Even such a  proposal does not give the answer to the question about the  north-west corridor, which is as important, if not more  important, for Greece. In this case, Macedonia cannot be  avoided, unless Greece presents a reserve plan for a repeated  by-passing of Macedonia -- that part of the road should go  across Albania, Montenegro, and Serbia.    Concerned about how to make all its moves, our neighbor, it  seems, has not counted on the simple fact that the United States  will not easily give up its strategic interests and games merely  out of friendship with Greece. Russia is also not a country that  can be tricked. You cannot trade with it the way the "Salonika  merchants" are doing, presenting the Macedonian-Greek dispute  the way they want to, without receiving an adequate reply from  the United States. The United States has -- just after the  experience in Bosnia- Herzegovina, where Russia became the  guarantor for Karadjic's Serbs -- announced and implemented its  own symbolic additional presence in Macedonia within the  frameworks of UNPROFOR. It looked like an extra deposit on a  deposit for a certain territory. Moreover, reliable sources  revealed to us that the unestablished, frozen U.S. ambassador  comes with a team composed of mainly economic experts, therefore  it is normal to think that the plan for a greater Russian  component on our territory will not be possible for the moment.  Nevertheless, we should not be lulled by this relatively well-  defined Macedonian position. It does not mean that such attempts  and definite Greek-Serbian pressures on Macedonia will  disappear. In the text above we mentioned the elements of  concern. Let us add to them: The world community, particularly  the United States and the European Union, has not offered  Macedonia much from its pockets except for its ponderous  sympathy and respect. Not much has been left out of the decision  that it was indispensable to provide financial aid in order to  make some small compensation for the damage caused by the  blockade against Serbia and Montenegro, including the damage  that is yet to come after the Greek unilateral blockade. Here  and there we can hear that a certain country eased its  conscience with a couple of million dollars, in a situation when  everyone knows your needs are for hundreds of millions of  dollars. If that becomes part of the basket of preventive  diplomacy that is now being exercised in our country, then there  will hardly be any effects of the prevention if the citizens of  Macedonia don't make their own contribution. In other words, the  best prevention is ourselves and our awareness that this is a  very dangerous situation, and a policy that will not help in our  own destruction. Trade and the partners' balance of forces are  on course, and we have no serious guarantees for the final  outcome. If Europe existed as Toto Cottugno sang about it --  united and with strong national interests in each separate  country member for the creation of a joint European policy --  that would be another story.</p>

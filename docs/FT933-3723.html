			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Records: British pop award takes the respectable route WELL, caution and common sense prevailed, and the judges of the Mercury Prize, Pounds 25,000 in readies for the creators of the best British pop album of the year, gave the money on Wednesday night to Suede for their eponymous album, Suede. If the Mercury wants to be the equal of the Booker in terms of outrage it will have to do better than that. If it wants to prove that the pop industry is as respectable and export minded as the manufacturers of widgets it could hardly have done better. Last year the judges of the first Mercury Prize took something of a flier and selected Screamadelica by the Scottish group Primal Scream. It added 30,000 to the sales of their album but hardly made the band international stars. This year the bookies' favourite won. Suede are the brightest young British band. They are fashionably androgynous, not to say gay, in a coyly blatant way, with lots of nudges, and bold images, in their lyrics. They appeal to young girls, who like the fact they resemble them, and to young boys, who enjoy a cathartic brush with the wild side. They are the type of band that record executives feel easy with, that they want the public to like. This is amazingly tuneful music, in the mainstream tradition, with echoes of everyone from David Bowie to Duran Duran, but with lyrics that make the Rolling Stones sound like sissies. The strongest song is 'Animal Nitrate', with its oblique druggy story line, while 'Metal Mickey' is equally tuneful about sex. Suede manage both hummable melodies and a louche image, which promises a long international career. It is music for hairdressing salons and for American arenas, and is only revolutionary in not being aimed at the dance clubs, which have dominated the music scene for too long. What of the other nine short listed albums? Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet, by Gavin Bryars, was the essential long shot, the bizarre album which ensured lots of publicity for Bryars and for the Prize. Last year this role was taken by John Tavener's The Protecting Veil, which offered some link between the popular and the classical worlds. Bryars spiritual input, although genuine, is more ragged than Tavener's seamless mock medievalism. Its inspiration was the song of a street beggar and it has the impact, powerful but upsetting, of the gutter. It grates and irritates and lingers. Then came a group of albums which reveal individuals with their own wayward visions edging towards the commercial. The most interesting was No Reservation by Apache Indian. This successfully merges street sounds, especially the obtrusive Jamaican Ragga, and its incessant hypnotic lyrics, with the equally mesmerising Asian Bhangra music. It is a powerful mix, more stimulating than soulful, but a good, if optimistic, vision of young urban living and brings Indian music into the mainstream at last. New Wave by The Auteurs is solidly student music, bed-sitter images for the 1990s stuck in the sound of the early 1970s. Here again the lyrics are worth attention and the orchestrations are not afraid of cellos and a subtle bass line. There is a committed intensity in New Wave and if writer-singer Luke Harris owes something to Leonard Cohen in his vocal approach it is a worthwhile debt. The Mercury judges could not totally ignore current popular taste, however debased, and hot favourites with Suede were club band Stereo MC. Connected was the album with the hit singles, songs lapped up on the dance floor but smooth enough for listening. There is a little rap; an easy groove; and loads of spirit to make this the acceptable sound of the times, funky but unlikely to scare the horses. The other main commercial challenger was New Order. Republic shows a welcome return to form for Peter Hook's enduring band. This is dreamy, well crafted, mature pop music. Dina Carroll and PJ Harvey were the women candidates. Carroll's So Close is old fashioned, American soul. It is a big voice revolving around a small emotional circle. Rid of Me by PJ Harvey is more interesting. The voice has a wistful intensity which you can hardly escape from, and if the songs are despairing at least genuine depths of feeling are being plumbed. The final two albums show up the limitations of the Mercury Prize. Both were short- listed to satisfy contradictory and unfulfillable demands. Stan Tracey is one of the UK's longest serving and best loved jazz musicians. His tribute to even greater Greats, such as Ellington and Rollins, in Portraits Plus appeals to the coterie of jazz fans and to sentimental judges. In contrast Sting's Ten Summoner's Tales could also never win because Sting obviously does not need Pounds 25,000, or a career boost, and you cannot honour such an established artist without revealing a total lack of imagination, even if his album is the probably the best group of pop songs written in the past year. Sting would doubtless have given the Prize to a deserving international cause. Suede, showing that they have quickly assumed the trappings of success, gave the money to cancer charities.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / BCCI regulator faces writ The liquidators to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International have launched legal action against the Luxembourg banking regulators, Andrew Jack writes. The writ, issued in the Luxembourg courts in the last few weeks, seeks compensation from the Luxembourg Monetary Institute (IML), the lead regulator for BCCI's holding company. The action follows similar litigation launched last year by the liquidators against the Bank of England for allegedly failing in its duty as a regulator to BCCI. The liquidators have also sued BCCI's directors, auditors, and Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz and National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia in efforts to recover assets for creditors. Details of the writ are expected to be announced today at the same time as the liquidators appointed to BCCI in England from accountants Touche Ross make public their annual filing to the Department of Trade and Industry. The filing, which has been produced after the statutory deadline with the consent of DTI officials, will show that the English liquidators have so far realised assets of about Dollars 750m from a stated total asset value of Dollars 3.2bn. Touche Ross fees up until this February total Pounds 98m on the English liquidation, but were in dispute and had still not formally approved when the BCCI creditors' committees met most recently last week. The liquidators refuse to add to their long-standing estimate that creditors may ultimately receive 30p-40p in the pound. They are still finalising the terms of an agreement tentatively approved with the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in the bank, in which it pays Dollars 1.8bn in exchange for a waiver of any possible litigation against it by the liquidators.</p>

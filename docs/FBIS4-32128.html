			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andrej Sabol, state secretary at the Czech </F> Ministry of Defense, by Oldrich Zabojnik; place and date not  given: "Arms Companies Have Something To Build On"]    [Text] [Zabojnik] How do you view the possibility of  cooperation between the arms companies in a situation where  these enterprises have begun to compete, to a certain extent, in  both republics?    [Sabol] The arms industry of the former Czechoslovakia was  organized as a whole. After the federation was partitioned, the  situation changed, but, nevertheless, what sense would it make  to buy something expensive in third countries that we ourselves  can make more cheaply at home? A solution would be to agree on  mutually advantageous economic opportunities. In both the Slovak  Republic and the Czech Republic, there is interest in arms  production because arms, as an important source of funds for the  state coffers, do sell and will sell in the world.    [Zabojnik] As a result of conversion, production was  completely phased out in the Slovak Republic. Will there not be  problems in reviving production?    [Sabol] The arms industry of the Slovak Republic is now  working at 8 percent of its capacity. We do not want the  industry to produce as much as before. However, we can produce  in order to meet the needs of our armies and the armies of  countries with similar equipment that needs to be renewed. The  modernization of equipment produced in the arms factories of the  former federation, the Soviet Union, and the Warsaw Pact  countries could become the second and a larger component of our  common interests. Each of these countries can carry out this  modernization using its own capacities, but full modernization  is not quite possible in that way. Purchasing expensive  technology from Western arms manufacturers may also be involved.  There also is a third possibility: We may reach agreement, and  everyone, according to his possibilities, will help to meet our  common needs. Now, the final problem is: To what extent are we  really able to revive and develop cooperation?    [Zabojnik] What did you learn at the recent IDET '94 arms  fair in Brno? It was possible to compare the products from both  republics there.    [Sabol] I saw both the Czech and jthe Slovak versions of the  modernized tank, and I spoke with experts from both countries.  If we agreed upon joint technological steps, it would certainly  lead to even better results and mutual benefit. Other countries  do not give up their own arms production, either. For example,  Switzerland is developing arms production that is more expensive  than possible purchases abroad. When I asked why they were  taking this course of action, they said: We keep the know-how  at home, the arms industry means the constant development of  technologies, and we provide jobs for our own people. This is  also a way for us, I believe.    [Zabojnik] The Slovak version of the modernized T-72 tank  has  met with a positive response from foreign experts. How are you  satisfied?    [Sabol] Some details can still be improved on ours as well  as  the Czech version. Jointly, we could get even further. I do not  imagine that the Czech side is thinking only about its own army,  but also wants, like ourselves, to assert itself abroad. This  means jobs for people at home and making our presence felt in  the world. We are also aware of the financial problems in some  countries that want to modernize economically but rationally.  This presents great opportunities to the producers in both  countries.</p>

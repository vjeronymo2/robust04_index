			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Police seek name of Channel 4 terrorism informant CHANNEL 4 television could face fines or seizure of assets if it refuses to give police the name of an informant. They want to know who revealed the existence of a secret loyalist organisation behind sectarian death squads in Ulster. The Department of Public Prosecutions was yesterday given High Court permission to start proceedings against Channel 4 and Box Productions, an independent producer, for contempt of court. The Committee, a programme broadcast last October, alleged that members of the security forces, loyalist paramilitaries and local businessmen organised sectarian killings in the province. The programme showed an anonymous informant in silhouette. Soon after the programme was broadcast, Channel 4 handed the police an 80-page dossier which including 19 names. Four weeks after transmission Channel 4 and Box Productions were served with orders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act requiring them to reveal all their evidence, including names and addresses. Channel 4 decided not to comply fully with the orders because of the 'acute and real risk' to the life of their main informant. It claimed yesterday that this was the first time the authorities had used the Prevention of Terrorism Act to try to compel journalists to reveal sources and name key informants. The main source agreed to appear on the programme on the strict understanding that his identity would be protected. Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, said yesterday: 'If journalists investigating terrorist activity cannot protect their sources, matters of legitimate public concern will become journalistic no-go areas.' Ms Liz Forgan, director of programmes at Channel 4, said: 'We are not talking about protecting terrorists. It (the programme) exposed a dangerous and sinister terrorist organisation and therefore tried to prevent terrorism.' Before the broadcast of the programme and since, Channel 4 said, there had been threats to those involved - the most recent on Tuesday. The move to commit Channel 4 and Box for contempt is likely to be heard in the next few weeks. The Prevention of Terrorism Act gives no protection to information given in confidence but the court can make an order only if it is satisfied that itis in the public interest to do so. Channel 4 will argue that it was in the public interest to present first-hand evidence of death squads being organised with the collusion of members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The company agreed to protect anonymity of individuals 'because their evidence concerned a matter of the gravest public interest and because their lives were clearly at risk'.</p>

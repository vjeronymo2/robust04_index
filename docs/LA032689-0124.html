			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STEADY RAIN TO GIVE WAY TO LIGHT SHOWERS TODAY  </P> <P> Several areas of San Diego County were drenched Saturday -- Palomar Mountain  received nearly 3 inches of rainfall -- but forecasters said the steady rain  would be replaced by light showers today.  </P> <P> Today's precipitation -- the last remnants of Saturday's storm front -- may  ruin weekend plans, but forecasters say the rain is greatly needed.  </P> <P> "We're way below normal for this time of the year," said Wally Cegiel, a  forecaster with the National Weather Service. "We're getting much-needed rain."  </P> <P> At this stage of the rain season, which runs from July 1 to June 30, San Diego  County typically has received 7.96 inches of rain. But so far, only 5.31 inches  of rain has fallen.  </P> <P> For Monday, warmer, sunnier weather is expected to return.  </P> <P> Today's morning showers are expected to yield a mere .25 inch of rain, but it  would add to Saturday's substantial rainfall, Cegiel said.  </P> <P> Most areas of the county received at least nearly .50 inch of rain: San Diego  had .48, Oceanside .60, El Cajon .63 and Escondido .80. Julian received 1.2  inches of rain, and Palomar was thoroughly doused with 2.75 inches.  </P> <P> After the morning showers, temperatures today are expected to reach 62 to 67  degrees along the coast and inland. Overnight temperatures should drop into the  mid-50s coastal and high 40s inland. GENE YASUDA  </P></p>

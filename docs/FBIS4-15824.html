			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 4 April POSTIMEES, p.3 ; "News Bulletin" No. 68/94] </F>   [Text] The government supports in principle the forming of  an ad hoc parliamentary commission to study the case of the  daily RAHVA HAAL and wider aspects of the privatisation of  state-owned media, government spokesman Ain Saarna said on  Friday [8 April]. Thursday's cabinet session had discussed the  draft laws submitted by the Centre faction and the Coalition  Party-Rural Union factions. The factions recommended that the  activities of the board of the state-owned company "Rahva Haal"  be suspended and the agreement with the company "Hommikuleht" on  the publication of the RAHVA HAAL be terminated. Saarna  commented that the government does not support nor wish the  approval of these draft laws in their present form. The forming  of the ad hoc parliamentary commission will only be possible  after a ruling coalition faction or Riigikogu [parliament]  member should propose it, he explained.</p>

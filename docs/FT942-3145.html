			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / SFO powers face legal test case A test case over the powers of the Serious Fraud Office to suspend the right to silence and force suspects to answer questions was taken to the High Court yesterday. In a judicial review, the SFO is asking two judges to overturn a ruling of Clerkenwell Magistrates Court that Mr Larry Trachtenberg, one of six men charged over the Maxwell affair, was entitled to refuse to answer questions put to him by SFO investigators. The magistrate ruled in February last year that Mr Trachtenberg had a reasonable excuse not to answer questions put to him under Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 because he had already been arrested.</p>

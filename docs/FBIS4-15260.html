			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Viktor Samoylov, general </F> director of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, by Lada  Lyashenko; place, date not given: "Peddling Military Goods"]    [Text] Last November the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company  for the import and export of arms and military hardware was set  up in accordance with a presidential edict. Our correspondent  discussed the aims and tasks of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State  Company with Lieutenant General Viktor Samoylov, general  director of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company.    [Lyashenko] Viktor Ivanovich, what prompted the idea to set  up this new arms import and export company?    [Samoylov] All these organizations [not further identified]  were simply duplicating each other. The new state company is  leaving the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations structure,  but is nonetheless the successor to the organizations you have  listed. Previously, under the rigid system for managing economic  activity, foreign exchange revenue from weapons sales was  distributed by the state itself. The situation then changed,  enterprises were being floated, and they began acquiring their  own economic interests. The process of producers entering the  foreign market began to snowball.    But how could this be done without knowing the basic rules  adopted in the world of the arms trade, without having any idea  about pricing conditions, the system of credit provision, and  much else besides -- quite apart from the fact that the arms  trade business, as a rule, is strictly secret and foreigners are  not privy to these secrets? But this was not all. Often the  interests of such businessmen overlap with the interests of our  state, and buyers played them off against each other in order to  knock down the price of military goods. Just imagine the  picture of the Bangladeshi or Malaysian defense ministers, who  were visited by 24 Russian representatives in the space of a  year, each claiming the exclusive right to supply Russian  weapons.    [Lyashenko] What specifically will "Rosvooruzheniye" be  doing?    [Samoylov] Primarily, importing and exporting all sorts of  weapons and military hardware, military property, and  strategically important raw materials. We are beginning to  operate in the world market as a powerful financial and  industrial group with excellent professionals who know not only  about military hardware but also about economics and marketing  -- in other words, the entire arms trade mechanism.    One fundamentally new task is to invest our own funds and  those of others in defense-sector enterprises. Organizing our  work with them on a contractual basis, our company plans to use  state and commercial credits to develop and produce primarily  weapons types and military hardware that will be competitive on  the world market.    The largest military-industrial complex enterprises will  continue to take part in foreign economic activity under  agreements with "Rosvooruzheniye."    [Lyashenko] How will the income be shared out between those  taking part in the production and sale of military products?    [Samoylov] We are developing this mechanism. But, for  instance, in the United States the bulk of the money raised from  arms sales goes to reduce the burden of defense expenditure and  to subsidize defense production. It resolves the problems of  restructuring the defense complex.    [Lyashenko] Viktor Ivanovich, in restructuring the arms  trade like this, will we not be losing our old and pretty good  ties on the world market?    [Samoylov] "Rosvooruzheniye" has made a very cautious entry  into the market. The arms trade is a relatively long process --  it is not the same as pumping oil down a pipeline. After all,  the partner state buying our weapons also has to make a  government-level decision and allocate budget appropriations.  And it is very difficult to make such important decisions in a  democratic state with its multiparty system and different views,  whereby you sometimes need a virtually nationwide referendum to  decide whether to buy our MiG's or a U.S. aircraft. That is why  the people representing the vendor country are exceptionally  important to the purchaser country. And we are doing everything  to ensure that Russia's prestige in this area is not damaged.</p>

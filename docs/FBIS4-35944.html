			<p>BFN     [Text] Al-Shariqah, 5 Jun (MENA)--Dr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid  has called on the Arabs to extend their hands to the Yemeni  people and work on putting out the fire raging in Yemen. Al-Bid  asked the Gulf Cooperation Council countries to take a decisive  stand. He declared that the people in the south are expecting  their state to be recognized.    In an interview with AL-KHALIJ newspaper today in the city  of  al-Mukalla, where he is currently residing, he said: I was  expecting a decisive stand to be taken. The issue now is the  security of the Gulf region, the stability of the people, and  the interests of these two countries. Al-Bid affirmed that an  effective cease-fire must be the priority. He said that  continued fighting, which will go on for a long time, will not  stop when Yemen is split in two. He also confirmed that he is  ready to take up the issue of unity once again, build new  institutions, and take new action, with wisdom and sanity this  time round. Al-Bid said that unity is our right. It is not the  unity of the House of al-Ahmar, but the unity of Yemen and the  Yemeni people. We will continue our peaceful and democratic  struggle for this cause.    Al-Bid revealed that he has information regarding the  delivery of eight Iraqi aircraft the day before yesterday to  Sanaa via Tashkent. He believes the mediators are Iranian. He  said that there might be Iraqi support for Sanaa through Iran.  As for reports about Jordanian aid to Sanaa, al-Bid said: We  have information that Jordanian planes are flying to Sanaa  carrying ammunition and weapons. On the returns from the oil  resources in the south, al-Bid said that Exxon has frozen the  profits from sales and deposited them in a bank for both sides.  Production, however, continues and is increasing. It has now  reached over 150,000 barrels per day. Production in Hadhramaut  has reached 130,000 barrels per day. On the reasons for his  transfer from Aden to Hadhramaut, al-Bid said: I have come to  al-Mukalla for organizational purposes. The region has oil and  the people must know that someone is protecting it.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Walt Disney names new president of film unit Walt Disney's motion pictures group has named Mr Chris McGurk as president, effective immediately, writes our financial staff. The company said that Mr McGurk would be responsible for the group's business activities, as well as international theatrical distribution, film acquisitions, Miramax films, Hollywood Records, Disney Theatrical Productions and character voices and dubbing. Mr McGurk was previously vice president and chief financial officer of the studios. The company said the promotion was part of a restructuring of the filmed entertainment division. The studio's management has been in flux since Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg's bitter departure as studio chief in August. Mr Katzenberg played a pivotal part in Disney's success since the late 1980s, culminating in its latest international hit, the animated film The Lion King, which is poised to become one of the most successful films of all time. Earlier this week it was announced that Mr Katzenberg is to join Mr David Geffen, the billionaire music mogul, and Mr Steven Spielberg, the film director, in a new entertainment company.</p>

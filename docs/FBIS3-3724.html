They have worked out a detailed report and proposals based  on  their grass-roots investigations for the provincial government.    Since last year the provincial CPPCC members have given  their  suggestions and opinions to the Qinghai government on developing  socialist market forces, finding and exploiting natural  resources, promoting agriculture and animal husbandry, and  invigorating major state enterprises.    Based on a proposal by three provincial CPPCC members for  gold panning by peasants in poverty-stricken areas, the  provincial government announced a regulation on gold panning by  collectives.    By the end of last year this northwest province's CPPCC  committee had gathered 85 proposals from its members, 74 of  which have already been transfered to related departments.    The provincial CPPCC heads have taken the lead in  investigations of grass-roots units.    A provincial CPPCC group led by its committee chairman Han  Yingxuan made a study tour of the Haixi Autonomous Prefecture of  the Mongolian and Tibetan nationalities. The tour concentrated  on investigating the development of salt resources and ways to  raise the added value of local-made products.    The CPPCC members also play a role in attracting overseas  investment to the province, as some of them have relatives and  friends abroad.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH PENALTY DECREED FOR KILLER OF 4 WOMEN  </P> <P> An illiterate construction worker convicted of four murders, including two  "Southside Slayer" killings of prostitutes in South-Central Los Angeles, was  sentenced Tuesday to die in the gas chamber at San Quentin.  </P> <P> Louis Craine, 32, stared ahead in glum silence as Compton Superior Court Judge  Janice Claire Croft rejected a defense plea that would have allowed him to  serve life in prison without the possibility of parole.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bodies Discarded  </P> <P> Acting on the recommendation of a Superior Court jury that in May recommended  capital punishment, Croft said that Craine's "victims fought frantically for  their lives . . . and he manually strangled each of them to death and discarded  their bodies in abandoned houses, vacant lots and an alley like so much trash."  </P> <P> After the sentencing, defense attorney Morris B. Jones told reporters that he  would appeal based on Croft's last-minute removal of the sole juror who had  held out against the death penalty.  </P> <P> Juror Carol Martin was removed from the 12-member panel after several fellow  jurors reported to Croft at a court hearing that Martin was refusing to  deliberate, was acting "spaced out" and had drunk a liter of wine at a  restaurant during lunch.  </P> <P> Before the hearing, jurors had informed Croft that they were hopelessly  deadlocked, 11-1. After an alternate was appointed, the jury deliberated only  four more hours before returning with a unanimous recommendation in favor of  death.  </P> <P> Martin, who did not testify at the hearing, has since sent Jones and Deputy  Dist. Atty. John Watson a letter saying she was surprised that she was not  given a chance to defend herself. She added that although she had voted to  convict Craine, she was holding out against the death penalty because of her  sympathy with his difficult childhood.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Motion Dismissed  </P> <P> Croft dismissed a defense motion Tuesday for a new trial, saying that Martin  was removed because of evidence that "she wasn't deliberating." Jones countered  that "argumentativeness is part of the deliberating process -- we don't want  rubber stamps in here."  </P> <P> As for the drinking allegations, the defense attorney added, "I've seen judges  go to the the Sizzler (a restaurant next to the courthouse) and drink during  the noon hours. . . . Everyone has a different tolerance."  </P> <P> Watson, who prosecuted the case, praised Croft's sentencing.  </P> <P> "These were vicious, vicious murders (and) the defendant has never shown any  remorse at all," he said.  </P> <P> Watson said Craine may also have been involved in several other attacks  attributed to the so-called Southside Slayer. But he added that it is likely  that at least four or five different criminals were responsible for the string  of 18 murders.  </P> <P> Charges against another suspect in three of the Slayer killings, former Los  Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Rickey Ross, were dismissed last month after  weapons tests linking Ross to the slayings were proven wrong. Two other men  have also been arrested in connection with Southside Slayer killings.  </P> <P> Craine was found guilty of first-degree murder in the strangling deaths of  Loretta Perry, found dead in a vacant South Defiance Avenue house in January,  1987; Gail M. Ficklin, found in an alley near South Grande Street in August,  1985; Vivian Louise Collins, found in an abandoned house on East Century  Boulevard in 1986, and Carolyn Barney, found in a vacant lot in May, 1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sexual Assault  </P> <P> Craine, who was also convicted of three counts of sexual assault on the  victims, was acquitted of a fifth slaying, the November, 1984, stabbing and  strangulation of Sheila Rae Burris.  </P> <P> The defendant, who has a sixth-grade education and an IQ of 69, left home while  in his mid-teens and lived in downtown transient hotels and the caretaker's  room of a coin laundry, where he served as an attendant. For the five months  before his arrest, Craine, who has no previous felony convictions, had returned  to live at his parents' home.  </P> <P> The sentencing took place just one day after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that  murderers who suffer mental retardation may be put to death.  </P> <P> During Craine's trial, defense attorneys contended that his confession resulted  from his low intelligence, which gave him the tendency to "parrot" the  statements of others.  </P> <P> Watson countered that "in the legal sense, there is no question of him being  mentally competent." Craine, Watson said, was able to live on his own, hold  down jobs and bear up under lengthy cross-examination in court.  </P></p>

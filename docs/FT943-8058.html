			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Arts: 'Fidelio day' - As the Edinburgh Festival gets into its stride, our critics review mainstream opera, theatre and ballet Wednesday was declared 'Fidelio day' at the Edinburgh Festival. A programme of lectures and concerts illustrating Beethoven's long struggle to write the opera led in the evening to a performance of Fidelio in Scottish Opera's new production at the Festival Theatre. Attendance grew as the day went on. At least those who only turned up in the evening should have plenty to think about. The issues tackled by Beethoven are clear-cut and the best way of learning about the opera is simply to see it. This year I had already come across two very different productions. One created an unholy mess by trying to equate Fidelio as redeemer with Christ (he offered bread and wine to twelve prisoners, who sat at a long table). The other was an exciting thriller in which oppression and suffering were depicted with ferocious impact. The realism of the latter is not necessary to put across Beethoven's all-powerful message: that Right triumphs over Wrong. As in much of his previous work Tim Albery, Scottish Opera's producer, has turned to expressionism for his theatrical language. This is no gloomy Fidelio in shades of grey. The brightness and colour controls are turned up to maximum. Stewart Laing's striking sets, brilliantly lit by Peter Mumford, divide the stage into brightly-coloured compartments, each like a television screen playing a different scene. When the curtain goes up, they form the tiny, box-like living quarters of the prison staff. Albery is good at capturing the claustrophobic atmosphere of these scenes. In the famous quartet the characters face each other across the kitchen table, a potentially discordant ensemble of family tensions. Ai-Lan Zhu's brightly-sung Marzelline survives through hopes of marriage to the resentful, tattooed young Jaquino of Richard Coxon. Stafford Dean's firm bass Rocco looks prematurely aged by the drudgery of prison life. They make vivid minor characters in the larger scheme of things, but Albery himself is less at ease at this higher level. He sets Fidelio in the present-day, which is fair enough. (Who believes Beethoven's submission to the censors that the opera takes place in the 16th century?) But doubts arise when a panorama of a forest is unravelled to provide a backdrop to Leonore's aria and coloured lights pick out the singers in the Act 2 quartet  -Pizarro, red for vengeance; Leonore and Florestan, yellow for hope; and Rocco, lilac for . . . well, for what? These are fussy contrivances in a production which is strong and stylish with a good grip on the characters. The most fascinating is Matthew Best's frighteningly repressed Pizarro, outwardly a neatly-manicured civil servant, but being eaten away inside by worms of evil. Elizabeth Whitehouse manages to make Leonore convincing as a pasty-faced, adolescent boy. Her lyric soprano is more fluid than usual and the music benefits from the ease of her singing. Michael Pabst's Florestan was pinched, not always in tune. Carsten Stabell made a grave Don Fernando. By the time he arrives as deus ex machina, the performance had reached a high level of tension. The conductor Richard Armstrong likes his Beethoven red-blooded and led a strong and decisive performance, crowned by the Scottish Opera chorus on its best form. The open pit at the new Edinburgh Festival Theatre made the orchestra sound too loud, but that is a minor problem to sort out. For its first festival appearance in the new theatre the company has a success to its credit. Earlier in the day Charles Mackerras had given us a contrasting view of Beethoven: lean, lithe, rhythmically keen, finely played by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. This was a concert performance of Leonore, the first version of the opera from which Fidelio was eventually to emerge. There was some good singing, despite Janice Watson's overparted Leonore; Franz Hawlata was an imposing Rocco and Donald Maxwell a fierce Pizarro. Rebecca Evans and Paul Charles Clarke made a touching Marzelline and Jaquino. Nobody hearing the two versions of the opera could feel any regrets over the changes. Indeed, it is remarkable that the garrulous and awkwardly-written Leonore could be transformed into the dynamic Fidelio we know today.</p>

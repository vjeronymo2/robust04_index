			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Technology: Cesar in charge of the crew Every time an Air France flight is delayed or cancelled an amazing back-room operation swings into action. Using pen, paper, scissors, pins and glue a team of people works to redesign the airline's six-month flight crew rota - trying to make optimum use of cockpit and cabin staff while obeying the safety and other regulations and agreements. In an effort to improve efficiency and save money by using crews more effectively, Air France asked Cap Gemini Sogeti, the European computer consultancy group, to help build a system to handle the staff rota. The project was nicknamed Cesar. Using its Kads (knowledge acquisition and design support) software development tool, CGS's research and development unit, Cap Gemini Innovation, set out to build an expert system which would model the decision-making process. Three years later Cesar is almost ready to go into operation and will be handed over at the end of May. To meet the operational demands of the airline it has to guarantee short response times and 24-hour availability. When it is fully operational Cesar will do the work of 30 people and produce 'an optimised' updated rota within 10 minutes instead of the three hours it took to do manually. The system will run on a local area network comprising 20 Vax workstations and servers connected to an IBM 3090 mainframe. It will have cost Air France FFr40m (Pounds 4m) with about half of that being spent on hardware. Dominique Sylvestre, CGS project manager for Cesar, said Air France was expecting to recoup the cost within three years through savings made by using flight crews more efficiently. Air France is hoping to sell the system to other airlines or transport organisations such as railways. Cesar is one of a number of customer applications to emerge from CGS Innovation's FFr600m-a-year R&amp;D programme, which includes more than 30 EC research projects.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment asked if paragraph (a)(3) meant that if mill sites are listed on a small miner certification, this would constitute a filing of a notice of intention to hold. The answer is yes, and this is further clarified in &sect;3833.1&hyph;7(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment asked whether paragraph (b) required that a reclamation plan be approved before the claimant can file the certification statement, whether a closure date is required under the certification, and whether a statement will have to be filed every year until closure. The comment also pointed out that notice-level reclamation work does not need to be approved by the authorized officer. Another comment questioned the procedure to be followed on lands where the surface is not managed by BLM. Unless only notice-level activities are being conducted on the mining claim, a reclamation plan is required to be approved before a certification statement can be filed. This paragraph has been amended to add ``in consultation with'' the authorized officer to cover notice-level operators who describe such reclamation plans in their notice, but are not required to have them approved. Such reclamation plans, whether a part of notice- or plan-level operations, are always required to be on file prior to any August 31 deadline. No closure date is required as a part of the certification statement, and such statement will have to be filed every year until closure. This paragraph also has been amended to clarify the process for claims for which the surface is not managed by BLM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two comments urged removal of paragraph (b), with one comment inquiring as to its statutory authority, its legal effect, and the effect of failure to follow it. It further questioned whether this amounted to paying miners for doing what they were already obligated to do under the law. Another comment questioned this paragraph as well. Section 10106 of the 1993 Act directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations implementing the maintenance and location fee requirements. This authority is applied here to exempt from the maintenance fee claims being reclaimed after mining. A valid mining claim need not be maintained in order for reclamation work to proceed. There is little incentive for claimants to maintain claims in which the minerals have been exhausted. It is in the Department's interest to encourage claimants to retain a mining claim until reclamation is complete. Excusing a miner from the maintenance fee during reclamation does not in any way release the miner from the obligation to reclaim, which remains as before. Release of the bond serves as incentive for reclamation. If the claimant is found to have filed a false certification, then appropriate action, including penalties under 18 U.S.C 1001, may be instituted. Any failure to reclaim will be dealt with under applicable regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d) has been amended to make it clear that an agency other than the National Park Service may deny access to a claimant's mining claim. All such denials may be grounds for a waiver under this paragraph. A new subordinate paragraph (3) has been added for the purpose of clarity to provide that the certification filed under paragraph (d) may serve as notice of intention to hold under Section 314 of FLPMA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two comments stated that paragraph (e), dealing with deferments, is inconsistent with the maintenance fee statute, which requires payment of the fee at specified times. One comment also stated that the fee cannot be deferred if, as in the case of the non-small miner, no assessment work is required. The language in this paragraph is similar to language in the rental fee regulations. The plain language of the Act of August 10, 1993, states that the fee is to be paid in lieu of the assessment work when it is required. When the assessment work is deferred, the maintenance fee may also be deferred. When a deferment ends, for the period in which the assessment work requirement was replaced by the maintenance fee, the deferred maintenance fee must then be paid. One comment referred to this section as providing for granting a waiver, but this is not correct. It provides for a deferment of fees that will have to be paid at the termination of the deferment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two comments stated that paragraph (e) conflicts with the Interior Board of Land Appeals decision  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Clay Worst <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 128 IBLA 165. This decision found that only those claimants with 10 or fewer claims can obtain a deferment of assessment work. That decision was based on the previous rule, implementing the rental fee requirements, which is being replaced by this rule. It was not the intent of the Department to limit deferments to small miners in the last rule and it is not the intent in this rule. Deferments under this paragraph may be obtained for any number of claims. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Worst <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision, which is based on the old regulation, does not affect this final rule because this rule implements a new statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment stated that paragraph (e)(1)(ii), redesignated (e)(2) in the final rule, departed from current policy. This paragraph is basically the same as the paragraph that applied to deferments in the rental fee regulations. It has never been the policy of BLM for claims to be automatically forfeited if a deferment is denied and the August 31 deadline has passed. In the current regulations, as well as under this rule, a 30-day period from the receipt of a deferment petition denial is allowed before payment of the fee is due. Spurious filings merely to delay payment of the fee have not been and should not be a problem, because fee payment is only potentially delayed, but not excused, in the case of a deferment denial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding paragraph (f), one comment asked whether claims or sites under a mineral patent application for which mineral entry has not been allowed will be forfeited if no maintenance fee payment or waiver certification is received. The answer is yes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMENIAN GENOCIDE  </P> <P> Daniels certainly zeroed in on the major problems passage of resolution would  cause for U.S.-Turkish relations.  </P> <P> Far from redressing an alleged human rights violation 75 years ago, it would  fan ethnic hatreds as both Turks and Armenians recall the civil warfare.  </P> <P> If this resolution is what our senators find in the best interests of the U.S.  and for human rights, they are either hopelessly naive and ill-informed or  completely caught up in double standards in which the Turkish dead are to be  condemned and the Armenian dead are to be commemorated. You performed a service  in printing this article for the public to see how the Senate spends its time.  </P> <P> CENGIZ SARIK  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

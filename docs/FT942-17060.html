			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Blunkett attacks spending policy Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, yesterday called for more spending on public services, in a speech at odds with his party leadership's view that shadow cabinet members should avoid making expenditure commitments. He told public-sector trade unionists in Blackpool that the Labour party offered 'care before accountancy', and problems could not be solved by 'taking them out of public spending'. The 'stupid belief' that privatisation and de-regulation were the only way to deal with difficult issues had to be set aside once and for all. Mr Blunkett accused the government of creating an 'off-balance-sheet' approach in an attempt to offload forthcoming dilemmas on to the backs of individuals. Labour's 'critical task' was to restore commitment and confidence to public services and investment in them. He said provision of more money for improving patient care could be partly financed by avoiding the bureaucratic and costly administration which had become endemic in the health service as a result of the government's market-oriented changes.</p>

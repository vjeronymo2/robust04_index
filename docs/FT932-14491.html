			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Labour hopes to force retreat on Maastricht LABOUR WILL today launch a fresh attempt at forcing ministers to back down over Maastricht's social chapter, hoping to dent government optimism that the bill's committee stage will end soon and without more concessions. Mr George Robertson, Labour's Europe spokesman, will meet Mr Michael Morris, deputy speaker, to urge him to rethink the amendments on the social chapter selected for debate. But Labour is now looking more to the bill's 'report stage' - likely to follow soon after the committee stage - as offering the best chance of forcing a further government retreat. Last week ministers agreed to support a Commons debate on the social chapter before formal ratification but after the bill completes its Commons stage, expected after the Danish referendum on May 18. Labour and Tory Euro-rebel MPs agreed yesterday that the committee stage was likely to end next week, or possibly even this week if the government won votes allowing all-night sittings. MPs are likely to vote on clause one of the three-clause bill today. Labour will abstain, allowing the bill to proceed but provoking Liberal Democrat and government accusations that they are anti-European. Mr Robertson said: 'We couldn't vote for clause one because there is still a social chapter opt-out.' Votes on new clauses to the bill, including on a referendum, could follow on Wednesday or Thursday and perhaps one day next week. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, is pledged to vote against a referendum and the rebels in his party or among Conservatives are unlikely to force a government defeat. One Foreign Office insider said: 'By the week and by the day, the general confidence of the government is underpinned and reinforced.' Labour wants the reinstatement of its amendment 27 for debate which it believes would have the effect of forcing the social chapter on the government and, in spite of ministers' denials, is seen by some Tory Euro-sceptics as a possible wrecking amendment. Mr Robertson is also urging the reinstatement of new clause 74, which would impose tougher conditions on the debate on the social chapter than the government conceded last week. Mr Morris decided against selecting amendment 27 last week but Labour hopes Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker who will preside over the report stage, will be more sympathetic.</p>

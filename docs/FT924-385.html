			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Motoring: Adieu to glorious relic of a vanished France - Production of the Renault 4 is ending. Stuart Marshall mourns the passing of an old friend IT IS WHAT the French mean by fin de siecle. Citroen knocked the 2CV deux chevaux on the head a couple of years ago. Now, it is the Renault 4's turn to enter motoring history. The France for which they were created, and in which they multiplied, has almost gone, too. It was a country that seemed to be populated by peasant farmers needing cheap, utilitarian cars that would not break when overloaded cruelly and driven hard on dreadful roads. A France, in fact, with an ambience which used to be termed 'the three Gs' - garlic, Gauloises (or Gitanes) and the gents. On driving off the ferry, they were all present. Happily, the aroma of garlic still perfumes the kind of restaurants I patronise, but the pungent pong of caporal tobacco has gone. And a revolution in plumbing technology has been sanitising and deodorising the traditional gamey, gurgling French loo. Even modest hotels now have gleaming bathrooms with fittings so high-tech that a degree in physics is helpful in making the shower work. And what about the bidet? When the deux chevaux and quatr'elle (shorthand for Renault 4, because it was first known as the 4L) were created, even the cheapest French hotel room had a bidet. Many British visitors wondered what they were used for. One innocently asked a French woman if it was for washing the baby in. 'Mais non]' she replied. 'It is for washing the baby out]' Now the bidet, too, is disappearing from hotels. Changing attitudes to contraception - and cost-cutting accountants - are to blame. But back to the Renault 4. We had two of them in the 1960s and early '70s. They were ungainly and tinny, extraordinarily comfortable, and cost next to nothing to run. In nine years, neither ever failed at the roadside, although I had to drive one home clutchless after the cable broke. They crossed fields, forded streams, took us to France on holidays and carried absurd cargoes - like the chesterfield sofa we brought home from an auction. It squeezed through the 4's immense tailgate opening but overhung the load floor, making the car look like a pike trying to swallow a carp of twice its weight. To appreciate fully the 4's carrying capacity, just try putting a sofa in a trendy modern estate car. Our first one was an early import, with a three-speed gearbox and six-volt electrics. It cost me about Pounds 500 new in 1964. We parked it at Heathrow for a fortnight one bitter winter. When we got back, the rubber door seals had frozen to the body, but I managed to get in by forcing the tailgate open. It started instantly. As we drove off, grander people on the same flight were calling for jump leads to start frost bound Granadas and Jaguars. Renault 4s rolled on corners like flat-bottomed boats in a beam sea, but they got round somehow and never fell over. Hurrying to catch a boat in my second R4, I saw the needle of the semi-circular speedometer disappear from sight at a clamorous 75 mph (120 kmh) - I was, of course, going downhill. At 80 mph (130 kmh), the effect was remarkable. It was as if I had entered the eye of a typhoon. All the noise just stopped and I still don't know where it went. The push-pull gear lever jutting from the fascia frightened off many potential British buyers but was simplicity itself to use. And it allowed the driver to slide across easily to step straight out on the footpath. The seats were the kind one sank into, softly. There was enough head-room to drive wearing a bowler hat. Friends bought Renault 4s on my recommendation. A Sussex farmer replaced his aged Land Rover with one. He filled it with sheep and straw, horse nuts and bits of broken-down machinery and reckoned it was the best car he ever had. It looked like a mobile midden and died ignobly when a drunken employee smashed it into a stone barn. The farmer, of course, bought another. The Renault 4 still lives on in one or two Francophone third world countries, but failure to meet crash safety and emission laws sealed its fate in Europe. What will replace it? Years ago, Renault thought it would be succeeded by the slightly bigger but basically similar R6, just as Citroen thought its Dyane would take over from the deux chevaux. Both R4 and 2CV outlived the upstarts. Perhaps the Renault Twingo, sensation of the recent Paris motor show, will take up the banner of cheap and practical motoring carried by the Renault 4 for 30 years. The Twingo, a brilliantly original one-box baby car, has a hint of the Renault Espace's shape. It goes on sale in France next March. At first, Renault said the Twingo would never be made with right-hand drive; but so rapturous was its reception that top management is, by all accounts, having second thoughts. Thousands of Britons will not forgive Renault if they do not get the chance to buy the cleverest small car to appear in years. I hope someone is listening over there in Paris.</p>

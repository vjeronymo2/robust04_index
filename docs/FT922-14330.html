			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Big-name losers highlighted THE Scottish National party is set to capture three seats from the Conservatives, including the prize scalp of Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, according to the Press Association's poll of 10,000 potential voters, results of which were announced last night. A uniform 10.5 per cent swing to Labour in the West Midlands, as the poll suggests, would leave Birmingham with only one Tory MP - Dame Jill Knight in Edgbaston - with Labour taking Hall Green, Northfield and Selly Oak. It would also enable Labour to gain Wolverhampton South-West, held by the Conservatives for more than 40 years and which Mr Enoch Powell represented from 1950 to February 1974. Mr Francis Maude, financial secretary to the Treasury, would be a ministerial casualty in Warwickshire North. Two other ministers, Mr John Maples, economic secretary to the Treasury, and Mr Colin Moynihan, junior energy minister, face defeat in Lewisham West and Lewisham East if a uniform swing to Labour in London of 7 per cent, as suggested in the poll, happens. The Conservatives would also lose Hampstead and Highgate to Labour's Ms Glenda Jackson, and Hayes and Harlington which, until the emergence of the Social Democratic party in 1981, Labour had held continuously from 1945. A uniform swing of 9 per cent in the south-east would see the Tories lose the two Southampton seats, one of which is held by Mr Christopher Chope, the roads minister. ICM polled 10,460 adults in 330 constituencies between March 31 and April 3. Figures show the change against 1987 election results, excluding by-elections. The percentage share of the vote in the regional breakdown may not add up to 100 because of rounding.  ------------------------------------------------------ REGIONAL VOTING INTENTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------ North  ----           Seats    Gain    Loss    % of vote    +/-  ------------------------------------------------------ Con           4       -       4        29        -3 Lab          31       4       -        54        +8 Lib           1       -       -        16        -5  ------------------------------------------------------ North-West  ---------           Seats    Gain    Loss    % of vote    +/-  ------------------------------------------------------ Con          19       -      15        33        -5 Lab          51      15       -        50        +9 Lib           3       -       -        15        -5  ------------------------------------------------------ West Midlands  ------------           Seats    Gain    Loss    % of vote    +/-  ------------------------------------------------------ Con          23       -      13        36       -10 Lab          35      13       -        44       +11 Lib           0       -       -        19        -2  ------------------------------------------------------ Wales  ----           Seats    Gain    Loss    % of vote    +/-  ------------------------------------------------------ Con           4       -       4        24        -5 Lab          28       4       -        56       +11 Lib           3       -       -        11        -7 Nat           3       -       -         7         0  ------------------------------------------------------ South West  ---------           Seats    Gain    Loss    % of vote    +/-  ------------------------------------------------------ Con          41       -       3        44        -6 Lab           4       3       -        21        +5 Lib           3       -       -        33         0  ------------------------------------------------------ Scotland  -------           Seats    Gain    Loss    % of vote    +/-  ------------------------------------------------------ Con           7       -       3        21        -3 Lab          50       -       -        40        -2 Lib           9       -       -        12        -7 Nat           6       3       -        25       +11  ------------------------------------------------------ Yorkshire and Humberside  -----------------------           Seats    Gain    Loss    % of vote    +/-  ------------------------------------------------------ Con          16       -       5        28        -9 Lab          38       5       -        53       +13 Lib           0       -       -        18        -4  ------------------------------------------------------ East Midlands  ------------           Seats    Gain    Loss    % of vote    +/-  ------------------------------------------------------ Con          23       -       8        41        -8 Lab          19       8       -        38        +8 Lib           0       -       -        20        -1  ------------------------------------------------------ East Anglia  ----------           Seats    Gain    Loss    % of vote    +/-  ------------------------------------------------------ Con          18       -       1        47        -5 Lab           2       1       -        30        +8 Lib           0       -       -        20        -6  ------------------------------------------------------ Greater London  -------------           Seats    Gain    Loss    % of vote    +/-  ------------------------------------------------------ Con          43       -      14        39        -7 Lab          37      14       -        39        +7 Lib           3       -       -        20        -1  ------------------------------------------------------ South East  ---------           Seats    Gain    Loss    % of vote    +/-  ------------------------------------------------------ Con          98       -       9        45       -11 Lab          10       9       -        23        +6 Lib           0       -       -        28        +1  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

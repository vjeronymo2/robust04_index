			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 28 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. Government is  expected to postpone the announcement of sequence measures  agreed with North Korea that was slated for March 1, timed with  the commencement of the long-delayed nuclear inspections, after  resumption of inter-Korean dialogue was rescheduled for Thursday  [3 March].    Washington and Pyongyang were to announce the agreements  reached in New York last Thursday simultaneously on Tuesday.    Their agreements required North Korea to resume dialogue  with  South Korea and fully implement International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) inspections of its nuclear facilities in order to  realize the third round of bilateral high-level talks.    Seoul proposed Pyongyang to meet on Tuesday and planned to  announce the suspension of this year's South Korea-U.S.  military exercise "Team Spirit", but cancelled the announcement  until Thursday, a date the communist regime later proposed for  inter-Korean dialogue.    The U.S. Government was to announce the Seoul government's  decision to put off the 1994 Team Spirit drill and reopening of  third round of talks with North Korea in Geneva on March 21 on  Tuesday when the IAEA inspection team arrives in Pyongyang and  inter-Korean working-level contact takes place, a senior  diplomatic source in Washington said Monday. But North Korea  broke its promise made in the New York meeting and did not  response to Seoul's proposal of talks, the source said.    If South Korea postpones the announcement to suspend this  year's Team Spirit, the United States is expected to follow suit  and cancel announcement of sequence measures until Thursday, he  said.    Washington reportedly will closely discuss Pyongyang's delay  of inter-Korean dialogue with Seoul on Tuesday. But as State  Secretary Warren Christopher is due to present himself to the  Congress hearing on Tuesday, he may well announce the agreements  reached with Pyongyang in last week's meeting and explain the  U.S. position.</p>

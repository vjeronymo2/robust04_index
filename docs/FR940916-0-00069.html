			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The FAA's criteria for a small aircraft manufacturer is one employing fewer than 75 employees. A substantial number is a number that is not fewer than 11 and is more than one-third of the small entities subject to the rule. A significant impact is one having an annual cost of more than $14,900 (1987 dollars) per manufacturer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A review of domestic helicopter manufacturing companies indicates that there are fewer than eleven small helicopter manufacturers. Therefore, the amendments to Parts 27 and 29 will not affect a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Trade Impact Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rule changes will have little or no impact on trade for both U.S. firms doing business in foreign countries and foreign firms doing business in the United States. In the U.S. market, foreign manufacturers will have the option of designing engines and helicopters capable of satisfying the new OEI ratings and, therefore, will not be at a competitive disadvantage with U.S. manufacturers. Because of the large U.S. market, foreign manufacturers are likely to certificate their rotorcraft to U.S. rules, which will limit any competitive advantage U.S. manufacturers might gain in foreign markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism Implications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that these amendments do not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. These amendments are considered nonsignificant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 CFR 11034; February 26, 1979). A regulatory evaluation of the amendments, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in the docket.

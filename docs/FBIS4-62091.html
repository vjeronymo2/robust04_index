			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Russian Federation Finance Ministry Appeal to Russian </F> Federation Citizens: Beware of Speculators"]    [Text] A critical situation has currently formed in the  securities market, whereby dishonest entrepreneurs are  exploiting the population's lack of experience in matters of  acquiring securities and the imperfect nature of legislation and  are, to their own selfish ends, getting rich for no good reason  on other people's money and undermining the population's trust  in honest participants in the securities market. With the aim  of protecting the interests of investors and ensuring the normal  functioning of the securities market, the Russian Federation  Finance Ministry proposes that all interested citizens should  follow the following recommendations in buying and selling  securities:    1. First of all, gather as much information as possible  about who is issuing the securities you intend to buy (that is,  the issuer).    If they are being issued by a bank or a credit institution,  then find out how long it has been functioning, what its  authorized capital is, and what types of banking operations it  has a license for.    2. Make sure that the securities are state-registered, and  study carefully the prospectus for the issue of securities  registered by the financial organs.    3. Never trust advertisements. You can only make a decision  to invest your money in securities on the basis of a  comprehensive analysis of the securities issue prospectus, the  accounts and the nature of the activity of the issuer, and the  general situation in the market where the issuer in question is  working.    4. When concluding security deals, only use the services of  professional participants in the securities market (investment  institutions which have the appropriate licenses).    5. Make sure that the seller is the owner of the securities  or an employee of an owner of the securities. If the seller of  securities is operating on the instructions of the owner of the  securities (on the basis of a commission contract or a contract  of agency), then he should be an employee of an investment  institution and have a first-category certificate of  qualification (that is, you must demand a photocopy of the  license granting the right to conduct activity as an investment  institution and a photocopy of the first-category qualification  certificate).    6. It is recommended that deals concerning the purchase and  sale of securities are drawn up in the form of a written  contract in which the following must be determined: the  procedure for transactions on the deal, the procedure for  entering a new owner in the shareholders' register, the  procedure for paying taxes on transactions involving securities,  and so on.    7. Register the deal at an investment institution, bank, or  with the issuer from whom you are buying the securities.    8. As practice shows, the investment of funds in bills of  exchange and granting loans by concluding loan contracts are the  most risky at present. You do not need any state registration,  nor do you need special permission (licenses) in order to issue  bills of exchange and conclude loan contracts, and that is  precisely why these financial instruments are most often used by  dishonest entrepreneurs with the aim of deceiving the  population. At the same time, as a rule neither the issuer of  the bill of exchange nor the borrower reveals any information  about his financial position or type of activity in the loan  contract. Remember that, when you conclude a loan contract, you  are entering into a civil-legal relationship with the borrower  and, in the event of a conflict, you can only defend your  interests via a court. The specific nature of a bill of  exchange is such that the absence of even one obligatory element  makes it invalid. If you are not familiar with the rules of  composing bills of exchange, the circulation of bills, and civil  legislation, do not invest money in these financial instruments,  regardless of the high interest rates you may be promised.    If you do decide to buy bills of exchange, then you should  know that the most reliable are the bills of exchange of major  banks and banking syndicates.    9. Remember that investing money in non-state securities  practically always involves risk. The fact that the securities  you are buying have passed through state registration is no  guarantee that the funds you have invested will be returned, or  of the reliability and profitability of these securities. The  basic axiom for investment activity in the securities market  states that, the higher the profitability of the security, the  greater the risk of investing in such a security.    10. Do not give in to general trends of investing your money  at an interest rate which exceeds the average market interest  rate many times over.    Remember that the founders of joint stock companies are  answerable to other shareholders only within the limits of  personal contributions to the authorized capital. Investments  in joint stock companies with a small authorized capital and a  declared issue exceeding the authorized capital thousands and  millions of times over are extremely risky.</p>

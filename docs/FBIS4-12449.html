			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry issued today a statement in  which it said Tunisia is following with great concern the grave  development in the situation in Bosnia due to the savage and  escalating acts aiming at the unarmed civilian children of this  country.    Tunisia, which had always stood by the causes of right,  liberation, and justice, strongly condemns the policy of ethnic  cleansing that blatantly contradict not only the right of the  peoples to self-determination but also the most basic of human  values and the most sacred of human rights -- namely the right  to life.    Tunisia, which had blessed the accord concluded in  Washington  between the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims, demands an immediate  end to this campaign and addresses an urgent appeal to the  international community, particularly to the Security Council,  to carry out a speedy and decisive action to halt this  aggression against the innocents and to provide the  circumstances that ensure security and peace in the region.</p>

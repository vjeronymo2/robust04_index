			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / US sends gunships to Somalia THE US is sending AC-130 attack aircraft to Somalia where they could be used to retaliate for the killing of 23 UN peacekeepers, Clinton administration officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. 'They are going,' said one official who was asked if Washington was sending the AC-130 'Spectre' gunships, heavily armed and computer-laden versions of the US Air Force's lumbering four-engine C-130 military transports. They said Washington was also considering UN requests to send tanks and other weapons after an apparent ambush on Saturday, believed sprung by forces of Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed, that killed 23 Pakistani peacekeepers. The AC-130s carry a 105 mm gun as well as 20 mm and 7.6 mm rapid-fire machine guns. Their radar and computers are meant to help them destroy targets with pinpoint accuracy. Twenty Somalis were also killed in the ambush.</p>

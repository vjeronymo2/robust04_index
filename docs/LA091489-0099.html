			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLOW OF GERMAN EMIGRES SLOWS TO TRICKLE  </P> <P> The number of East German refugees entering West Germany dropped markedly  Wednesday, but the diplomatic argument between East Germany and Hungary  remained heated.  </P> <P> In Passau, the main gateway to West Germany in Bavaria, frontier officials said  that the flow of refugees has slackened and that most of those who had crossed  the border since midnight Sunday had moved out for more permanent lodgings  elsewhere in West Germany.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 15,000 Expected  </P> <P> The total number of East German refugees reaching West Germany through Hungary  and Austria is still expected to reach about 15,000 by the end of the week,  Bavarian officials said.  </P> <P> "The situation has quieted down considerably," declared West German Interior  Ministry official Detlef Flotho. "Individual travelers are arriving steadily  but no longer in the mass proportions of Monday and early Tuesday."  </P> <P> In Poland, about 50 East Germans were reported to have occupied the West German  Embassy in Warsaw in an effort to join their estimated 12,000 compatriots who  have successfully fled to the West through Hungary in the last several days.  </P> <P> And in Prague, Czechoslovakia, about 180 East Germans remained in the West  German Embassy -- also hoping to join the exodus of refugees that has created a  crisis among East Germany, West Germany and Hungary.  </P> <P> West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl turned the refugee crisis to his political  advantage Wednesday by urging the annual conference of the Christian Democratic  party in Bremen to fight next year's national election with the kind of drive  displayed by the incoming East Germans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Energy and Optimism'  </P> <P> Kohl urged the 750 delegates to emulate the refugees in the election campaign  and show the same "energy and optimism."  </P> <P> In East Berlin, a commentary in the official Communist newspaper, Neues  Deutschland, accused West Germany of "interventionist, aggressive acts against  East Germany."  </P> <P> On the other hand, some East German comments seemed purposely toned down.  </P> <P> The Communist youth daily, Junge Welt, ran a statement that said East Germany  should openly discuss why so many people are leaving the country "for  questionable happiness in the West."  </P> <P> Other commentators in East Berlin, however, continued to criticize Hungary for  breaking the 1969 pact with East Germany that forbids each country to allow the  other's citizens to go to the West.  </P> <P> East Germany, one of the hard-line countries in the Communist Bloc, has  resisted the economic and political reforms called for by Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> In contrast, Hungary has instituted liberal economic measures to improve living  conditions and has increasingly sought financial aid from the democratic states  of Western Europe -- particularly the Bonn government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hands-Off Policy  </P> <P> The Soviet Union has maintained a hands-off policy in the current verbal battle  between Hungary and East Germany, analysts say, adding to the anger and  frustration of the regime in East Berlin.  </P> <P> And the confusion in East Germany has been compounded by the fact that its  leader, Erich Honecker, 77, is seriously ill, reportedly recovering from a gall  bladder operation.  </P> <P> He has not been heard from directly since the exodus of East Germans through  Hungary and Austria to West Germany began over the weekend.  </P></p>

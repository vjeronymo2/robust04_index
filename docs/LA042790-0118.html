			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: TOLEDO TEAM COUNTS ON MAYS, RHODES FOR ITS STRETCH DRIVES  </P> <P> The University of Toledo's baseball team travels by Shortway Bus Lines, and the  driver is Willie Mays -- no relation to the Hall of Famer.  </P> <P> But Mays was not available last weekend, so they called in a replacement named  Dusty Rhodes -- no relation to the famed pinch-hitter.  </P> <P> In the 1954 World Series, Mays made a memorable over-the-shoulder catch and  Rhodes delivered the key pinch-hits as the New York Giants beat the Cleveland  Indians in four games.  </P> <P> Toledo baseball Coach Stan Sanders said, "It's a great baseball coincidence."  </P> <P> That it is. But if they get another driver and tell us his name is Sal Maglie,  well . . .  </P> <P> Add Rhodes: After the '54 Series, he said: "They shoulda thrown me changeups. I  couldn't hit a changeup, even if some Eskimo was pitching."  </P> <P> More Rhodes: Of his fielding, Leo Durocher said: "Any time you see a fielder  get under a ball and pound his glove -- even in Little League -- you know he's  going to catch it. I have seen Rhodes pound his glove and have the ball fall 20  feet behind him."  </P> <P> Trivia time: What is the first name of Dusty Rhodes?  </P> <P> Reaching out: From Hal Bodley of USA Today: "Those Bo Jackson telephone  commercials come in handy.  </P> <P> "Sunday night, the Royals' charter to Baltimore was delayed on the ground in  Toronto, causing Kansas City newspaper reporters anguish. Deadlines were  approaching; they had planned to file stories after arriving in Baltimore.  </P> <P> "Fear not. Bo reached into his bag of tricks and produced a cellular phone, and  the reporters called their newspapers."  </P> <P> Sour relations: From the Pittsburgh Press: "Fifty years ago: Chicago Cubs owner  Phil Wrigley said he would 'get rid of' Dizzy Dean 'if his eccentricities  contaminate my ballclub.' Dean was in hot water with Wrigley for calling  Manager Gabby Hartnett 'a picklepuss.' "  </P> <P> Slick southpaw: The nickname for left-hander Rafael Valdez of San Diego is  Exxon.  </P> <P> Double trouble: When the Oakland Athletics played their double-A farm club in  Huntsville, Ala., Monday night, Jose Canseco was three for three, with two  doubles, before sitting down. His twin brother, Ozzie, hit a homer as  Huntsville won, 6-4.  </P> <P> When Ozzie homered, Jose rushed out of the Oakland dugout and gave him a  forearm bash.  </P> <P> Bunny-hoppers: On the early line, the ones to catch in the Jack in the Box  women's mile May 20 at UCLA are Buffy Rabbitt of UC Irvine and Anne Hare of New  Zealand.  </P> <P> Word of warning: From Sid Wing, captain of the USC old-timers who will face  UCLA in a legends relay Saturday at the Coliseum: "Tell the Bruins that if they  win, they're going to be tested for steroids."  </P> <P> Still agitating: In the wake of the rumble in Detroit, called "Malice at the  Palace," Philadelphia's Charles Barkley said, "If we play the Pistons again in  the playoffs, they'll need the three-knockdown rule."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: James.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls, on the playoffs: "We expect to  go all the way."

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Japanese car sales fall 14% THE continued weakness of Japanese consumer spending was heavily underlined yesterday by a 14 per cent fall in new car sales last month compared with October last year. The resulting financial pressures which the continued fall in sales is exerting on Japanese car manufacturers will be reflected in their deteriorating financial results, which are due to be announced within the next three weeks. Nissan Motor announced yesterday that in the six months to September it had made its first pre-tax loss since the second world war. Large luxury cars were particularly hard hit, with a 21.9 per cent fall to 47,573 units compared with October 1991. Sales of smaller cars fell by 15.6 per cent to 233,292 units. The smallest decline was in sales of small trucks, which fell by 5 per cent to 128,960 units, while large truck sales fell by about 20 per cent to 10,618 vehicles. The growth of new car sales reached a peak of 30 per cent a year in October 1989. Over the next year the growth of new car sales fell to zero and since then have been contracting. However, the decline in sales has not affected car manufacturers equally. Honda, Toyota and Mitsubishi all managed to contain the damage, while Nissan and Mazda each suffered falls of more than 20 per cent. Toyota's sales fell to 183,296 in October, down 9.6 per cent from the year before. Honda sales fell by 9.8 per cent to 35,003, while Mitsubishi's sales were 3.3 per cent lower at 36,241. In contrast Nissan's sales fell by 23 per cent to 84,618 and Mazda's sales were 22 per cent down at 34,380. Sales of imported cars also declined 3.4 per cent to a total of 14,509 vehicles. Japan's small businesses are being badly hit by the economic downturn, with profitability at a 17-year low, according to a survey published yesterday by the Japan Finance Corporation, a government agency which provides small companies with low-interest loans, writes Charles Leadbeater. The survey suggests that small businesses, which are the bedrock of employment in Japan despite the power of its large manufacturing groups, may be suffering the first signs of the kind of squeeze which has hit small US businesses over the past few years. Japanese small companies, which are heavily dependent on bank lending for their finance, may be particularly hit by a more cautious approach to lending by the banks as they attempt to deal with their mounting bad loans.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GENE KLEIN GETTING OUT OF RACING;  </P> <P> WINNING COLORS WILL BE AMONG HORSES GOING ON BLOCK  </P> <P> Gene Klein, a three-time winner of the Eclipse Award as America's leading owner  of thoroughbreds, announced Friday that he is pulling the plug on his  multimillion-dollar racing stable after six years of meteoric success.  </P> <P> Klein, who formerly owned the San Diego Chargers, has decided to sell his  nearly 150 race horses, broodmares, yearlings and weanlings at a public auction  Nov. 6 in Lexington, Ky.  </P> <P> Among those going on the block will be Winning Colors, 1988 Kentucky Derby  winner; Lady's Secret, 1986 horse of the year, and current stable stars Open  Mind and On the Line.  </P> <P> Winning Colors, who has not won since her Derby victory, is recuperating from a  throat operation, and Lady's Secret, who already has been auctioned twice  without selling, recently gave birth to a filly by Alydar.  </P> <P> Klein's bombshell triggered speculation as to the impact it will have on Wayne  Lukas, the country's top money-winning trainer. Lukas has guided Klein's racing  dynasty since the two men met in 1982.  </P> <P> Lukas has been cultivating other major clients during the last three years,  among them Peter Brant, William T. Young and Daniel Wildenstein.  </P> <P> Lukas was en route from Oklahoma to Los Angeles Friday and could not be reached  for comment. However, the fact remains that Klein's horses provided more than  $23 million to the $64.7 million won by horses in the Lukas stable between 1984  and 1988. In 1988 alone, Klein's horses won $5,632,639, nearly a third of  Lukas' horses' $17,502,110 total.  </P> <P> Klein said that he is getting out of racing because he no longer wants to  commit the energy and attention required to maintain his unprecedented success.  </P> <P> "I'd been thinking about cutting back on my horses for a long time," he said.  "I thought at first that I could scale back, not be quite so involved.  </P> <P> "But that's not my style. I found out I couldn't lighten my load and still be  competitive in the sport the way I wanted to be."  </P> <P> Not many owners have been able to compete with the Klein juggernaut, which has  been fueled mainly by high-priced purchases of well-bred yearlings.  </P> <P> Klein and his wife, Joyce, won their first race on Jan. 30, 1983, with a filly  named Cassie's Prospect. Over the next six seasons their horses won 11  championships, seven Breeders' Cup races, a Kentucky Derby, a Preakness and a  horse-of-the-year title while flying Klein's blue and gold silks with the  lightning bolt logo borrowed from the Chargers.  </P> <P> Klein said that the 1989 Breeders' Cup Nov. 4 at Gulfstream Park in Florida --  two days before his dispersal sale -- would be his swan song. At least for now,  that is.  </P> <P> "I want to do it like Joe DiMaggio," Klein said. "I hope we can go out on top."  </P> <P> Klein, however, did not dismiss the possibility that he might reenter the sport  later with a lower profile. In the meantime he will continue to lease Lukas the  140-acre training center adjacent to his Del Rayo Farm near Klein's home in  Rancho Santa Fe.  </P> <P> "Wayne and I will always be fast friends," Klein said. "I'm not worried about  him at all. He's always turning people down who want to give him horses, so I'm  sure they'll be lining up to fill my spot."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Bill Christine contributed to this story.  </P></p>

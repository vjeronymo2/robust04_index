			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / IRA kills seven civilians in Ulster bomb attack A MASSIVE IRA bomb killed seven men last night as they returned from work on an Ulster security force base in Co Tyrone. Seven others were hurt, one critically, when the 1,500lb-bomb ripped apart their transit van on the main Omagh to Cookstown road. They were at a place known locally as Teebane crossroads, a few miles from the Republican village of Carrickmore. It was the highest civilian death toll in the province since the IRA Poppy Day massacre at Enniskillen in 1987. The bombing followed warnings by the IRA that terrorist activity is set to increase, both in Ulster and on the UK mainland. In particular, the IRA said two weeks ago that it intended to step up its military activities in Ulster in 1992. It hopes to prevent effective political talks on the future of the province between the UK and Irish governments and between political parties in Northern Ireland. The failure so far by Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland Secretary, to stimulate cross-party dialogue ahead of the UK general election has enabled the terrorists to thrive in a political vacuum. Unionist politicians, outraged by the atrocity, called for an all-out military offensive against the terrorists. As tension rose in the province last night, there were fears that Loyalist paramilitary organisations would mount retaliatory attacks on Republicans. The Rev William McCrea, Democratic Unionist MP for mid-Ulster, said he had no doubt that the bombing was a carefully planned IRA operation. He said that the security forces should be given the scope to combat the IRA free from political interference. It emerged last night that the dead men had been carrying out work at the Lisanelly army base in Omagh. The IRA has carried out attacks on workers supplying or working with the security forces since 1985. Executives have been murdered, several firms have been forced out of business, while others have publicly withdrawn from security force contracts. The bombing will have far-reaching political implications. It is certain to re-open the debate about reintroducing internment, or detention without trial, of terrorist suspects. Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist security spokesman and a former major in the Ulster Defence Regiment, said internment should be brought back immediately. Senior army commanders are understood to favour the move as one of the most effective methods of disrupting the IRA's command structure. Ulster talks, Page 4</p>

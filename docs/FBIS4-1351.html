			<p>BFN     [Text] Two NPFL-[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]  nominated officials, Information Minister Joe Mulbah and  Agriculture Minister Dr. Roland Massaquoi, have appeared before  the Transitional Legislative Assembly [TLA] at the Capitol  Building in Monrovia for confirmation hearing.    The appearance of the two ministers is in line with the  position of the leadership of the NPFL to have all of its  nominated officials formally seated on the LNTG [Liberian  National Transitional Government]. Outlining the program of his  ministry, the information boss spoke of plans to strengthen the  government media system, particularly LIBERIA NEWS AGENCY.  Minister Mulba spoke of plans to reactivate the radio and  television facilities of the government-owned Liberia  Broadcasting System. He said all public media institutions will  be made available to the public, political parties, and interest  groups during the transitional period, and repeated his  commitment to uphold press freedom. The information boss said  he would be launching a government-sponsored newspaper called  the TRANSITION.    On his part, Agriculture Minister Dr. Roland Massaquoi said  he would seek international support to upgrade Liberia's  agricultural sector. Dr. Massaquoi described agriculture as the  lifeblood of the Liberian economy.    Meanwhile, it is still not clear why the NPFL newly  nominated  minister of foreign affairs, Mrs. D. Musuleng-Cooper, has not  been confirmed by the TLA in Monrovia. Mrs. Cooper was  appointed by the leadership of the NPFL over the weekend to  replace Counselor Momolu Sirleaf, after reservations by some  Monrovia politicians of Counselor Sirleaf holding the post.    At the same time, NPFL members of the Transitional  Legislative Assembly have taken their seats at the Capitol  Building. The assembly members were welcomed by TLA Speaker  Morris Dukuly, who said their participation in the LNTG signals  the beginning of the end of the country's civil conflict.</p>

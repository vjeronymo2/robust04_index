			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prosperity Party Leader Necmettin Erbakan by </F> Mehmet Ali Birand and Can Dundar in the studio on the "Cross  Fire" program; date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Begin recording] [Birand] You recently  started to make inconceivable changes in your party. New names  from various sectors are joining it. Is this real change or is  it just for show?    [Erbakan] This is called development. While on its way to  becoming the party that will come to power on its own, and since  its basic principle is to embrace the 60 million people in this  country without discrimination and to bring them happiness, this  embrace is beginning to cover all the sectors of the nation.  Not only do we embrace them, but we include them in our party  and work together.    Our main principle remains the same: While the other,  West-imitating parties hold force to be supreme, just as the  West does, we hold God to be supreme. Those who join us,  therefore, believe in this principle.    [Dundar] Yet some of the people who join your party have  nothing to do with God. It is as if they are doing this for  publicity purposes.    [Erbakan] The door to repentance is always open. Every  person can make mistakes; however, every person has enough  common sense to see God. [passage omitted]    [Dundar] Former U.S. Ambassador in Ankara Abrahamowitz  recently said that the Prosperity Party [PP] could come to power  if it were led by a younger, more moderate leader. As you know,  when the United States speaks about something, it usually turns  out to be not so auspicious. [laughs] How do you feel about  that?    [Erbakan] You know what Ali Pasha used to say: If he wanted  to find out the truth, he would go ask the Russian ambassador.  The truth would be exactly the opposite of what the ambassador  said. Now the world has changed. It is not Russia but the  United States that is filling this role. So that is how we  should relate to this. [laughs]    [Birand] The most important thing on Turkey's agenda is the  southeast. Your approach to the Kurdish problem differs from  the other parties. You are more moderate. You are not opposed  to the use of the Kurdish language, for example. Your campaign  is: Either the PP or terrorism in the southeast. Democratic  Left Party leader Bulent Ecevit is critical of your policy  regarding this issue.    [Erbakan] The PP and the southeast -- that is an important  issue. Ecevit is not important. Let us put him aside. All the  parties are trying to discredit the PP today. Ecevit harps on  this issue. He has published certain things which were found in  his party offices. We are suing him. The PP is the party that  strives for the happiness of the 60 million people in this  country -- in fact, of 6 billion people. Approximately 60  million brothers live in this country. We have lived as  brothers -- in fact, as one body -- for 1,400 years. The  country reached its current situation as a result of the wrong  policies of the West-imitating parties. [passage omitted]    [Birand] You are saying that you have a different policy  toward the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan].    [Erbakan] We do not have a policy toward the PKK. The PKK  is not important to us. There are 60 million people in this  country. We want to bring all of them peace, freedom,  prosperity, dignity, and self-respect. To achieve this, we must  first stop being the satellites of foreign forces. It is  impossible to have Poised Hammer imposed on us on one hand and  to prevent terrorism on the other.    [Birand] You mean you will first get rid of Poised Hammer?    [Erbakan] Of course. We will send it back where it came  from. Are we a colony? What is this? What is a foreign power  doing in our land? Then, of course, we will lift the embargo  against brotherly Iraq. Why should we continue to paralyze the  economy of southeastern Anatolia? All these things, of course,  are details. Our real mission is to give the 60 million people  in this country a sense of love and brotherhood.    [Birand] All this is very abstract.    [Erbakan] That is not true. When a Muslim from Turkey who  goes on Haj meets a Muslim from Uganda, he feels an affinity and  a sympathy for him. The Muslim religion is such a tie. We have  lived with this tie for 1,400 years. If you break this tie, the  real tie, then foreign forces can divide you easily. That is  why the tie of religion should never be neglected; its  development should not be prevented; it should be encouraged,  even revived. Faith is the strongest tie that connects a  country to itself.    [Birand] I want to go back to a previous question. You say  either the PP or terrorism in the southeast. Also, only the PP  can work and produce candidates in the southeast, none of the  other parties can. How is this possible?    [Erbakan] The PP used to be the strongest party in the  southeast before the terrorist incidents flared up. Now, the PP  is stronger in the whole country. From being the largest party  it is moving toward becoming the only party. The same situation  is also true in the southeast. Our brothers in the southeast  can also see the reality. They all want to be our citizens, and  for the country to be united. Being a citizen of a dignified 60  million strong Turkey will bring happiness to everyone. They  have things they complain about: They claim that they have been  treated as second class citizens, that their economic  development has been neglected, and that their human rights have  not been recognized. Their human rights should have been  recognized.    [Birand] What about the PKK?    [Erbakan] The PKK is a tool of outside forces. Outside  forces are using it to create trouble in the area. The PKK is  merely a tool of exclusively Western forces.    [Birand] Why does it not hurt the PP then?    [Erbakan] The PKK declared us its greatest enemy.    [Birand] Of course, but it is not doing anything to your  candidates.    [Erbakan] The people there love us. The people are with us.  The PP is therefore open and can announce its candidates. The  PKK is afraid of the people and is trying to bring the people to  its side against the government. However, the people are on our  side.    [Dundar] There is also Hizbullah. It is also based on  religious faith. How do you view that organization?    [Erbakan] Some stories are being concocted. Nobody knows  the truth behind this organization. The way we view it is that  certain elements create trouble among our people in the  southeast. As you know, we want peace, brotherhood, peace of  mind, unity, and solidarity.    [Dundar] Is it possible that the Hizbullah is a continuation  of the (gladio)?    [Erbakan] It is possible, because certain very suspicious  persons are among them. It is unbelieve the things that happen  there. As you know, we have many deputies in the southeast, and  a PP southeastern committee. We study the developments in the  region in great detail. Certain unbelievable things are  happening there. Certain CIA agents and provocateurs go there  and do certain things, sometimes even under the guise of the  state, and cause the people to move away from the state. The  agents of all the foreign forces.... [pauses] Didn't the former  governor of the state of emergency region say that the place is  full of CIA agents?    [Birand] What is the conclusion we should be drawing from  your statements? You are saying that you do not like the  approach of the current government to the southeast problem. Is  that what you mean? Mainly the security issue is being dealt  with.    [Erbakan] They know nothing but violence. This is the first  issue. Secondly, there is the issue of materialism. They claim  to be brothers but the foundations of this brotherhood do not  exist. They are only paying lip service.    [Birand] When you come to power....    [Erbakan, interrupting] When we come to power all the  citizens in Turkey will actually feel the bonds of brotherhood.  We are the symbol of brotherhood.    [Birand] Will the PKK feel these bonds of brotherhood as  well?    [Erbakan] The PKK is an outside factor. The actual factor  is the people and the people are with us. We will definitely  wage a much more effective struggle against those who come and  kill our innocent children of this region. When we come to  power, however, they will not be able to base themselves in the  region and they will disappear.    [Dundar] You are trying to say that you will be replacing  the Turkish-Kurdish conflict with Islamic unity.    [Erbakan] We will have bonds of brotherhood. There is  nothing more absurd than ethnic differentiation among Muslim  brothers.    [Birand] In the past you would not visit the Ataturk  Mausoleum. You, especially your party, would not refer to  Ataturk. Now you claim that were Ataturk alive he would prefer  your party. What has changed?    [Erbakan] Now the parties that imitate the West are only  exploiting Ataturk. We are only disarming them. None of these  parties actually abide by the principles of Ataturk. We have  pointed this out repeatedly. Let us have a look at the first  years of the republic. Were we trying to borrow from other  countries or were we more interested in being self reliant and  building our own industry? What is this? This is the national  view. It is the PP program. Did we go and beg the West or did  we pursue a dignified foreign policy? In other words, the PP  policies were carefully applied during the first years of the  republic. Only afterwards did the imitators of the West come on  the scene and degenerate everything. Now they are knocking on  the doors of the West and begging. [passage omitted]    Now let us discuss the issue of laicism. There cannot be an  Ataturkist laicism or any other kind of laicism based on someone  else's views. This is a foreign word. We have always said  that. There is an unprecedented contradiction in our current  constitution. On the one hand it states that the official  language is Turkish and on the other it has foreign words. We  should be suspicious of it. What is the intention of those who  want to preserve this? Now let us leave the issue of intention  aside and let us deal with the scientific aspect. There are  close to 200 countries in the world. We have analyzed the  constitutions of all these countries and have presented a paper  on the issue to the Assembly chairman. Only two of these  countries use the word laicism in their constitutions, namely  France and Turkey. No other country uses this word. More than  half of these countries state their official religion in their  constitutions. For example, the British constitution states  that the official religion is the Anglican Church. [passage  omitted] All countries do that with the exception of Turkey.  Laicism is based on three fundamental principles. The first  one is that there is the freedom of belief. The second one  states that one cannot resort to force to impose his beliefs on  others. There should be tolerance and views should be expressed  in an atmosphere of tranquillity. The third principle notes  that the church administration will not interfere with the state  administration. This is a reaction to the Middle Ages when the  church remained in power for a long time in Western countries.  It is stated that the church administration will not interfere  in the state administration and vice versa. This is a delicate  differentiation. It does not say that religion and the state  are separate. [passage omitted]    [Birand] There has been a very interesting development.  There has been a rapprochement between the PP and the Alawites.  You have even had contacts with Prof. Izzettin Dogan. There has  been talk of cooperation, mutual support in various  municipalities. The Alawites have reacted to this cooperation.  The Sivas incidents have not yet been forgotten. Can you  explain this rapprochement? How far will it go?    [Erbakan] Let me first refer to the Sivas incidents. Those  incidents were the ploy of foreign forces aimed at creating an  Alawite-Sunni conflict. [passage omitted] Our Alawite brothers  are Muslims. We believe in the same God, the same Prophet and  the Koran. Sectarian differences are just details. We should,  therefore, not become the tools of foreign forces in their  efforts to create an Alawite-Sunni rift. The PP is against the  Turkish-Kurdish rift. The PP has the ideology to create the  bonds of brotherhood among our 60 million citizens. It also has  the ideology to eliminate the Alawite-Sunni rift.    [Dundar] What kind of a cooperation is being envisaged?    [Erbakan] In a symbolic ceremony held last week, we accepted  200 Alawite brothers as members of our party. Certain persons  with ulterior motives have been waging this propaganda for years  now. Now our Alawite citizens are asking themselves. They are  saying: We have, for years, been voting for the SDPP [Social  Democratic Populist Party]. What have we achieved? Are we still  not hungry? Are we not oppressed? Having seen these realities  they now see salvation in the PP just as the 60 million citizens  of our country.    [Dundar] How will you cooperate?    [Erbakan] No doubt, in regions where there is a large  Alawite population we will ask them who they want to nominate  for the municipal elections. We will ask them to nominate their  own candidates. Of course, the work to be carried out will be  in line with our principles. What does this mean? It means the  equal treatment of all. It means the recognition of human  rights for everyone.    [Birand] So long as they abide by your principles.    [Erbakan] They are not our principles alone they are the  principles of all humanity. We do not have special principles.  As I stated earlier, we advocate equal treatment of all, bonds  of brotherhood for all.    [Dundar] In an interview with a daily you were quoted as  saying that it is not difficult to come to power but that what  frightens you is to come to power and be impotent. What do you  mean by that?    [Erbakan] There are many institutes of strategy in the  United States. These institutes conduct research in line with  their own basic plans. Many people we know there send us  reports on this research. They say that most of the institutes  there regret their research. In other words, they brought about  revolutions in certain Muslim countries and these revolutions  have not brought any happiness to the people. They had to foot  the bill for these revolutions. One can cite Algeria. The  revolutions in Turkey were also greatly influenced by them. It  is not important whether those who made the revolutions are  aware of it.    [Dundar] You are saying that they were used?    [Erbakan] Of course, they were used. We have repeatedly  stated this. They are the directors. They prepare the ground  and then they push the button. Those who make the revolutions  are not aware of what they are doing. None of the problems are  solved. Realizing this U.S. interference and involvement the  people become furious. This has been confirmed. Now they  propose to do it differently. They propose not to interfere in  the elections. Let the people elect whomever they choose. If  the elected administration does not suit them, if it does not  fit in with their exploitation and world supremacy, if an  administration favoring equality, independence, peace,  tranquility, and justice instead of force is elected then they  will try and render that administration unsuccessful.    [Dundar] Then they are no longer in favor of coups.    [Erbakan] That is true. They prefer to cause that  administration to fail.    [Birand] That is not what they did in Algeria.    [Erbakan] And what happened there? There is no  tranquillity. Algeria will revert to its former situation. They  realize that this is not a solution. Now they are trying to  devise new methods. I would like to refer to an important  point. I allocated a significant section to this point in our  party congress. They might think that the PP will come to  power. I am sure that when we come to power they will be  revising their policies. Why? Because the PP is not against  anyone. We are not prejudiced against any country. We want  happiness for the 6 billion people of this world. We want good  relations with everyone. We will be establishing these good  ties. For example, the United States will change its stand  towards Turkey. How will it change? Instead of giving orders  over the phone it will show us the respect befitting a country  that is the leader and nucleus of the new world. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

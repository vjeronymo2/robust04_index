			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Four commenters recommended the use of specific types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure relief devices. EDO recommended that the agency require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fusible plug device and prohibit the rupture disc device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EDO stated that a combination of hot conditions and overfill at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the refueling pump could cause a rupture disc to activate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> releasing CNG and causing a potentially dangerous situation. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further believed that the safety factor in the burst test would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be sufficient to prevent over pressurization and that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure relief device should only open in a fire situation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flxible stated that the agency should require a fusible plug to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure pressure relief of partially filled containers subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heat or fire. NYCFD stated that the agency should prohibit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination fusible plug and rupture disc devices, claiming that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over-charged containers exposed to high ambient temperature are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely to fail whether or not they are exposed to fire. Thomas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commented that the agency should require the combination fusible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plug and rupture disc device because it is required by NFPA 52. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> NFPA 52, Standard for Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Vehicular Fuel Systems <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , is a voluntary standard adopted by the National Fire Protection Association that specifies guidelines for the ``design and installation of CNG engine fuel systems on vehicles of all types including aftermarket and OEMs and to their associated fueling (dispensing) systems.'' (NFPA 52, &sect;1&hyph;1) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has concluded that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard should not specify the type of pressure relief device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with which a container may be equipped. The NPRM and SNPRM did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not provide sufficient notice for the agency to adopt such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specification as part of this final rule. Further, the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the bonfire test, which is performed at both 100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of service pressure and 25 percent of service pressure,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will adequately evaluate a container's ability to vent its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contents in a high temperature/pressure situation. In the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test, the combination of the 100 percent service pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition and the high heat from the bonfire will cause the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container's pressure to increase rapidly. This test evaluates a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container's ability to vent its contents at high temperatures and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressures. In the second test, the 25 percent service pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition and the heat will cause the container's temperature to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase before the pressure in the container reaches a critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point. This test evaluates a container's ability to vent its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contents at high temperatures, where the container is at a less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than full condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Shielding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA notes that there are two types of shielding that can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect the performance of pressure relief devices in bonfire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests: (1) ``Vehicle-based protective shielding'' that is placed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> around the container in the vehicle to protect the container from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surrounding heat, and (2) ``test shielding'' that is placed over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pressure relief device to prevent flames from contacting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device. Test shielding is, as the name suggests, installed only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the purpose of conducting bonfire tests. Unlike vehicle-based protective shielding, it is not used to affect real world  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, NHTSA recognized that some CNG vehicles may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have vehicle-based shielding installed to protect the containers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from exposure to heat. Nevertheless, the agency proposed that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle-based shielding be used during the bonfire test because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard No. 304 is an equipment standard, and applies to CNG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers, not to vehicles. Further, since the presence or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of shielding could vary from vehicle to vehicle, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency tentatively concluded that the containers should be tested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the worst case situation, i.e., without any vehicle-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shielding. Nevertheless, the agency stated that it did not want  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to discourage vehicle manufacturers from including shielding in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CNG vehicles as an added safety feature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA received six comments addressing the use of vehicle- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based shielding during the bonfire test. PST, EDO, ARC, Ontario,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and NGVC agreed with the agency that vehicle-based shielding of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the container should not be used during the bonfire test. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that such shielding could detract from or mask the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results of the test. In contrast, AAMA stated that ``[i]f a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer chooses to add the additional expense to protect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel tank from exposure to potential flame, the protection ought  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be allowed in any test as representative of the tank's use in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the vehicle.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit vehicle-based shielding of the container during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bonfire test. As explained in the NPRM, the bonfire test is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to evaluate the container and not the vehicle. Since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this is an equipment standard, the tests are designed to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the containers are safe for installation in any vehicle,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of the amount of protective vehicle shielding, if any,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with which it is equipped. The agency disagrees with AAMA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contention. Using vehicle shielding in compliance testing would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not ensure that a container could perform safely under worst case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions (i.e., no vehicle-based shielding of any type or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent) that the container could encounter during its service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life (e.g., if the container is subsequently placed in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different vehicle).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Test shielding consists of a metal plate over the pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relief device and is permitted, but not required, under NGV2 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of the horizontal bonfire test. In the horizontal test,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CNG container is positioned over the bonfire with its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longitudinal axis in a horizontal position. In the NGV2 vertical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bonfire test (container longitudinal axis in a vertical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position), pressure relief device shielding is also permitted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but not required, except where the CNG container is fitted with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure relief device on both ends. In that case, the bottom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure relief device must be shielded. The goal is to not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow flames to impinge directly on any relief device. This may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be done through test shielding, or by orienting the container so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as to avoid flame impingement on any pressure relief device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Without this metal plate, the flames could contact the pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relief device, possibly causing it to vent the container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prematurely. If this occurred, the bonfire test results would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neither evaluate the CNG container as a whole nor accurately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect the container's pressure relief characteristics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CGA and PST opposed allowing shielding of the pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relief device during the bonfire test. They commented that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shielding the pressure relief device during the bonfire test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be representative of a real-world crash fire situation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CGA stated that allowing, but not requiring shielding to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placed around pressure relief devices could produce non-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeatable results. PST stated that excessive shielding around  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pressure relief device could cause an otherwise acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design to fail the test, but did not elaborate as to how this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

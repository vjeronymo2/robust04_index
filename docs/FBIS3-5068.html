Ermita] </F>   [Text] Adjudication of cases involving violations of  intellectual property rights (IPR) in the country has remained  problematic because of numerous constraints, says a recently  released study. According to the study, the country's IPR laws  need strengthening and updating to become effective. While IPR  complaints have been routinely filed with the Department of  Justice, most IPR cases have not resulted in convictions of  alleged violators. Most IPR cases have been settled out of  court. In the few cases where the court has ruled in favor of  IPR owners, the convicted were punished with a small fine, or  put on probation without serving their prison terms.    These are among the findings of a study commissioned by the  Philippine Exporters Confederation (Philexport), through its  Private Investment and Trade Opportunities -- Philippines  (PITO-P) project. The SRI [Stanford Research Institute]  International-Washington team conducted the study. Rico Domingo  led the SRI study team. Other team members were: Carlo Carag,  technical expert; Peter Boone and Ophelia Yeung, international  economists.    The study acknowledges the increasing international  consensus  about the need to protect intellectual property to encourage  technological and artistic innovation. Indeed, the recently  concluded Uruguay Round of the General Trade and Tariff  Agreement's program to come out with a multilateral global trade  framework has agreed for a stricter intellectual property  protection standards. The study suggests several reforms to  protect and enforce intellectual property in the country --  fully consistent with international standards. These reforms  involve changes on the IPR regime itself, the streamlining of  the IPR adjudication process and the prevention of intellectual  property violations.    According to the study, its survey of intellectual property  owners and representatives has shown that the Philippine  judicial system is not at all effective in enforcing IPR  violations. The general constraints to IPR adjudication in the  Philippines include the following:    -- low priority given to IPR protection;    -- inadequate resources and training for IPR enforcement  agencies;    -- possible judicial and government agency bias against  multinationals;    -- lack of information and knowledge on IPR laws among  enforcement agents and judicial officers;    -- public apathy or lack of awareness;    -- lack of coordination among IPR enforcement agencies;    -- overall inefficiency of the judicial system; and  corruption.    The study identifies these legal regime problems:    -- overly technical and stringent evidentiary requirements;    -- tenuous legal authority among enforcement agencies to  expedite IPR violations; and    -- inadequate fines and criminal penalties.    The adjudication system is equally difficult, says the  study.  The investigation stage has the following problems:    -- difficulties obtaining receipts to prove sale of  counterfeit items;    -- difficulties establishing identity of intellectual  property violators;    -- problems finding witnesses to sign affidavits;    -- availability of judges,    -- refusal by owners to allow entry during raids and in  the serving of search warrants;    -- "protection" offered to infringers by "influential  friends";    -- and; lack of storage space for seized evidence  (counterfeit and pirate goods).    During the prosecution phase the following difficulties were  identified:    -- respondent's inability to answer subpoena and notices;    -- liberal extensions granted by the prosecutor to the  respondent to appear in preliminary investigation hearings.</p>

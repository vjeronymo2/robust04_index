			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: European side behind 14% rise by Unilever UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, increased pre-tax profits 14 per cent in the second quarter to Pounds 511m, due mainly to an improved performance by its European operations. In the half-year to June 30, pre-tax profit rose 10 per cent to Pounds 888m. Mr Michael Perry, chairman, said the progress would be sustained in the second half. However, he said: 'We perceive little evidence of economic recovery in a number of our important territories.' The second quarter profit compares with Pounds 448m in the same quarter a year ago and was earned on sales of Pounds 6.15bn (Pounds 5.81bn). The half-year profit, which compares with Pounds 806m a year ago, was earned on sales of Pounds 11.6bn (Pounds 11.2bn). In Europe, operating profit rose to Pounds 354m (Pounds 336m) on sales of Pounds 3.67bn (Pounds 3.48bn) in the quarter. The group said a fall in half-year operating profit to Pounds 614m (Pounds 642m) on sales of Pounds 6.91bn (Pounds 6.72) reflected the disposal of its packaging businesses. Mr Perry described as excellent the performance of the ice cream business in Europe, which had benefited from good weather. Results in the region from personal products, speciality chemicals and German operations were also good. However, meal components and professional products suffered from the warm weather and slow economic growth. In general, Unilever's consumer operations fared better in Europe than its industrial activities. In North America, quarterly operating profit edged up to Pounds 74m (Pounds 69m) on sales of Pounds 1.22bn (Pounds 1.2bn). The half-year figure rose to Pounds 91m (Pounds 79m) on sales of Pounds 2.27bn (2.24bn). Unilever said it gained volume and share in margarine, toilet soap and several other products. Recovery continued in personal products, particularly at the upper end of the market. In the rest of the world, Unilever said quarterly operating profit was depressed by exceptional items, growing to Pounds 105m (Pounds 98m) on sales of Pounds 1.27bn (Pounds 1.14bn). Half-year profit advanced to Pounds 232m (Pounds 194m) on sales of Pounds 2.47bn (2.21bn). Sales of detergents and personal products grew strongly in Latin America, and results in Argentina were particularly good. Losses in Japan declined on improved results from detergents and personal products, though food performed less well. Earnings per share rose six per cent in both periods to 16.98p (15.98p) for the quarter and 30.07p (28.42p) for the half year. Operating margins remained at 8.7 per cent in the quarter but fell to 8 per cent (8.2 per cent) in the half year. Net interest fell to Pounds 84m (Pounds 145m) in the six months, reflecting lower interest rates and continuing reduction in net debt, which declined by Pounds 100m to Pounds 1.5bn during the second quarter. Unilever made 12 acquisitions and 17 disposals in the six months, at a net cost of Pounds 67m. The interim dividend will be announced with third quarter results in November. See Lex</p>

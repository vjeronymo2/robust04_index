			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Hard graft for software - A look at various ways computer entrepreneurs have raised elusive early-stage finance Never has the application of software made a bigger impact on business and domestic life than in the 1990s. But surprisingly few software houses in the UK manage to start up, raise finance and build companies that grow and survive. Banks do not like them; they are too dependent on people, and assets such as debtors tend to evaporate when the software company can no longer provide service support. Start-ups tend not to be considered by most venture capitalists, and even finance for later-stage development is scarce. Bitter experience suggests that most venture funds have not done well in this area. The pace of change means it is not uncommon for venture capitalists to require the business to be sold just when the software house needs to spend more money developing a next generation or new product. 'There is the first start-up funding, when a group of individuals get together, which may not be fantastically large,' says Philip Purslow, managing director of Birmingham-based Simtel, which makes pre-production software for industrial processes. 'You then sell and develop, sell and develop - but to go faster you need more finance.' A sine qua non for funding at any stage is a good business plan - one that includes a clear idea of the software to be developed, the market and the company's competitive position. Take Option Systems Limited, a Leicester-based maker of software that helps customers such as Mizuno, the sports goods company, Pepe Jeans and Hi-Tec shoes manage their international distribution. When Terry Forsey and partners launched OSL in 1991, they had considerable knowledge of their particular niche - software for the textile industry to help customers manage the supply of different shapes, colours and sizes of the same item. Forsey's previous company, Universal CMS, had built sales of Pounds 12m with the help of a government software development grant and some development capital. Forsey left when the board decided to freeze further research and development expenditure on the product - a decision he says was partly responsible for Universal CMS going out of business in 1991. When he took the idea of a new company producing similar software to the bank, he had a product and a clearly-defined set of customers in a niche market. OSL was able to get off the ground with a mixture of directors' borrowings, backed by personal guarantees, and a bank loan supported by the small company loan guarantee scheme. What is even more unusual is that OSL has sold to 14 companies in 34 sites around Europe using internally-generated resources. It has avoided the need to raise external funds partly because it is using distributors who bear some of the risk and cost and partly because OSL has found and concentrated on a niche market. OSL has also adopted a novel way of ensuring that its customers get the product upgrades they want and not what the supplier thinks they want. It has handed over much of the authority to spend the R&amp;D budget to a user group made up of its customers. 'Inherent in the culture of the business is the idea that you have to keep developing the product,' Forsey says. Instead of growth based on spurts of development spending - a process that can be difficult to finance - development becomes continuous, ys. Rather than try to work on an entirely new product, OSL is now using the strong cash flow from Pounds 1.6m of sales to push into new geographical markets. Purslow says there are few companies that can occupy a small niche market like this any more. Most software companies must operate in a world where their market is rapidly changing. It is this that makes funding of the early stage of a software company's life so risky, he says. Simtel's early financing also had government support. Purslow's eight years of developing and marketing software suggest that at an early stage software entrepreneurs have to be as knowledgeable about sources of grant aid as they are about their market and product. When Purslow approached Derek Harris, managing director of Birmingham Technology Venture Capital, he had no product - just an idea that he could improve pre-production systems that help manufacturers design and schedule production and distribution. Between the three original partners, who put up Pounds 60,000, and Birmingham Technology Venture Capital, Simtel raised about Pounds 150,000 in start-up funds. It then went down a familiar path of supplementing income from its own software with the sale of bought-in Cad-Cam products. But when it needed to develop more quickly, Purslow started looking to the Department of Trade and Industry for grants. Over three years the DTI supplied about Pounds 300,000  -but only after Simtel had found two collaborative partners. 'Since then we have developed from national schemes to European funding and the consortiums have become bigger,' says Purslow. Simtel's last project, funded from the EU's Eureka Famos and Brite Euram funds, cost Pounds 6m and was done in collaboration with seven partners in four countries. Now breaking even on sales of about Pounds 2m, Simtel is moving to a stage where it will limit its development and place more emphasis on commercial exploitation of the software it has developed. QSP, now a quoted company making software for integrated financial control systems, also turned to the DTI for a job creation grant early in its life. But it was also an exponent of the beg-and-borrow school of early fundraising. Alan Mordain, its founder, found three companies which agreed to let him use their IBM mainframes over evenings and weekends for the early development work. Only after a couple of years, when the company had about 16 customers, did Mordain decide QSP needed a mainframe of its own. Then it brought in venture capitalists Advent Limited. Leaning on customers, or more likely future customers, is another way for software houses to finance their development. The customer pays for part of the development, takes the product at a concessionary rate once it is developed, but leaves the right to develop and market the product with the software house. A variant of this is the route taken by the Software Partnership Limited, which produces specialist banking software and was recently sold to Deluxe Data Systems, a subsidiary of the large US cheque printer, Deluxe Corp. To finance its early days, Software Partnership's three partners became consult-ants. Howard Hanson, a co-founder and now research and new technology director for Deluxe, said this did not simply cross-subsidise the development of generic software products it was later able to market. By working closely with the bank, the company was also able to discover exactly what the customer wanted and what the market was failing to supply. These alternative solutions to early-stage funding leave most UK venture capitalists searching for a role. While more are prepared to enter at a later stage, all but those with the most recent experience in the software industry seem to find the pace of change too fast. But, according to Brian Reynolds, a founder of Microfocus, one of the UK's most successful software companies, finding the initial finance was not the most difficult part. He did it by borrowing Pounds 5,000 from the bank to buy a computer on which he developed enough of a product to get backing from 3i two years later. What was difficult, Reynolds says, was building a company in the UK and the US. 'All the main competitors are in the US and you have to absorb the way they think, act and market,' he says. This is an extremely difficult and hard grind, he has found. But he is optimistic that new communications, like video-conferencing, are breaking these barriers down. 'It is a good time for software companies to start up,' he says.</p>

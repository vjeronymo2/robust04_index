			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: US clarifies trading of Zeneca during rights THE US Securities and Exch-ange Commission has clarified the trading rules for underwriters of the Zeneca Pounds 1.3bn rights issue. Since shares of Zeneca, the bioscience business demerged this week from Imperial Chemical Industries, are to be listed in New York as well as London, the SEC's rules have to be complied with. However, whereas normally there are restrictions on underwriters throughout such an offer period, the restrictions on Zeneca's underwriters will only cover the last five days up to the close on June 21. Underwriters will be able to trade normally if the Zeneca share price is either below the 600p rights issue price or more than 666p. Yesterday the shares closed at 634p, up 4p. If the share price is between 600p and 666p, underwriters can only trade 'passively' the SEC says. This means they can respond to client orders and deal at the market price. But they cannot generate trades or 'lead' the market. Meanwhile, shares in new-ICI, rose further yesterday, up 38p to 674p.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Petrocan to sell 37% stake in Westcoast PETRO-CANADA, the partially privatised Canadian energy group, is further rationalising its activities by selling its 37 per cent stake in Westcoast Energy, the Vancouver-based pipeline operator and natural gas producer. Petrocan said yesterday a group of securities dealers, led by ScotiaMcLeod, had agreed to buy the Westcoast shares for CDollars 342m (USDollars 285.59m) or CDollars 16.25 a share. The price will be paid in two near-equal instalments. Petrocan is Westcoast's largest single shareholder. The proceeds will be used to reduce Petrocan's CDollars 1.5bn debt. But the company expects to post a CDollars 54m after-tax charge from the sale against third-quarter earnings. Petrocan first bought a stake in Westcoast shortly after its creation in the mid-1970s as Canada's national energy company. It augmented its holdings in 1988.</p>

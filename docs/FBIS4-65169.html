			<p>BFN     [Text] Aachen (DPA) -- At the start of the European  election campaign, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian  Democratic Union -- CDU) has demonstrated optimism about  economic prospects in Germany and has clearly expressed himself  in favor of the European unification process. He said at a  rally in front of the Aachen Cathedral that peace and freedom  are only possible in a united Europe; this holds true also for  the long-term safeguarding of the economic sector, jobs, and the  social system.    Following the most serious cyclical crisis since World War  II, the order books are filling again now, the rate of inflation  is about 3 percent and, for the first time in a long period, GNP  is increasing again, said the chancellor. In his speech, which  was repeatedly interrupted by some demonstrators, Kohl told his  audience of approximately 3,000 that he advocated a common  European policy in the struggle against organized crime. "The  struggle against the mafia and international drug trafficking is  an all-European responsibility," he said.    He called upon foreigners living in Germany not to misuse  their right as guests and to pursue political goals in a  peaceful way: "We will not tolerate citizens being terrorized in  the streets and squares." Kohl and Federal Labor Minister  Norbert Bluem, the chief of the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU, and  CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze stressed that almost every  third job in Germany is marked by exports to other EU [European  Union] member states.    Kohl, who was received by roughly 100 demonstrators with  shrill catcalls, called the protesters "descendants of the  socialist migration of peoples." He said it was a great  achievement for him to receive Russian President Boris Yeltsin  on 11 May, shortly after the anniversary of the German  capitulation, for talks on details of the definitive Russian  troop withdrawal.    In view of the European parliamentary elections to be held  within five weeks (12 June), it is our duty "to do everything to  build a Europe in which wars are no longer possible." In  connection with German unity, the chancellor sharply attacked  the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. He said he could  tolerate criticism from the jobless in the new laender.  However, he did not need criticism from the SPD, "which had  long betrayed German unity." The Social Democrats had been  prepared to "go down on their knees" before Erich Honecker, the  chief of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Kohl said that  "the flourishing landscapes" in the new federal laender were  progressing well.</p>

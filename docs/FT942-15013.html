			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / AEEU strengthened by government policy on check-off About half the 500,000 members of the AEEU engineering union who pay subscriptions through their pay packets under the check-off system have agreed to carry on doing so, Mr Bill Jordan, union president, said yesterday, Robert Taylor writes. He said he was confident the union would not suffer a net loss of members as a result of new rules on check-off which require written authorisation for subscriptions to be deducted by employers at source. As much as 75 per cent of the AEEU's income comes via the check-off system, which covers 65 per cent of its membership. Mr Jordan said the government's clampdown on check-off had strengthened his union by galvanising the activists to recruit members. The union also achieved a profit of more than Pounds 1.5m in 1993 - thanks to a rise in subscriptions, a shake-up of its organisation and a slowdown in membership loss.</p>

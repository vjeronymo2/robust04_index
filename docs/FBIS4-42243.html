			<p>BFN     [Text] In comments for our station, Defense Minister Julian  Garcia Vargas said that the blue helmets' humanitarian aid for  the Bosnian conflict cannot go on forever if the parties in  conflict do not reach a peace agreement. Julian Garcia Vargas.    [Begin Garcia Vargas recording] We have to establish a  principle: We will set a reasonable period of presence and if  this period does not lead to anything, if the negotiations do  not make any progress, we will have to tell the parties that we  do not want to stay there forever.    In two months, [corrects himself] in five months, we will  have been there for two years, and I think that it is time to  speak to our European partners and to discuss with them the fact  that this cannot go on forever. [end recording]</p>

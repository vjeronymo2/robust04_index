			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Observer: Shop early Mohamed Fayed's war with John Major's government has the oddest consequences. Many of Westminster's well-heeled Tory MPs might expect to do some Christmas shopping at Harrods, the famous Knightsbridge store. Which is of course owned by Fayed. Hardly the done thing, perhaps, to be spotted crossing Harrods's threshold at the moment. It might be construed as an act of gross disloyalty to the prime minister.</p>

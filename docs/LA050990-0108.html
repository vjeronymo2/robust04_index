			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> COUNCIL ENDORSES ARMING RANGERS  </P> <P> By the end of the year, the city's five full-time park rangers will become the  first in Orange County allowed to carry handguns on patrol.  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday unanimously endorsed the idea of arming the rangers  and directed the city attorney's office to draft an ordinance that will allow  them to carry .357-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers while patrolling Santa  Ana's 38 parks. The rangers already wear bulletproof vests and carry batons,  Mace and two-way radios.  </P> <P> City Manager David N. Ream said that setting up a program to arm the rangers  would take about nine months and cost about $20,000.  </P> <P> "I think it would be in the best interest of the department if we proceed with  a sensible plan of testing and arming the park rangers," Ream said. "It needs  to be done in a thoughtful, thorough way."  </P> <P> But Councilman Richards L. Norton urged the council to make sure that the  rangers are armed "as soon as possible."  </P> <P> "Every day they are out there without the necessary protection, including  firearms, they are in jeopardy," Norton said. "There's a tremendous need out  there, and it's just a matter of making it a priority."  </P> <P> Sean Mill, chairman of the city's Recreation and Community Advisory Board,  agreed.  </P> <P> "I would like to see it implemented as soon as possible rather than wait nine  months, because gang problems get worse," Mill said. "I think the summer is  going to be a bad one in Santa Ana, and I'd like to see our rangers armed  before then."  </P> <P> Rangers already have undergone 360 hours of reserve officer classes, which  include training with firearms, but they will have to complete gun  certification training, Ream said.  </P> <P> Although city officials said no park ranger has ever been stabbed or shot on  duty, shots were fired recently in the direction of an on-duty ranger, said  Allen Doby, director of the city Recreation and Community Services Agency.  </P> <P> The park ranger program was begun in Santa Ana nine years ago to combat  vandalism in the parks. Since the patrols began, vandalism has dropped from  9,000 incidents a month to about 1,000, Doby said. In addition to patrolling,  rangers also are in charge of locking restrooms and closing parks at night.  </P> <P> The city also employs eight part-time rangers who will not be allowed to carry  guns. Doby said part-timers do not patrol at night.GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

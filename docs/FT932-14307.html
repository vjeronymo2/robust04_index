			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Economic reform for S Korea THE two-month-old government of South Korean President Kim Young-sam said yesterday that it planned to introduce extensive economic reforms during its five-year administration. The guidelines released by the economic planning board established goals for economic deregulation. A detailed blueprint on their implementation will be announced at the end of June. Some of the measures announced yesterday had been promised by earlier administrations, but were delayed for political reasons. Although the new programme is impressive in its scope, some seasoned analysts in Seoul expressed reservations that, based on past experience, it would reach fruition. The measures include financial liberalisation to ease state controls on the banking sector and cut the government's role in credit allocation. The nation's 23 commercial banks will be encouraged to merge and will be allowed to expand into other financial sectors. Almost all interest rates will be deregulated by 1996. Credit controls on the nation's big industrial conglomerates, or chaebol, will be abolished but they will be replaced by tougher anti-trust laws to force them to concentrate on a few core businesses instead of operating a wide range of diversified activities. Institutional investors will be encouraged to raise their chaebol shareholdings to cut the influence of family owners that now dominate them.</p>

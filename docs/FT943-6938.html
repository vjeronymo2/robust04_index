			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: E German industrial output up Eastern Germany's industrial output rose by 15 per cent in June compared to the same period in 1993 and by 5.3 per cent compared to May, the federal economics ministry announced yesterday. It said seasonal factors had helped to boost overall output. However, output in individual sectors was mixed. Manufacturing recovered strongly, up 21.5 per cent year-on-year, and by 6.7 per cent between May and June. Construction, one of the most buoyant sectors, rose 14 per cent and 8 per cent over the same periods. Output in the electricity and gas sectors increased only by 3.4 per cent year-on-year and fell by 6.7 per cent between May and June. The mining sector, mostly brown coal, or lignite, fell by 13.6 per cent year-on-year, and rose 4.4 per cent in June compared to the previous month. Consumer spending in the Netherlands rose 1.5 per cent in real terms in the second quarter from last year, the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics said yesterday. That gain was sharply narrower than the 2.8 per cent real increase in the first quarter. France's current account showed a seasonally adjusted surplus of FFr1.14bn (Pounds 130m) in May after a revised FFr2.75bn surplus in April, the economy ministry said.</p>

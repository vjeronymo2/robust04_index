			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / International Company News: Recovery under way at Enichem Enichem, the Italian state-owned chemicals group, should be able to halve its losses this year after cutting costs. The group, which is wholly-owned by Eni, the state holding company, made a net loss of L2,668bn (Dollars 1.7bn) in 1993, up from L1,560bn in 1992. However, in the first four months of 1994, the company has managed to reduce fixed costs by 10 per cent, while increasing income from its principal products by 7 per cent. Overall sales are up 7.2 per cent to L3,711bn. The company's gross operating profit in the first four months reached L287bn, compared with L385bn for the whole of 1993, helped by a 4 per cent fall in the cost of raw materials for its petrochemicals products. Eni is trying to restore Enichem to financial health with a four-year programme of restructuring and L2,500bn of asset sales.</p>

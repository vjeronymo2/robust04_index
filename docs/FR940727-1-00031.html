			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Green Lights participants include: Corporations; State, city, and county governments; lighting manufacturing and management companies; electric utilities; non-profit organizations; and hospitals, universities, and other businesses throughout the U.S. Green Lights encourages the establishment of comprehensive energy-efficient lighting programs within an organization that include: Converting from less-efficient fluorescent to more-efficient fluorescent lamps; converting from incandescent to compact fluorescent lamps; converting from magnetic to electronic lighting ballasts; installing occupancy sensors, daylight dimmers, and other lighting control technologies; installing more efficient luminaries or lighting fixtures; and efficient maintenance practices, such as group relamping and regular fixture cleaning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By signing a partnership agreement with the EPA, Green Lights participants agree to survey and upgrade, within 5 years, 90 percent of all domestic facilities wherever profitable and wherever lighting quality is improved or maintained. In return, these participants should receive reductions (savings) in their monthly energy expenses. A good energy-efficient lighting upgrade typically includes some type of control strategy (such as occupancy sensors) that will reduce lamp burning hours. The result is that the lamp will last longer and need to be replaced less frequently. As of June 30, 1993, over 1,000 organizations have joined the Green Lights program. These organizations have committed over 3.5 billion square feet of facility space to the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Green Lights Program encourages the use of energy-efficient lamps using an initial and scheduled periodic relampings to achieve higher energy efficiency and reduce energy costs. These relampings involve removal and replacement of all lamps in a building or in an area at one time, as opposed to replacement of lamps as they burn out. An initial lighting upgrade and group relamping may result in a large number of fluorescent lamps that require disposal. In some instances, a participant that would usually be a conditionally exempt small quantity generator, could become a large quantity generator of hazardous waste due to the large number of lamps generated in one month. In general, if a generator disposes of more than approximately 350 four foot fluorescent lamps, that generator is a large quantity generator due to lamps alone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite the environmental and financial benefits of energy efficient lighting systems, there are disincentives to participating in an energy conservation program like Green Lights. Establishing a comprehensive energy-efficient lighting program and installing energy-efficient lighting technologies require an initial investment that may be significant, depending on the size and comprehensiveness of the project. Although Green Lights provides information to participants on financing options, many profitable lighting upgrade projects are delayed due to restricted availability of capital. It is especially difficult for smaller businesses and government organizations to raise the necessary capital, although energy-efficient lighting investments are low risk and in the long run will reduce costs. The additional costs associated with managing, transporting, and disposing of lighting wastes as hazardous wastes can create an additional disincentive to join Green Lights and make the initial investment in energy-efficient light technologies. For example, under the hazardous waste regulations, large quantity generators are required to label boxes and drums, notify EPA of status as a hazardous waste generator, transport waste via a hazardous waste transporter, manage waste consistent with the land disposal restrictions, and manage waste at a hazardous waste management facility. In addition, on May 8, 1994, generators of mercury-containing lamps will be required (under the Land Disposal Restrictions) to meet a treatment standard for lamps as hazardous debris. As is discussed in detail in Section VII, Economic Impact Analysis, of this preamble, the Agency estimates that the annual national cost of Subtitle C compliance for large quantity generators could range from 110 to 134 million dollars. EPA's preliminary estimates suggest that an exclusion would save generators of mercury containing lamps approximately 85 to 102 million dollars annually, while the inclusion of lamps in the universal waste management system would save generators approximately 16 to 20 million dollars annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Green Lights program may increase the number of large quantity generators on months when mass relamping occurs, the program is not expected to increase the total quantity of used fluorescent lamps in the long run. The lamps recommended by the Green Lights program are more energy efficient and with implementation of energy saving practices, these lamps could have an extended life of four to five years rather than the average three to four years. Therefore, if by reducing the initial costs of participation in the Green Lights program, generators participate in the Green Lights Program, an energy savings will occur. These additional energy savings will decrease the amount of mercury and other pollutants emitted to in the atmosphere from coal-burning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> C. Industry Source Reduction Initiatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> A report, ``The Management of Spent Electric Lamps Containing Mercury,'' by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA, 1992) discussed industry efforts to reduce mercury in fluorescent lamps. According to the report, due to the use of more efficient dosing techniques (i.e., placing mercury in the lamp), the average mercury content of a standard 4-foot, 11/2 inch diameter, cool white fluorescent lamp was reduced by 14% (48.2 mg/lamp to 41.6 mg/lamp) from 1985 to 1990. Future industry projections of mercury reductions by 1995 show an estimated 35% further reduction (41.6 mg/lamp to 27.0 mg/lamp) for the standard fluorescent lamp.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Source reduction, which is the reduction or elimination of the toxicity and/or volume of a waste product, is at the top of EPA's hierarchy of municipal solid waste (MSW) management methods. With regard to mercury, the most significant source reduction achievement has been the trend toward elimination of mercury from alkaline batteries. Although these batteries are still a significant contributor of mercury to municipal solid waste, discards of mercury from alkaline batteries are dropping dramatically because of source reduction achievement. Mercury-containing lamps are one of the next highest single sources of mercury in the municipal solid waste, accounting for 3.8% of mercury now going to MSW landfills. EPA encourages cost-effective source reduction of mercury in fluorescent lamps. Opportunities exist to reduce mercury content levels in both standard 4-foot fluorescent lamps and the increasingly popular compact fluorescent lamps (U.S. EPA, 1993b). If source reduction is pursued aggressively by the fluorescent lamp manufacturing industry, the overall contribution of mercury from fluorescent lamps to municipal solid waste could remain constant or decrease over time even as fluorescent lamp usage increases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (5): Getting to grips with income ALTHOUGH there has been some study of the employment effect of having an international airport at Manchester, little work has been done on the income flows resulting from its presence. Virtually the only exercise undertaken was by the economic development unit of the Manchester City council; but this was in 1988. Mr Steve Carr, the principal economic development officer attached to the chief executive's office, was one of the authors of the study. He says: 'It was a very simple and crude attempt to discover what the airport contributed to the region.' The paper divides income into five categories: procurement, remuneration, tourism and business travel, capital projects and induced investment and development. Procurement: The paper found the average annual expenditure on goods and services by companies based at the airport was estimated to be slightly in excess of Pounds 100m. However, not all of this was spent in the Greater Manchester area or in the wider north-west region. The 'leakage' outside the area was up to 50 per cent. But some 5 per cent of goods and services were obtained from outside the north west. The paper put the procurement income at Pounds 54m. Remuneration: The total wages bill for those employed at the airport was found to be in excess of Pounds 70m. Not all of this wages bill found its way into the Greater Manchester economy. Again, there was leakage outside the area. The study estimated that the losses accounted for around 10 per cent of the total wages bill. It put the remuneration effect at Pounds 63m. Tourism and business travel: The estimated income gained by the Greater Manchester area from spending by overseas tourists travelling through the airport was put at Pounds 50m. It was possible, the study found, to calculate the total direct and indirect effects of tourist spending in Greater Manchester at Pounds 72m. Capital projects: The income effect of the major capital projects at the airport: the second terminal, the maintenance hangar and a reservations office was put at Pounds 61m. Induced investment and development: The location of the airport is thought to have acted as a magnet for investment in the Greater Manchester area. Inward, the industrial promotion agency for the north-west identified the airport as one of the region's key attractions for investors and it became a main plank in its marketing strategy. However, apart from mentioning one or two individual investments such as the Siemens Pounds 15m regional headquarters in Didsbury, the study did not attempt to quantify the flow of inward investment. It says: 'There is insufficient information available to attempt to quantify the proportion of regional income and employment that has been induced by the airport's role in the local economy.' Therefore, the total income effect of the airport was Pounds 250m. Other bits and pieces about income can be gleaned from different reports. For example, a paper by the Airports Association International Council which claims to represent 150 airports worldwide, says Manchester airport in 1991 contributed Ecu30m (Dollars 35m) in tax to the UK government. Mr Carr says: 'At a rough guess I would imagine you would have to double our figures for today. What is impossible to calculate is the amount of foreign investment that might flow in as Manchester becomes a top international airport. Much publicity has been given to the British Council moving to the city centre and Siemens going to a business park close to the airport, but these could be the tip of the iceberg.'</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Letter: New regime will not fill lorries Sir, The removal of cabotage restrictions on international hauliers, allowing them greater freedom to compete in European Community national markets, is undoubtedly a welcome development ('EC agrees on road charges for hauliers', June 21). Efficiency gains in the haulage sector will bring both economic and environmental benefits. Yet it would be unwise to count on the elimination of the one in three goods vehicles which are quoted in your report as running empty. In the mid-1980s I led a study co-sponsored by the Department of Transport and the Chartered Institute of Transport, in which we concluded that the overwhelming reason for empty running was the imbalance of trade flows, with cabotage restrictions being a relatively minor factor. While trade imbalances endure, then so will lorries on the road with nothing in them.

Prime Minister Tzannis  Tzannetakis, who will act as caretaker prime minister until a new government is  sworn in, said he expects elections Nov. 5. The unprecedented coalition of  conservatives and Communists was formed in July with the sole aim of lifting  immunity from prosecution for former Socialist ministers suspected of  wrongdoing in a series of scandals and sending them to trial on corruption  charges.  </P></p>

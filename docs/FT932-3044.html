			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Banker to the bankers: A powerful and secretive institution On the second Tuesday of every month, 13 central bankers meet in the sleepy Swiss town of Basle to review the monthly accounts of the Bank for International Settlements, one of the world's most powerful and secretive banks. The general manager, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, admits that the gathering, in the bank's nuclear-attack-proof 1970s headquarters, is usually a formality and rarely lasts more than 15 minutes. The bankers say their main reason for the trip is for the other meetings held there, during which they discuss weighty issues of monetary policy and the health of the financial system. However, the 15-minute meetings are crucial, since the revenues from the bank pay for all the other activities and the sumptuous meals and rural excursions that make the sojourn more pleasant. The BIS, set up in 1930 to recycle German first world war reparations back to Germany as government loans, is, in the words of Mr Lamfalussy, a mixture of arcane traditions and banking strength. But it has come to play a pivotal role in the world's financial affairs, through a combination of secrecy, financial strength and technical expertise. Tucked away at the back of its latest 230-page report on global monetary conditions and international banking supervision are the balance sheet and profit-and-loss account. They show that last year the BIS paid a record SFr240 dividend from record profits of Dollars 271m, while its balance sheet expanded at an unprecedentedly fast rate. The location of the figures reflects the banking department's shy public posture. The BIS is the central banks' bank - 84 per cent of its shares are owned by 33 central banks, with the balance held by private shareholders. The glare of the limelight would not be conducive to its business. 'The main banking activity of the BIS is to help the reserve management of central banks,' Mr Lamfalussy says. This means that central banks place substantial amounts of their foreign exchange reserves with the BIS, normally on very short-term deposit. 'Between 85 and 90 central banks deal with the BIS,' he added. 'Our share in world foreign exchange reserves is normally around 10 per cent.' At the end of March, the BIS held Dollars 106bn of deposits from central banks - 60 per cent in dollars - 28 per cent more than the previous year. In winning this business, the BIS was competing with commercial banks and the direct placement of central bank funds in money market instruments. According to Mr Lamfalussy, the BIS's success stems from its liquidity and its discretion. When there is uncertainty in foreign exchange markets, central banks need to know they have instant access to their reserves, in case they have to intervene in the markets. 'If a central bank rings up at 4pm and asks for Dollars 2bn, we can give it to them immediately,' Mr Lamfalussy said. 'No other bank can do that.' The BIS's financial skills and liquidity were put to the test during the instability which rocked the European exchange rate mechanism last year. Central banks sold an estimated DM188bn, mostly for dollars, between June and December to try to reduce upward pressure on the D-Mark. At the height of the crisis, between August and the end of October, central bank deposits at the BIS increased by almost Dollars 27bn. If central banks had placed these funds directly into the money markets, speculators would have found it even easier to work out what the banks had been up to. The BIS also lends to central banks in an emergency. Mr Lamfalussy hinted that central banks whose D-Mark reserves were running low because of sales of the German currency, may have borrowed some from the BIS during the ERM debacle, before rebuilding reserves through a bond issue or currency swap. He added that the BIS pays an interest rate on central banks' deposits below commercial bank rates but above treasury bill rates (government-issued securities). It then makes a small profit by placing these funds on deposit with the most financially secure commercial banks or in government securities. Central banks accept a low rate of interest because of the BIS's balance sheet strength, which guarantees the security of their deposits. But assessing its net worth is complicated: it admits using unusual accounting techniques and undervaluing and hiding some assets. The BIS has built up gold and currency reserves worth Dollars 4.3bn, expressed in the quaint convention of gold francs, a monetary unit invented by the BIS and used exclusively by it. When translating currencies into gold francs, the BIS uses a fixed gold price of Dollars 208 an ounce, well below the current market price of about Dollars 365, which means that one gold franc is equivalent to Dollars 1.94. At the end of March, the BIS's published capital and reserves in gold and currencies were GFr1.75bn (Dollars 4.3bn). But several more calculations are required to arrive at a more accurate measure of the bank's financial strength. As Mr Lamfalussy said, its assets are 'substantially more than that'. One disguised source of wealth is its 'miscellaneous account', an unusual balance sheet classification. Unrealised gains and losses on its holdings of currencies and securities are taken through the miscellaneous account, which stood at the equivalent of Dollars 2.9bn at the end of last year. Many banks would include all of that in their capital and reserves. In addition, the BIS owns and occupies a 21-storey office block in Basle, and owns several acres of prime property around it. This is all valued in its balance sheet at GFr1. Total net assets could be as high as Dollars 9bn. Even though central banks and shareholders recognise that its strong balance sheet is the key to its ability to do what they want, they cast a covetous eye on the gold, cash and real estate. Some central bankers believe the BIS is over-capitalised and should return part of its capital to its shareholders in the form of a special dividend. Such a suggestion is anathema to Mr Lamfalussy. The BIS, he said, must have sufficient capital to borrow and lend billions in the time it takes for a central bank governor to raise his eyebrow.</p>

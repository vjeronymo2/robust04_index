			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Govett &amp; Co shows advance to Dollars 22.8m PRE-TAX profits at Govett &amp; Co, the fund management company, rose 23 per cent to Dollars 22.8m (Pounds 15m) in the six months to June 30, compared with Dollars 18.5m. Last year's figures have been adjusted to reflect a change in accounting policy at the group's US insurance subsidiary. Income from the institutional fund management and mutual fund business grew from Dollars 6.34m to Dollars 8.37m, helped by stronger stock markets, increased mutual fund sales in the US and the launch of a new investment trust. Total funds under management are now Dollars 5bn, of which about Dollars 1.5bn represents retail money. London Pacific, the US insurance subsidiary, reported more than doubled income of Dollars 8.24m (Dollars 3.36m), although Dollars 4m of that represented one-off capital gains. Total assets at London Pacific are now more than Dollars 800m. Income from the venture capital arm fell from Dollars 3.7m to Dollars 3.41m. Govett said that growing fee business was offset by lower placement volumes. Investment income fell back to Dollars 4.19m (Dollars 6.69m) as a result of lower interest rates and the company's programme of buying back about 11m shares since mid-1992. The buy-back programme, by reducing the amount of cash held in Jersey, has also resulted in an increased tax charge to Dollars 5.73m (Dollars 2.74m). Fully diluted earnings per share were 25.4 cents (20.3 cents) and the interim dividend is increased 5.3 per cent from 9.5 cents to 10 cents. The company recently announced the acquisition of a US trust company and said it hoped to get a quote on the US Nasdaq exchange shortly.</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRACTICAL ALTERNATIVES TO JAIL'S FAST SHUFFLE  </P> <P> The local manifestation of the nationwide epidemic of overcrowded jails,  prisons and juvenile facilities became evident recently when Los Angeles County  Sheriff Sherman Block was forced, under federal court order, to increase the  number of early releases of county prisoners.  </P> <P> News of the announcement was accompanied by a disturbing photograph. It showed  a just-released inmate, a smile on his face, who had served his 14-day county  jail sentence in 14 hours -- or at the rate of 2 1/2 minutes on the hour.  </P> <P> Confronted with jail sentences shortened because of overcrowding, law-abiding  citizens must wonder what kind of justice we have anymore. They must sense that  overcrowding is undermining the only weapon the courts can use to protect the  community -- the threat of criminal sanction.  </P> <P> Criminal sanction is the "cost" that society attaches to crime to make it  unrewarding to criminals. When the cost of a crime has to be reduced so much  that a 14-day jail sentence can be served in 14 hours, what message is sent?  The obvious message to criminals is that their crimes won't cost them much at  all.  </P> <P> With no end in sight to the serious jail overcrowding problem, it is time that  the community look to new criminal sanctions that can protect its citizens and  satisfy the demands of justice without depending on scarce jail beds. Jail may  be where most citizens want criminals to be, but that is not reality today.  There is just not enough space to hold any but the most dangerous and violent  criminals. New sanctions, strong enough to deter, are needed for criminals who  are released early -- or do not go to jail at all -- because of overcrowding.  </P> <P> But if new sanctions are not found and used, a never-ending cycle of greater  overcrowding and earlier release will embolden confirmed criminals to continue  committing crimes, while failing to discourage would-be criminals.  </P> <P> Which new sanctions are needed? Examples include "house arrest," electronic  monitoring of criminals confined to their homes on probation; "work  sentencing," using supervised crews of probationers sentenced to work improving  community buildings, parks, roads and other public areas, or "work furlough," a  program in which employed probationers work their regular jobs by day and are  sentenced to stay in a contracted residential center by night.  </P> <P> Sanctions like these are obviously not appropriate for every criminal. Violent  offenders and habitual criminals belong in jail or prison. But for petty  criminals and even many non-violent felons, such sanctions are not only  appropriate but needed. They help to mitigate the jail overcrowding crisis by  imposing penalties right in the community. They attach a cost to crime that is  more demanding than just sitting in jail for a few hours. Coupled with a  beefed-up, quick-to-respond surveillance capability, these community-based  sanctions are effective, tough and affordable.  </P> <P> For the past five years the Los Angeles County Probation Department, with money  and personnel provided by the Board of Supervisors, has been developing and  testing such sanctions. The probation department has been working more closely  than ever with police and prosecutors to develop stronger, more responsive  surveillance. The department has created a joint surveillance capability with  the police so that now, in selected areas of the county, patrol officers as  well as probation officers enforce court orders on probationers. With the  district attorney, the department acts to move violent and dangerous criminals  out of the community and into state prison immediately if they violate the law  again.  </P> <P> Necessary as new sanctions and police-probation-legal partnerships are, they  are not easy to create and operate when money and staff are greatly limited.  The probation department has had to shift resources and staff to create special  sanction programs, but they are worth it. They not only provide clear and  immediate penalties, they do so at a cost far less than that of incarceration  -- and with deterrent results and victim benefits greater than jail can  provide.  </P> <P> It is unlikely that policy-makers will fund alternatives to incarceration as  long as they believe that their constituents accept confinement as the only  appropriate sanction for crime. In fact, any alternative is all too easy to  reject because dollars spent for these programs are like an investment. The  return (reduction of crime rate) is not achieved during the current budget  year. On the other hand, jails and prisons, though far more expensive, are easy  to point to as evidence of a strong committment to solving the crime problem.  </P> <P> Recent RAND Corp. research has demonstrated that local corrections can be more  effective than prison in reducing recidivism. The research is there, the  expertise of the local corrections staff is there, but the political will to  fund these community sanctions is not there.  </P> <P> Effective sanction programs, "prisons without walls," must have community  support. Faced with the jail overcrowding crisis, the community needs to decide  how to best protect itself from crime. Do we want to continue to base  expectations for criminal sanctions on jails that are no longer available  except for the most dangerous criminals? Or should we begin to base  expectations for criminal correction programs on corrections that are readily  available and that can effectively improve protection for the community?  </P> <P> By deciding to develop community-based sanctions, we can reserve jail for those  who really need it and still attach a real cost to crime.  </P></p>

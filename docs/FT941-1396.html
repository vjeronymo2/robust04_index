			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Builders' imports 'rise' Imports of building materials are starting to rise as construction output increases, a survey of more than 100 material producers says today. The Council of Building Material Producers' survey echoes government concerns over Britain's building material trade deficit which ministers say remains too high in spite of a sharp decline in construction output in the recession. The council says that more than a third of building material producers questioned said imports accounted for more than 10 per cent of domestic market sales. This compared with 28 per cent of companies in September and 20 per cent in February 1993, making it the third consecutive survey to report an increase in import penetration, the council says. It was accompanied by a slow thaw in the UK construction market with 87 per cent of companies expecting to increase output during this year. Exports, which had increased during the domestic recession, are being maintained but are no longer rising because of a downturn in continental European markets. By comparison UK construction activity is forecast to rise by up to 2 per cent this year. At the end of last year a task force of construction customers, contractors and producers was established by the industry in a bid to reduce the annual trade deficit. This move was supported by the Department of the Environment.</p>

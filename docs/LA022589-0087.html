			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW CHP CHIEF URGES PLAN TO AVERT TRAGEDY  </P> <P> Maurice J. Hannigan, the new commissioner of the California Highway Patrol,  warned Friday of traffic congestion and public safety problems beyond "our  wildest imagination" in the 1990s unless plans are made to avoid them.  </P> <P> Hannigan, 48, issued the warning to several hundred CHP officers and civilian  employees shortly after being sworn in as commissioner of the 8,600-member  organization. He succeeds James E. Smith, who retired last month.  </P> <P> Hannigan, a CHP officer for 25 years who was Smith's deputy for the last five,  said California's expected swift growth during the coming decade is among the  challenges facing the patrol.  </P> <P> "That growth will bring traffic congestion and public safety problems beyond  our wildest imagination, unless we plan and prepare for it now," Hannigan said.  </P> <P> He said enforcing the law and educating Californians in the areas of "drunk  driving, speed violations and seat belt usage must remain our highest  priorities if we are to significantly reduce the needless tragedy upon our  highways."  </P> <P> "We must rigidly control the transportation of hazardous materials upon our  highways, overcome urban congestion by working with Caltrans (California  Department of Transportation) and local agencies . . . (and) build upon our  cooperation with allied law enforcement agencies to stem the flow of illicit  drugs and other crimes throughout our state," Hannigan said.  </P> <P> Hannigan, assigned briefly to Los Angeles as a rookie officer in 1965, became  the sixth consecutive up-from-the-ranks patrolman to be appointed commissioner  of the CHP.  </P></p>

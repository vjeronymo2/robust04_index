			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stephe Laufer] </F>   [Text] ANC Treasurer General Thomas Nkobi admitted this  week the organisation was struggling to finance the critical  last 10 weeks of the election campaign. "We are managing to pay  salaries at the moment, but the election is a problem," said  Nkobi. "We have not reached our target of $17-million  (R[rand]58.3-million) in contributions from the international  community, and we are afraid to borrow -- because of course we  would have to pay for it."    The $17-million international fundraising target is believed  to be significantly lower than originally planned. Fundraisers  on both sides of the Atlantic are locked in a battle with the  ANC's chief Washington representative, Lindiwe Mabuza, over  large American campaign donations promised to Nelson Mandela,  but never received by ANC headquarters.    At stake are millions of U.S. dollars. Repeated requests to  Mabuza to transfer the funds, raised during Mandela's U.S. trip  last July, have fallen on deaf ears, say sources in the U.S. and  South Africa.    Mabuza refused this week to discuss the issue when  telephoned  in Washington, saying she was answerable only to the ANC  leadership. "I don't want to discuss this in the media," said  Mabuza. "I don't even know really how much was transferred or  not -- I don't keep the books."    The election cash crunch would be eased, say insiders, if  Mabuza were to transfer almost $500,000 (R1.7-million) in cash  and cheques raised during Nelson Mandela's U.S. trip last July.  A further $1.8- million (R6.2-million) in pledges has also  failed to materialise, because Mabuza has not followed up on the  promises made to Mandela. Mabuza, who has been nominated to a  safe position within the top 102 on the ANC's list for the  national parliament, is understood to be the sole signatory to  the organisation's Washington bank accounts. The $500,000 was  deposited after Mandela's fundraising swing last year, which  took him to New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and other centres.    Asked about his department's difficulties with Mabuza, Nkobi  was unspecific, saying "Nelson Mandela brought about $10,000  (34,300) back with him" after the July U.S. trip, and the "most  of the rest was pledges which are not being fulfilled".    An audit of the ANC's Stockholm office while Mabuza was  chief  representative in Sweden several years ago apparently revealed a  gap of several tens of thousands of Swedish krona between amount  paid by local donors to the ANC and expenditure records kept by  the office.    Confronted over the hole in the till, Mabuza is reported to  have burst into tears, saying she knew nothing about accounting.  Asked about the audit this week, she denied any knowledge of a  cash shortfall, saying: "I am aware there was an audit, but I  was not told that figure was missing."    An attempt to transfer her to Dar es Salaam as chief  representative to Tanzania failed when she successfully lobbied  for the Washington D.C. position. She is said to have an  "inside track" to foreign affairs chief Thabo Mbeki. But far  from winning friends and influencing people in the U.S. capital,  Mabuza is reported to have thrown her lot in with some dubious  Capitol Hill entrepreneurs and put several important noses out  of joint. Sources in the U.S. say she has angered ANC donors  and sympathisers by "trying to hog everything for herself"  rather than leaving fundraising to the professionals.    One American source, who asked to remain anonymous, said she  had failed to prevent turf battles between two ANC-aligned  fundraising operations, and "funds raised have not found their  way back to South Africa".    "There is definite incompetence within the Washington  office,  and it needs better financial controls -- even outside the issue  of fundraising. The fault lies with the organisation at large,"  said a source. A fundraising effort set up to encourage large  tax- deductible contributions from corporate donors and chaired  by Heinz chief Tony O'Rielly, who recently bought a major stake  in South Africa's Argus newspapers, has reportedly been using  its clout to raise funds from traditional ANC donors like  churches and black groups.    Called Safe -- for South Africa Free Elections -- the  organisation was set up with Mandela's blessing and the  involvement of the ANC in an attempt to mobilise U.S. funding  for voter education projects. Pro bono legal services were  provided by former Kennedy aide Theodore Sorensen.    U.S. law makes makes tax-deductible donations to political  parties impossible, and the clear expectation was that Safe  would fund voter education projects close to, but not  organisationally linked to, the ANC. But aside from minor  amounts which have gone to ANC partners within the Patriotic  Front, Safe has ended up supporting voter education projects  beyond the ANC orbit to the tune of at least $1-million  (R3.4-million). Among those receiving support is the Institute  for a Democratic Alternative in South Africa (Idasa).    Considering the use of Mandela's high profile for Safe's  fundraising effort, said one U.S. source, "anger is justified if  ANC-related voter education is not getting the funds". Mabuza  was also instrumental in brokering a contract between the ANC  and former non-voting congressional delegate for Washington D.C.  Walter Fauntroy, for "the provision of public policy, political  action, public relations, mobilisation and other services to  assist the ANC mission to the U.S.".    The initial proposal included a draft first year budget of  $700,000, (R2.4 million) and requested a three-month start-up  planning grant of $230,000 (770,000). Fauntroy was to cover  these costs through fundraising in the U.S., but has not  remitted a cent to the ANC. Instead, the start-up grant has  been lost, putting the ANC more than $230,000 out of pocket.    Mabuza has also pushed other associates at the ANC's  expense,  including one Albert Nellum, who came to South Africa with his  wife, ostensibly because there was an "urgent need" to plan  fundraising events around a tennis match involving Zina  Garrison. Nellum is described as "a very close friend of  Lindiwe and the godfather of Zina Garrison". Mabuza was told  twice by fax not to approve Nellum's visit, but he came anyway,  billing the ANC for his room at the Carlton Hotel and for air  fares for himself and his wife, which he insisted on having  upgraded to business class. Asked to comment on the goings-on  in the Washington D.C. office, an spokesman said: "We don't deal  with election fundraising -- that's the treasurer's and the  election campaign department's responsibility. We have no cause  to be unhappy with our representation in D.C."</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Net tightens round French Republicans: Corruption probes are not only ensnaring the party but could harm the premier Strand by strand, the web of corruption probes ensnaring Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, and his Republican party, is growing thicker. An announcement by the justice ministry on Monday night that it was opening a formal investigation into the funding of the centrist party follows existing allegations of irregularities concerning payments for the minister's holiday villa in Saint Tropez. He is already under pressure to resign, and the latest probe could also drag other party members into the judicial firing line. The implications of Mr Longuet's legal problems, however, extend beyond his position and his party. The affairs are developing into a dilemma for Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, which could undermine his bid for the presidency in next spring's elections. More broadly, they are fuelling pressures for a reform of the relationship between French business groups and political parties. For Mr Balladur, the stakes are high. With his eyes set on next year's elections, he regards Mr Longuet and his Republicans as vital allies in an undeclared battle with his Gaullist rival, Mr Jacques Chirac. The Republican party is the largest element in the UDF, junior partner in the centre-right RPR-UDF government, and could offset Mr Chirac's advantage as head of the Gaullist RPR. The widening scope of the corruption investigation also threatens to tarnish Mr Balladur's government. In addition to Mr Longuet, two other ministers from the Republican party - Mr Francois Leotard, defence minister, and Mr Alain Madelin, minister for enterprises and economic development - were cited in the report by an investigating magistrate which triggered Monday's official inquiry. The report, issued by Mr Reynaud Van Ruymbeke, the magistrate leading the probe into the financing of Mr Longuet's villa, questions how the Republican party received cash payments of about FFr28m (Pounds 3.35m) between 1987 and 1991. It also questions whether the party obtained its Paris headquarters on favourable terms. Mr Leotard and Mr Madelin, like Mr Longuet, strongly deny any wrongdoing and attack the leaking of supposedly confidential investigations. 'Journalists are becoming prosecutors,' said Mr Leotard. The problem for Mr Balladur, however, is that the corruption controversies could damage the image of his government as they did the previous Socialist administration which was bundled from office last year, partly because of a public perception of corruption. Mr Balladur's government has already lost one minister in a corruption case. Mr Alain Carignon, the communications minister, stepped down in July after being placed under investigation for alleged influence peddling in Grenoble, where he is mayor. Several leading businessmen, including the chairmen of Saint Gobain, the glass and building materials company, and Cogedim, the property developer, have also been placed under investigation for alleged fraud. The combined effect of the various corruption investigations has been to increase pressure for a reform of the existing party financing laws and the close links between business and politics. Mr Philippe Seguin, the national assembly president, proposes an all-party study into reforming legislation on the funding of political parties, a move which would have the backing of 90 per cent of the public, according to a Louis Harris poll published on Monday. France has already implemented several reforms of party financing over the past six years. Laws passed in 1988 and 1990 limited the campaign spending of parliamentary candidates to FFr500,000 (Pounds 60,000) and set limits on corporate contributions. There is now pressure, however, for a complete ban on corporate funding. Two senior government politicians, Mr Pierre Mazeaud and Mr Charles Millon, have proposed a bill to ban completely the financing of political campaigns by business groups. Alternatives include a state fund for political expenditure or the creation of German-style foundations to receive corporate contributions and so act as a filter between politicians and companies. Mr Balladur, however, has been reluctant to embark on complex and politically sensitive reforms. He argues that the rise in corruption investigations in recent months reflects a freer hand given to judicial authorities rather than a rise in corruption and that the cases in question date back to the end of the 1980s. He says he is 'convinced that a rigorous application of the law will clean up the situation'. Mr Balladur may be right. But, politically, it is a risky perspective. The prime minister has already drawn criticism for granting Mr Longuet a one month grace period to defend himself against Mr Van Ruymbeke's allegations of irregularities concerning his villa, although he has made it clear he expects the minister to resign if formally charged. Said one senior Chirac supporter: 'Mr Candidate has got the better of Dr Premier.'</p>

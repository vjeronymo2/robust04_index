			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED ARMY GETS A DAY IN SUN TO FLEX ITS MUSCLE;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: THE MILITARY ALSO GETS A CHANCE TO AIR ITS VIEWS ABOUT SECURITY  AND THE UPHEAVALS SPARKED BY PERESTROIKA.  </P> <P> The Soviet military got its day in the sun Wednesday for an impressive flexing  of its military muscle on Red Square and the airing of its views about security  matters and the social upheavals sparked by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's  reforms.  </P> <P> With Gorbachev, who is also Soviet commander in chief, and the Politburo  watching, the military held a spit-and-polish parade outside the Kremlin to  mark both the 45th anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat and the current role of  the armed forces, now under unprecedented attack from radicals, reformers and  local separatists.  </P> <P> Public response to simultaneous Victory Day parades in the independence-minded  Baltic republics -- where the 4-million-strong Soviet armed forces are looked  upon as occupiers rather than wartime liberators by many -- showed the degree  to which opinion is now polarized.  </P> <P> In Riga, Latvia's capital, as many as 10,000 people, many of whom were Russians  or from other non-Latvian ethnic groups, gathered on a river embankment to  cheer the parading soldiers and demonstrate against the republic's declaration  last Friday proclaiming restoration of Latvian independence.  </P> <P> In Lithuania, where Soviet troops have seized buildings and manhandled  deserters since the republic's proclamation of independence from Moscow in  March, youths in the capital city of Vilnius whistled in contempt at the  soldiers and derided them as "occupiers." A group of protesters reportedly  tried to block the parade but were dislodged by paratroopers.  </P> <P> In Estonia, many elected officials shunned their republic's parade.  </P> <P> On a sunny but cool day in Moscow, more than 12,000 troops from the ground  forces, navy, air force, KGB border guards and Interior Ministry high-stepped  across Red Square with eyes trained on the nation's leadership assembled atop  Lenin's mausoleum. That was the same spot where Kremlin leaders were standing  last week when thousands of Muscovites jeered them during the May Day parade.  </P> <P> Rows of T-34 tanks, considered by many Western experts to be the best any  nation produced in World War II, ground across the cobblestones, belching blue  clouds of exhaust fumes, as a tribute to the victors in the Soviets' "Great  Patriotic War."  </P> <P> But the Soviet Union also revealed its newest battle tank and other items of  military hardware never before put on display.  </P> <P> To render further homage to the 27 million Soviets said to have perished in the  four-year struggle against the Nazis, a graying group of World War II veterans,  partisans and underground fighters strode across the cobbles, their medals  gleaming and bouncing off their chests.  </P> <P> To incarnate the Soviet army's vision of itself as a wartime liberator, and not  a subjugator as many Balts or East Europeans would contend, a soldier armed  with a sword stood atop a float, cradling a little girl as if to protect her.  </P> <P> The pair, reproducing the image of a Soviet victory monument in East Berlin,  waited frozen in their poses for at least at hour before the parade got under  way.  </P> <P> Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said veterans it interviewed want the  monument brought home from Berlin's Treptow Park, where it presumably might  disappear in the process of German unification, to be erected in western Moscow  as the Soviet capital's victory monument.  </P> <P> The 30-minute march-past and related ceremonies were interpreted by Moscow  diplomats as the latest of a series of gestures by the Soviet leadership to the  military, which is now seeing its ranks thinned by half a million men. The  armed forces also feel multiplying pressures to cut costs and mounting press  criticism and public opposition as a result of glasnost.  </P> <P> The Victory Day parade, the first since 1985, "is a shot in the arm for those  who want to show their pride," said U.S. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock, who  watched from the VIP gallery.  </P> <P> Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, in a speech before the start of the parade,  voiced the military's concerns over the current course taken by Soviet domestic  and foreign policy, although he explicitly pledged the armed forces' loyalty to  Communist Party policies.  </P> <P> "Under the influence of the deep transformations in the Soviet Union, there  have been positive changes in international life," Yazov said. "Dialogue is  taking the place of confrontation.  </P> <P> "However, these positive changes are not yet irreversible," he said, speaking  from the mausoleum with Gorbachev next to him. "The military danger still  remains. In these conditions, the Soviet Union maintains its defense capability  at the necessary and sufficient level and is carrying out a radical  transformation of its defense structure, all of which constitutes military  reform."  </P> <P> Although Gorbachev had no visible reaction, Yazov's assessment of the  international scene was notably more cautious than the phrasing that the  country's civilian rulers are now using as a May 30 superpower summit in  Washington draws near.  </P> <P> State-run Soviet television, during its live broadcast of the parade, commented  that the world is expecting much from the summit and said the main goal of  Soviet foreign policy is to negotiate a halving of the superpower strategic  arsenals.  </P> <P> Yazov also spoke of the Soviet people's "unshakable faith" in communism and the  "mighty possibilities of the socialist organization of industry and  agriculture." Gorbachev and his allies, in contrast, are stressing the need for  rapid implementation of elements of a capitalist market to rescue the nation's  reeling and shortage-plagued economy.  </P> <P> The defense minister, who is a non-voting member of the Politburo, also voiced  concern over the breakdown in inter-ethnic relations that has fueled resistance  to compulsory military service in the Baltic and Caucasus republics and, in the  case of Armenia and Azerbaijan, led to virtual civil warfare.  </P> <P> "The war convincingly showed the stability of the Soviet state structure, the  indestructibility of the fraternal friendship of the peoples of our country,"  Yazov said. "It confirmed that not apart, not alone, but only in a tight union,  under mutual respect, help and collaboration, can woes and difficulties be  overcome."  </P> <P> According to NATO military attaches, Soviet equipment shown for the first time  Wednesday included a variation of the T-80 tank and the BMD-2 airborne combat  vehicle, which is armed with a tank-killer missile.  </P></p>

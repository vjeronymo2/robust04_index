			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Money Markets: French rates fall THREE month interest rates in France again dipped below those in Germany after the French franc consolidated its strength in the European exchange rate mechanism and the Bundesbank left interest rate policy unchanged, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank decided not to change either its Lombard or discount rates at its council meeting yesterday, but that outcome had been widely predicted by the market. Members of the German central bank's ruling council have expressed concern in the last week about the potential weakness of the D-Mark, the rise in German money supply and the increase in German bond yields. Euromark futures were therefore more-or-less unchanged on the day. The June contract closed unchanged day at 92.49 while the September contract closed 3 basis points higher at 93.30. In the German cash market, call money was slightly softer at 7.80 per cent, from 8.00 per cent earlier in the week. This was mostly due to a greater supply of liquidity to the market and the more relaxed nature of dealing at the start of the month. Three month money was roughly unchanged at 7.55 per cent. By contrast, French cash rates dropped sharply as the franc enjoyed a new bout of strength against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges. Three month French francs fell back to 7.40 per cent from a previous close of 7.60 per cent on the bid side, pushing them below the German level. The September futures contract closed up 14 basis points on the day at 93.20, narrowing the spread between September Pibor and Euromark futures to 10 basis points. Speculation of another base rate cut continued to linger in sterling markets. In the discount market, dealers were wary of offering bills outright to the Bank of England for fear of losing any capital gain if monetary policy is eased. However, difficulties removing the Pounds 1.5bn shortage forecast by the Bank pushed the overnight rate up to 9 per cent yesterday, with late assistance of Pounds 465m. Three-month money closed  1/32 per cent firmer at 5 29/32 per cent. Sterling futures contracts were more-or-less unchanged on the day, but still reflected some bullishness about prospective rate cuts. The September contract closed down 1 basis point at 94.28.</p>

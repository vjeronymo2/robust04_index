			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan reiterated its concern  Friday [3 June] over North Korea's defiance of international  calls for inspections of its nuclear reactor and suspicions that  Pyongyang is trying to develop atomic weapons.    "We are deeply concerned about this situation," Chief  Government Spokesman Hiroshi Kumagai said at a news conference.  "We would like to weigh what action to take in close concert  with the countries involved such as the United States, South  Korea and China."    A government source said Japan will act in concert with  Washington in case the U.S. and China fail to resolve  differences over UN sanctions against Pyongyang. "Although we  talk with China, too, Japan-U.S. relations are the basis of our  policy," the source said.    On Thursday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  said the North Korean refusal to let inspectors conduct an  unimpeded check of fuel rods removed from a suspect nuclear  reactor has made it impossible to verify whether Pyongyang  diverted plutonium in the past to manufacture atomic bombs.    Hans Blix, the IAEA director general, said in a letter to  the  UN Security Council that the Vienna-based agency "cannot achieve  the overall objective of comprehensive safeguards...namely to  provide assurance about the nondiversion of nuclear material."</p>

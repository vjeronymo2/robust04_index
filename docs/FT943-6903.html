			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Slow but sure pension sea-change: Long-term movement in policies' popularity At first sight the new business figures released by the Association of British Insurers yesterday are like gently rolling English countryside, generally flat but with some slight valleys. On closer inspection, however, they reveal longer-term changes which have a more significant influence on the personal pensions and life insurance landscape. There are three trends which are highlighted by the figures for the second quarter of this year - the shift from regular to single premium policies, a move away from products which are not linked to equity investments, and a marked decline in sales through home collections. The reluctance of customers to take on long-term commitments is behind the trend towards single-premium policies. The number of yearly premium life insurance policies has been falling since 1991, when 5.29m were taken out. About 4.64m were taken out last year. The total is fewer than 2m for the first half of this year. Numbers of regular premium personal pensions have similarly fallen, from 1.56m in 1991 to 1.28m last year. Only about 563,000 have been sold in the first six months of this year. By contrast, sales of single premium life insurance policies have held up rather better. Although the 276,000 policies and Pounds 2.4bn new premiums for the second quarter are below the comparable figures for the second quarter last year, they are higher than the equivalent figures in 1991. This changing balance between regular and single premium policies has been apparent from the new business figures reported from large life insurers such as Legal &amp; General. Further below the surface has been the shift towards 'linked' policies in the types of investment that are preferred by customers, which is revealed by the ABI statistics. Linked policies - which can be life insurance products or pensions - are policies where part of the premiums buy investment units, for example in an equity or property portfolio, which are managed by a fund manager. Their value can fluctuate but there is the prospect of higher returns to make up for the risk that the value when the policy reaches maturity will be lower than the payout from a conventional policy. Non-linked policies are generally invested in gilts or deposits, where both the risk and potential returns are lower, but the value of the policy is raised by bonuses from the profits of the fund during the course of its life, culminating in a terminal bonus. The ABI figures show that the steepest falls in business in a comparison between the second quarter of this year and last year have been in non-linked policies. New premiums from linked annual and single-premium individual pensions and from linked single-premium life insurance were broadly similar in the period from April to the end of June in 1993 and 1994, but premiums in non-linked products in the same categories fell by up to 35 per cent from their 1993 levels. The figures also confirm a clear shift in how life insurance is sold. Policies sold through the 'industrial branch' - where a sales agent calls once every two weeks or so at the home of a customer to collect what are often relatively small premiums - have plummeted. At 201,000 policies and Pounds 28m new premium income for the second quarter, both sets of numbers are now less than half the equivalent just two years ago. Concerns among life companies such as Prudential about the cost of collecting premiums from customers' homes mean that industrial branch business is likely to continue to diminish. Customers' fears about job prospects are likely to mean that the shift away from regular premium products is likely to continue so long as memories of the most recent recession remain fresh. Life companies must hope that the trend to linked policies, which the ABI says shows a confidence in the life companies' investment performance, is similarly persistent to offset the other changes.</p>

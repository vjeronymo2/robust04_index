			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Bosnian minister campaigns for US hearts and minds WHEN Haris Silajdzic, the indefatigable foreign minister of Bosnia-Hercegovina, arrived in Washington last month, he had one aim: to jolt the US out of its indifference towards the violence and ethnic fighting in his country. For nearly a year, the US has relied on the European Community to shoulder the burden of the war in the former republics of Yugoslavia. The tall and dapper Mr Silajdzic, 47, has changed all that. 'James Baker (US secretary of state) agreed to meet Silajdzic,' a US state department official said. 'Baker had already been briefed many times by Larry Eagleburger, and Brent Scowcroft, both of whom were diplomats in Belgrade in the 1960s and had close connections with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Silajdzic had a lot of work to do, a lot of records to put straight. . . . Baker didn't know what hit him last month.' The official said Mr Silajdzic spelt out to the secretary of state how Serbia was trying to destabilise Bosnia's newly-won independence, and how both Croatia and Serbia were conniving to divide Bosnia. His sensitivity towards ethnic problems and the dangers they bring was fostered during his university days at Pristina, the capital of the province of Kosovo, whose ethnic Albanian majority has long been in conflict with its Serbian overlords. Before his appointment to the foreign ministry in 1990, Mr Silajdzic was an academic in Sarajevo. His speciality is international relations. 'Silajdzic impressed upon Baker that this was no local war in a far away place. He argued that the Balkans could go up in flames, involving Greece and Turkey, two Nato allies,' another US official said. Mr Silajdzic returned to Washington 10 days ago, with considerable difficulty. Serb irregulars and the Yugoslav federal army have been allowing no one in, or out of, Sarajevo airport. Capitalising on his growing friendship with Mr Baker, the Bosnian foreign minister then started swinging the American media behind him. His articulate manner, helped by his impeccable English which he learned while doing a doctorate in the US, put Bosnia-Hercegovina and its Moslems on the map. He has also won much support among the tens of thousands of Moslem refugees who have sought refuge in neighbouring Croatia. 'He is a kind man, and a great man,' said Mr Shefko Cengic, a 32-year-old refugee from Sarajevo. 'Let's hope American support is backed by deeds as well.'</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Tough trading flattens profit at Guinness TOUGH conditions in important markets and higher interest costs made for flat interim profits at Guinness, the international drinks group. Sir Anthony Tennant, chairman, said: 'Recession remains obstinately present in many major markets.' As a result, growth in the group, with 85 per cent of sales outside the UK, would not match that of the recent past. Pre-tax profit more than doubled between 1987 and 1991. Pre-tax profit inched ahead to Pounds 353m, compared with Pounds 350m, on sales up 5 per cent to Pounds 1.75bn. Trading profit advances of 7 per cent in spirits and 16 per cent in brewing were offset by Pounds 30m of extra interest payments related to acquisitions. Sir Anthony said profits of the companies purchased were biased towards the second half. Profits would also be protected by cost-cutting. As a show of confidence in the group's longer-term prospects, the interim dividend was pushed up 10 per cent to 3.35p. This was covered 3.8 times by diluted earnings per share of 12.6p, up from 12.3p. The spirits division, United Distillers, increased trading profit from Pounds 283m to Pounds 303m on sales of Pounds 981m, up 6 per cent. This included Pounds 4m profit and Pounds 95m sales from acquisitions made in the second half of last year, including Glenmore Distilleries in the US which enabled rationalisation of US operations. Mr Anthony Greener, chief executive and chairman designate, said there had been a downturn in Japan 'in the high end of the bar trade' because of cuts in corporate entertainment. The UK spirits market fell 10 per cent. The recession's effects were 'made worse by what the government has done on duty'. The total raised by the Treasury was falling - 'diminishing returns' had set in, he said. Brewing raised profits from Pounds 94m to Pounds 109m on a slower sales increase to Pounds 761m. Margins were helped by cost-cutting and investment in more efficient plant. Extensive reorganisation was taking place in Spain after the acquisition of Cruzcampo and Union Cervecera. Net debt of Pounds 1.73bn compared with Pounds 1.5bn in June 1991, but was down from the year-end Pounds 1.8bn through cash generation. The contribution from LVMH, the French luxury goods group in which Guinness has a 24 per cent stake, fell from Pounds 44m to Pounds 40m because of increased interest costs following the conversion of loan stock.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slobodan Jarcevic, foreign minister of the </F> republic of Serb Krajina, by unidentified correspondent in  Belgrade -- live]    [Excerpts] [Reporter] Good day, or better to say, good  evening!    [Jarcevic] Good evening! [passage omitted]    [Reporter] To return to the Serbian-Croatian normalization  agreement, a document that only expresses a will and desire to  normalize the relations, and constitutes no treaty or anything  similar. You have already spoken a bit about this document,  finding in it your place as an independent country that will, in  a certain historic moment, decide where and with whom it wants  to live, observing the political will of the people to the  greatest possible extent. Therefore, how do you perceive what  is being called the interpretation of this document, the  interpretation venturing into the sphere of mutual recognition  and the establishment of economic and transportation links.    [Jarcevic] The interpretation of this agreement coming from  Zagreb should worry us. However, we are used to this as the  Croats never speak about the events and their relations with the  republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] and other countries  realistically. They always express their wishes and many people  have noticed that this is only a dream of the Croatian  politicians.    [Reporter] However, I was listening to television last  night, I cannot recall exactly which channel it was, to a man  who, as I understood it, is envisaged to be the chief of the  Croatian bureau in Belgrade, who was stating precisely that the  Serbs and the Croats have had enough of mourning clothes and  ruins and spoke very calmly, I would say, without any  aggravation or stubbornness, or any dwelling on those well-known  stories about bits of territories of this or another country.    [Jarcevic] Mr. Markovic is right when he says that both  sides have had enough of war, bloodshed, destruction, and the  decreasing standard of living on both sides. He is right, and I  have nothing to add here. However, Mr. Markovic, if he  represents the government in Zagreb, could have eliminated all  this a few months earlier, in February 1993, when a RSK  delegation offered Croatia the establishment of transport,  railroad, and postal links, the use of oil pipelines, and  everything else that is in the interests of the Republic of  Croatia. Without this it cannot consolidate itself and get its  economy and its society back on their feet. What is preventing  the Croats from accomplishing all these goals is an agreement  that they must sign with the RSK representatives. [passage  omitted]    The Croats have rejected signing any sort of agreement in  this sense with the RSK government as everybody would know that  this would mean a signature between two countries. Croatia was  in a dilemma whether to recognize us or not. It has decided not  to recognize us and not to sign any agreements, hoping to now  sign such agreements with the FRY [Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia]. However, this is illusionary. Croatia will sign  with the FRY only the agreements that regard the territory, the  economy, and all the rest, of the FRY. Everything that should  be regulated on the RSK territory, Croatia must anyway sign with  the RSK government. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Mr. Jarcevic, you are a member of the present RSK  government. The presidential elections have just ended. It is  well known that this post went to Milan Martic. Regarding the  events relating to the constitution of the assembly, can you  briefly tell us when the constituting session of the assembly,  the election of the government, and everything else are  envisaged?    [Jarcevic] I believe that the assembly will convene next  week already and that the new president, Mr. Milan Martic, will  entrust the mandate to one of the politicians who originates  from the RSK. It is certain that the reconstruction of the  government will take place. It is impossible for it to remain  in its present makeup, because the president has announced that  he would employ more people in the state administration for it  to be more efficient. Namely, what has hindered the RSK's  development was precisely the lack of efficient administration.  You know that the Republic of Croatia has inherited almost the  entire state administration and other institutions on the RSK  territory, for example, there was not a single archive center.  This means that, for decades, the Croatian leaders in the  former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] have been  deliberately taking away from the Serbian ethnic territories  anything that resembled an attribute of a state.    [Reporter] Therefore, it will be a major task to put all  this in order?    [Jarcevic] There will be a lot of work and I think that  President Martic intends to invite numerous cadres who have  sought refuge in the FRY into the administration, economy,  police, and the army.    [Reporter] Thank you very much.</p>

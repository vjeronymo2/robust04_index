			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- In an exclusive  telephone interview with a UNIAN correspondent yesterday,  Vitaliy Masol stated that he is not sure whether his candidacy  for the post of prime minister will be submitted for examination  by Ukraine's Supreme Council on 15 June. Speaking about the  probability of a group of deputies blocking this election  because they fundamentally disagree with electing a government  before the presidential election, Vitaliy Masol noted: "We are  always searching for something -- to begin with, how to block  the election of people's deputies, then [how to block] the  elections to local bodies of power and the presidential  election. If the reason for the protests is my candidacy, then  I, unlike many people, am not striving for power, because I know  what it is and what state the economy is in now."    Vitaliy Masol is convinced that the government should be  elected without delay, because it is possible that a president  will not be elected on 26 June, and the situation could be  repeated in the second round as well. He agreed with the  reasons of some politicians who believe that the election of a  prime minister now is a risky affair, because a candidate could  be proposed by Leonid Kravchuk, but Kuchma could come to power.  But he is convinced that it is not permissible to delay the  formation of the government for another two months.    In Vitaliy Masol's opinion, the prime minister should head  the government, and not the president. "If we truly want to  have an independent legal democratic Ukraine, then we should not  do what we did in the last two years: We lost power and the  governance of the state, and no one knows who is responsible for  what." Vitaliy Masol declined to assess the actions of the  government, led by Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, observing that "the  newspapers publish everything anyway."    Vitaliy Masol maintained that he will not be taking part in  the 14 June discussion of the report by Yukhym Zvyahilskyy on  the government's activity for moral and ethical reasons, because  he does not want to repeat the mistaken practice of those who,  while approaching power, criticized their predecessors. With  regard to an action program, he observed that it is the affair  of the government as a whole, and it will have to be elaborated  together, and not with one person governing, "as happens now."    "In the event that I am elected, I will rely above all on  balance and predictions, as is the practice throughout the  world. The government must know how much breadgrain it has and  whether it will be able to feed its people. Those who are  against a planned economy have evidently never worked in such a  system. I have devoted many years to this and know that there  really is much in it which is not required, and if I were asked  to head the state planning now, I would not agree to do it,"  Vitaliy Masol said.    In answer to a question about whether he would include in  his  team any of those whose candidacies for this post have recently  been discussed, Vitaliy Masol replied that it is possible, and  maybe even more than one of them, but he maintained that above  all this would proceed from the point of view of their  professionalism, experience, and understanding of the situation.  He also expressed the conviction that young people should enter  the government.</p>

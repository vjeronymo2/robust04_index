			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' The agency has considered the impacts of this rulemaking action and has determined that this action is not ``significant'' within the meaning of the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. NHTSA has further determined that the effects of this rulemaking are so minimal that preparation of a full preliminary regulatory evaluation is not warranted. The agency believes that manufacturers will be minimally affected by this rulemaking because it simply permits new designs in infant restraints and does not require any design change or impose additional costs on manufacturers. Manufacturers that do not want to manufacture an infant restraint that can change adjustment positions will not be affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The agency knows of fourteen manufacturers of child restraints, seven of which NHTSA considers to be small businesses (including Kolcraft, which with an estimated 500 employees, is on the borderline of being a small business). These businesses do not comprise a substantial number of small entities that are affected by this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regardless of the number of small businesses, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on these entities. The rule will affect manufacturers only if they choose to manufacture an infant restraint that can change adjustment positions in Standard 213's dynamic test. The amendment may benefit manufacturers by allowing them to manufacture and sell a new product. However, based on manufacturers' responses to the NPRM, it does not appear that manufacturers other than Century will manufacture and sell such a product. The amendment may provide benefits to apnea-prone children by allowing manufacturers to produce an infant restraint that can position these children in a manner more appropriate for their condition. However, the agency does not have information to estimate those possible benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Small organizations and governmental jurisdictions procure infant restraints for programs such as loaner programs. NHTSA does not believe the costs of infant restraints will be increased by this rule. Thus, these entities will not be significantly affected by this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and the agency has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act. The agency has determined that implementation of this action will not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Safety Act; 15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the state requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 105 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 571_[AMENDED]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the foregoing, NHTSA amends 49 CFR part 571 as set forth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> NO ON AIR AMBULANCE  </P> <P> A hearing examiner has recommended that Los Angeles city officials reject a bid  by the Fire Department to operate a 24-hour air-ambulance service from a ridge  above the Hollywood sign in the Hollywood Hills.  </P> <P> In a report to the city Planning Commission, hearing examiner Charles Rausch on  Tuesday recommended that the department's request for a permit be denied until  a study is conducted to determine the effect of helicopter noise on nearby  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission will consider the report Sept. 6.  </P> <P> Fire officials, who respond to air-ambulance calls from Van Nuys Airport, want  to operate a permanent, centrally located heliport at Mt. Lee that would serve  the entire city. Many Hollywood Hills residents, however, have complained that  noise from the operation would be intolerable and have urged the department to  find a location away from residential neighborhoods.  </P></p>

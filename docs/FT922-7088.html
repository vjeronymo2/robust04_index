			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Japan may face dumping duties on vans in US THE US Commerce Department yesterday ruled that Japanese carmakers have sold minivans in US markets at less than fair value. In a ruling which clears the way for punitive duties on Japanese minivan imports, the Commerce Department said Mazda sold minivans below fair value by 12.70 per cent. Preliminary estimates had put the dumping level at 7.19 per cent. Toyota was found to have underpriced its minivans by 6.75 per cent; the preliminary dumping estimate was 0.95 per cent. All other vehicles were found to have been underpriced by 9.88 per cent, up from 4.23 per cent in the preliminary investigation. The department makes the estimates on the basis of a fair market value formula. The complaint now moves to the US International Trade Commission, which is expected to rule by the last week in June on whether the alleged dumping has hurt US industry. An ITC spokesman said a finding of injury was by no means 'a foregone conclusion'. Before dumping duties can be imposed, the US carmakers must prove they have been hurt as a result of the 'dumped' minivans rather than the recession or American preferences for Japanese vehicles. Injury has been found more often than not in dumping complaints. The big three US car companies - GM, Ford and Chrysler - asked for the dumping investigation a year ago. They said Japanese minivan exports to the US had soared to Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 670m) in 1990. They asked for dumping duties of almost 30 per cent. After the Commerce Department issued its preliminary findings, Japanese carmakers raised prices and the US carmakers' share of the minivan market increased, analysts said. Mazda and Toyota are the big sellers in the US minivan market. Mitsubishi's sales volume is considered minimal, and Nissan discontinued minivan sales in the US.</p>

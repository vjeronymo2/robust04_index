			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Oleksandr Yehorov, deputy head of the </F> Employment and Job Market Administration, by Volodymyr Oliynyk,  under the rubric "How To Be Bankrupt"; place and date not given:  "The Labor Ministry's Move Against Unemployment"--first  paragraph is MOLOD UKRAYINY introduction]    [Text] As we know, in anticipation of the structural  reorganization of the economy this year, Ukraine's Ministry of  Labor drafted a National Public Works Program. In connection  with this measure, our correspondent met with Oleksandr Yehorov,  deputy head of the Employment and Job Market Administration.    [Oliynyk] Mr. Yehorov, what is the goal of the National  Public Works Program?    [Yehorov] First, this program was drawn up as part of the  effort to implement one of the points of the government's action  plan for 1994. Second, this is the first time that such a  program has been drafted as a separate document. Third, the  program is designed to provide work for those left without jobs  as a result of the structural reorganization of the economy and  to avert landslide unemployment due to mass layoffs.    [Oliynyk] Can we regard the National Public Works Program as  a panacea in the struggle against unemployment?    [Yehorov] I would not put it that way. This program should  we  viewed as part of a complex of measures aimed at overcoming the  negative phenomena of mass unemployment. Its implementation is  closely linked with the implementation of the state and  territorial employment programs for 1994 and subsequent years.  Actually, what this means is carrying out measures within the  framework of the principal document--the National Employment  Program.    [Oliynyk] What kind of public works does the program  foresee?    [Yehorov] We concluded that the labor force made available  by  layoffs should be employed primarily on priority  undertakings--i.e., projects and facilities that serve the vital  needs of the people and improve the social infrastructure. First  and foremost, this applies to such important economic complexes  as the agrarian, transportation, and housing and public  utilities sectors. For example, such large projects as the  construction and reconstruction of the trans-European highway  including the creation of a complete transportation  infrastructure: Germany--Poland--Ukraine--Russia and Central  Europe--central Ukraine--the Near East; the construction of  plants to manufacture building materials. Incidentally, all  these projects are long-term and not limited to 1994 and 1995.    [Oliynyk] This is a very large task, and one need not be a  specialist to understand that this requires a very large number  of people and a very large amount of money? [punctuation as  published]    [Yehorov] Your observation is very true, and I will respond  to it. In light of the variable nature of the situation in the  job market and given the crisis conditions that mark the  development of this situation, scientific estimates indicate  that in 1994 there will be 2.4 million people without work, of  whom 1.5 million will have unemployed status. Let me remind you  that in 1993, there were only 275,000 people who were not  working and only 78,000 with unemployed status. As to funds,  estimates show that we will need at least 52.6 billion  karbovantsi (in July 1993 prices) for regional projects alone.  The total cost of implementing the measures provided for in the  program will amount to nearly a billion karbovantsi in 1994.    [Oliynyk] Would it not be better to use this money to  support  unprofitable enterprises or simply for paying out unemployment  benefits?    [Yehorov] Of course not. Structural reorganization is a  painful operation, but once it is over, we will have a sound  economy. As far as the cost of organizing and implementing the  National Public Works Program is concerned, despite the fact  that it is obviously a loss-making proposition, it will  ultimately relieve social tensions--to begin with, because  people will have work, and secondly--and this is very  important--the state will get the main highways it so badly  needs and the housing and public utilities infrastructure will  be improved, inasmuch as the state has never had enough  resources to get around to the construction and ordering of the  latter.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Action agreed over frontiers - French plan for pan-European security conference is accepted / FT writers report on the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels A French proposal for a pan-European security conference dealing with minority rights and border problems in the former communist bloc won broad endorsement at the Brussels summit yesterday. EU foreign ministers welcomed the latest refinement of the Balladur pact, the French prime minister's initiative for strengthening political stability in central and eastern Europe. The Balladur pact has gained momentum among the 12 EU member states since it was first floated last spring in response to the failure of European diplomacy in former Yugoslavia. European leaders are seeking ways to fulfil the Maastricht treaty's provisions for joint actions under a new common foreign policy. They are also responding to signals from the US that the EU should become more involved in security questions on the continent. However, several difficulties remain outstanding with the latest proposals, diplomats at the summit said. First, east European states such as Poland and the Czech Republic are less than enthusiastic about attending a peace conference which draws an implicit line between stable western states in the EU and unstable states in the former Soviet bloc. A Polish official said yesterday his country did not have a minority problem and had signed co-operation agreements with six out of seven of its neighbours. Second, those countries seeking EU membership - notably the Visegrad Four of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - argue that closer economic links with the European Union are a more effective way of guaranteeing stability in central Europe than a peace conference. Third, the question of which states are invited to attend the opening security conference likely to take place next spring remains contentious. Some countries want to restrict invitations to countries which have realistic aspirations of joining the EU in the next 10 to 15 years. These would include the Visegrad Four, Bulgaria, the three Baltic states and Slovenia. Others believe that a genuine security conference must include Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and the Caucasus region, all of which are suffering from inter-ethnic conflict. Albania, which has tense diplomatic relations with neighbouring Greece, is also a prime candidate for an invitation, a Brussels diplomat said yesterday. A UK spokesman said the Balladur plan was a 'good proposal' because it did not attempt to create a new international organisation. Earlier fears that the Balladur pact could duplicate work by the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe - whose membership has grown since the collapse of the Soviet bloc - had dissipated. Intensive diplomacy also appears to have removed objections to earlier drafts of the Balladur pact which seemed an open invitation for disgruntled minorities to challenge frontiers. 'Existing borders will not be touched,' said a UK official. The idea is to hold a conference starting in spring 1994.</p>

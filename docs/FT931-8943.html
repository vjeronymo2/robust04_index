			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Flexible work deal agreed SOUTHERN Electric, the privately-owned utility, yesterday agreed a flexible working pattern with its 5,000 employees which it believes is the first of its kind among the main UK utilities. The five unions, in return for a 2.9 per cent pay rise and one-off lump sum payments averaging Pounds 200, have accepted the phased introduction of a six-day working week over the next 18 months and a big reduction in voluntary overtime which costs the company Pounds 10m a year.</p>

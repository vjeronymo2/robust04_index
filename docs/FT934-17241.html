			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Flow of Canadian dollar issues continues THE RECENT flow of Canadian dollar issues continued yesterday as the Kingdom of Denmark raised CDollars 250m through an offering of six-year Eurobonds. Mr Niels Sorensen, head of the foreign debt department at Denmark's National Bank, said that the issue formed part of Denmark's policy to replace commercial paper that was falling due with medium-term borrowings. He added that there was a lot of commercial paper falling due this month. The bonds were priced to yield 32 basis points over the 6 1/2 per cent Canadian Treasury due 1998. Lead manager Daiwa said there was a differential of 12 basis points between the five-year and the six-year area of the yield curve. Mr Sorensen said that the proceeds of the issue had been swapped into floating-rate dollars at a 'comfortable' level below the London interbank offered rate (Libor). He indicated that the margin below Libor was in double digits. Daiwa said the launch of the issue had been hampered by a half-point fall in the underlying Canadian government bond market. When the bonds were freed to trade, they eased to 98.15 from their re-offer price of 98.65, but the spread remained intact. There was a blend of retail and institutional interest in the bonds, which offer a significant yield pick-up over the recent spate of five-year Canadian dollar offerings. However, Daiwa said it would take some time to place the entire issue. Salomon Inc raised Dollars 294.5m through a three-year offering of auction-rate notes linked to the yen. Salomon said the notes offered investors exposure to the yen without having to hedge themselves in the foreign exchange market. In the Eurosterling sector, Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil company, raised Pounds 75m through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds. Lead manager BZW said this was the first time Pemex had achieved a 10-year maturity since the international bond market re-opened to Latin American borrowers. The bonds were priced to yield 200 basis points over the 8 per cent UK government bond due 2003, but the spread tightened to 195 points after the bonds were freed to trade. The proceeds were swapped into fixed-rate dollars. Banco de Colombia, the largest commercial bank in the country in terms of deposits, raised Dollars 50m through an offering of five-year Eurobonds. The issue completes the borrower's Dollars 100m Euro-MTN programme. The bonds were priced to yield 300 basis points over the 4 3/4 per cent US Treasury due 1998, which represents an improvement of 20 basis points since June when the issuer made a Dollars 50m offering of three-year Eurobonds. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said it had placed Fiat's A-1 commercial paper rating on creditwatch with negative implications.</p>

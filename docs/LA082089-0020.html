			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALICE KAHN: WE'VE REACHED CIRCUIT OVERLOAD ON THE ISSUES  </P> <P> Opinions. Do we have too many of them? Do we need more of them? Opinions --  bulwark of democracy or high-fiber diet for radio? Go ahead, caller.  </P> <P>  You can't even walk into a hardware store to pick up a bungee cord without  being drawn into a conflict. In fact, there I was, standing in line buying two  bungee cords to replace the one the raccoon ate off my garbage can last night.  </P> <P>  Raccoons. Cute animals or cunning antagonists? Go ahead, caller.  </P> <P>  The man in front of me in line suddenly starched up and said to the clerk, "I  find that T-shirt extremely offensive."  </P> <P> We were at Ace -- Ace is the place with the helpful hardware man. Except that  this helpful hardware man was wearing a T-shirt that said: "Adolf Hitler World  Tour, 1938-1945." There was a drawing of Hitler on the front, and on his back  was a list of the cities Hitler had visited.  </P> <P> REACTION.  </P> <P> "Yeah, yeah, a lot of people told me it was offensive," said the helpful  hardware man in the Hitler shirt, who was actually a boy of about 19. He was  noticeably muscular and blond, and he was wearing camouflage-style pants.  </P> <P> It occurred to me that maybe the shirt wasn't a joke. Maybe he was one of the  phantom Nazi skinheads who keep attacking people.  </P> <P> "Are you a Nazi?" I asked. "You know there really are Nazis."  </P> <P> "No," the kid said, getting angry.  </P> <P> "Well, I'm offended, and I'm going to write a letter to the owner of the  store," said the man in line.  </P> <P> "Do what you want," said the kid, and then he just stalked away from the cash  register, leaving us standing there.  </P> <P> Now I was stuck. In a hurry. Just wanting a bungee cord, not a moral dilemma.  </P> <P>  Moral dilemmas. Spiritual breakthrough or waste of time? Coming up after this  message.  </P> <P>  On the one hand, I know the shirt was a satire on the rock 'n' roll tour  shirts you see everywhere. On the other hand, what if a Holocaust survivor  walked in and had to cope with that?  </P> <P> I did have the urge to teach the kid a lesson -- a history lesson. To ask him  the obvious questions about events that happened 45 years ago. And I could hear  him saying, "Yeah, yeah. It's just a joke."  </P> <P> Then we could get into a dialogue, an extended dialogue about his right to wear  jokes and his right to wear flags and his right to vote on whether I have a  baby. And -- yeah, yeah -- the Holocaust.  </P> <P> REPLACEMENT.  </P> <P> Another clerk came. I bought my bungee cords and went home.  </P> <P> And I was thinking about how weary I am of reacting. Of taking sides. Of having  opinions. How little is accomplished in these my-ideas-are-better-than-yours  tests of tongue. How everything gets trivialized as we go on automatic Donahue.  </P> <P> Actions -- do they speak louder than words? Next time I go into the hardware  store, should I lecture the kid or snap a bungee cord on his nose? Should I  write the owner or organize a boycott? Do I have to do something or can I just  watch Oprah?  </P> <P> Go ahead, caller.  </P></p>

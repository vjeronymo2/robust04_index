			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith senses schism over future voting plan - Labour is still warring over PR as the Plant committee concludes its inquiry today TO THE senior Labour party official, the dilemma was simple: 'How can you be a party of change and not change on PR? If you do opt for change, how do you counter the Tory argument that you don't believe you can win an election by the present system?' If he were not so before, Mr John Smith, Labour's leader, must now be aware that the potentially explosive electoral reform issue could split his party as damagingly as Maastricht has divided the Tories. Today, as Lord Plant's exhaustive three-year trawl through the issues involved comes to its formal end, the fierce disagreements within his 18-member working party are about the only element in the equation not in dispute. Another might be that the only game in town is what happens to the House of Commons. Even opponents of any change from first-past-the-post for MPs, like Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader, can probably live with alternatives for Europe, local government, Scotland and the Lords. But when it comes to the lower chamber, schism is in the air. Lord Plant, a politics professor from Southampton University, has always said that his warring colleagues must table a report with recommendations. But with committee members split three ways between three systems, it appears clear there is no outright majority for any one. So how is a conclusion reached? Lord Plant - now regarded as firmly in the reformist camp - is expected to insist that members first vote for or against change. Some, Mrs Beckett once again is one, may strenuously object as such a vote would almost certainly produce a majority for change. But what change? Neither of the two hybrid systems on offer - Supplementary Vote and the Mixed Member System - can command a majority of the committee. One insider said: 'The first hour and half of the meeting will probably be spent arguing how the vote on the committee is going to be taken.' The protests of advocates of first-past-the-post must also be accommodated, probably requiring a further 'final' drafting meeting before the finished report is sent on to the National Executive Committee's meeting at the end of April. Party officials have hinted that Mr Smith, a known sceptic about change, must make his own views known by then. He may do so only privately. As the ultimate decisions still lie with party conference, the key battles now lie, as so often, within the executive committees of the big unions. Mr Bill Morris, the Transport Union's general secretary, surprised many last year when he came out for reform. His executive, however, is not yet with certainty in the reformers' bag. Similar hints of flexibility have come from the highly influential GMB general union which is said to have pledged to do what Mr Smith wants. So what does Mr Smith want? The simple answer is to win the next election. Even if that can only be achieved by having Mr Paddy Ashdown as his deputy, Mr Smith might swallow hard and bear it - though never publicly in a pact. But he is said to be unconvinced that Labour has a better chance as an electoral reforming party than not. If Mr Smith comes out firmly against change, he can be sure the reformers' campaign will continue. One final option, mooted recently, is to promise a referendum on the issue, along the lines of the recent plebiscite in New Zealand. But that might prove awkward at a time when Labour is so adamantly opposed to a referendum on Maastricht. Mr Smith might just be tempted to do what Labour leaders are traditionally least naturally disposed to do - let the conference decide, then try and make the decision stick.</p>

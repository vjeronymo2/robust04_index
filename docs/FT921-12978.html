			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Mine output boost helps JCI surge to R58.4m SUCCESSFUL cost containment and productivity increases at the Randfontein mine allowed Johannesburg Consolidated Investment's (JCI) gold mines to show a 28.6 increase in net profits for the December quarter. Net profits rose to R58.4m (Dollars 20.90m) from R45.4m the previous quarter. Of this, R54.5m came from Randfontein, which recorded a 46.1 per cent rise. A large part of Randfontein's success arose from a productivity bonus scheme agreed with workers in exchange for a low annual wage increase last year. The mine produced 7,821kg of gold at R26,018 per kg in the December 1991 quarter, compared with 7,363kg at R27,694 per kg in the December 1990 quarter. Mr Bill Nairn, managing director of the gold and uranium division, said workers had received, in terms of the productivity scheme, about 23 per cent of the benefits from the mine's improved performance. This involved the mine paying out about R5.2m in productivity bonuses during the quarter, which translates to a wage rise of about 12 per cent. The interim dividend was lifted by 25 per cent to 25 cents per share.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Businessman is jailed for forgery DR Shrian Oskar, a businessman, was sentenced to three years' jail at the Old Bailey yesterday after a jury found him guilty of forgery and on two counts of perverting the course of justice. The court had been told that, using a forged affidavit, he had hoped to overturn a two-year sentence imposed in 1985 for dishonesty and to fight extradition proceedings launched by the Australian government. Dr Oskar is already serving six years after being convicted last autumn of a Pounds 400,000 fraud on Midland Bank. After that trial, the home secretary issued a deportation order against him. Judge Lawrence Verney, the Recorder of London, said yesterday the three-year term should be concurrent with Dr Oskar's existing sentence so that the deportation order was carried out at the earliest opportunity.</p>

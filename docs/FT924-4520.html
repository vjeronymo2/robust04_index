			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Barclays defends lending policies BARCLAYS Bank firmly rejected criticism of its small-business lending policies yesterday, although it admitted that it has widened the average margin on small-business loans from 2.9 percentage points to 3.4 points over the past 18 months. The bank published extracts from evidence to the renewed inquiry on lending to small businesses by high street banks which is being conducted by the Treasury and the Bank of England. It said the increased margin was needed to cover losses. Mr Bill Gordon, managing director of Barclays' banking division, said the figures showed that the bank had acted responsibly during the recession. Losses in lending to small businesses meant that it had to widen margins. 'The increases have been modest, particularly bearing in mind the fact that the bank has passed on all base-rate cuts in full to its customers,' said Mr Gordon. Barclays said the report it passed to the Treasury showed that only a third of the bank's business customers borrowed. The typical margin for loans to businesses with turnover up to Pounds 250,000 was now 3.4 percentage points above base rate.</p>

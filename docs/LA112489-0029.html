			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Biggest Box Office Wednesday: "Back to the Future Part II" broke box office  records Wednesday grossing $7 million in its opening day for the biggest  Wednesday in the history of the motion picture business. The Universal film,  starring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, opened in 1,866 theaters in the  United States and Canada and broke the record for a Wednesday opening  previously held by "Rocky IV." That film brought in $5.7 million on  Thanksgiving eve in 1985. The previous all-time Wednesday high was held by  "Batman," which made $6.6 million on its first Wednesday (the film opened on a  Friday). "It should obviously be the biggest Thanksgiving in history," said  Universal Pictures spokesman Alan Sutton. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

Addressing a press conference in Pretoria, Mr Meyer  said the government was prepared to negotiate with the  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] and the Transitional  Executive Council to extend the time for submitting candidate  lists.    This was, however, subject to a "clear indication" from the  Inkatha Freedom Party and the Freedom Front within the next 24  hours that they intended to do so. This was stretching the  technical requirements because Wednesday's deadline had passed  without these parties submitting candidates lists to complete  their "provisional" registration.    Logistically, Mr Meyer said: "We have until tomorrow  (Friday)  afternoon".    Mr Meyer rejected Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National  Front] leader Constand Viljoen's suggestion that the election be  postponed for two months as "not making sense". Gen Viljoen had  proposed that one month should be used for mediation and the  next to prepare for the elections.    Also, there was no need for a seperate referendum or  plebiscite to determine support for a "volkstaat" [homeland]  because through the elections' two-ballot system they could  determine their support and where it was located, Mr Meyer said.    The right-wing had no grounds to take "undemocratic steps"  to  realise their ideal and the government would see that the  necessary steps would be taken to protect the process and the  elections, Mr Meyer warned. Mr Meyer urged the Freedom  Alliance's parties to participate in the elections, saying their  objections had been dealt with in the amendments to the interim  constitution. Gen Viljoen had acknowledged this, he claimed.    Referring to Gen Viljoen's proposal to postpone the  elections  for at least two months, Mr Meyer said: "It cannot work. With  six to seven weeks before the polls there are already complaints  from Freedom Alliance parties about time contraints to prepare  for the elections, it would be even more so with only one month."    He added that the government was not in principle against  international mediation, but it was not clear over what issues  further mediation was needed.</p>

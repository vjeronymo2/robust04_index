			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Duncan Campbell, crime correspondent: "Street </F> Price of Cocaine Drops"]    [Text] The street price of cocaine has dropped steeply over  the past year, indicating that it is more widely available,  according to a survey published this morning. The report also  highlights a big increase in home-grown cannabis.    The survey, produced by Release, the drugs and legal advice  service, suggests there has been a steady resurgence in the  popularity of LSD, thought to be partly due to a switch from  Ecstasy because of uncertainty about its quality.    The price of cocaine, once as high as &pound;100 a gramme,  now  averages &pound;40 to &pound;60 a gramme, although there are  regional  variations and the price can go as low as &pound;30. The drug is  being used most widely in London and the South-east.    Cannabis remains the most popular drug throughout Britain,  with prices at &pound;25 to &pound;30 a quarter ounce for herbal  cannabis and resin. The price has been stable for about 10  years. However, the market for homegrown "grass" appears to be  developing, a trend led by the Dutch, the survey said. Indoor  growers operate under sophisticated botanical conditions  involving high wattage halogen lightbulbs and complex water  feeding systems. Dutch "skunk weed" can cost as much as  &pound;60 a  quarter ounce, while some British home grown strains sell for as  little as &pound;15.    The anaesthetic drug, ketamin--associated with the dance  scene--has become more available, selling at around &pound;15 a  tablet.    Crack cocaine is most widely available in London and  inner-city areas of the Midlands and North-west, but is rarely  found in Scotland or rural areas. It is sold by the "rock" at  between &pound;15 and &pound;25.    Mike Goodman, director of Release, said "millions" would be  taking drugs for recreational purposes over the festive season.  While abstinence was safest, people should be aware that it  could be dangerous to mix some drugs and alcohol. He urged those  taking drugs not to drive.</p>

			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Cadbury report criticised THE CADBURY report on corporate governance places too much emphasis on non-executive directors and fails to stress the role of internal auditors, speakers at the Institute of Chartered Accountants annual conference in Eastbourne said yesterday. Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, the UK's biggest life assurance company, said Cadbury too readily assumed executive directors were the enemies of corporate governance, which he found 'disturbing'. While stressing the importance of corporate governance, he said institutional investors should not intervene in the day-to-day running of companies in which they invest, and confine themselves to protecting shareholders' interests. Non-executive directors were important, but too few had the independence and experience required to do their job well. He spoke out against proposals to introduce compulsory rotation of audit firms, determination of fees other than by the management of a company, and audits for interim accounts. Mr Graham Wilson, managing director of United Newspapers, said Cadbury had sidestepped the issue of requiring companies to report on internal controls. He said internal auditors had an important role to play in financial reporting, but required clear statements of responsibility and effective reporting lines. Mr Wilson also launched a strong attack on the notion of intangible assets such as brands on the balance sheet. Brand valuations were clearly subjective, and the more scope there was for differing accounting treatments applied to the same facts, the less useful financial reports would become. Mr Brandon Gough, senior partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said auditors should consider radically expanding the scope of their work while fighting to reduce the extent of their liability. He was 'stung' by allegations that firms had surrendered professional integrity for commercial gain, and concerned at the costs of litigation against auditors. Mr Gough said there needed to be a balance between fair penalties and encouragement to professionals to give an opinion in an independent and fair way.</p>

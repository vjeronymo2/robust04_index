			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chang Mu (1728 3092): "CPC Redefines Positions </F> of Political and Economic Reforms; Reform and Opening Will Make  Moderate Progress"]    [Excerpt] At present, economic operations and structural  reforms in Mainland China have come to a point of stagnation.  The comprehensive reform program adopted earlier this year, and  aimed at making major breakthroughs in shifting from the planned  to the market economy, is now facing a range of difficulties.  It is believed that, after tiding over mountains of  difficulties, the situation will become bright again. The  difficulties are mainly reflected in the following: Prices are  increasing by too big a margin and state-owned enterprises are  operating under more difficult conditions (because their  economic results are getting even worse, their business losses  are increasing, their debt chains are accumulating, the income  of their workers is decreasing, and there are great difficulties  in their social insurance arrangements). A potential crisis  exists in agricultural production, which is vitally important to  the people's livelihood, because it is affected by market  competition. In addition, sensitive and unstable factors exist  in the months of April, May, and June. The CPC top leadership  thus emphasized the need to advance reform in an orderly way and  coordinate reform with development and stability under the  precondition of maintaining the current political framework.    In such circumstances, the CPC authorities have obviously  replaced the previous guideline of laying equal stress on  economic and political reforms with the general policy decision  of taking economic construction as the central task and making  everything suit the needs of the economic structural reform, to  implement Deng Xiaoping's line and accelerate the establishment  of the socialist market economic structure. Qian Qichen, vice  premier of the State Council and foreign minister, announced  that without continuous economic growth, it is difficult to  develop democracy. This precisely reflected the policy  orientation of the third-generation CPC leading body.    Premier Li Peng said recently: In the course of gradually  establishing the socialist market economic structure, China also  attaches great importance to developing democracy and the legal  system and boosting spiritual civilization. China pays  attention to adopting and assimilating advanced scientific and  technological achievements, management expertise, and cultural  achievements from foreign countries; at the same time, it also  pays attention to resisting decadent things. In particular,  China pays attention to maintaining its fine national tradition  and the cream of its national culture. This can be viewed as an  explicit definition of the contents and orientation of the  political structural reform, as well its position of being  subordinate to and guaranteeing the economic reform. Therefore,  Li Peng pointed out that the CPC's plan was to basically  establish the new economic structure in the 1990's and then  further build up a set of mature and fixed systems in various  aspects through efforts over the following 20 years.    In a previous period, the opinions about "greatly developing  the nonpublic economy" and establishing "a new type of mixed  economy" prevailed. Some people even advocated that like  planning and market, the system of ownership is also a means and  that only economic development is the end. They called for  respecting the independent status and interests of commodity  producers and dealers, arguing that the market economy is in  essence linked only with private ownership. At a theoretical  symposium on the private economy, a private entrepreneur read an  essay entitled "Keep Wealth in the Hands of the People--the Only  Way To Make a Country Prosperous and Powerful." He asserted  that "China is now undergoing the process of relative  privatization." This is characterized by the fact that "the  proportion of the private economy among other economic elements  in society is increasing and private enterprises are becoming  main pay contributors in the country" and "an increasing number  of individuals have, and will, become shareholders or owners of  former state-owned enterprises." As a result, "private property  is dramatically increasing" in society. He also held that the  countryside is the "source of privatization" and "the adoption  of the production responsibility system based on output  contracts has become the prelude to the process of  privatization." "As a result of the reforms, private  enterprises appeared on the Chinese mainland, a group of native  capitalists were fostered, and foreign capitalists were brought  in together with their investments." The essay said: "By the  end of this century, with the return of Hong Kong and Macao, the  private economy in the mainland will gain a natural ally and the  unexpected convergence will make the number of China's national  capitalists more impressive."    Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "We allow the individual  economy to develop and also allow Sino-foreign joint ventures  and the enterprises solely owned by foreign investors to develop  but socialist public ownership should always be the mainstay of  the economy." He stressed that "in the course of reform, we  should always adhere to basic principles: One is to keep the  dominant position of the public economy and the other is to seek  common affluence." Therefore, the 14th CPC National  Congress drew a particularly explicit conclusion: "In the  ownership structure, public ownership, including the economy  under whole people ownership and collective ownership, will be  the mainstay and the individual economy, the private economy,  the foreign-funded economy will be supplementary, and a variety  of economic elements will develop, side by side, over a long  period of time."    In fact, the state-owned economy remains the main source of  tax revenue for the state, accounting for about 60 to 70 percent  of the total. The private economy is still far from being the  main taxpayer. Some experts hold that the fact that the  economic results in some state-owned enterprises are poor and  some even incur serious business losses is caused, to a large  extent, by the unfair competition. It is a biased opinion to  say that state-owned enterprises cannot match collective  enterprises, that collective enterprises cannot match private  enterprises, that private enterprises cannot match  foreign-funded enterprises, and that private ownership is  superior to public ownership. A large part of state-owned  enterprises are concentrated in the basic industries. They  require high investments and are slow to yield returns, their  products and services are sold at low prices, and thus their  profit margins are lower than the average level in society. In  fact, part of their economic results are transferred to private  enterprises and their low economic efficiency guarantees the  high efficiency of the national economy as a whole, including  that of the private economy. State-owned enterprises employ 20  to 30 percent more workers than they actually need. They also  have to bear the wages and welfare benefits paid to an  increasing number of retired personnel and the load is getting  increasingly heavy. On the other hand, the township and town  enterprises, private enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises  only need to pay the labor costs and they shift the welfare  burdens onto society. In the process of accelerating the  establishment of the market economic structure, the state-owned  enterprises have lost their advantages in raw materials and in  production costs but they still have to shoulder heavy burdens.  On the other hand, the township and town enterprises, private  enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises can enjoy various  preferential tax terms. More importantly, although the  management and operation mechanisms of the state-owned  enterprises have been transformed somewhat, they are still  subject to administrative interference and it is still hard for  them to actually exercise independent decisionmaking power in  investment, production distribution, personnel appointment, and  price-fixing. Naturally, they cannot adapt themselves flexibly  to the market economy.    Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is now in charge of the reform  oriented to the establishment of the modern enterprise system,  said that as long as the management and operation mechanisms of  the state-owned enterprises have been thoroughly changed, such  enterprises are given independent decisionmaking power for  business operations; their property rights are explicitly  defined; a reasonable internal organizational structure, the  stimulating and self-control mechanisms, and the environment for  fair competition are set up; and then they will also be able to  achieve high economic efficiency. Privatization is never the  only way out. Public ownership is not the cause of the poor  economic results. The current economic difficulties in Western  countries also proves this.    With the in-depth development of the economy, individual  investment in state-owned enterprises will increase and  individual investors will become shareholders in such  enterprises. Moreover, some small- and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises will be sold to individuals by auction. The CPC  authorities stress that this does not mean any privatization of  state-owned enterprises; instead, this is just a measure for  deepening the enterprise reform and invigorating the economy.  According to the relevant state regulations, the proportion of  shares held by individuals is limited and public ownership will  remain predominant. Deng Xiaoping said: "According to the  current practice of opening, there will not be a newborn  bourgeois class when our country's per capita GNP increases to  several thousand dollars." "If there is a newborn bourgeois  class then we will have really gone astray."    Among CPC cadres at all levels, there are many different  opinions about the country's development orientation and about  the contents and intensity of the reforms; there are also  differences in the implementation of the established policies.  Many cadres only stress the need to quicken development and do  not pay attention to various new economic phenomena and the  implementation of various reform measures. Some of them are  even tired of so many "twists and turns."    CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin particularly instructed  the  State Council's Development Research Center, headed by Ma Hong  and Sun Shangqing, to organize some experts in compiling  textbooks for provincial, prefectural, city, township, and  enterprises leaders to popularize knowledge about the socialist  market economy among them. In early April, Jiang Zemin  telephoned Ma Hong and said: The ongoing transformation from a  traditional planned economic structure to a socialist market  economic structure is a great historical change but leading  cadres at all levels are still unclear about the basic facts and  the basic concepts of the market economy. It is now urgently  necessary to popularize the ABC's of the market economy, such as  basic knowledge about stocks, bonds, real estate, and futures.  In the past, our cadres learned little about such things while  working under the planned economy structure but now, they must  have knowledge about the market economy to develop the socialist  market economy and must be familiar with the market and  understand the contents and operation of the market economy in  order to do a good job.    Since the beginning of this year, principal provincial-level  leading cadres have received training in turn at the CPC  High-Level Party School led by Hu Jintao. They mainly studied  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and  the major principles and policies for establishing the socialist  market economy and the reform arrangements. In particular,  stress was laid on the need to unify thinking, to coordinate the  steps, to act in accordance with the overall interests of the  whole nation, and to safeguard the authority of the central  leadership. As a result, such things as ignoring central  instructions, working out "countermeasures" against central  policies, taking advantage of loopholes in the policies, and  going one's own way have been seen to decrease.    After the Second Session of the Eighth National People's  Congress, the CPC leaders inspected various localities to see  how the reform measures were being implemented. Zhu Rongji's  inspection of Heilongjiang was most impressive in terms of size  and influence. He led 10 principal State Council ministry and  state commission leaders to "work on the spot," dealing mainly  with difficult issues in the economic layout and in large  state-owned enterprises (including those in the war industry).  Some enterprises were forced to suspend operations and  production because of the industrial restructuring and  enterprise mergers. Some workers gathered to protest and this  caused a bad atmosphere. Zhu Rongji announced that he  visited Heilongjiang in accordance with the instructions of  Jiang Zemin and Li Peng. Thus, he brought with him the supreme  policy decisions. At the end of the inspection, on 17  April, he openly announced that Sun Weiben, secretary of the  provincial party committee was relieved of office and would be  succeeded by Yue Qifeng, former governor of Liaoning Province.  This showed that Zhu Rongji was resolute in making decisions as  a troubleshooter and could seize the crux of the problem.    Whether or not the CPC's reform measures for improving  macrocontrol will achieve the expected results is contingent on  whether or not social and economic operations can be kept in a  healthy and stable condition during the first half of this year.  Although the results of production, sales, tax revenue, and  foreign trade in the first quarter of 1994 show that the  economic conditions can basically meet the macrocontrol targets,  retail prices still increased by 20.1 percent, much higher than  Li Peng's target of keeping the margin of price increase within  10 percent for the whole year. Chen Jihua, minister of the  State Planning Commission, said that in order to curb inflation  and guarantee the smooth implementation of various reform  measures, it is necessary to effect the following:    First, maintaining the balance between gross supply and  demand. In normal conditions, the difference should not be  larger than 5 percent. At present, the difference is 7 percent.  The investment-led demand is too great and supply is relatively  insufficient and, if this situation continues, inflation will  appear. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly control the  amount of investment in fixed assets.    Second, attaching importance to agriculture and guaranteeing  the supply of vegetables, eggs, meat, and other foodstuffs.  Workers in the middle and lower income groups are strongly  discontented with the fact that food prices are increasing by  too wide a margin and this is greatly unfavorable to social  stability.    Third, properly handling the intensity of the price reform  and selecting the right time for the adoption of the reform  measures. That is, the reform measures should be adopted when  the economic environment is relatively relaxed and the masses  can endure higher prices. Public opinion should help adjust the  psychological condition of the masses for inflation.    Fourth, the government should be exercising management and  interfering in market prices. At present, in such countries as  the United States and Japan, which pursue typical free market  economies, the commodity prices and service charges subject to  government management account for 5 to 10 percent, or even 20  percent, of the gross volume of retail sales in society and the  proportions there are even higher than those in China.  Therefore, macrocontrol over the conditions of a market economy  is still indispensable.    Since Ding Guangen, CPC Central Political Bureau member,  took charge of the party's ideological work, he has pointed out  more explicitly the position of ideological and propaganda work  as subordinate to the central task of economic construction and  reforms. The position and role of opinion orientation is being  strengthened and has become the important nerve of social  stability. The CPC top leadership stressed that factors  which may cause social instability must be wiped out when they  are still in the embryonic stage to prevent them from causing  major trouble. This is in fact the extensive application of  Deng Xiaoping's idea about "no controversy." News reports, the  arts, and other forms of propaganda should serve the central  task, playing an assistant role, and must not add trouble to the  situation. They should play the main theme and not add noise.  This is the most important function of the propaganda methods.  They must not create any unnecessary controversy or even sing  an opposing tune to divert people's attention from economic  construction. Stopping beauty pageants, stopping performers  from moving all over to put on shows, checking young people's  crazy admiration for some singing stars, clamping down on the  illegal sale of book registration numbers and illegal  publications, including pornographic publications, were all  measures adopted by the CPC authorities to remove the unstable  factors and resist the influence of the decadent Western  lifestyle.    Jiang Zemin pointed out that the first thing in  building spiritual civilization is to cause creations to  flourish and these works should play the main theme. The  works should give expression to Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the party's  basic line, and the spirit of patriotism, socialism, and  collectivism. Literature and arts should follow the principle  of "serving socialism" and "serving the people." In short, they  should arouse the entire people's enthusiasm for socialist  construction and should encourage them to make progress. The  main theme must be played in the works being supported as key  projects, in the main pages and columns of newspapers and  magazines, and in the golden hours of television broadcasts.  The main theme should be combined with a variety of vivid  forms. The main theme is the ideological requirement for  the works but the works giving expression to the main theme need  not be serious or highly aesthetic in their style. Some works  may be very easy to understand and should be popular with the  masses. As long as they give a healthy feeling to the people,  then they are works playing the main theme. We cannot demand  that all works repeat the same thing and follow the same pattern  while stressing the need to play the main theme. We should  still let a hundred flowers blossom. We should also allow the  existence of some works which are somewhat vulgar in style but  are harmless in their contents. Jiang Zemin also said: We  must boost spiritual civilization; otherwise, people at home and  abroad can complain bitterly. For example, karaoke bars in some  places hire young ladies to entertain customers by drinking,  singing, and dancing with them. If there are additional  services, things will become serious.    Jiang Zemin said: Sweeping away pornographic things is a  popular action supported by the people, so we should go all out  to do this boldly. Of course, this is also a long-term task  that cannot be finished in one single move. It is necessary to  mobilize all quarters of society to sweep away pornographic  things, just like the tasks being assigned to all units in  public sanitary work. The tasks of eliminating pornographic  things should also be assigned to all institutions, schools, and  enterprises and routine management should be combined with  sudden inspections. Unremitting efforts should be made and  actions should be taken repeatedly. [passage omitted]</p>

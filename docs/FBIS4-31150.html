			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The following items on political and  economic developments in the Republic of Croatia are drawn from  periodicals published in the republic.  <H5>  Controversy Over New Croatian Currency </H5>   Croatian and Serbian newspapers have published articles  condemning the introduction of the kuna (Serbo-Croatian for  marten) as the new Croatian currency, mainly because it had  heretofore been used only in the Independent State of Croatia  (NDH--World War II pro-Nazi state ruled by Ante Pavelic).    "The replacement of the Croatian dinar with the Croatian  kuna  is primarily a political act.... The name kuna itself is pure  politics, because it defines the origin of the current Croatian  state differently than the Constitution does. Instead of the  current name, derived from the Yugoslav dinar and originally  from the Roman denarius, we are getting a name which the NDH's  money bore.... Thus, the wishes and dreams of influential  persons nostalgic for the NDH are being fulfilled," the 9 May  edition of the Split weekly FERAL TRIBUNE writes, going on to  cite Josip Manolic, vice president of the newly founded Croatian  Independent Democrats and a leading critic of Croatian President  Franjo Tudjman, as saying that Tudjman personally gave the order  which the HDZ majority in the Croatian Assembly "simply obeyed  in a discipled manner."    The 5 May issue of the Zagreb weekly GLOBUS also published  criticism by Manolic of the decision on the new monetary unit.  The kuna has never been the Croatian currency, Manolic said,  except during the time of NDH. Marten pelts, he noted, were  merely a commodity used for bartering in the time before Croatia  had currency, just as were seashells, leather, or sheep. The use  of marten pelts was absolutely not a tradition, he added, in  spite of what Tudjman and others who support the return of the  NDH currency claim.    Manolic went on to say that numerous "pogroms" against  minorities, and even against many Croats, were carried out  during the four years the NDH existed. "We should be realistic.  Neither the Jews nor the Serbs will be able to accept the kuna  as their money," he continued, observing that the NDH was not a  "shining" period in Croatian history and that nothing from that  period should be linked to the present Croatia. "We cannot  seriously consider the reintegration of the occupied territories  with such things as the kuna," he concluded, according to GLOBUS.    "The introduction of the name kuna for Croatia's currency is  a harmful political move, one of those that are renewing  Pavelic's Independent State of Croatia," the 5 May issue of the  Zagreb daily VJESNIK cites Branko Horvat, president of the  Social-Democratic Union (SDU), as stating at an SDU press  conference. Horvat went on to say, according to VJESNIK, that  "the kuna has never been Croatian money; it was invented during  the NDH, and there is no reason whatsoever to reintroduce this  name. This is obviously a concession to the ustasha elements  that surround President Tudjman, and this name offends the pride  of cultured Croatian people."    Several Croatian politicians critical of the introduction of  the kuna have also been cited in the Belgrade press. For  example, Silvije Degen, leader of the Socialist Party of Croatia  and renowned Zagreb lawyer and human rights activist, noted  during an interview in the 21-22 May Belgrade daily BORBA, that  "symbolically, the marten is the smallest but most bloodthirsty  mammal on the face of the earth."  <H5>  Share of Zagreb Brewery Sold to Belgian Firm </H5>   With the signing of an agreement for the sale of 23.78  percent of the shares of the Zagreb Pivovara (brewery), one of  the largest privatization deals in Croatia to date, worth 40  million German marks [DM], has been concluded, reported the 5  May VJESNIK. The Belgian firm Interbrew immediately paid double  the "nominal" value of DM9.7 million for the shares, and is  planning to invest an additional DM21 million in the Zagreb  brewery -- DM11 million immediately and DM10 million in a year  -- VJESNIK reported, adding that the Belgian firm for the  present has a minority stake but that its share will increase  with the additional capitalization. The contract was signed on 4  May by Ivan Penic, president of the Croatian Privatization Fund,  and Hans H. Meerloo, president of the executive board of the  Belgian firm. The privatization fund management board  unanimously decided to sell the Zagreb Pivovara shares to the  Belgian firm, which made the highest bid, VJESNIK added.  <H5>  German Firm Becomes Majority Owner of Koncar </H5>   The German firm EGE, through "additional investment" in the  Rade Koncar firm in Slavonska Pozega, has become majority owner  of this "relatively small but profitable export-oriented firm,"  according to the 5 May VJESNIK. During the capitalization  process, which has been going on for almost two years, the  German partner has invested DM7.3 million in Koncar. Production  of tube heaters began in 1993, and this year funds were invested  in the production of heating plates. Koncar-EGE director Zeljko  Bohm told VJESNIK that annual production of about 2.5 million  heating plates and 2 million tube heaters is planned. Most of  the production is for export to Austria, Germany, and  Switzerland, and production for the Italian market is especially  significant. This year, 500,000 heating plates will be delivered  to two Italian buyers.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L. Lagin: "Sociologists Suggest the Solution: </F> How the Chelyabinsk Administration Makes Use of Their  Conclusions and Predictions"]    [Text] In the course of a little over two years, a group of  sociologists from the Chelyabinsk branch of the Institute of  Economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as an assignment  for the Chelyabinsk administration, has been making sociological  studies. The authorities are interested in everything: how the  Chelyabinsk citizens feel under the new conditions and how  certain specific actions should be planned. It would be a good  idea to become familiar with certain aspects of this difficult  job.  <H8>  `Pro' or `Con' </H8>   Practically every staff meeting of V. Tarasov, head of the  Chelyabinsk administration, begins with the latest sociological  poll and the conclusions and recommendations of sociologists.  Moreover, in addition to the constantly repeated questions  (monitoring) -- how much have the citizens adapted to the new  prices, is their standard of living on the whole rising or  falling, how satisfied are they with the work of a certain  specific municipal service -- the directors of the committees  and the head himself ask the scientists to take a special  interest in some specific subject. On the basis of the data from  the polls, a conclusion is drawn as to the advisability of the  actions or measures planned by the municipal authorities.    For example, the question was asked: "Are the citizens  planning to get vegetables and potatoes at stores or are they  relying on their own stock?" It was ascertained that most of the  Chelyabinsk citizens rely more on themselves and on the market  than on state trade. This served as the basis for the trade  committee to amend its plans and try to have a necessary, but  not excessive reserve at the vegetable warehouses.    Another example. There was a great deal of "pro" and "con"  about holding a trade fair on Revolyutsiya Square. The  sociologists said unequivocally that the city needed these trade  fairs. The administration was guided by their conclusions.    Before introducing compulsory registration for foreign  citizens in Chelyabinsk, the sociologists were charged with  determining the attitude of the citizens toward this extreme  measure. Their conclusions convinced the head of the  administration that it was not the right path. No registration  procedure has so far been established, true, but it must be, by  summertime. Also taken into consideration was the opinion of the  Chelyabinsk citizens, that no daily payment should be taken from  foreigners for staying in the city: a fine for violation of the  registration rules is compulsory, but they do not have to pay  for each day.  <H8>  Life Has Become.... </H8>   At one time our fathers and grandfathers were convinced:  "Life has become better, comrades, life has become merrier!"  Today this slogan does not do it -- one must operate with  scientific data and figures. To what do they attest?    As sociologists affirm, over half of the Chelyabinsk  inhabitants (54 percent) eat as well or better than in March  1992. Moreover, in March 1992, this was true of only 42 percent.  The percentage of those who have begun to be worse fed has  dropped from 57 to 34. No one, of course, is shouting "Hurrah!":  after all, this is one-third of the citizens! These are  primarily the pensioners and the poorly-paid categories of  employees and workers. It is to their social protection that the  municipal services are oriented: subsidies, compensations,  benefits.    The percentage of those finding it difficult to buy  themselves clothing and footwear has dropped (from 86 to 58). It  has been reduced by one-third -- good. What is bad is that these  Chelyabinsk citizens constitute a majority. There must therefore  be a group of measures to help this majority: pensioners,  teachers, physicians, cultural workers and scientific workers.  The conclusion of the scientists is: consumption of food  products will increase somewhat, and the need for clothing and  footwear will increase, but by much less. This is very important  information for the committee for trade and services: clothing  and footwear must be less expensive.    For the majority of the citizens (56.5 percent), there is a  possibility of starting to work. This is 10 percent more than in  1992. At the same time, there were only 1,038 persons, 0.61  percent, officially (registered) unemployed in Chelyabinsk in  February (compare: in the small town of Nyazepetrovsk, 11  percent are unemployed!). Not counting the hidden unemployed.  But this depends to a lesser extent, you will agree, on the  "city's leading economic section" and its administration than on  various AO [joint-stock company], AOZT and TOO [expansions not  given], large combines and plants.    Yesterday and today and tomorrow, it is hard to find a  person  who would say: "I am satisfied with my life." Nevertheless, 15.7  percent of the Chelyabinsk citizens are satisfied with their  lives. This is more than last year. Some 56.6 percent feel  dissatisfied, but this percentage has dropped. Compare: 73  percent of the Moscow citizens, 72 percent of the inhabitants of  Chelyabinsk Oblast but "only" 55.6 percent of the Chelyabinsk  citizens put down "dissatisfied" with their lives. To some  extent, this is an evaluation of the work of the municipal  administration, which has managed to "amortize" the difficulties  --although not so much that a majority of the citizens put down  a favorable evaluation.  <H8>  A Beloved City </H8>   Chelyabinsk remains one of the major cities in Russia: it is  in third place after Moscow and St. Petersburg with respect to  industrial potential, and has a population of 1,161,000 people.  It is both easier and harder to live in a city like this. It is  easier because Chelyabinsk is a city of plants, the center of  metallurgy and heavy industry. Specialists feel that tomorrow is  for these precise citizens. For the same reason, it is more  difficult for us to live today.    "How do you evaluate the situation in the city?" -- the  sociologists are constantly asking this question. In all the  years of the studies, the relative proportion of those who  evaluate the situation in the city as tense holds steady in the  area of 28 percent (one-third). Depending on the time of the  year and the month, the number of Chelyabinsk citizens who  consider the situation calm fluctuates (from 32 percent in June  1993 to 14 percent in January 1994). On the basis of this, the  percentage of those who evaluate the situation as on the border  between calm and tense changes (from 41 to 57 percent).    In the opinion of sociologists, the most unfavorable months  for Chelyabinsk are March, April and the first half of May. The  peak of tension falls precisely in these months, year after  year. There are several reasons: economic, climatic,  psychological, organizational, material -- you cannot list them  all. If you turn to preceding years, it is in spring that the  mass revolts of the miners occur, with the protest actions of  the metallurgists as their consequence. It becomes clear to  anyone: in these months, the work of all the units should be  organized with particular precision, without any breaks.    Specialists of the International Bank of Reconstruction and  Development (IBRD), in drawing up predictions of a way out of  the crisis in various regions and Russia as a whole, feel that  the basic economic and social problems can be solved in a region  or city taken individually, without waiting for them to be fully  resolved throughout the country. The Chelyabinsk citizens were  not acquainted with the conclusions of the foreign scholars, but  nevertheless, every third one (32 percent) intuitively agreed  with them -- they can be solved in our city, they can! Some 54  percent reject this idea. The IBRD asserts that the industrial  regions, where the metallurgical industry predominates, will  start to come out of the crisis first. This includes Chelyabinsk  and Chelyabinsk Oblast.  <H8>  Feedback </H8>   One of Russia's leading sociologists asserts: "With  socialism  there was complete agreement of opinion -- anyone who thought  otherwise would find himself subject to the action of the  repressive organs. Today, any authority, in order to hold its  ground, must know the opinion of the people and amend its work  in accordance with the reaction of the people." Feedback today  is not a tribute to fashion, but a vital necessity for any level  of authority. This feedback is working in Chelyabinsk.</p>

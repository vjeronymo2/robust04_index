			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Underwriting fees There has been a hostile reaction to Mr Paul Marsh's report on UK sub-underwriting commissions from some sections of the City. The current system for raising capital through rights issues suits the City very well. Many institutions and merchant banks fear that the OFT-sponsored report will provide useful ammunition for those seeking to move London towards the New York model for raising equity. But the report does not question the virtues of the rights issue system. It merely argues that the fixed 1.25 per cent commission paid to sub-underwriters provides them with excess returns. Mr Marsh calculates these by using an option valuation method to establish a 'fair' price in each case. This is based partly on the historic volatility of a particular share price which his critics argue is likely to change during a rights issue. In fact, the evidence suggests volatility actually falls. Other criticisms of the methodology are somewhat undermined by the fact that some aggressive investment banks are using similar techniques to price their risks. If Mr Marsh's case that there are excess returns looks strong, it is less clear what should be done. The authorities could simply force a reduction in the flat rate, though that would still mean strong issuers were subsidising the weak. Issuers themselves could haggle with their advisers and threaten to go elsewhere. In practice, they do not because they are afraid that their plans will leak out. But maybe the conventional wisdom that impending rights issues must be kept secret needs to be challenged.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Markets: Investing in the cult of personality - London ON WEDNESDAY, the stock market had to divide its attention between a Pounds 500m bet on the property cycle and a Dollars 5bn commitment to global leadership in the 21st century's most important industry. No prizes for guessing which stimulated more excitement. It was the announcement that George Soros, 'the man who broke the Bank of England' on Black Wednesday, was buying a Pounds 34m stake in British Land and setting up with it a Pounds 500m partnership to buy UK property. Investors pushed up British Land's shares by 46p to 344p, brushing aside the company's accompanying Pounds 132m rights issue and helping the property sector as a whole to rise 6 per cent on the day. By comparison, British Telecom's news had much less impact on share prices. BT is paying Dollars 4bn to buy a 20 per cent stake in MCI, America's second-biggest long-distance phone company, and creating a Dollars 1bn joint venture to serve the global communication needs of multinationals. BT shares closed down 5p on the day, at 421 1/2 p. The only side-effect was a mild flurry of interest in the shares of Cable &amp; Wireless and Vodafone, seen as potential partners for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. The contrast between the two reactions illustrates, perhaps, that investors are more comfortable with straightforward questions of timing and personality than complex judgments about a company's vision and abilities. Soros's property play was a reassuring validation - by the man who is, at present, the world's most influential investor - of the conclusion the market reached some time ago: that the UK property market is past its worst. Since investors cling to the visceral belief that timing property right is one of the few sure-fire ways of making money in the UK, their reaction is not surprising. As the chart alongside shows, however, in the very long run neither property shares in general, nor the talents of John Ritblat, British Land's boss since 1970, are a guarantee of sustained outperformance. The question hanging over property shares - is there still lots of recovery to come, or has the 92 per cent rise since September exhausted the immediate potential for gains? - is also an issue for investors considering other kinds of cyclical stocks. For property, the Soros/Ritblat deal went some way to assuage any worries this week. For other cyclical sectors, however, the jury is still out - a thought underlined by a research note from Sushil Wadhwani and colleagues at Goldman Sachs. Looking back at how cyclical sectors have done during other recessions, they find that the usual period of outperformance, as the market anticipates economic recovery, comes to an end 6-9 months after the economy touches bottom, to be followed by a period of underperformance. If September 1992 is the trough of the most recent recession, that might make you think that the period of strong gains by cyclical stocks is now drawing to a close. Goldman Sachs concludes, indeed, that a large part of the cyclicals' outperformance is probably over. Every cycle has its quirks, however. One striking factor this time is that the market's fears that ERM membership would prolong the recession long beyond its natural trough postponed the moment at which the cyclicals' outperformance began. Usually, a number of cyclical sectors - banks, property, electricals, building materials - start outperforming the rest of the market well ahead of the moment the economy starts its own recovery. This time round, that did not happen. Almost all the cyclical sectors did worse than the market as a whole in the period before Black Wednesday. They have since done much better, but some may still have ground to make up to compensate for their relatively late start in the business of outperformance. Goldman Sachs thinks contracting and construction, electricals, hotels and leisure, motors, and (you guessed it) property are all sectors where there is still scope for further outperformance. For the market as a whole, this was another week trapped inside the trading range of 2,780 and 2,880 on the FT-SE 100 index. The upper and lower boundaries of this range, set six weeks ago, came under little threat in a week when much of the City seemed still to be celebrating Monday's bank holiday. For those at their desks, there was the stimulus of renewed speculation about a possible cut in base rates, perhaps timed to accompany Kenneth Clarke's first set-piece policy speech as chancellor at the Mansion House on June 15. Bank of England actions in the money markets appeared first to be steering the market away from this conclusion, by keeping money tight, then to be lending support to it by offering money on a two-week basis (which coincides with the speech) rather than the more normal three. The net effect of these actions - and of some money supply figures which raised the possibility that the recovery was slowing down prematurely - was to leave a lingering impression that an interest rate cut might indeed be possible. As the week drew to a close, the most intriguing news was the announcement that Transatlantic Holdings, the financial services group chaired by Donald Gordon of South Africa, had taken a 3 per cent stake in Sun Alliance, the insurer. 'We see this as a strategic investment in embryo,' said Gordon, implying that, in time, the embryo would grow. In the mid-1980s, Transatlantic acquired a similar embryonic shareholding in Sun Life, which matured in time into a 50 per cent controlling stake. On Friday, the market reacted to this thought by marking Sun Alliance shares up 5 per cent, to 350p. As with George Soros, the 'who' of the investment was more important, in the short run, than the 'what.'</p>

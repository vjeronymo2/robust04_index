			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Sport: Shafts of sunlight in the shopping malls - Baseball THE BASEBALL fan is both objective and subjective. Dispassionate views may be held about players, managers, hot dogs, ballparks, even commissioners who get sacked by avaricious mill owners, as was poor Fay Vincent's fate this year. But there is no substitute for true passion - and for that a handy team is the minimum daily requirement. In this age of cable and satellite, very different from my last full season ten years ago, that team may not necessarily be next door. Here in Washington, superstations beam in the Atlanta Braves, whose pitching is a pleasure to watch, and the New York Mets, who, Eddie Murray apart, please only masochists. ESPN also provides a catholic nation wide service, extending, for the east coast insomniac, to broadcasts of the Los Angeles Dodgers, more error-ridden and lamentable than even the Mets. But all this has been couch potato ersatz compared with the undiluted joy of the real thing 45 minutes down the road. If there has been an undisputed rookie of the season it has been Camden Yards, home of the Baltimore Orioles, a distinguished new-old stadium built on the spot where Babe Ruth is believed to have been born and nestling majestically among the warehouses of the inner city. Baseball is, after all, both a city and a country game, to be played in fields of dreams not suburban shopping malls. Camden Yards sold out just about every home game in this its first year. Perhaps even more miraculously, the Orioles rose to the occasion. Having lost 95 (out of 162) games last year, they won 89 this season and were in contention for the American League East pennant until the penultimate Sunday of the season, dogging the much more talented Toronto Blue Jays, and only passed in the home stretch by the resurgent Milwaukee Brewers. They did it the old-fashioned way with sound fundamentals - solid fielding, timely hitting and some exceptional pitching - just like the good old days when Earl Weaver managed the Robinsons, McNally, Palmer and Eddie Murray into the side with the best record in baseball for 20 years from the mid-60s. Curiously, the Oriole's main man, Cal Ripken Jr, 1991's most valuable player, had the worst year of his career. Still, he came out of it with a Dollars 30m five year contract, the highest ever and just reward for ten great years. With nearly 1,800 consecutive games under his belt, he is on schedule, barring injury or complete loss of form, to pass Lou Gehrig's record in 1995; it ought to be in Baltimore. Round about that time, with a little luck, Mike Mussina may have record of about 60 wins and 15 losses. In fact, if he pitches like he did in August and September, he may never lose another game. Mind you, the same could have been said of Steve Avery of the Braves after last season; this year he lost as many as he won. Mussina, in his first full season, won 18 games, lost five, averaged 7 2/3 innings per start, and gave up only just over 2 1/2 runs an outing. Only 23, trim almost to the point of fragility, studious but self-confident, the fast ball is quick enough, the knuckle curve wicked, the change-up capable of rearranging a batter's spine and the control immaculate. He may have no more natural ability than the Orioles' other young phenomenon, Ben MacDonald, but the head is ten years older. Robin Yount of Milwaukee and George Brett of Kansas City racked up 3,000 lifetime hits. Neither has ever hawked his wares to another club. Dave Winfield, who does all the time, this year for Toronto, became the oldest man ever to drive in 100 runs. Frank Tanana of Detroit continued to win as he approaches 40. Tanana was a flamethrowing lefty of the mid-70s. Shoulder surgery has reduced him to a crafty military medium. The game I wish I had seen was in August in a suburban shopping mall in Texas, Tanana against the even older Nolan Ryan, still throwing as hard as he did when they were team mates in California. Deviousness beat smoke and Texas did not get a run. Of all those, only Winfield and Avery are taking part in post-season play. The regular season title chases were underwhelming, with Pittsburgh, Atlanta and Oakland locking up their leagues by early September. As a result I advised the sports editor a week ago - and, amazingly, he concurred - that the Braves would beat the Pirates simply because they had the best and deepest pitching, and that the banged up but experienced Athletics would knock off the Blue Jays because they had the best manager in the game in Tony La Russa and because Toronto is not on US soil. These predictions looked impeccable after the Braves established a 3-1 lead and the Athletics split the first two games in Toronto. But, for Pittsburgh, Barry Bonds discovered that he was allowed to hit the ball in post-season play while Tim Wakefield, the casual young knuckleballer, befuddled the Braves with gentle deliveries that danced three pasodobles and four entrechats en route to the plate. On Thursday in Atlanta, the Pirates stood on the threshold of the World Series, up 2-1, two out in the bottom of the ninth, when the unheard of Francesco Cabrera, with only ten appearances at bat all season, drove a two run single to left. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, had shown that talent on the field can beat brains off it and beat Oakland four games to two. Atlanta is worth sticking with, even though its pitching now looks almost fragile. The Braves lost narrowly the series in seven games last year while Toronto has never been this far. Any bet is worth only a nickel, but no bet can even be applied to the existence of next season, with the mill owners rampant and apparently dead set on a collision course with the players, the umpires, the fans and everybody else who denies them their unalienable right to make a fortune.</p>

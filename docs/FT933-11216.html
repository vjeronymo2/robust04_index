			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Twilight of the ERM It is hard to see what can hold the ERM together after yesterday's Bundesbank refusal to cut its discount rate. The bank's decision looks odd after Wednesday's cut in its repurchase rate and leaves the impression of wide disagreements within its central council. But the clear message is that most council members remain in favour of putting domestic considerations first. That is, after all, logical. Had the Bundesbank cut its discount rate for the second time in a month just to save the French franc, its credibility as the guardian of sound money would have suffered serious damage. There is little in Germany's domestic situation to justify further relaxation. Inflation and money supply growth remain excessive. Significantly, the German bond market weakened when a cut was expected ahead of yesterday's meeting, a sign that financial markets were worried about the inflationary consequences of premature easing. The days of self-delusion are, however, past. German rates will not come down far enough or fast enough to refloat the French economy. The peseta, escudo and the Danish krone look more immediately threatened. But barring a miracle it looks only a matter of time before the French franc's position in the ERM is untenable too. Intervention on yesterday's scale cannot continue indefinitely, especially since that would once again put German money supply targets out of reach. Today's French unemployment data may determine the timing of the final denouement. Thereafter the market would be back to judging currencies on their fundamentals. Comparison with the franc might then quickly put the mighty D-Mark in a much less favourable light. Yesterday it was already falling sharply against the dollar.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: BTR sells Meggitt stake TAKEOVER speculation surrounding BTR intensified after it placed its 17.2 per cent stake in engineering group Meggitt. In a bought deal, Smith New Court, Meggitt's broker, is believed to have purchased the 36.9m shares from BTR at 100p cum-dividend, placing between 11m and 12m at 101p cum-div, and the remainder, around 25m, at 98p xd. Although Meggitt was said to have initiated the deal, the move led to increased speculation that the proceeds from the sale would go towards BTR's takeover war chest. Lucas Industries remains the market's favourite bid target for BTR but there was some suggestion that it may be Pilkington, which escaped its clutches after a bitter and acrimonious Pounds 1.2bn battle six years ago. BTR put on 2 at 619p, and Meggitt, which also benefited from a buy circular from its broker earlier this week, firmed  1/2 to 101p. The bid speculation continued to boost Lucas and it added 2 1/2 at 134 1/2 p in trade of 6m, while Pilkington ended 3 better at 130p on volume of 6.5m.</p>

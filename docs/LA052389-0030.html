			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P>  Yuba Natural Resources, the troubled mining firm whose former chairman,  Richard Silberman, was arrested April 7 on money-laundering charges, has made  an overdue $131,000 payment to the U. S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of  Land Management as part of a settlement of mineral trespass charges.  </P> <P> The payment, which was due April 1, stemmed from charges filed by the bureau  last year in connection with Yuba's 9,900-acre mining field near Marysville.  Yuba still owes the bureau $400,000, which it will pay off in annual  installments through 1993, bureau area manager Deane Swickard said Monday.  </P> <P> Yuba, which is hard-pressed for working capital, generated the money by selling  hunting and fishing rights on part of its land to a sportsmen's club, Yuba  spokesman Marshall Mintz said.  </P> <P> Yuba is still negotiating to refinance an overdue $6.5-million loan from Bank  of America, he said.  </P></p>

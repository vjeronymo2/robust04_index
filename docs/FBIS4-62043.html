			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- Chairman of the Russian  Government, Viktor Chernomyrdin, believes that only a strictly  balanced budget can mobilize the market. A statement to this  effect was made by the Russian prime minister on Wednesday as he  addressed lawmakers of the State Duma during debates on a draft  law on the state budget for 1994.    According to Chernomyrdin, the suggested figures of  budgetary  expenditures and revenues and the budget deficit envisaged by  the draft law and insisted upon by the Russian Government will  enable to keep inflation rates under control.    If the suggested federal budget is not approved by the State  Duma as soon as possible, the Government will be devoid of  starting points necessary for the formation of its economic  policy. If the Duma approves of key figures of the state  budget, Russian lawmakers jointly with the Government will be  able to finalize the draft in a calm and orderly way,  redistribute funds and decide "where to channel extra funds and  at whose expense," Chernomyrdin said.</p>

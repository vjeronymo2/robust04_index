			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Talks resume on ending conflict in Guatemala The Guatemalan government and left-wing guerrillas resumed peace talks yesterday in a new bid to end their 33-year conflict. The talks in Mexico between the government and the guerrillas of the National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unit come amid a climate of instability fuelled by recent coup rumours and apparent divisions in the army over the possible outcome of the talks. The negotiations, at which a United Nations moderator will be present, are to address the delicate issue of a human rights agreement and the creation of a commission to investigate past abuses. The meeting will be the first since the signing of a framework agreement in January, in which both sides stated their political will to reach a settlement this year. Guatemala's President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, a former human rights official who became head of state last June, badly needs a public relations victory, after his image has begun to wilt both locally and internationally. But senior army officers, including the minister of defence, have made it clear they take a dim view of a proposal to form a commission which would investigate violations during the internal conflict, which has cost more than 100,000 lives. The substantial constituency in the army against the peace talks, and particularly an investigative commission, has cast doubt on professed optimism in government circles of an imminent breakthrough. However, sources close to the government delegation believe the guerrillas may allow discussions on the commission to be put to one side. The guerrillas have maintained throughout the four-year long negotiations that the creation of such a commission, and a commitment to international verification of human rights observance, are requirements if it is to sign an agreement on human rights. The issue has highlighted divisions between the civilian government and the military. Mr Hector Rosada, the head of the government's team in the talks, which includes two generals and a colonel, has said that a commission is necessary if peace is to bring minimal comfort to the hundreds of thousands of relatives of victims during the conflict.</p>

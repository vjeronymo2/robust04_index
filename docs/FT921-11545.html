			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television One of the most promising schedules tonight, as so often, is Radio 4's. From Chris Serle's Pick Of The Week at 7.20 through to The Financial Week with Nigel Cassidy at 11.25, is a constant flow of tempting material. It includes Any Questions at 8.05, which this week has two non-politicians (banker/novelist Janet Cohen and columnist Alan Watkins), Marcel Berlins' weekly Law In Action (8.50), the FT's Nigel Andrews reporting on the career of film director Barry Levinson in Kaleidoscope (9.15), Alistair Cooke's still compelling Letter From America, and, one of the best 24-hour news wrap-ups in the business, The World Tonight (10.00). BBC television's social affairs series Public Eye begins another run with a programme about atavistic attitudes in education: the desire to see children taught in the way one's grandparents were taught (8.00 BBC2). Victoria Wood  -As Seen On TV (9.00 BBC2) is one of those series which not only deserves a repeat, it actually stands up very well to being watched twice. Arena goes for one of those quirky editions which may soar triumphantly or flop disastrously: Peter Blake paints the portrait of masked wrestler Kendo Nagasaki.</p>

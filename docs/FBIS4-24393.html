			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- At a national telephone  conference on the inspection of the Statistics Law enforcement  tonight, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua said that effective measures  should be taken in a timely fashion to stop negative and corrupt  behavior, such as daring to defy the law, seriously running  counter to the party's ideological line of seeking truth from  facts, and practicing fraud in statistics data. He urged all  localities and departments to put inspection work high on the  agenda and try to achieve practical results.    Zou Jiahua said: In light of the guiding spirit of the  Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress  concerning resolutely combating fraud and proneness to boasting  and exaggeration and striving to improve the work of statistical  and administrative supervision and auditing supervision, the  State Statistical Bureau, the Supervision Ministry, and the  Legislative Affairs Bureau are launching a nationwide inspection  of the Statistics Law enforcement. The inspection drive is  important to correcting the party's work style and guaranteeing  the state's scientific decision-making and modern management.  Meanwhile, the inspection drive also plays an important role in  strengthening the building of the Statistics Law system and in  pushing forward the reform of statistics work.    Zou Jiahua continued: Since the promulgation of the  Statistics Law, China has achieved great results in statistics  work over the past 10 years and more. Meanwhile, we should have  a clear understanding of the existing problems. At present,  phenomena such as being late in filing statistics reports or  refusing to file them at all are very flagrant. The practices  of boasting, exaggeration, and fraud, mainly caused by the  changes of the interest pattern, begin to emerge in some  localities and units and become very serious in some localities.  Resolute efforts should be made to stop such behaviors.  Otherwise, these practices will lead to incorrect statistical  data, which in turn will cause the state to make wrong  macroeconomic decisions and bring about serious consequences to  economic development.    Zou Jiahua said: While carrying out this inspection, first  of all, localities and departments should make great efforts to  strengthen the educational campaign to publicize and enforce the  Statistics Law. Any one, including party and government leaders  whose jobs are related to statistics work, should learn,  understand, conscientiously observe, and strictly carry out the  Statistics Law. While carrying out this inspection, we should  conduct a thoroughgoing investigation of the new situations and  problems in implementing the Statistics Law and sum them up.  Great efforts should be made to amend the law to improve the  statistics legal system. It is necessary to conscientiously sum  up practical experiences at home and boldly borrow foreign  countries' successful practices. We should strive to be  specific and concrete in setting up our statistics requirements.  In this way, we can establish a supervision and control  mechanics that will enable us to guide, push forward, and  guarantee the smooth progress of the statistics work reform to  prevent and eradicate the corruptive phenomena of artificially  imposed obstacles and frauds.    Zou Jiahua stressed: The following people will be severely  punished--anyone who refuses to perform statistics obligations,  who is late in reporting statistics data or refuses to report  statistics data, who files incorrect statistics data, who  fabricates or changes statistics data, who forces or incites  statistics organizations or personnel to practice fraud in  statistics data, who fabricates statistics data to cover up  serious mistakes or fish for honor, position, or other personal  objectives, who brings about losses or bad consequences to the  interests of the state and the people, who retaliates against  those who dare to adhere to the principle and expose violators  of the Statistics Law, and who obstructs those who conduct  investigations on illegal statistics practices. If a case is  particularly severe, it will be exposed in the newspapers. We  should ensure that whenever a wrong practice is dealt with, all  the people will learn from it.</p>

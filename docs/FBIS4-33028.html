On 23 May, the Foreign Trade Institute reported that  Colombian imports during the first four months of 1994 totaled  $5.278 million. This represents a 22.7 percent increase over the  same period last year. Imports of raw materials amounted to  $2.1746 million -- 41.2 percent of all imports during the same  period. The United States continues to be Colombia's main  supplier. Venezuela is second.

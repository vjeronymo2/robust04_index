			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC EXTENDS ITS REACH  </P> <P> The University of Southern California is wiring itself for the 21st Century as  a crew from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph installs a new  telecommunications nerve center. The so-called Integrated Services Digital  Network, or ISDN, will enable faculty and researchers to communicate with  colleagues around the world over a system that carries voice, pictures and  computer data simultaneously over the same telephone line.  </P> <P> "USC is part of a worldwide research community," said spokesman Hugh Kelley.  "We have a tremendous interaction with other countries and other organizations  worldwide."  </P> <P> Under a $23-million contract, AT&amp;T also is delivering 10,000 telephone sets  (3,000 of them ISDN-compatible), a network management system, a microwave radio  link, fiber-optic and coaxial cables and three equipment rooms as well as  maintenance service.  </P> <P> When the new system starts operating in the fall, USC will join the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology and North Carolina's Duke University as  the only U.S. institutions of higher learning with ISDN technology.

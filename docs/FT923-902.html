			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Interest savings boost More O'Ferrall A DROP in interest charges helped More O'Ferrall, the billboard and bus shelter advertising contractor, increase pre-tax profits by 15 per cent, from Pounds 812,000 to Pounds 936,000, for the six months to June 30. Mr Russell Gore-Andrews, chairman, said the overall advertising market continued to be 'short-term and erratic'. Revenues were up in the third quarter, but there was 'a long way to go before we get anywhere near recovery,' he said. Much would depend on the outcome of the economic situation in the UK over the next six weeks. Nevertheless, the interim dividend is again 3.2p, and uncovered for the second consecutive year with unchanged earnings per share of 2.1p. Mr Gore-Andrews said the pay-out had been held as there was 'no reason for thinking that things are going to be any worse than last year'. Turnover was down by 1 per cent to Pounds 28.6m. The Pounds 13m 1-for-4 rights issue in October last year was responsible for a drop in interest payments from Pounds 1.65m to Pounds 857,000. However, gearing currently stood a little above the 26 per cent of June 30 and was expected to remain so. Mr Gore-Andrews said business in the first quarter had been 'extremely poor in relation to a very good quarter in 1991'. Poster advertising declined by 10 per cent, compared with an advance of 15 per cent in 1991. The improved second quarter had not been enough to avert an overall decline in operating profits of 27 per cent to Pounds 1.79m during the first half. Sharpest drop was in the UK, where profits fell by 81 per cent to Pounds 241,000 on turnover 5 per cent down at Pounds 16.5m. The deepening recession in France resulted in a 60 per cent decline in profits there to Pounds 263,000. Belgium improved significantly, following the reorganisation of the Visibility business acquired in 1990; profits increased from Pounds 570,000 to Pounds 1.32m.</p>

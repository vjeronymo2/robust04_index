			<p>Contaminants   Using Sunlight   <F P=102> 94FE0402F Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 31 Jan 94  p 5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0402F </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] TSUKUBA -- The AIST National Institute for Resources  and Environment developed a photocatalytic sheet that absorbs  and decomposes air contaminants using sunlight. By simply  placing it outdoors, the sheet draws out of the air contaminants  such as oxides of nitrogen (NO[.sub]x[/]) and oxides of  sulfur (SO[.sub]x[/]). Without any human intervention or the  addition of any artificial energy, the action of sunlight  hitting the sheet gives rise to a photochemical reaction on the  sheet's surface. Even if the effectiveness of the catalyst  drops, the sheet's functionality is restored by washing the  surface. The National Institute for Resources and Environment  thinks the sheet is suited for use on the outer walls of  buildings and in preventing noise near freeways.    The sheet uses titanium oxide, a catalyst that reacts with  NO[.sub]x[/] and sulfur dioxide (SO[.sub]2[/]).  NO[.sub]x[/] can be recovered in the form of nitric acid. To  prevent the production of nitrogen dioxide during the reaction  process, the sheet is formed from titanium oxide and activated  carbon, an absorbent, in which a porous fluororesin is  dispersed. The ratios of catalyst, activated carbon, and  fluororesin by weight were 3:1:6.    The catalyst can decompose NO[.sub]x[/] if near-infrared  light hits the sheet with about the same strength of sunlight on  a cloudy winter day (0.1 mW/cm[.sup]2[/]). The sheet is  effective for NO[.sub]x[/] concentrations ranging from the  usual 0.05 PPM in the air to high concentrations near tunnels.    The sheet's NO[.sub]x[/] removal rate drops to about half  after 150 hours of use because nitric acid accumulates on the  sheet's surface. However, a trial-produced sheet was restored  back to its original effectiveness by washing it with water, and  the sheet was all right after dozens of washings. Although trace  quantities of nitric acid are present in the water after  washing, it can be detoxified by putting some lime in the path  of the runoff wash water. As for the titanium oxide, even if it  is blown around in a strong wind it will not be damaged.    The research group roughly estimated that the sheet can  reduce amounts of NO[.sub]x[/] by about 20% when used in the  spaces between buildings in the center of a city. In the future,  the group will research methods of combining materials in forms  other than sheets, e.g., paints and tiles.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: Mistress and Muse CLOSE up, this work, which bills itself as a sophisticated sex comedy, is a bedlam of competing imperatives: sex, friendship, work. From a distance, it is a serious modern version of two myths: a little of what you fancy does you good, and great art comes from great pain. It makes an exciting evening checked by occasional tedium. In essence, Mistress and Muse attempts for the studio stage what Something Wild and Sex, Lies and Videotape did for the big screen: great sex can alter one's life, but it demands sacrifices. Situation rather than plot drives the play. James, a cerebral painter of grey abstracts, has a new lodger. She is a stripper called Goldie; she seduces him on her first night, rehearsing her latest raunchy routine. Mind meets body. Her idea of love is sharing strawberries and gyrating to James Brown; his is sharing Nietzsche and undulating to Dave Brubeck. She sets him straight and they become lovers. James has the wit to see his own problem clearly: 'She brings out the worst in me,' he says, 'she's so emotional.' At first, as James' sexist friend Charles says, it's 'more sex, less art', but gradually the muse descends, and James starts painting well. But Goldie exists by creating chaos, breaking up order, and his life soon becomes intolerable. She respects neither time nor place. She pleases James with sexual treats, luxuries from the delicatessen rather than basic groceries. Practical life stops when she behaves like a spoilt child demanding unconditional love. Finally she cuts her wrists and daubs one of his paintings with blood; she recovers in hospital; the painting turns out to be his most valuable work. Six months on, James weds the sensible, staid Amanda, fulfilling the popular wisdom that a man marries the woman he can't love, and loves the woman he can't marry. The play is often confused, sometimes confusing. But it successfully makes questions of value and lifestyle into moral matters, like Forster in Howards End: 'Only connect the prose and the passion.' The acting is sharp and bold, particularly from Laurie Brett as the feline Goldie and Nigel Carrington as the old-style sexist Charles ('I noticed her personality when she bent down to pick up her bags'). The nervousness and tentative gestures will mellow as the play matures. John Cooper's dialogue creaks in places by being too formal and ceremonious; and William Tanner's direction could be wilder. Pentameters Theatre, Hampstead, until 21 June, (071) 435 3648.</p>

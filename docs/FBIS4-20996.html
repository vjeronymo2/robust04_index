Jayamani T. Palanisamy, the owner of a  retail shop, after he was found guilty of distributing 250 gr of  marijuana four years ago.    Chief Justice Mohamed Ghazali Mohamed Yusoff handed down  this  sentence after he had heard arguments from the public prosecutor  and counsel for the accused on 8 February.    When the sentence was announced, P. Jayamani seemed to be  calm and even smiled briefly at several members of the High  Court.    P. Jayamani, 30 years of age, was found to have committed  the  act of which he was accused at a coffee shop near Jalan Bayam 13  in Permas Jaya at about 1430 on 26 January 1992.    He was arrested by a detective who had been given the task  of  acting like a person purchasing drugs from P. Jayamani at that  time.    P. Jayamani was sentenced under the provisions of Section  39B  (1) (a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1952.    Previously, in his defense P. Jayamani told the High Court  that he knew nothing about the contents of the plastic bag which  he carried for delivery to two men.    P. Jayamani said that he was only asked to turn over the  plastic bag tucked into his waist by a man known as Maniam who  was related to his wife.    According to P. Jayamani, he did not open the plastic bag to  find out what its contents were because he did not suspect  anything.    However, when he arrived at the place indicated by Maniam,  he  met two men. They later asked him about the package which he had  been asked to deliver.    P. Jayamani said that he was suddenly seized by a man  standing behind him when he was asked to turn over the package  to another man. Then he was handcuffed.</p>

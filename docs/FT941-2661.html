			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Malaysian affair - insensitivity and mistaken beliefs (2) Sir, Dr Mahathir Bin Mohamad's letter (March 17) clearly puts the record straight on the Pergau Dam project. A soft loan granted by the British government to Malaysia has been misinterpreted by some sections of the press as an outright grant at the expense of the British public. The failure of the British government to intervene and to tell the truth has aggravated the situation. Malaysia may be harsh in its action on the trade embargo. But what alternative course is there for a small nation like Malaysia whose views are not heard and published in the so-called free press? The press in Britain should also learn to tell the truth.

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Travel: Africa - my own private tryst list - Michael Holman discloses the names of special hotels that he trusts for assignations THE SULTAN'S band no longer plays outside the English Club in Zanzibar. It used to, every Thursday evening, according to my guidebook. But that was published in 1952, when the island was a British protectorate. Some 30 years later I sat on the balcony of the club and watched the dhows drift by at sunset. The band stopped playing at independence in December 1963. The club had become the Africa House Hotel, its past revealed by the battered snooker table and a faded sign pointing to the 'Ladies Powder Room'. As in many of my favourite African hotels, ghosts seemed to walk the club's corridors and prop up the bar. Like the club, the hotels usually have high ceilings and creaky fans, mosquito nets and wide verandas. The bedroom keys have worn wooden tags, the cast-iron baths rest on clawed feet, and the bar has trophies of long-forgotten tournaments. They are on my idiosyncratic African tryst list: scenes of assignations with companions real or imagined. Hotels where, by chance or design, I have met up with a friend; or which were my destination in a search for the past. Most of them are - or were in their heyday - tourist hotels in the conventional sense, either set amid spectacular scenery or near man-made marvels. They still provide hospitality, though many show the strains of the continent's crisis. But my judgment of their appeal is flawed, distorted by that narcotic nostalgia, or by the strange juxtapositions of life as a journalist in Africa. Being a witness to poverty and distress and then retreating to comfort and security; or simply thankful to have survived a long car journey or bumpy flight, accentuates the pleasures of the senses. Never has chablis tasted so good as at the Hotel de la Gare in Lubumbashi, southern Zaire, in the wake of one the abortive uprisings against President Mobutu. Nor has my thirst been slaked so well as by the cold beer served on arrival at the Mweya Safari Lodge, high above Lake Edward in eastern Uganda, at the end of a fraught and dusty journey from Kampala, not long after Idi Amin's downfall. Seldom have I enjoyed my Davidoff cigar more than on the lawn of the hotel at Bahar Dar on the banks of Lake Tana in central Ethiopia. On the horizon was one of the lake's ancient island monasteries, some dating back to the 13th century. The monks still observed age-old rituals of meditation and prayer. Other unsung wonders of Africa are served by the hotels on my list. War made some of them well-nigh inaccessible for most visitors. Peace has since brought them within reach, although they remain hard to get at for all but the determined visitor, who will have to brave pot-holed roads and endure rickety aircraft. The modest hotel in Lalibela, in northern Ethiopia, overlooks a wondrous spectacle - 12 churches hewn out of solid rock over 800 years ago. From the Gohar hotel, high in the hills that surround Gondar in north-eastern Ethiopia, one looks down in the valley with the 17th century castle of Emperor Fasiladas. At the window of a dilapidated hotel I watched dawn break over Mozambique island, where Vasco da Gama's ships cast anchor in 1498. Sunrise revealed a 16th century Portuguese town, transplanted to the east African coast and frozen in time. It was the capital of Mozambique until the end of the last century; now it is a crumbling relic of 400 years of colonial rule. The upper floor view from the hotel on the island of Goree, off Dakar, Senegal, takes in the picturesque harbour as well as a neglected monument to Africa's holocaust - the island's slave house, the last staging post in a terrible journey. The slave trade has been called the greatest forced migration in the history of man. Between 1650 and 1850, the period when the trade flourished, some 12m slaves were landed in the Americas, according to one estimate. It is calculated that 2m perished on the journey and 7m died before embarkation. Their ghosts can be found on Goree. Some of my favourite hotels are long gone, like old Meikles Hotel in Harare, which had high ceilings and wide red-polished verandas. Some are preserved and thriving: the Mount Nelson Hotel, for example, in the shadow of Cape Town's Table Mountain. Union Castle passenger liners used to carry hotel guests across the Atlantic from Southampton, a two-week voyage I did as a child. They now step off a 12-hour flight from London; but the hotel still recalls an era past and residents write postcards home from escritoires in a stately lounge. Some have evocative names, like the Mountain of the Moons Hotel, Fort Portal, in western Uganda, overlooking the Ruwenzori Mountains. Others have powerful associations, like the hotel in Stanleyville, now Kisangani, on the bend in the Congo river made famous by V S Naipaul's classic novel. They were terrible times in the Congo in the 1960s. The Belgian Congo, now Zaire, was in bloody post-independence upheaval. The country symbolised anarchy: a confusing battlefield of communists, nationalists, secessionists, mercenaries and United Nations troops. Belgian refugees streamed across the border with Northern Rhodesia. To the whites of neighbouring Southern Rhodesia, it seemed a harbinger of their own fate. Schoolboy memories of Stanleyville, whose reverberations reached me in my home in Gwelo, Rhodesia, would have been enough in themselves to draw me to the city. But my interest was whetted by the recollections of journalists who covered the Congo, equipped with Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriters, and who filed by cable. Some ended their careers in Salisbury, ancient mariners telling tales of expense claims on a heroic scale. It was not until 1985 that I made my pilgrimage. The hotel had become a pit-stop for trans-Africa safaris, but the ghosts were there. Other hotels on my list I arrived at by chance. Like the Karibu Hotel near Goma, in eastern Zaire, with a wine list that harked back to the days when coffee exports flourished and French fashions and Belgian chocolates were in the town's high street windows. I was stranded at the airport one minute, the next minute rescued by the local coffee baron and drinking champagne on the banks of Lake Kivu. The crisp air and the mountainous scenery were a world away from the steamy heat and seamy intrigue of Kinshasa. Even Fanta orangeade tasted special in the Restaurant Ca Depend, off the main road from the airport to Goma. It was served with engaging informality, the proprietress nonchalantly uncapping the bottle with her teeth, plonking it down on the red-and-white check tablecloth, and chewing the cap reflectively as she moved back behind the counter. Some while ago I added the Pointe Venus Hotel on the Indian Ocean island of Rodrigues to my tryst list. A wood-slatted verandah surrounds an elegant but fading colonial residence, one of the first built on the island, and perched above Port Mathurin. But closest to my heart is the Kuchawe Inn, on Malawi's Zomba Plateau. It is a 30-minute drive from Zomba, the sleepy former colonial capital. The rooms are on the very lip of the plateau, each with its own balcony. I recall morning tea while looking down on hawks circling in the valley; fresh strawberries; an idyllic lake; cows as sleek as if they lived in Switzerland; and walking in the plateau's cool forest with the ghosts of old Malawi and a companion by my side.</p>

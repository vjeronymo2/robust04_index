			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours Newcast"] </F>   [Text] Colombia signed a trade and economic cooperation  agreement with 31 Caribbean countries this evening. Foreign  Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos explained the scope of the  agreement.    [Begin Santos recording] A great opportunity has been opened  for Colombia's productive sector because at this time we export  to the Caribbean no more than $65 million. This is the first  time the Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] has signed an  agreement establishing reciprocity. In other words, we open our  markets to them and they in turn open their markets to us. That  had never happened before with the Caricom countries. In  addition, this means we are fulfilling to the letter all our  plans to open markets to Colombian products in the Latin  American region. [end recording]</p>

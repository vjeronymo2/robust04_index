			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POWER OF THE PRESS  </P> <P> Thank you for your continued efforts to put readers in touch with the many  small inns and lodges in Southern California. You recently published a letter,  "Small and Beautiful" (Nov. 13), from David Greenfield, one of our satisfied  guests who was pleased with his accommodations at the San Lorenzo, 777 San  Lorenzo Road, Palm Springs 92264, (619) 325-5166. Since that letter, we have  been inundated with requests for our brochure and have received many confirmed  reservations.  </P> <P> GRANT THOMPSON  </P> <P> Owner  </P></p>

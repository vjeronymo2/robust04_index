			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Bosnian president urges US to dispatch troops to border BOSNIAN president Alija Izetbegovic yesterday asked the US and other countries to send troops to the borders with neighbouring Serbia to stop the flow of arms into the war-torn republic. 'Aid will not stop the killing, the deportations and the ethnic cleansing,' said Mr Izetbegovic, who reached Helsinki by getting a lift on a relief flight from the besieged capital of Sarajevo on Wednesday. Mr Izetbegovic told the summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) that Bosnia needed 'arms to defend ourselves against the Serb aggressors'. 'It is a fraud that the Yugoslav army has withdrawn from Bosnia. It is here in another name. There are 80,000 Serbian-backed Yugoslav troops, 500 tanks, and 55 planes still in our republic. It is one of the best equipped armies in Europe.' US President George Bush and secretary of state James Baker yesterday made no explicit commitment to provide military aid to Bosnia. 'Our policy is that we do not believe that large infusions of arms into the crisis in what was Yugoslavia is going to solve the problem,' a US spokesman said. The US would continue to work with its European allies, and 'we will have to consider what our future steps will be.' A US diplomat suggested that efforts would be made to tighten the UN sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. Although several other CSCE countries repeated the US view, other countries, notably Canada and Czechoslovakia said the international response to the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina, as well as ethnic disputes in other former communist countries, was dangerous and shameful. Few delegates believe the CSCE's new mechanisms for peace-keeping or crisis management will have enough clout to stop the killing. Reuter adds from Strasbourg: The European Parliament recommended yesterday that Croatia be excluded from the EC aid programme for eastern Europe because of questions over its role in the Bosnian civil war. Some deputies charged that Croatia and Serbia had agreed to partition Bosnia-Hercegovina. EC Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said Brussels would prefer to give aid to both Croatia and Slovenia, but would delete Croatia from its proposal if the parliament wished.</p>

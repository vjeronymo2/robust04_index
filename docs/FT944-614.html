			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Revenue's error - Briefcase In May 1993 I was made redundant and my redundancy money was taxed via PAYE (the excess over Pounds 30,000). In June, I applied for and received a tax rebate as I had no intention of working for the rest of the tax year, nor claiming unemployment benefit. In August 1994, I completed a return for the tax year to April 1994. Recently, I received another tax rebate with my notice of assessment. It appears that the IR did not take into account the first tax rebate from June last year. Am I obliged to point out this error, which is in my favour? If I do not, what happens if or when the error is discovered? Wilful failure to point out the over-repayment could constitute a criminal offence under the Theft Act. The procedure for recovering over-repayments of tax is set out in section 30 of the Taxes Management Act 1970, as amended. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Valiyev] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, 30 May (ITAR-TASS) -- A military  delegation from Vietnam paid an unannounced visit to the DPRK  this month. The talks with the North Korean side covered a  number of issues, primarily the coming visit of the Vietnamese  defense minister to Pyongyang on 16 June, informed sources told  ITAR-TASS. The sources said the visit should have taken place  three days ago but was postponed for undisclosed reasons.    The republic's mass media said nothing about the Vietnamese  military delegation's visit. Local observers believe that the  sides are also making arrangements for the sale of rifles and  other arms manufactured in the north of the Korean peninsula.    Representatives of the Vietnamese Embassy in North Korea  denied that a Vietnamese military delegation visited North  Korea. According to them, the Vietnamese defense minister will  visit Pyongyang this year as planned earlier, but they declined  to say what is in the plan.</p>

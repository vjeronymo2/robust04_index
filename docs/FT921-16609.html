			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Celebrations for Tottenham Hotspur Tottenham Hotspur, owner of the north London football club, has room to celebrate. Mr Gary Lineker, Spurs' star striker, was awarded an OBE in the New Year's honours list and yesterday the club clinched a 2-1 victory over Coventry. After a 14 1/2 month suspension, Spurs' shares resumed trading on Tuesday, rising 9p, to 100p. Nevertheless the celebratory mood in the stock market is likely to be tinged with concern over what might happen to the club's performance on the field, if it loses Mr Paul Gascoigne to Italy and Mr Lineker to Japan.</p>

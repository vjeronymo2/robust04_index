Vladimir Shumeyko, chief of the organizing committee, has  already said that he is going to propose the vote right after  the question of voting procedure was resolved.    By many accounts, it is Mr. Shumeyko, elected in Kaliningrad  Oblast, who has the best chances to assume this job. He even  plans to ask Boris Yeltsin to allow him to combine his permanent  job at the Federation Council with being deputy prime minister.  Earlier, Vladimir Shumeyko had said that he did not consider  the future speaker as "a ceremonial figure, but as a  decisionmaking politician" -- apparently unlike "the first-night  speaker," Yuriy Chernichenko, who will open the senate's meeting  as the oldest deputy.    There have been no reports about any consultations among  other senators as to who would be their head. Viktor Stepanov,  chief of the Karelian Supreme Soviet, even suggested that there  should be no speaker in the upper chamber at all so that "no one  will manipulate the deputies." This option is unlikely to  materialize. What this means, however, is that Vladimir  Shumeyko may have as many as 169 competitors, but none of them  can seriously challenge him.    Still, one should proceed with care when forecasting the  results of the vote. The Federation Council, unlike the State  Duma, has so far been devoid of party lines. Any talk about  party factions in the council is yet out of the question: out  of 170 seats, the communists have 12; "Russia's Choice," 6; and  the Agrarian Party, 1. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy claims that senator  Leonid Polezhayev, Omsk Oblast governor, has connections with  his party. Mr. Polezhayev himself denies this. Mr. Shumeyko  has already said that he was "glad that the upper chamber does  not have any party affiliation." It is likely, however, that  territorial blocs will emerge in it instead of party factions.    Eduard Rossel, dismissed from governorship but still leader  of the Urals Economic Cooperation Association, continues his  efforts to form a group called "Deputies of the Urals." On  Monday evening, the council of the "Siberian Agreement"  association was meeting to work out its line of conduct; the  next meeting was scheduled for Wednesday.    The essence of the policies regional elites are expecting  their delegates to pursue was formulated fairly clearly by  conferences of entrepreneurs in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk,  Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, and Magadan: They requested that the  Far East authorities take protectionist measures to shield  domestic businesses and introduce tight taxation rules for  foreign entrepreneurs.</p>

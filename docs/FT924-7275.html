			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (2): Battle rages in the skies - International carriers are offering more services to maintain their share of lucrative business class traffic plus another Pounds 20m in advertising - to upgrade its Club World services on all long-haul routes is a clear example of just how seriously the world's airlines are wooing the business traveller. As the recession shows no real sign of ending, so BA and the other leading international carriers are being forced to offer an increasing range of services and perks to maintain their share of lucrative business class traffic. Everything from neck massage from a resident masseuse aboard Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic aircraft through to luxury limousines taking executives from door to door are being used to win business. But executives are not as easily persuaded by such blandishments as they were in the late 1980s. The reason, however, is not of their choosing: rather, it is a result of the decision by many companies to downgrade the class of travel for their executives. When a seat in economy class - or coach as it is known in the US - from London to New York costs a tenth of the business class fare, then it is easy to see why companies are increasingly instructing their executives to save money and fly in the cheaper seats. For the airlines this is serious news: the yield from full-fare paying business class travellers is the most profitable part of the airline business. While this has been the case for many years it is even more important now as first class passengers are becoming increasingly scarce - only about one in every five first class seats is now sold at full fare - and economy class seats are being offered at heavily discounted prices. Hence the importance for airlines of wooing corporate travellers. The battle is being fought in two ways: enhanced services on the ground and in the air; and by customer loyalty programmes for frequent flyers. It is this second approach - frequent flyer programmes - that is currently at the sharp end of the battle for business. The practice of rewarding passengers for flying with a particular airline by giving them a chance to fly again for nothing was first used in the US market after deregulation in the 1980s. At first, it seemed a brilliant marketing idea, similar to the explosion of trading stamps in securing customer loyalty in the 1950s and 1960s. But the drawback soon became clear: passengers flying free hit yields and margins with the inevitable result that many airlines were forced either into Chapter 11 administration in the US or out of business. Yet when the British government adopted an 'open skies' policy across the north Atlantic routes, the US airlines which jumped into the market  - primarily American, Delta and United - all brought with them frequent flyer schemes. British Airways was forced to follow suit last year and award Air Miles for frequent flyers (who now qualify as members of its Executive Club scheme). Other European airlines have also had to join in. The result has been twofold. For the airlines, it has meant that yields on certain flights have been hit further as a proportion of travellers are flying free. Every month, for example, some 25,000 people fly free on BA as a result of collecting sufficient Air Miles. For the frequent traveller, however, the availability of such schemes has provided a welcome perk. But should they get the benefit of being able to take themselves and their families on holiday as a result of belonging to a frequent flyer scheme when the airline tickets have been paid for by their companies? The dilemma is a difficult one for companies and individuals. Mr Bill Kirkwood, marketing director for Thomas Cook travel management, points out that a good corporate travel policy will identify a frequently used route and negotiate a favourable corporate rate with one carrier. 'But a serious conflict of interest can occur if staff ignore the low corporate rate dictated by the travel policy and book a more expensive ticket that rewards them personally for their loyalty,' he says. Mr Kirkwood acknowledges that many executives see the perk of frequent flyer schemes as compensation for long periods away from home. 'That accepted, it is still more cost-effective for the company to find a more direct way to compensate its high mileage travellers while at the same time making them keep to the most cost-effective travel policy.' A recent survey carried out by Mori of corporate travel buyers on behalf of Wagons-Lits Travel found that just over half the 400 companies surveyed felt the benefit should return to the company rather than to the individual. Air Miles, however, neatly sidesteps this issue by refusing to allow companies to register for its system - only named individuals can apply for and receive the frequent flyer rewards. Perhaps the only way such schemes may come to an end - apart from an airline being forced out of business by the heavy liability to fly passengers for nothing - is if the tax authorities decide to get tough. The perk is clearly taxable, but so far the Inland Revenue has taken no action. The uncertainty surrounding the future of such schemes - and their potential cost to the airlines - makes improving service for business travellers a better bet to win customers. BA has been in the forefront of many business class initiatives in recent years and has won a well-deserved reputation for its Club World cabins. Readers of Business Traveller magazine, for example, recently voted it the best airline overall. What BA now plans to do is to offer Club World travellers more control over their journey, starting with its new Lounge Pavilion at Heathrow's terminal four. 'Our research shows that passengers continue to feel stressed in airports,' points out Mr Robert Ayling, BA's director of marketing and operations. 'They want to be cocooned in a relaxing environment before getting on to a plane.' The new lounge will be more like a hotel lobby than existing airport lounges, he adds. In the air, BA is redesigning the 6,000 Club World seats on its 71 long-haul aircraft to give better back and leg support as well as making the 'ears' on each side wider to give greater privacy. It is also installing eight-channel videos in the back of each seat to give passengers the freedom to watch what they want. BA is not alone in upgrading its in-flight services - Emirates, for example, is also installing seat-back videos - and other developments on the way include better in-flight telephone and fax facilities on long-haul transatlantic flights. On the ground, most attention is being focused on improving the speed and efficiency with which executives can get from their office, on to the plane, and to their destination at the other end of the flight. Limousine transfers are now quite common, although they tend to be offered by the smaller airlines with fewer flights than the major operators. Perhaps the most interesting development for business travellers whose travel budgets are being squeezed has been initiated by Virgin. This has been to create a new section on the aircraft, called Mid Class, for full-fare paying economy passengers who typically are executives. A full economy fare, which allows greater flexibility than discounted tickets, can often cost two or three times as much as the cheap fares. For business travellers forced to downgrade, however, travelling with the leisure passengers can be irritating. Hence Virgin's move to offer a separate section with bigger seats and better check-in facilities for full-fare paying economy ticket holders. As yet, the move is not being copied by the other airlines who still hope to lure travelling executives into the higher-yielding business class cabins. But if the recession continues unabated, then the pressure to downgrade may prove irresistible for some.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Fannie Mae posts record earnings in last quarter THE Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the largest provider of mortgages to US homeowners, has ended its best year in record style. Yesterday, it reported record fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 361m, a performance which took total 1991 earnings to Dollars 1.36bn, the highest in the association's history. In 1990, it earned profits of Dollars 1.17bn. Fannie Mae was able to post record earnings against the background of a depressed housing market and a economic recession primarily because of strong growth in the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) business, which involves selling securitised packages of mortgage debt to institutional investors. During the year, Fannie Mae issued Dollars 112.9bn of MBS, taking the total of outstanding securities to Dollars 372bn and boosting guaranty fees on MBS business 26 per cent to Dollars 675m. The recession also failed to halt growth in the association's mortgage portfolio, which expanded 11 per cent over the year to Dollars 126.5bn. There was a similar-sized increase during 1991 in Fannie Mae's earnings from net interest income, which totalled Dollars 1.78bn. Contrary to public perception that the weak economy left homeowners struggling to pay their mortgages last year, the number of foreclosed properties acquired by Fannie Mae actually fell, from just over 8,000 in 1990 to 7,450. Similarly, charge-offs to the association's allowance for loan losses dropped in 1991, falling from Dollars 233.5m in 1990 to Dollars 205.3m. Fannie Mae reported that during the year it helped 1.7m families acquire mortgages, in the processing doing Dollars 139bn of business.</p>

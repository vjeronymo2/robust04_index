			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Bush is pressed on UK air deal THE heads of the three biggest US airlines have written to President George Bush, urging him to reject the proposed tie-up between British Airways and USAir. The letter was timed to arrive ahead of the visit by Mr John Major, UK prime minister, to Washington this week. The 'big three' US airlines, fearful Mr Major will press for approval of the deal, urge Mr Bush 'to resist 11th-hour promises that fall short of a fair and balanced transaction, and mortgage the future' of the US airline industry. 'To compete with British Airways, US airlines must be able to offer the same products as British Airways,' they say. 'To do that, they must have expanded authority to London and rights to fly within and beyond the UK to all points served by British Airways.' The Bush Administration is to decide on the deal before Christmas. President-elect Bill Clinton has hinted he will not approve it unless US carriers win extra access to the UK.</p>

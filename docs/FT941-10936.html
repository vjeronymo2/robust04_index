			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Last week, the Federal Reserve surprised the bond market by tightening monetary policy as a precautionary move against inflation. The central bank said it was not so much worried about inflation now, or over the next few months, but about what inflation might do in the longer term if the economy continued to grow at its heady pace. On Friday, fixed-income investors will be able to judge for themselves if the Fed's optimism about the short-term outlook for inflation is well-placed when the January producer price index is released. Wall Street analysts are not expecting the PPI to be as weak as it has been lately (it posted a fall in December), and some are even forecasting a rise of as much as 0.6 per cent. If it is at or above that level, investors could offload more bonds on the market in the expectation of further rate rises from the Fed. The consensus forecast for the January PPI is for a 0.3 per cent rise. The latest retail sales data will be released alongside the PPI report. The harsh weather is expected to have dampened sales in January, and analysts are forecasting a fall of between 0.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent, against the 0.8 per cent rise in December. Attention on Thursday will focus on the year's first auction, of Dollars 11bn in 30-year bonds.</p>

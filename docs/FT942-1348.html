			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Singed fingers among the recs - Michael Smith on the diversification lessons for power companies The contrast could be instructive. After electricity privatisation four years ago, East Midlands Electricity was intent on broadening its horizons and became the most acquisitive of the 12 regional power companies. Manweb, however, stuck to its core businesses, even to the extent of holding back from the dash for gas in which all other 11 regional companies invested in generation plants. The two companies were this week displaying the results of their policies. East Midlands was not flattered by the comparison. While Manweb's pre-tax profits rose by 14 per cent to Pounds 126m, East Midlands reported a Pounds 100m fall to Pounds 51m after taking an exceptional hit of Pounds 130m as a result of diversifications into contracting and home security and write-offs on its retailing interests. It seems to have learnt its lesson. Mr Nigel Rudd, recently appointed chairman, made his name as the head of the acquisitive Williams Holdings, but he says electricity companies should stick to what they know about and concentrate on their core activities. East Midlands has ruled out for now the possibility of following other regional power companies in providing other utility services. But what about other companies? Are there more non-core problems ahead? Almost certainly there are; but the worst fears are about what the companies will be tempted to diversify into in the future, rather than what they have already grown or bought into. After seeing the disastrous results of the privatised water company's forays outside their main business, the power companies have been relatively restrained. SG Warburg Securities estimates that total investment on non-core activities by the 12 regional companies is less than Pounds 650m, compared with their market capitalisation of more than Pounds 12bn. Water companies, by contrast, have spent about Pounds 1.4bn. And whereas some of the water companies' most calamitous acquisitions were overseas, the recs have ventured seriously outside the UK only recently. This month Norweb paid Dollars 36m (Pounds 23.6m) for a 50 per cent stake in two gas-fired co-generation facilities in Virginia. Yorkshire Electricity is to pay an undisclosed sum, thought to be about Pounds 100m, for a 17.3 per cent stake in Stockholm Energi. Norweb's investment is viewed in the City as safe, if unexciting. Yorkshire's foray into Sweden offers opportunities because of the deregulation of that country's power market and is welcomed by analysts. Other companies are also considering moves abroad. Midlands Electricity and Eastern are looking at buying stakes in distribution companies in the Czech Republic. City reaction would depend on the regulatory regime, which is still being formulated by the republic. But even here the outlays are likely to be relatively small, perhaps between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m for a stake. In the UK, where most of the diversification has occurred, the biggest acquisition was made by London Electricity, which paid Pounds 90m for the electricity distribution networks of its three London airports. This is performing above expectations, contributing Pounds 11m operating profit last year. Again, the City approves because it is so close in nature to London's core business. Similarly there is only limited downside in the recs' moves into power generation. It is possible that Prof Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, could rule that these are too expensive later in the decade and prevent the companies from passing on the costs of what could be expensive power to customers, but the likelihood seems slim. He has already said that the deals do not conflict with the companies' obligation to buy power economically. There is perhaps more concern among investors about rec ambitions to become broad-based utility companies. While it may make sense to sell gas and telecommunication services to customers who already buy power from them, the competition is intense. Most of the companies have joined the race to get into the gas market before it is opened up to competition in 1996, but telecommunications have attracted fewer recs. 'We looked at it very seriously, but decided it was too risky,' says the chief executive of one company. 'There are some very big players out there - BT's profits are the same as our turnover - and they can afford to take big losses to crowd competitors out of the market.' Heavy competition is also responsible for extremely tight margins and in some cases losses in the retailing and contracting businesses. These are not businesses which most recs would choose to be in were they starting up from scratch, but which are difficult and expensive to withdraw from. Retailing and contracting are likely to provide most of the difficulties for recs in the next year or so. More losses and write-offs are expected by analysts, although few expect losses of the scale reported by East Midlands. But perhaps the recs' biggest problems stem from the amount of money they have. Buying back shares is one way of dealing with the money, but there is strong pressure to do more than that. 'On the one hand the City says diversification is bad for regional power companies,' says one analyst. 'On the other people say managements lack imagination if they do nothing. 'The recs cannot win either way, but there are bound to be one or two that trip up by taking the diversification route.'</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NO ACCIDENTAL TOURIST;  </P> <P> FOR THIS GARDENA HIGH SCHOOL ART TEACHER, HER CLASSROOM IS REMOTE AREAS OF  CHINA  </P> <P> As Phila McDaniel walked breathlessly from her classroom to the art gallery at  Gardena High School the other day, she was, as usual, preparing for a trip.  </P> <P> A crumpled note pinned to her gray-and-black-striped vest reminded her of  things to do, headed by the admonition: "Don't forget briefcase." With her  overloaded schedule, it's easy to see the need for reminders.  </P> <P> McDaniel, 57, is an art instructor, intrepid world traveler, tour leader,  artist, photographer, art gallery curator, art restorer. She is seeking air  time for a television documentary she directed on her travels in China. She has  amassed a highly regarded collection of costumes worn by some of China's ethnic  minorities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Finalist for Award  </P> <P> Somehow, McDaniel also finds time to study for her doctorate and continue work  on two books she is writing. And for the second consecutive year, McDaniel is  one of 10 finalists for the annual Bravo Awards for excellence in teaching the  arts.  </P> <P> Like the eye of a storm, the mild-mannered McDaniel remains unfazed amid the  flurried pace of her life. "I love the drama and the adventure," McDaniel said.  "I love art, and I just like to go places and to see what I can find out from  many different standpoints."  </P> <P> An art teacher for 33 years, McDaniel has taught at Gardena High since 1972.  She is curator of the school's extensive collection of California art, which  consists of 78 paintings donated to the school since 1919 by Gardena High  alumni.  </P> <P> For the last 28 years she has combined teaching with traveling. She instructs  Gardena students in painting and art history during the school year and, for  the last 10 summers, has led tours into remote sections of China. Before China  opened its doors to Western tourists in 1979, she traveled extensively in  Japan, Greece, India and Nepal. Since then, she has been to China 17 times.  </P> <P> Wherever McDaniel goes, interesting things seem to happen.  </P> <P> "I got into a little altercation with a Tibetan warrior last summer, and I'm  still suffering from the damage he did to my arm," the scholarly looking  McDaniel said. The warrior was of the fierce Khampa tribe, she said.  </P> <P> As she recalls it, the fracas began when a Tibetan tour guide recommended that  participants refrain from buying the warrior's goods in the Xigatse Bazaar, an  outdoor folk market near Mt. Everest, because the items were too expensive.  </P> <P> "The warrior got angry, and he tried to carry our guide away," McDaniel said.  "Then I tried to rescue the guide. That's when I got hit by the warrior. He  tore the tendons in my arm and separated the muscle, so my arm is very weak  now."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, McDaniel was preparing for a presumably safer trip to the Wing  Luke Asian Museum in Seattle, where a major exhibition of her collection of  ethnic costumes and jewelry, along with her photographs of the Chinese  residents who made them, is opening.  </P> <P> Museum Director Kit Freudenberg said McDaniel's collection is remarkable  because of the completeness of the costumes. Few travelers to China see such  costumes, she said, and it is possible that the Chinese will stop making  traditional outfits as the country becomes more Westernized.  </P> <P> McDaniel is a member of the China Exploration and Research Society, founded by  a National Geographic Society researcher last year and dedicated to preserving  the history and culture of China.  </P> <P> Her research specialty is documenting the customs of China's 55 ethnic minority  groups. So far, she has collected material from 40 of the groups, including  members of the Miao, Dong, Tibetan and Manchurian minorities. Like the  costumes, ethnic customs may be about to vanish.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'An Urgent Thing'  </P> <P> "We're trying to document things before they disappear," McDaniel said. "It's  an urgent thing, because once these people get Western civilization, once they  get television, once they know what's out there in the rest of the world,  they're going to change. . . . So we have to document things now while they  still exist in their pure state."  </P> <P> In 1986, McDaniel traced the path of Mao Tse-tung's Long March across China in  1934, traveling 900 miles by bus along the dusty roads crossing the Aba  grasslands. The seven-day feat was celebrated by the governors of the Sichuan  and Ganshu provinces, each of whom greeted her tour group with banquets and  ceremonial white scarfs called khagatas that were draped around their necks.  </P> <P> "I don't know how she does it," Freudenberg said. "She was one of the first  people back in after China opened up, and she is frequently one of the first  Westerners to go into many regions. She has made friends and acquaintances of  governors and business managers. Many times her bus goes where there isn't even  a road."  </P> <P> Traveling where there was no road and no good gasoline once presented a problem  when a tour bus broke down in the Yunan grasslands "hundreds of miles from  civilization," McDaniel said.  </P> <P> "I had a bottle of alcohol in my suitcase and I poured it in the carburetor,"  McDaniel said. "We limped along until we found some Tibetans who had a wrench  so we could take off the gas tank and clean it. Then I strained the gasoline  through my T-shirt so we could get the water and dirt out. It was because I  knew a little bit about chemistry and mechanics that I knew what to do."  </P> <P> McDaniel picked up some of her knowledge of chemistry from her husband, Calvin,  a retired Harbor College chemistry professor who is also a tour director, and  from her father, a mechanic and inventor.  </P> <P> The couple, who live in Rancho Palos Verdes, have three adult children, all of  whom have traveled to China with their mother. Calvin McDaniel, however, said  he has never been to China. He specializes in tours to the Philippines, Taiwan,  Malaysia, India and Burma.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles native and an only child, McDaniel said her love of travel and  teaching came in great part from her mother, an elementary school teacher who  bought her daughter lavish art and travel books. As an undergraduate, McDaniel  studied fine arts at Pepperdine University before receiving a master's degree  in Oriental art history from Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> McDaniel is one of 97 people nominated this year for the seventh annual Bravo  awards. Two winners will be announced on March 6 at a ceremony at the Los  Angeles County Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, she said. The awards,  coordinated by the Music Center's education division and sponsored by the  Jeffrey Melamed Memorial Fund, are given to teachers in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Helene Trudeau, program administrator of the education division, said McDaniel  is remarkable as a teacher because of her success in inspiring Gardena students  in arts careers while doubling as curator of the school's art collection.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A World of Knowledge'  </P> <P> Gardena High Principal Tamotsu Ikeda agrees. "Because of her travels, she  brings to our kids a world of knowledge which other art teachers would find  difficult to give to youngsters."  </P> <P> On her return from Seattle, McDaniel's whirlwind schedule will continue. Her  current exhibit at the high school's art gallery is in celebration of the  Chinese New Year, which begins Feb. 6. She is organizing a mural to be painted  by beginning art students in honor of Black History Month, also in February.  </P> <P> Some of McDaniel's former students have returned to exhibit their work in the  school's gallery.  </P> <P> "My greatest thrill," McDaniel said, "has been to see some of the result of my  philosophy of teaching . . . to let children know the joy of creating art."  </P></p>

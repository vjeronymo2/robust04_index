			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Fiscal deficit puts Pakistan's economy at risk: Mounting defence and debt costs hamper government attempts to bring public spending under control THE LONG shadow of excessive public spending hangs over Pakistan's economy. Its baleful influence is not immediately apparent since the country is enjoying a surge in economic growth prompted by successive good harvests and by wide-ranging economic liberalisation. Textiles factories are working flat out to fill export orders, while farmers sell produce to the Middle East. City centre shops are stocked with imported luxuries; in Karachi, rows of Japanese cars stand on the dockside waiting for customers who have the money to buy even Mitsubishi Pajeros, costing up to Dollars 58,000 (Pounds 38,200) each. Last autumn's damaging floods have slowed expansion not halted it - the economy is still expected to grow by 5.5 per cent in the financial year to June 1993. However, the government continues to spend so much itself that it could yet undermine its achievements of the last two years since Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, came to power and launched radical economic reforms. The State Bank of Pakistan, the central bank, singled out the deficit for criticism in its annual report for 1991-92, published last month. 'A high level of fiscal deficit continues to be the central concern for the managers of Pakistan's economy.' Businessmen share the central bank's fears. 'I am very impressed with Pakistan's progress,' says Mr H J Hemmen, chairman of the Pakistani affiliate of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and detergents group, 'But the macroeconomic environment is worrying. They must bring public spending under control.' The government has been trying to deal with the gap between revenue and expenditure since it took office. For the year to June 1992, it set a target of 5 per cent of national output for the fiscal deficit. The actual result was 7.8 per cent, according to the central bank. For the current year, too, the government has already given up hope of reaching the 5 per cent target. Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance minister, admits: 'The only area where progress is difficult is the budget deficit.' The basic problem is that defence soaks up around 35 per cent of public spending and a further 25 per cent goes on debt servicing. Cutting debt servicing is almost impossible without reneging on agreements with creditors. Military spending is also sacrosanct as long as relations with India remain hostile. Mr Aziz takes comfort from the fact that increases in defence spending have been kept in line with inflation, but concedes that cuts are off the agenda. The reformist government had hoped to reduce civilian administrative costs - but progress has been slow since the bureaucracy, a powerful force in Pakistan, is loathe to pull in its belt. The inability to cut such big items leaves the government with little scope for increasing those programmes which are essential for economic development, such as expanding transport networks and the power supply. It is also difficult to accommodate emergencies - such as the autumn floods which, as well as causing death and destruction to large communities, cost the government Rs4bn-Rs5bn (Pounds 100m-Pounds 126m). Mr Aziz's main strategy has been to raise revenues, including taxes. According to the central bank report, tax income rose 28.9 per cent in the year to June 1992, due both to economic growth and to the expansion of a system of 'withholding' taxes. These are VAT-like levies charged on various economic activities including paying and receiving interest, importing and even using electricity. They have been devised as a partial substitute for income tax, which is widely evaded in Pakistan. Taxpayers who believe they pay too much in withholding taxes are entitled to appeal but they must file a detailed tax return. Few do and withholding taxes account for two-thirds of total tax revenue. Unfortunately, such widespread use of indirect taxes is no substitute for direct taxes and in itself creates widespread opportunities for abuse and corruption. The government is trying to improve income tax collection but progress will be limited as long as politically-powerful groups such as farmers enjoy tax exemptions. Tax reforms are necessary not only for the health of public finances but of the economy as a whole. The central bank report estimates 70 per cent of the new credit created during the economic surge of the last two years has been swallowed up by the public sector. If this continues, companies will be unable to benefit from the government's deregulation and privatisation programme. As the central bank says: 'Expectations of an increasingly larger role of the private sector in the economy are at variance with a situation where the preponderant credit increase during the year goes to the government.'</p>

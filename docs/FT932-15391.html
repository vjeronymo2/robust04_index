			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Vietnam denies POW claim Vietnam yesterday flatly rejected a report suggesting that it lied over the number of American prisoners it was holding shortly before the US withdrawal from Indochina in 1973, Reuter reports from Hanoi. It also denied it was still holding any prisoners. The issue, which flared up with disclosure of a document found in Moscow archives and said to be from the North Vietnamese army, looked likely to delay efforts to reconcile Hanoi and Washington 18 years after the Vietnam war ended. Vietnamese officials said every time a breakthrough appeared imminent in relations with the US, forces in Washington opposed to reconciliation threw a spanner in the works.</p>

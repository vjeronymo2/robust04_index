			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / GrandMet chief calls shake-up complete Grand Metropolitan, the drinks and food group, yesterday unveiled details of its second large restructuring charge in two years, costing Pounds 280m and 2,600 jobs, and said there would be no need for a third. 'We have completed, or have provided for, all major restructuring projects for the foreseeable future,' said Lord Sheppard, chairman, announcing a 5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 654m for the year to September 30. Pre-tax profits before charges and other exceptional items rose 3.7 per cent to Pounds 945m on flat turnover from continuing opera-tions of Pounds 7.63bn. Pillsbury foods in the US and Burger King were the strongest performers. Drinks profits worldwide were down as were food profits in Europe. Most of the money saved by cost-cutting is being spent on increased marketing. The budget rose 3 per cent last year to Pounds 900m with most of the increase spent on North American food. It will rise modestly this year with drinks getting most of the increase. IDV, GrandMet's drinks division, will lose 1,500 jobs and European foods 900 in the latest two-year restructuring. In total, 500 UK jobs will go and 1,000 in continental Europe. Operating profits from IDV fell 8 per cent in the latest year to Pounds 520m with Europe and the rest of the world suffering more than North America. Volumes were flat overall but margins suffered from a change in product mix and destocking, particularly in the US where volume was down 2.9 per cent. The UK was the only market to show growth but GrandMet said continental countries were beginning to show encouraging growth signs. Operating profits from food rose 24 per cent to Pounds 497m despite a 20 per cent fall in Europe to Pounds 12m. Acquisitions, cost-cutting, new products and a rebound in Green Giant's canned vegetables boosted Pillsbury. Burger King's like-for-like store sales were up more than 6 per cent. Net debt fell by Pounds 866m to Pounds 2.16bn thanks to disposals and a 26 per cent rise in free cash flow to Pounds 642m. Gearing dropped to 60 per cent from 81 per cent. The board recommended a final dividend of 8.8p to make 13.95p for the year, up 7.3 per cent. Earnings per share were 21.6p (19.9p) after charges, and 32.2p (29.6p) before.

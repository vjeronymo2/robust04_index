			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 17, IRNA -- Majles Speaker 'Ali Akbar  Nateq-Nuri here Tuesday expressed regret over the measures taken  by Saudi rulers to prevent the "Disavowal of Pagans" ceremony by  Hajj pilgrims in Mecca.    Since the ceremony threatens the interests of the global  arrogance and its allies, the Saudi rulers prevented the Iranian  pilgrims and those from other countries from holding the  ceremony, said the speaker at the open session of Majles. Such  actions were not unexpected from Saudi rulers in order to serve  the interests of the enemies of Islam, he said adding that  fortunately they were thwarted by the awareness of the leader's  representative for Hajj-related affairs, Mohammad  Mohammadi-Reyshahri.    The speaker then described today's silence of Hajj pilgrims  as very meaningful and added that this would exopose the real  nature of the Saudi rulers for the Muslims world over.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Indices should adjust for Japanese double counting Sir, John Plender, in 'A less than stabilising experience' (December 12), drew attention once again to the long-standing problem of double counting in Japan: namely, the impact of companies' holdings of other companies' equity which in total leads to an inflation of market capitalisation by more than 35 per cent. This in turn distorts world equity indices by giving an excessive 30 per cent weight to Japan, or around 32.5 per cent excluding the UK. Some institutions like Sun Life avoid these distortions by holding a weighting nearer to relative gross domestic product, in the range 15 per cent to 20 per cent of non-UK equities. However, other funds and investors feel obliged, or are required legally, to follow world indices as benchmarks. To avoid the 'doubly pointless' activity of taking exposure in Japan to match a weighting that is a statistical illusion, such world indices need to be either adjusted for double counting or have heavy footnotes pointing out the distortion and its scale for Japan and for any other country where the effect is significant (for example, Germany). Let the FT and its actuarial and investment bank advisers panel set a good example by starting with the FT-Actuaries World Index.

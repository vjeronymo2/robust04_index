			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus expressed alarm  today about Austria's consistently voiced doubts about the  completion of the Temelin nuclear power plant construction. He  pointed out that the Czech Government's stance on this matter is  final. Our Prague correspondent Daniela Galikova reports in more  detail:    [Galikova] According to Vaclav Klaus, the Czech Government  does not identify itself with Austrian Chancellor Vranitzky's  idea of a nuclear-free Europe. However, this does not mean that  the government denies Austria's right to hold its own view.  Nevertheless, being the government of an independent state, the  Czech Government is also entitled to a different view. I am  angry that Austria does not take seriously the fact that the  Czech Government's decision on completing the construction of  the Temelin nuclear plant is final. I do not understand the  reasons for the debate on not completing the Temelin power  station or rebuilding it to use gas fuel.    [Begin Klaus recording] Why should I continue to write  letters or issue statements because somebody on the Austrian  side seems to hold the view that we did not in fact mean our  decision and that it was a joke by the Czech Government or  perhaps an attempt to prod our neighbors? This is simply  untrue. Should I put this in stronger terms or in very strong  terms? I am simply saying it. [end recording]    [Galikova] The Czech prime minister went on to say that the  entire affair has gone beyond the framework of the present  Austrian Government's usual attitude toward the completion of  Temelin. He goes so far as to consider this to be  inappropriate, especially in the context, which he mentioned, of  his talks a few days ago with officials from Switzerland and  Germany, whose nuclear power stations are as close to the  Austrian border as is Temelin. However, there are no protests  against them. As regards Austria's attempt to choose whom they  consider to be a weaker partner and use them as a testing  ground, I have to say that we are not a weaker partner, Vaclav  Klaus stressed when speaking in Prague a few hours ago.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Gain on Sybase sale lifts Lotus in third quarter LOTUS Development, the US personal computer software company, reported a 6 per cent decline in third-quarter revenues as it lost ground in the market for programs that run on PCs using the popular Microsoft Windows program. A pre-tax gain of Dollars 34.6m from the sale of stock in Sybase, another software company, brought net income for the quarter to Dollars 30.1m, or 72 cents a share, compared with earnings of Dollars 21.5m, or 48 cents, in last year's third-quarter. Revenue was Dollars 206.7m, down from Dollars 218.8m last year. Without the gain from the sale of Sybase stock, earnings totalled Dollars 7.3m, or 17 cents. 'Seasonal softness and recessions in key international economies, along with continued price competition, contributed to the quarter's modest decline in revenue,' said Mr Ed Gillis, chief financial officer. 'We anticipate that certain of these factors will continue to affect our business in the near term.' Large initial shipments in the third quarter of 1991 of 1-2-3 for Windows, a version of Lotus' spreadsheet program, resulted in negative year-to-year comparisons, he added. Competition from Microsoft has significantly reduced Lotus' share of the spreadsheet market. Lotus has, however achieved a leadership position in the emerging 'workgroup' computer software market. 'Over the next several quarters, we expect to increase our overall share of Windows desktops, based on the strength of our offerings across the major Windows application categories,' Mr Gillis added. Nine-month net income rose 76 per cent to Dollars 65.8m, or Dollars 1.52 a share, from Dollars 37.3m or 84 cents. Revenue rose 13 per cent to Dollars 654.1m, from Dollars 579.7m.</p>

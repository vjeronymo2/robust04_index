Korea" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- The U.S. State  Department reportedly reaffirmed Wednesday that the demand for  the abolition of the "National Security Law" in South Korea was  the official stand of the United States.    Commenting on the great sensation in South Korea caused by  the remarks of Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hubbard  urging the abrogation of the "NSL" in South Korea, its spokesman  declared again what this senior U.S. Government official had  said was not his personal view and what the United States  demanded was not the revision of the "NSL" but its abolition.    Noting that the maintenance of the "NSL" was illogical, the  State Department said what the United States demanded of South  Korea was the abrogation of the "NSL" and this was the U.S.  official stand.    This statement of the U.S. State Department came at a time  when the South Korean puppet Foreign Ministry authorities met  officials of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul and asked them to inform  the U.S. Government of the sensation created in South Korea by  the remarks of the deputy assistant secretary of state.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Lower oil price cuts Chevron's earnings Chevron became the latest US oil group to report lower earnings in the wake of the declining oil prices when it unveiled a 14 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings to Dollars 424m yesterday. After special charges of Dollars 36m to cover environmental remediation costs and the resolution of certain royalty issues with regulators, the group posted net income of Dollars 388m, or Dollars 1.19 a share. Blaming lower oil prices for the fall in earnings, Mr Ken Derr, chairman and chief executive, said the group's 'crude oil realisations averaged about Dollars 4 per barrel less than in last year's first quarter'. He also said that temporary stoppages squeezed the group's sales margins. The negative impact of these developments was partly offset by higher production volumes and downstream product sales margins from the international operations, rising US natural gas prices, and lower operating and administrative costs, which fell 5 cents a barrel to Dollars 6.47 a barrel. Total group revenues fell to Dollars 8.3bn, from Dollars 9.1bn in the same quarter a year ago. The biggest decline was in upstream exploration and production earnings, which dropped to Dollars 235m from Dollars 360m a year earlier. Refining and marketing earnings, however, rose 32 per cent to Dollars 161m. Capital and exploratory expenditures climbed from Dollars 778m to Dollars 1.06bn, reflecting higher spending on the Tengiz oil field in Kazakhstan and refinery construction and expansion projects by the group's Caltex affiliate. Chevron shares fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 90 7/8 on the NYSE.</p>

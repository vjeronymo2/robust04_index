			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'ALPHABET OF BONES' GIVES NEW MEANING TO MOVEMENT  </P> <P> To Joyce Cutler-Shaw, the art of communication is as easy as ABC. What sets the  San Diego-based visual artist apart from the pack is her own alphabet.  </P> <P> "I developed an alphabet of bones," she said in an interview from her home last  week. "It's an original calligraphy with 26 characters, each with an alphabetic  equivalent in the English language. But it's really a visual dance with an  embedded symbolic code. When I was developing the calligraphy of bone, I was  interested in the relationship between dance and movement."  </P> <P> That fascination led her to seek out kindred spirits -- San Francisco-based  dancer/choreographer Nancy Karp and local composer Chaya Czernowin.  </P> <P> Their three-way collaboration produced "From the Alphabet of Bones," a  full-length work that translates Cutler-Shaw's original calligraphy into  movement and voice. The interdisciplinary performance piece will premiere at 8  p.m. Thursday through Sunday at Sushi's downtown gallery space.  </P> <P> "What we're all really doing is developing parallel languages," said  Cutler-Shaw, whose haunting representational drawings of the skeletal forms of  birds were the catalyst for this ambitious undertaking.  </P> <P> "I was interested in the possibilities of parallel languages when I developed  my calligraphy of bone," she said. "Nancy (Karp) had done a book of graphic  notation, and I saw certain parallels in her work.  </P> <P> "I had (written) a text and translated it into bone. Then Nancy developed a  vocabulary of 26 movements for a visual alphabet, and responded in dance terms  to the text. Chaya interpreted vocal equivalents to the alphabet of bones."  </P> <P> "I composed the music only from seeing the text in bone," Czernowin said during  a break from rehearsals. "I was not interested in the meaning -- only the  graphics. I gave every letter a sonic gesture that I could interpret in many  ways."  </P> <P> As Karp explained in a telephone interview from the San Francisco Bay Area last  weekend: "I found myself fascinated with the structure. In the alphabet of  bones calligraphy, each character is part of a configuration of figures. It's a  wonderful device. I came up with more than 26 different movement phrases, and  then we chose the ones that worked for the piece."  </P> <P> Karp created more than 26 distinct phrases for the duet section of the dance,  performed by longtime Karp company dancers Deirdre Carrigan and Diane McKallip.  </P> <P> "If each dancer used the same phrases for every letter, they'd be doing unison  dancing all the time," Karp said. "So we had to make sure that one dancer's A  was not the same as the other's. Sometimes they come together, but it's a very  elaborate system, because there are so many variations."  </P> <P> The performance piece was designed to be sequential in structure, rather than a  continuum of simultaneous stimuli, according to Cutler-Shaw.  </P> <P> "It weaves through a sequence of presentations," she said. "When the dance  portion is over, I come in and take over with the speaking part of the text.  And when I finish, Chaya sings the text."  </P> <P> Connecting all the elements -- dance, story and sonic gestures -- are  Cutler-Shaw's graceful graphic images.  </P> <P> "Joyce made beautiful characters," said Karp, "and the calligraphy will be  projected to create the environment.  </P> <P> "In fact, the lighting designer (Craig Wolf of San Diego State University)  asked us to wear light-colored costumes to heighten the effect when the dancers  pass through the light projections," she said.  </P> <P> "Into Flight" -- the section Cutler-Shaw recites and Czernowin sings in "From  the Alphabet of Bones" -- has a serious message as its subtext.  </P> <P> "We're dealing with issues of survival and evolution -- from the reptile to the  bird to human and perhaps into the humane," Cutler-Shaw said. The bird imagery  "is a symbol and a metaphor for environmental concerns. It's about  transformation. We have to be much more responsible. We have to change our  habits. And artists are mediums for that kind of thing -- the conveyance of  illumination."  </P> <P> Separated as they were by distance, collaborating on this "visual dance" was a  challenge for Cutler-Shaw, Karp and Czernowin. But with help from a California  Arts Council grant, and plenty of stubborn determination, their vision has  reached fruition.  </P> <P> "It was difficult, with me in San Francisco and the others in San Diego," Karp  said. "I've been down to San Diego to meet with Joyce and examine the space,  and Joyce has taken several trips here -- and we've been on the phone a lot.  But it's been very interesting. Joyce and I have a different way of looking at  the aesthetics, but it's been a real pleasure juxtaposing movement in a  different way."  </P> <P> "The most exciting new works are those that break down boundaries between the  arts," said Cutler-Shaw. "We all have individual voices, but working together  makes our own voice that much more distinct."  </P></p>

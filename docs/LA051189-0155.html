			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT A VINTAGE YEAR FOR THEATRICAL FILMS ON AGING  </P> <P> There will be a touch of disappointment today when films and videos dealing  with issues important to the aged are honored at the fifth annual Retirement  Research Foundation National Media Awards.  </P> <P> Never before has the engraved porcelain Owl and the $5,000 first-place prize  for theatrical fiction gone unawarded. Three honorable mentions -- one in  theatrical fiction and two in other categories -- will not be awarded either.  </P> <P> "We didn't find a film that met 100% of the criteria," Marilyn Hennessy, the  foundation's senior vice president, explained about the theatrical fiction  category. But, she said, the foundation will recognize Hollywood's effort, and  honor two productions for their portrayals of older people.  </P> <P> "Madame Sousatzka," starring Shirley MacLaine, will receive the second-place  award and the TV movie "Marcus Welby, M.D.: A Holiday Affair," starring Robert  Young, will receive an honorable mention, both in the theatrical fiction  category.  </P> <P> The Chicago-based foundation, funded by money left by the late philanthropist  John D. MacArthur, hopes to promote positive portrayals of the elderly through  its awards program.  </P> <P> The smaller number of awards this year highlights a continuing gap in film  making -- the lack of quality films and videos on subjects important to  increasing numbers of older Americans.  </P> <P> "Its like wine," said foundation trustee William T. Kirby. "You have vintage  years and non-vintage years.  </P> <P> "We're interested in the way people think about the aged. Films about being old  used to be sad because the ultimate prognosis is death."  </P> <P> More than 380 entries, most independently produced, were screened this year.  Judges from the media and experts in gerontology looked for productions that  portray the aged without using stereotypes, and for meaningful and insightful  treatment of economic, biological and social issues related to this growing  segment of the U.S. population. There are about 31 million Americans 65 and  older today; that group will grow to about 35 million in 2000, according to  Department of Commerce projections.  </P> <P> Foundation officials believe that Hollywood, concerned with demographics that  show the largest portion of the movie-going audience to be under 30, favors  romances and comedies and action films that feature younger stars. Thus,  big-budget Hollywood films depicting older people in a positive light are rare.  "Cocoon II," for example, was rejected by the foundation's judges because they  believe it condones the preservation of youth, rather than accepting age.  </P> <P> Most entries are not for mass audiences, but are nonfiction works responding to  needs and questions that come with growing older: where to reside, who to turn  to for help, how to deal with impairments and diseases. These were entered in  categories for independent films and tapes, television nonfiction and training  films and tapes.  </P> <P> "There is a crying need for a lot more understanding of both the problems and  opportunities of the elderly," said Joe Parkin, foundation president. "This  kind of program, maybe, will (show) the need and attract the better independent  producers to scratch their heads and say, 'Maybe I'll take a crack at that.' "  </P> <P> "Independent film makers might like to make a film about aging, but  fund-raising is difficult," said Dai Sil Kim-Gibson, a media consultant.  </P> <P> Two-time Owl recipient Susan Stone Shapiro -- this year for "In Their Own  Words: The Story of Search and Care," a 28-minute video about services for the  elderly living at home -- relies on grants to produce her community videos. "I  think it's helping as we write proposals to be able to say we are  award-winning," she said. "The award is recognition that we've done something  good for a group we believe in, for a cause we believe in."  </P> <P> Owl award money -- from $500 to $5,000 -- is insufficient in itself to produce  a quality film or video. Stone Shapiro's budget is $3,500 per video but she  said that in-kind contributions bring the dollar value to $7,000 to $8,000.  </P> <P> "Independent film makers tend to live project to project," said Steve Talley,  who will receive a second Owl this year. "The awards have helped me keep body  and soul together so I can pursue my dreams."  </P> <P> Talley's latest winning entry, "A Cost of Caring," explores the economics of  long-term health care. His winner last year, "Final Choices," looks at the  right-to-die issue. Both pieces were funded by Los Angeles public television  station KCET.  </P></p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / White House landing lights for airlines: Hopes of help to industry THE US's leading airlines, after losing more than Dollars 10bn between them over the last three years, are happy that they have a new administration more inclined to lend a sympathetic ear to their concerns. Congress has agreed, with backing from Mr Federico Pena, the transportation secretary, to set up a 15-member commission to report within 90 days on ways of alleviating the crisis. 'The industry is relieved that policy makers finally realise that the US airline industry is in serious financial crisis,' said Mr James Landry, president of the Air Transport Association, which represents the carriers. After seeing four sizeable airlines go out of business in the space of three years (PanAm, Eastern, Midway and Braniff) and with debt ratings for all the national carriers now at 'junk bond' levels, the nature of the problem is clear enough, but its causes, and even more its solutions, are much debated. The recession, which has curtailed spending on leisure and business travel, has been an important factor, as have savage price wars. The leading carriers also contend that the US bankruptcy system, which has allowed financially-weaker carriers to seek protection from their creditors and continue flying while restructuring their finances, is another. But the General Accounting Office, an investigative branch of Congress, questions the impact of bankrupt airlines on pricing structures, noting that they are not always the ones who start the fare wars. Mr Norman Mineta, chairman of the House of Representatives committee on public works and transportation, has warned the airlines not to expect too much on this front: even if the bankruptcy code were at fault, an overhaul in the interests of a single industry is unlikely to make it through Congress. Even as they emerge from bankruptcy, frailer carriers such as Continental and TWA pose new problems to their bigger brethren. Some of the weaker carriers - TWA, Continental and USAir - have won big wage concessions from their employees, often in return for an equity interest in the airline. Employees have little choice but to accept these pay/benefit cuts - the alternative is probably a lost job. The process continues: Northwest Airlines is trying to secure a concession package, worth almost Dollars 900m in operating cost savings over a three-year period. The 'big three' carriers - American, Delta, and United - argue that they have much less leverage for squeezing labour costs and cannot hope to match these deals. They also complain about the encroachment of foreign investors. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is now tied to Northwest, Air Canada to Continental, British Airways to USAir. Others, such as Lufthansa, are known to want a US partner. While the ultimate value of such alliances has yet to be established, there is little doubt that some domestic traffic will be diverted from other US carriers, as the US partner feeds into the foreign airline's route network and vice versa. But Mr Kenneth Mead, director of transportation issues at the GAO, argues that, on the contrary, the law limiting foreign ownership of airlines to 25 per cent of the voting stock has weakened the US industry by restricting access to capital. Both the airlines and the GAO agree that the restrictions on foreign ownership provide useful leverage for renegotiating many of the US's bilateral aviation agreements to give US airlines greater access to foreign markets. Mr Pena, too, sees this as a priority. Indeed, he made a new agreement with the UK an implicit condition for renewal in a year's time of his temporary approval of British Airways' partnership plans with USAir - with the carrot in his negotiating strategy a promise that the US will relax the ownership restriction. The airlines, however, appear to see the restrictions as more of a stick than a carrot, and it is by no means clear that Mr Pena can persuade either the airlines or Congress to let him deliver. Carriers have not waited for government help. Some - USAir, for instance - have begun to reduce their domestic route networks, to concentrate on the more profitable routes, and cut out costly hubs. Others have built up alternative earning sources, with American Airlines taking the lead in selling services ranging from investment management to logistics consultancy. And they had best beware lest the government's new found interest in their problems carries a sting. Some members of Congress feel that if the big three spent more time trying to emulate profitable Southwest Airlines and less time lobbying against USAir's link with British Airways, they might fare better. These congressmen are inclined to focus on barriers to competition in the aviation industry, such as the exclusive control exerted by some airlines over individual hub airports, the operation of the computerised reservation systems that dominate the industry, and the impact of frequent flyer plans. 'Even though most airlines are losing money, not all money losers are equal. Some still have anti-competitive advantages, most notably in computer reservations systems,' warns Mr Mineta. Some of the gloom seems certain to lift, since most of the red ink in 1990 and 1991 was attributable to failing airlines which have gone out of business or emerged from bankruptcy, while half the losses recorded in 1992 resulted from a new federal accounting standard. Wall Street analysts, although increasingly optimistic, are divided. Some suggest that the stronger carriers, such as American and United, could see modest profits in 1993; others think that a return to after-tax profits is unlikely this year. The larger airlines are doing nothing to encourage Wall Street's bulls. They know that their plight has caught Washington's attention and are keen to keep up the pressure for federal assistance.</p>

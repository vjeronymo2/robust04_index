Briefing media  executives in Lagos this evening on the latest developments  around the Bakassi Peninsula, the foreign affairs minister,  Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, said the federal government's  position is that Nigeria and Cameroon can resolve the dispute  peacefully, having been traditionally good neighbors. He said  the French should hold themselves fully responsible for the  consequences of any direct military confrontation between  Nigeria and Cameroon.    [Begin Kingibe recording] We hold the French responsible for  internationalizing it, for encouraging the Cameroonians to go  from pillar to post; they are ones who provided the Cameroonians  three French lawyers -- international law lawyers -- to go to  the Hague to try and file the case at that tribunal. They are  the ones who strategized for them to wait until they become the  president of Security Council, which was in force yesterday,  before they took the matter of Bakassi, and they are the ones  who internationalized and introduced an element of war by  bringing in their troops into the region where, in fact, the  conditions for inviting their local defense staff did not exist.  [end recording]    Discussing the situation on the ground, Ambassador Kingibe  said the Cameroonian Army has already been placed on the alert  and the French troops and military hardware are on the ground in  that country. He also warned if nothing is done quickly to  return to dialogue, the situation might explode. He said that  while Nigeria is mobilizing all diplomatic machinery at its  disposal to ensure a peaceful resolution of the dispute, it is  prepared and has the full capacity to defend every inch of its  territory and protect the lives and property of all Nigerians.    Foreign Ministry correspondent Godfried Agor reports that  Nigeria cannot be bothered by an International Court ruling  since the document disputed, dating far beyond the colonial era,  confirms Nigeria's ownership of the disputed territory.</p>

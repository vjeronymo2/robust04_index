			<p>BFN     [Text] In response to the deteriorating situation in the  ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia]  territory, the West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG [Economic  Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group],  yesterday began the deployment of its troops into Bomi County.  Although a part of the Liberian peace plan, ECOMOG's deployment  into the ULIMO territory is seen as an attempt to calm the  internal rift within the organization and also separate the  fighting forces of the Mandingo and Krahn ethnic groups. At a  brief ceremony held at the Po River Bridge minutes before their  checkoff yesterday, soldiers of Nimba 17 hurriedly boarded a  convoy of several trucks and tanks awaiting instruction from  their commander.    As the commanding officer of Nimba 17 Lieutenant Colonel  (Jonathan Albaah) gave the order, two armored tanks slowly led  the convoy of four trucks of troops that drove across the Po  River Bridge into Bomi County amid cheers and jubilation by  war-weary civilians standing by. Our reporter, Harry Rogers,  who was on the scene, said that the troops would be deployed at  (Camp Fashima) last night and disarmament would have begun  immediately thereafter. According to Rogers, the scene at the Po  River Bridge was characterized by a lot of emotion when the  [words indistinct].    Fighters of the defunct ULIMO were (?behind) the bridge  chatting with their ECOMOG brothers as civilians looked on. One  of the fighters, according to our reporter, said and I quote,  let this thing be over. We are now tired of fighting. With  yesterday's exercise, ECOMOG can now be said to be in Margibi  and Bomi Counties.</p>

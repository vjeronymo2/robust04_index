			<p>BFN     [Text] Vientiane, June 24 (KPL) -- The major donors and  international aid institutions heaped praise on the Lao  government's recent economic performance yesterday at a UNDP  [United Nations Development Program] round-table conference to  launch a far-reaching aid programme which will carry over into  the next century, said a UNDP information letter issued in  Geneva on June 22.    According to the letter, singling out the success of  Vientiane's fiscal and monetary reform plan (begun in 1986),  which has achieved single digit inflation, a much reduced trade  deficit, and control over foreign debt payments, the donors  urged the Lao government to press on with the pace of economic  change and aim for rapid development.    The Lao government, which was represented by Khamphoui  Keoboualapha, deputy prime minister, announced that it would  increase the rate of public investment to 14 per cent of GDP by  2000 in a bid to radically overhaul the country's poor  infrastructure and prepare the economy for full-blooded regional  integration.    As part of the Public Investment Programme (PIP) - which is  to be backed by donors to the tune of up to U.S. dollars 1.4  billion - the Lao government will irrigate more than 50,000  hectares of unused land, plant 100,000 hectares of forest, and  build 1,500 km of road.    In addition, a full-scale hydro-electric project is to go  ahead which is planned to earn substantial foreign revenues  through power export to Thailand and Vietnam, among other  neighbours.    Donors agreed that the recent opening of the Mittaphap  (Friendship) Bridge linking Laos to Thailand across the Mekong  River along the growing tide of foreign investment pledges had  all but guaranteed continuation of the country's healthy growth  rates (7.5 per cent since 1989) for the next few years.    Among the congratulations for the boldness of the Lao reform  programme, however, donors warned the Lao government that it  should not base its plans on growth for the sake of growth but  should work for a higher calibre of development.    It was also noted that least developed countries found it  easier to achieve high growth rates than more sophisticated  economies and that Laos had a particularly long way to go before  its population could taste the fruits of a modern economy.    In his address to the donors, Deputy Prime Minister  Khamphoui  recognized that his country still suffered from poor social  conditions: `national income (less than U.S. 300) is still very  low. Agricultural production is still dependent on the mercy of  nature. Ethnic groups in the mountainous areas live on  practising slash-and-burn cultivation -- a practice that  destroys forest areas of hundreds of thousands of hectares a  year,' he said.    Along with a scheme to protect the environment, the  government would invest significant donor-back sums to improve  the country's education and health soctors, he said. Resources  would also be channelled into a comprehensive training programme  to modernize the workforce. And the government would strengthen  its opium-eradication programme aiming to wipe out production of  the drug by the year 2000.    The thrust, however, of the six-year reform and  restructuring  programme would be to develop Laos' market economy and diversify  the country's rapidly growing export base. The Lao government  and donors agreed that the country should build on its success  in attracting foreign investment (U.S. dollars 126 million in  1993 and over U.S. dollars 500 million in pledges) by updating  the country's commercial law system and rationalizing its tariff  structure.    If the PIP fulfilled its ambitious targets-- a plausible  objective according to the experts at the meeting. Laos would be  well on its way towards joining the prestigious club of newly  industrialized countries in Asia by the end of the six-year  programme. The Lao government and donors will meet again in two  years to evaluate the trajectory of the reforms.    Tuesday's round-table conference was co-chaired by the  deputy  prime minister and by UNDP's acting director for Asia and the  Pacific, Ms. Elena Martinez. Participants included Australia,  Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden,  Switzerland, Thailand, the UK, the U.S.A., the Asian Development  Bank, the European Commission, the International Fund for  Agricultural Development, the OECD, the IMF, World Bank, FAO [UN  Food and Agriculture Organization], UNCTAD [United Nations  Conference on Trade and Development], UNDCP [expansion unknown],  UNFPA [United Nations Fund for Population Activities], UNHCR,  UNICEF, WFP [World Food Program], WHO, and the Swiss Red Cross.</p>

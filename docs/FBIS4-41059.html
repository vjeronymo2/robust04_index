			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS -- The State Duma (lower  chamber) of the Russian Parliament lacked five votes on  Wednesday to approve the federal draft budget under the third  reading, but will reconsider it in the evening.    With only 221 votes for it, the draft, which was amended  after its second reading a few days ago, failed to overcome the  226-vote hurdle.    The major disagreement is the defence spendings. The Duma  wants to keep them at the 40-trillion rouble level, while the  upper chamber, the Federation Council, wants to increase the  appropriations to 55 trillion.</p>

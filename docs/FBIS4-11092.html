			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina described his  recent tour of South American countries as very positive. Upon  his arrival he made exclusive statements for this newscast. His  tour through Uruguay, Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay allowed him  to make the reality of our country known to those countries and  opened new channels of communication in Cuba's relations with  other Latin American countries.    [Begin Robaina recording] I believe that being able to talk  about Cuba's truth and being able to learn of the continent's  reality represents a lot. For me there is no greater  satisfaction than having been able to transmit, and sometimes I  fear not having been able to do so with enough intent, the  respect, authority, and love that is generated by the way that  the Cuban people not only resist, but by the way they resist,  live, work, walk, and triumph. [end recording]    Besides meeting with high-ranking officials, party leaders,  and friends of Cuba, Robaina's visit awakened great interest  among the business community of those countries.    [Begin Robaina recording, in progress] ...the large number  of  businessmen with whom I met, and the doubts that may arise from  the debt were not the main issue in these business meetings.  These doubts would arise from within determined structures of  the government that wanted to make the issue of the debts the  center of their negotiations, but the great majority of  businessmen asked about the possibility of investments. They  asked about judicial guarantees. They asked about  constitutional, and financial guarantees and about the different  line of goods. To all this, Cuba has much more than answers. I  believe that this... [pauses] First of all, they know that Cuba  is a market, that there are possibilities, and they know that it  is a country that, like very few in the world, has an  established infrastructure with an unprecedented level in  education, science, and technology. [end recording]    Regarding "The Nation and the Emigre Community" conference  which will begin on 22 April, in Havana city, Robaina stated:    [Begin Robaina recording] In the extent that the reality of  that community abroad begins to express itself in a different  way, and the reality of the nation begins to change, we take  steps which are derived from a new situation. A new situation  which I insist demonstrates the audacity of our project and of  the country that summons the meeting because we continue having  abnormal conditions as in the past. I believe that under  abnormal conditions one cannot ask that relations with the  emigre community be normal.    Once again Cuba is putting itself above all those abnormal  situations and is capable of finding a solution and a topic for  these times. I believe this is what brings us to this conference.    For me the most important thing remains the path that is  being opened and the way in which in a responsible and civilized  manner, and, above all, with much comprehension and mutual  respect, we will be able to discuss common issues from this  point on.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each series of Bonds will have such interest rate, maturity date, redemption and sinking fund provisions, be secured by such means and sold in such manner and at such price and have such other terms and conditions as shall be determined at the time of sale. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to provide additional security for its obligations with respect to the Bonds, SERI may assign for the benefit of the holders of the Bonds certain of its rights under the Availability Agreement, dated as of June 21, 1974, as amended. Pursuant to this agreement, the Operating Subsidiaries have agreed to pay SERI certain amounts for expenses incurred by SERI in connection with the operation of a nuclear-powered electric generating station in Mississippi. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As further security for its obligations with respect to the Bonds, SERI may assign certain of its rights under the Capital Fund Agreement dated as of June 21, 1974. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, Entergy has agreed to provide SERI, among other things, capital sufficient to enable SERI to maintain a 35% equity ratio, as defined in that agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SERI proposes to use the net proceeds derived from the issuance and sale of the Bonds for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, (i) the acquisition and retirement, by means of tender offer, or open market, negotiated or other forms of purchases, or redemption in whole or in part, prior to their respective maturities, of one or more series of SERI's outstanding first mortgage bonds, (ii) the payment of construction costs and nuclear fuel costs, (iii) the repayment of long- and short-term borrowings and/or (iv) other working capital needs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SERI also requests authority to enter into arrangements for the issuance of Tax-Exempt Bonds by governmental authorities (each an ``Issuer'') in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $235 million. Each series of Tax-Exempt Bonds will have such interest rate, maturity date, redemption and sinking fund provisions, be secured by such means, be sold in such manner and at such price, and have such other terms and conditions as shall be determined at the time of sale. However, it is proposed that each series of the Tax-Exempt Bonds mature not earlier than five years from the first day of the month of issuance nor later than forty years from the date of issuance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed arrangements, SERI would enter into one or more installment purchase, refunding or other facilities agreements (each a ``Facilities Agreement'') or one or more supplements and/or amendments thereto with one or more Issuers. Pursuant to the terms of each Facilities Agreement, the Issuer will pay to or provide for the benefit of SERI the total amount of the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt Bonds and SERI will agree to pay amounts sufficient to pay the principal or redemption price of, premium, if any, and interest on the Tax-Exempt Bonds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to obtain a more favorable rating on any series of Tax-Exempt Bonds, SERI may arrange for one or more irrevocable letter(s) of credit (each a ``Letter of Credit'') for an aggregate amount up to $285 million from one or more banks (each a ``Bank''). In connection with any such letter of Credit, SERI would enter into a Reimbursement Agreement (``Reimbursement Agreement'') with the Bank. Pursuant to a Reimbursement Agreement, SERI would agree to reimburse the Bank party thereto immediately or within a specified period (not to exceed 60 months) after the date of the draw for all amounts drawn under Letter of Credit, together with accrued interest. The rate of such interest would not exceed the New York prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal plus 200 basis points. Additionally, it is anticipated that each Reimbursement Agreement would require the payment by SERI to the Bank of up-front fees not to exceed $100,000 and annual fees not to exceed 11/4% of the face amount of the related Letter of Credit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition or as an alternative to the security provided by a Letter of Credit, SERI may pledge one or more new series of its first mortgage bonds (``Collateral Bonds'') under the Mortgage, as it may be supplemented. These Collateral Bonds may be interest-bearing or non-interest bearing. Such Collateral Bonds would be non-interest bearing of the principal amount issued were the same as the principal of the underlying Tax-Exempt Bonds plus accumulated interest for a specified period. The rate on interest-bearing Collateral Bonds may be less than or equal to the interest rate on the underlying Tax-Exempt Bonds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SERI proposes to use the proceeds of the sale of Tax-Empt Bonds to refinance certain pollution control revenue bonds that were previously issued to finance pollution control facilities at the Grand Gulf nuclear state. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

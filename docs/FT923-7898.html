			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Pan-German economic growth slows THE growing strength of the D-Mark and unease about international growth prospects has shaken Germany's confidence that the domestic economy will regain momentum later this year. The government stands by its official forecast of 2-2.5 per cent pan-German economic growth this year, but in a report yesterday the economics ministry gave the first official hint that expectations may not be met. Real western German growth slowed in the second quarter of this year, falling by between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent compared with the first three months, the economics ministry said. This represented a return to normal after the 2 per cent quarter-on-quarter gain recorded between January and April, due mainly to mild weather conditions. However, there were also signs of reduced momentum in the domestic economy and doubts about recovery elsewhere. 'Until now there has been a general expectation of improving external demand. How strong this will be is admittedly uncertain,' the ministry said in its August report. 'The picture of the world economy, after positive indications in the first quarter, has recently become vague again. The high exchange rate of the Deutschemark against the US dollar could reduce the competitiveness of west German companies.' The report expressed concern at the rising number of companies planning job cuts, while recovery in the east was less marked than expected. The ministry repeated its claim that domestic demand should rise because of tax cuts and higher disposable incomes. But independent economists suggest consumer confidence has been eroded by fears of increases in indirect taxation and growing unemployment. Manufacturing companies have announced big payroll cuts in the past few months. The Baden-Wurttemberg government said yesterday that 2 per cent of industrial jobs in the state had been lost in the year to the end of June. The southern state, home to Daimler-Benz and its Mercedes Benz motor subsidiary, said 6,000 vehicle manufacturing jobs had been lost. There were 23,000 fewer workers making plant and machinery, and the electronics industry had cut its workforce by 3,600.</p>

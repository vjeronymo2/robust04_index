			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: DAMEWORTH SEES TO AFFAIRS OF STATE  </P> <P> Guess what Bryan Dameworth did Saturday night after winning the elusive  3,200-meter title at the state track and field championships?  </P> <P>  He started packing for the fall semester at the University of Wisconsin?  </P> <P>  No. Winter blowout sales of wool socks and mittens won't come until later this  year. Try again.  </P> <P>  He ran back to his home in Calabasas from Cerritos College?  </P> <P>  Not even close. That's about 65 miles from point A to point B, but it probably  wouldn't be a problem if you spotted the Agoura High senior a few days to do  it. Last chance.  </P> <P>  He went to Disneyland?  </P> <P>  Sorry, but thanks for playing.  </P> <P> Dameworth finally was able to relax after winning the state 3,200 championship  in a nation-leading 8 minutes 53.26 seconds -- thus ridding himself of a source  of considerable frustration.  </P> <P> "I just sort of stayed out all night and kicked back the next day," Dameworth  said of his post-race activities.  </P> <P> Although pleased with his success in cross-country, the sport in which he won  three consecutive state Division I titles and last December's Kinney national  championship, Dameworth had thrice fallen short in his bid for a state track  title.  </P> <P> He finished seventh in the state 3,200 final as a freshman in 1987 and was  second last year. As a sophomore, Dameworth failed to make the state meet after  placing seventh in the Southern Section Masters meet in a then personal-best  9:06.88.  </P> <P> On Saturday night, Dameworth was able to lock up his ghosts of disappointment  past and throw away the key.  </P> <P> "I feel quite relieved," he said.  </P> <P> But his latest accomplishment was by no means a romp in the park. Two other  Southern Section runners also dipped under the nine-minute barrier and the  fourth- through 11th-place finishers were under 9:10.  </P> <P> "I really didn't know (I won) until after I crossed the finish line," Dameworth  said. "I felt someone on me pretty much the whole time."  </P> <P> For the most part, that someone was Hoover's Eliazar Herrera. The UCLA-bound  senior finished second in 8:58.97, currently the third-best mark nationally.  </P> <P> What sapped Dameworth the most, he said, was leading the entire race with the  exception of a 200-meter stretch when Hector Hernandez of San Diego Mar Vista  surged past before fading to a 21st-place finish.  </P> <P> "At first I thought, 'Cool, I get to run with someone,' " said Dameworth, a  notorious front-runner. "But after about 200 he just dropped back."  </P> <P> Knocking down Andy Maris' previous national best of 8:53.78 gave Dameworth  another reason to celebrate.  </P> <P> The senior from White River High (Buckley, Wash.) recorded the time in handing  Dameworth his first 3,200 loss of the season at the Arcadia Invitational in  April. Dameworth was second in 8:53.85.  </P> <P> "That's another thing I'm happy about," Dameworth said. "It's not by much (but)  at least his name's not up there any more."  </P> <P> Although the Golden West and Keebler invitationals remain, Dameworth can  virtually close the book on what has been four years of mostly blue-ribbon  performances and eight Times Athlete of the Week selections.  </P> <P> "I think I've accomplished everything I would have ever dreamed of," Dameworth  said. "I'm pretty happy."  </P></p>

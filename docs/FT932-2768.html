			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Local counsel THE LOCAL Government Commission which is reviewing the structure of local councils in England has now published four reports. As anticipated when it was launched last year, the commission is approaching its task with no preconceived blueprint for how local government ought to be structured. The different solutions adopted in the first four reports, however, suggest that this pragmatic approach is less attractive than it seemed at the outset. Some counties such as Derbyshire and Durham will survive, albeit without large towns like Derby and Darlington, which will be reconstituted as county boroughs. Others, such as Somerset and Gloucestershire, will survive only for 'ceremonial and cultural' purposes, being divided into smaller districts. The 'new' counties like Avon and Cleveland which failed to generate popular support (or even a county championship cricket team) are to be scrapped. The only option so far ruled out appears to be the preservation of the status quo in which district councils provide street-level services and county councils strategic services. If the commission continues in this manner, much of the country will be divided into district councils varying greatly in size. The smallest are unlikely to be able to perform satisfactorily strategic functions like planning and economic regeneration. In the large conurbations, the creation of unitary authorities has required new quangos and joint boards to handle such issues. If this is repeated where county councils are abolished, it will do little to enhance accountability, one of the justifications for moving towards single-tier authorities. Nor is it clear that reorganisation will always save money, the other rationale for eliminating a tier of local government. While each commission report has claimed savings for the local taxpayer, the calculations are hotly disputed by the councils recommended for the scrapheap. There may be scope for economies of scale where services are to be provided by fewer councils, as in Derbyshire. But where county services are to be divided up among several district authorities, one possible outcome is a growth in bureaucracy and higher costs to pay for it. This piecemeal approach is a novel way of reorganising local government which, even after 14 years of centralisation, employs more than 2m people and spends Pounds 54bn a year. England needs a system of local government that is capable of strategic action and which combines local delivery of services with genuine electoral accountability. Is the Local Government Commission sure that is what its reforms will produce?</p>

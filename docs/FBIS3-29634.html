			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 20 KYODO -- The likelihood of a  cabinet reshuffle in late February or early March increased  Sunday [20 February] after two previously reluctant coalition  parties expressed readiness to accept the move proposed by Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party  (SDP), said, "the cabinet reshuffle comes under the jurisdiction  of the prime minister, so we will back it if he is determined to  do so."    But he told a press conference that the cabinet should  preferably be reshuffled after the Diet passes the fiscal 1994  state budget, possibly around April.    The SDP, the biggest force in the seven-party coalition  government, and Sakigake (Harbinger) have opposed an early  cabinet reshuffle plan.    SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo said on a public  television  news program that he cannot help dropping his earlier dissent if  Hosokawa believes the reshuffle is necessary to eliminate policy  differences within the cabinet.    The focus of the projected cabinet reshuffle concerns the  fate of Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.    Takemura, the top government spokesman and leader of the 14-  member Sakigake, reportedly alienated Hosokawa and Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] co-leader Ichiro Ozawa over his opposition  to Hosokawa's plan in early februrary to impose a new 7 percent  indirect tax on goods and services. The plan was later scrapped.    Ozawa, a key strategist in the ruling coalition, was  reported  late last year to have urged Hosokawa to remove Takemura from  the key cabinet post.    Takemura, who had put up harsh resistance to the reshuffle  plan, withdrew his opposition Saturday by saying in Nagoya that  it is up to Hosokawa to decide to reshuffle his cabinet.    Hosokawa and Takemura met Sunday morning to discuss the  projected cabinet reshuffle, political sources said.    Sakigake Executive Hiroyuki Sonoda hinted on the same NHK  (Japan Broadcasting Corp.) program Sunday that the party is  ready to accept the reshuffle if Takemura can retain a cabinet  post.    "We have not thought of the possibility that our party may  break away from the governing coalition," Sonoda said.    "If the prime minister is in need of our party, it is the  best solution (for our party) to continue to help him by  remaining within the cabinet," he said.    A reshuffling of the six-month-old cabinet is expected to  come at the end of February or early March following passage of  a third supplementary budget for the current fiscal 1993, the  sources said.    Hosokawa's Japan New Party and six other parties, including  Sakigake, the SDP, Shinseito and Komeito, make up the governing  coalition.    Meanwhile, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa said on  the same program and on a private television program that  cabinet changes will take place in late February or early March.    Ichikawa blamed the reshuffle debate on Takemura and said  the  cabinet changes will be "very limited."</p>

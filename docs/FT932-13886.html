			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: JR East files preliminary application for Tokyo listing EAST JAPAN Railway, the Japanese railways group, filed a preliminary application yesterday with the Tokyo stock exchange for a listing that will be a test of the market's recently-regained strength. The listing of JR East, as the company is known, will be the biggest offering of a semi-privatised company since that of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), whose shares fell last year to almost one-third of their first offering price of Y1.197m (Dollars 10,783) in late 1986. Mr Minoru Nagaoka, stock exchange president, said the exchange did not want to see a repeat of the NTT episode, which is blamed for souring the attitude of retail investors towards the stock market. However, NTT's price has recovered in recent weeks, lifting the market's confidence, encouraging the government to press ahead with JR East, and suggesting to brokers that there would be retail interest in the railway company. Mr Nagaoka said the timing of the listing and the price should be decided after careful examination of the market's strength, though the listing was likely in late October or early November. It has been reported that the offering price will be around Y250,000. The market expects about 2m of JR East's 4m shares held by JNR Settlement will be offered to the public. JNR Settlement took over shares of the seven companies created through the break-up and semi-privatisation of Japan National Railways in 1987, and has been waiting more than three years for stock prices to recover. Meanwhile, the stock exchange reported a deficit of Y3.46bn for the year ending in March, compared with Y9.13bn in the previous year.</p>

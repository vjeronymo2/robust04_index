			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Higher prices help lift Freeport Higher metals and phosphate fertiliser prices helped Freeport-McMoRan, the New Orleans-based natural resources group, report second-quarter net income of Dollars 4.63m, or 3 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 77.4m, or 54 cents, a year ago. For the six months to June 30, the company recorded net income of Dollars 17m, or 12 cents, against a net loss of Dollars 132.7m, or 93 cents. Second-quarter revenues benefited from increased sales volumes. Freeport's metals affiliate, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold, sold 168.6m lbs of copper and 185,400 troy ounces of gold, up from 140m lbs and 127,200 ounces in the same quarter of 1993. A price-protection hedging programme also lifted the average realised price of copper to Dollars 1.02 a lb, against 90 cents, while gold sale prices averaged Dollars 353.82 an ounce, compared with Dollars 338.60. However, copper production costs were abnormally high in the quarter.</p>

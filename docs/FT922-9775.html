			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Rossington raises offer for Acil ROSSINGTON Holdings, Sir Ron Brierley's vehicle for a bid for Australian Consolidated Investments (Acil) yesterday increased its offer to 23.5 cents a share from 23 cents, and dropped a series of conditions. Rossington, jointly owned by Brierley Investments of New Zealand and GPG, Sir Ron's UK company, extended the bid to May 22 in a statement filed with the Australian Stock Exchange. The revised offer values Acil at ADollars 130.17m, (USDollars 98.6m) but is still well below the valuation of 33 cents a share placed on the company by Acil directors, who have urged shareholders to reject the bid. Rossington's decision to make the bid unconditional follows claims by Acil that shareholders controlling about 60 per cent of Acil stock would reject the bid unless the conditions were dropped. However, Rossington has begun legal proceedings to block Acil's proposed flotation of its 95.6 per cent holding in Weeks Petroleum, an Australian oil company. Rossington's initial bid was conditional on the abandonment of Acil's plans to sell its 50 per cent holding in National Brewing Holdings, formerly Bond Brewing, to Lion Nathan of New Zealand. Acil and Lion Nathan said on Monday the New Zealand brewer had exercised a call option to acquire the stake, and indicated the transaction would be completed by the end of the month. About 40 per cent of Acil is owned by companies formerly controlled by Mr Alan Bond, the bankrupt entrepreneur. A further 19.9 per cent is owned by the Adelaide Steamship group, which is being reconstructed by its banks. Sir Ron said the real value of Acil shares was about 25 cents, depending on 'the ultimate wash up of (Acil's) many messy legacies from the Bond and Adsteam eras'. He said shareholders were unlikely to receive a better offer than the Rossington proposal, and warned they could do 'a lot worse if the company's legal wrangles continue to proliferate as rapidly as in the past few months'.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bank in Liechtenstein group ahead BIL GT, the financial group built around Bank in Liechtenstein, has reported a 53 per cent jump in consolidated net income in the first half of 1993 to SFr69m (Dollars 46m). Like other banking groups based in the Swiss market, the group has benefited from an unusual combination of rising and active securities markets, declining interest rates, large inflows of funds and relatively stable expenses. BIL GT said all its companies contributed to the overall increase in assets under administration to SFr44.8bn at June 30, up 16 per cent from a year earlier. Assets under management rose 21 per cent to SFr24.6bn. A 25 per cent advance in group revenues to SFr255m resulted from a substantial increase in net interest income and brokerage earnings together with increased investment management fees and higher dealing profits. Administrative expenses were up only 10 per cent, and most of it was attributed to the higher business activity level. The directors said they were confident of achieving 'a good business year'.</p>

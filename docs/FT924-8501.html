			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / OECD presses Germany to ease rates of interest GERMANY came under renewed pressure to ease interest rates yesterday from its European partners in the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development. A meeting of senior finance officials, called to debate why the long awaited economic recovery has not arrived, agreed that long-term rates in Europe may continue to come down on the likelihood of lower inflation. They also recommended that OECD members should ease fiscal policy to stimulate growth. Governments should at the same time give firm promises to toughen fiscal policy again when growth takes off, said Mr Bernard Molitor, the German Economics Ministry director, who chaired the meeting. He stressed the OECD still stuck to its strategy of price stability and reducing budget deficits. The scope for German interest rate cuts was the subject of 'much debate', said Mr Molitor, with several governments emphasising the promotion of European business confidence that a reduction in borrowing costs could bring. The meeting confirmed the downgrading of OECD growth forecasts, but predicted that inflation would continue to fall. Unemployment would start to ease in 1994 after stabilising at an average of slightly more than 8 per cent next year. Accordingly, the OECD expects average growth in gross domestic product to reach about 1.5 per cent this year, down from earlier forecasts of 1.8 per cent. There should be a continued small recovery, about 2 per cent in 1993, rising to 3 per cent in 1994, said Mr Molitor. Earlier forecasts had underestimated the deflationary drag caused by the ending of the market booms in the late 1980s and subsequent cautious lending by banks. Even the latest lower forecasts had a big margin of error due to blows to economic confidence inflicted by the currency market turmoil, growth in government budget deficits and deadlocked negotiations on world trade rules, he warned. Mr Kumi Shigehara, head of the OECD's economic department, predicted that average inflation would fall to 2.5 per cent by the end of 1994, the lowest level since the 1960s, which compares with 3.2 per cent in the 12 months to September.</p>

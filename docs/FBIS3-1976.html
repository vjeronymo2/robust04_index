The presidium executive chairman Ma Shiqing presided  over the meeting. Sitting on the rostrum were executive chairmen  Cai Dan, Ma Yuling, Ye Fei, Ji Jingde, Liu Rongqing, Gan  Shouxiang, Feng Linggang, Caipei Doji, Fang Jie, Ye Fengnian,  Zhang Jingshan, Ma Youqiang, Yang Yinkai, and Shi Huaizhen. Su  Kun, director of the provincial commission for planning  delivered a report on the conditions of implementing the 1993  provincial plan for economic and social development and the  draft 1994 plan. In the report he said the province scored  substantial progress in economic restructuring and opening up in  1993; the national economy rapidly developed; the pace of  exploiting resources was stepped up; production, construction  and circulation developed in a comprehensive way; new  accomplishments were scored in all social undertakings including  science, technology, education, culture, public health, and  enterprises. On the basis of production development, the living  standards of the urban and rural populace continued to improve  somewhat; the GNP was 10.1 billion yuan, up by 9.5 percent from  the previous year, exceeding the 8 percent growth rate in the  national plan. The accomplishments evidenced the fact that all  measures adopted by the provincial party committee and  government centering around building the socialist market  economic structure, accelerating the exploitation of resources,  and pushing the province's economic development were very  effective.    Entrusted by the provincial government, Xia Luodi,  provincial  finance department director, made a report on conditions of  implementing the 1993 provincial financial budget and initial  arrangements for 1994 financial revenues and expenditures. In  the report, he said that in financial work in 1993, the  provincial government earnestly implemented various central  measures for macroeconomic regulation and control, organized  revenue and controlled expenditure with great efforts. Year-end  results in executing the plan were better than expected. The  annual budgetary expenditure was 2.377 billion yuan, and  financial revenue fulfilled was 1.135 billion yuan, being 130.5  percent, or 319 million yuan more than, the annual revenue  target of the yearly financial plan. Those items with increases  in financial revenues were mainly industrial and commercial  taxes, which enjoyed a 356 million yuan increase, in addition to  agricultural and animal husbandry taxes as well as other income  from special items.    In their reports, Su Kun and Xia Luodi separately explained  the draft 1994 plan and initial arrangements for financial  revenues and expenditures for the session's deliberation and for  provincial CPPCC members attending the session as non-voting  delegates to give their opinions.</p>

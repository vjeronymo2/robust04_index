			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Poles in Spanish cigarette deal Spanish cigarette brands will be made in Poland from this autumn under an agreement between the Tabacalera tobacco group and Polish state company ZPT Radom, writes David White in Madrid. The accord marks the first foreign manufacturing investment by the partly-privatised Spanish company. It is the latest in a series of agreements between Polish cigarette manufacturers and international groups. Tabacalera said it would spend about Pta750m (Pounds 3.64m) on the Polish project. Apart from licensed production of Tabacalera's Fortuna and Winns brands, the two companies plan to introduce a new brand through a joint venture 51 per cent controlled by the Spanish partner. Tabacalera will supply packaging equipment and raw materials and will take charge of promotion, with the Polish company responsible for production and distribution. The Spanish said Poland ranked eighth among world markets for tobacco products, and had one of the highest per capita consumption rates, of 7.28 cigarettes per day, compared with 5.6 in Spain. Further deals are under discussion in Europe and other foreign markets in an effort by Tabacalera to offset a gradual decline in domestic sales of tobacco products.</p>

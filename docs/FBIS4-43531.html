			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "cs": "Attacks Before the FPOe Congress"] </F>   [Text] Vienna/Linz -- Just in time before the beginning of  the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] congress, with which Joerg  Haider wants to take the offensive again, new accusations  against the FPOe chairman were disseminated on Friday [17 June].  Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] Federal Manager Josef  Cap quoted from an article in the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU which  accuses Haider of contacts with a group that is classified as  right-wing extremist in the FRG.    U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli -- the Democratic  representative from New Jersey is the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs of the House Foreign  Affairs Committee and involved in human rights issues -- has  warned his 434 colleagues in the House of Representatives  against meeting with FPOe Chairman Joerg Haider. In a  memorandum Torricelli pointed out that Haider had praised the  employment policy of the Third Reich. He should "not be honored  by a visit to Congress."    Haider did not comment on this matter. FPOe officials are  surprised that a visit to Congress is supposed to be prevented,  which Haider neither intended nor had asked for. Rather, his  visit to the United States next week is aimed at meeting  Austrians living abroad in New York and talks with U.S. foreign  policy experts about a potential Austrian membership in NATO.    This goal of the FPOe is to become both the topic of the  party congress and the central issue in the election campaign,  FPOe Secretary General Karl-Heinz Grasser told DER STANDARD.  The congress, at which Haider wants to propose one or two new  deputies, should also engage "a bit in coming to terms with the  past." He will mention Erwin Hirnschall's "behavior that was  damaging to the party." Hirnschall had rejected Haider's offer  to present his arguments in favor of EU membership during  Haider's own appearances and had, instead, criticized the party  line in the "Press Hour" television program.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: Getaway route was via France THE AIRCRAFT identified by Turkish Cypriot officials as having flown Mr Asil Nadir to Cyprus took off from an airfield owned by British Aerospace on Monday afternoon. Mr Nadir, however, boarded that aircraft in France. It is thought he made his way to France in a light aircraft from another airfield at Compton Abbas in Dorset, taking advantage of new simplified EC passport procedures. Compton Abbas airfield refused to comment on reports that a Piper PA34 had taken off with Mr Nadir. BAe refused to disclose who owned the aircraft which flew to Cyprus via France but confirmed it had departed from its airfield in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. The company said it had given the Serious Fraud Office full details of the flight plan, but said it did not know who chartered the aircraft. According to the US Federal Aviation Administration, the Cessna 500 Citation which landed in northern Cyprus is owned by a US company called Flamingo 500, whose president is Mr Michael G. Hamlin. The FAA said one of the alleged pilots - Mr Alexander Marc Tai - was licensed in the US. BAe confirmed last night that Mr Hamlin was a regular customer of Hatfield.</p>

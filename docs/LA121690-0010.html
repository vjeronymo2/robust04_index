			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: NONFICTION  </P> <P> A HAND IN THE DARKNESS: The Autobiography of a Refusenik by Ida Nudel (Warner  Books: $22.95: 314 pp.) In the midst of the euphoria over the political changes  sweeping through Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, this book stands as a  cautionary beacon.  </P> <P> Removing state communism from the countries of Eastern Europe, and liberalizing  it economically in the Soviet Union, has not meant that ethnic hatreds have  been forgotten. Slav and Czech, Serb and Croatian, all are now freer to hate  than they were before.  </P> <P> Most reviled of all are the Jews, not so much in Eastern Europe -- the Germans  saw to that -- but in the Soviet Union. Nudel recounts a life experiencing  anti-Semitism in Russia, from the children calling her "kike" before World War  II to the apparatchiks who harassed her unmercifully when she decided to help  her fellow Jews to emigrate to Israel -- and to act as a solitary angel of  mercy looking after Jews who were sent to prison camps in Siberia.  </P> <P> She used the telephone, telegraph and mail not only to buoy the spirits of  prisoners but also to ensure their humane treatment. For her work, she was,  inevitably, sent to prison, and denied an exit visa for 16 years. But perhaps  the most depressing fact about her treatment was the verbal abuse from Russians  who shouted to her that they wished Hitler had finished his job on the Jews --  this from people whose own relatives, as many as 20 million of them, were  slaughtered during the German occupation of Russia.

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / BBC pulls out of contract magazines BBC Enterprises, the commercial wing of the BBC, has sold its contract-magazine interests responsible for publishing customer titles for companies such as Marks and Spencer and American Express. The change has led to an effective split of Redwood Publishing, the magazine publisher in which the BBC has held a 77 per cent stake since 1988. At present Redwood publishes four contract magazines and a raft of magazines such as BBC Good Food Guide. Redwood, now wholly owned again by its founders Mr Christopher Ward and Mr Michael Potter, will consist of the contract titles only. Redwood's present consumer titles, ranging from BBC Gardeners' World and BBC Clothes Show Magazine to BBC sports magazines, will become part of BBC Magazines. The decision to sell the contract-magazine business followed a review of all BBC commercial activities as part of the corporation's response to the government's green paper on its future. The BBC will concentrate on magazines with direct links to its programmes. Mr John Thomas, managing director of BBC Enterprises, said yesterday: 'The BBC's review of its commercial activities has provided the trigger for the two areas of business to separate.' The BBC declined to give details on the financial transactions involved in the deal. Redwood Publishing will continue to operate from its headquarters in Camden, north London. The BBC magazines launched by Redwood will also stay there. Mr Ward said yesterday that his company planned to expand its base in publishing customer magazines and was also interested in developing magazines for other media organisations. BBC Television had nine out of the top 10 programmes on Christmas day and took a 68.4 per cent audience share. Over Christmas week the BBC took a 50.7 per cent share.</p>

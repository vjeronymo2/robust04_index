			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 1 Jun (AFP) -- The Dominican Republic  Central Electoral Board (JCE) has agreed to turn over the voter  lists used in the 16 May general elections -- the opposition's  main demand. This was confirmed today to AFP by JCE  spokespersons.    The Dominican Republic held presidential, parliamentary, and  municipal elections 15 days ago, nevertheless a winner has not  been declared yet due to uncountable charges of fraud. This has  led the JCE to recount the votes. The opposition parties' main  charge is that approximately 200,000 persons -- allegedly  opposed to the official Social Christian Reformist Party of  President Joaquin Balaguer -- were excluded from the voter lists  used on election day.    The opposition parties demand the JCE show them the lists  used in the elections to compare them with the ones the board  delivered to them a few days before the elections. This request  has just been granted. The JCE decision came about after, in an  independent manner, the electoral boards of the Puerto Plata and  the National District [Santo Domingo and its surroundings]  declared their willingness to turn over their voter lists to the  parties that requested them. Nevertheless, a JCE spokesperson  told AFP that the printing and delivery of the voter lists to  the political parties will take five to six days.    According to the count, Balaguer, 87 and almost blind, who  is  running for his seventh presidential term, garnered a 1 percent  lead (30,000 votes) over Jose Francisco Gomez, social democrat  from the Dominican Revolutionary Party [PRD]. The PRD, which  charged alleged fraud, insists that the sole solution to the  post electoral crisis is a partial or total repetition of the  elections.    International observers who watched over the Dominican  elections have declared the need to verify the number of persons  who were not able to vote to establish if it was a significant  enough number that could have altered the results.</p>

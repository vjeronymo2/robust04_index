			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Leading Article: A global test for Germany THE WEST's disarray in the face of Bosnian and Somali bloodshed has not facilitated Germany's efforts to inch towards a new role in foreign policy. In 1990, German politicians spoke persuasively of the need to fulfil the country's weightier post-unity responsibilities. Above all, they started to search for a legal and political mechanism to allow the German army to take part in peace-keeping missions outside Nato. Three years later, Bonn is still looking for a means of carrying out this goal in a way which commands a domestic consensus and which is practical. It is in the interest of Germany and of the rest of the world that this aim is accomplished. Unless it can participate fully in peace actions launched by the United Nations, Nato, or the European Community, Bonn will not be able to play the international political part justified by its economic stature. The hearings yesterday at the constitutional court over Bonn's dispatch of troops for the UN mission in Somalia highlight Chancellor Helmut Kohl's difficulties. Discomfited by the US-led attacks in Mogadishu earlier this month, the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) are undertaking emergency action to try to overturn the decision to send 1,700 German troops to east Africa. The UN secretary general will tell Mr Kohl in Bonn today that the Bundeswehr's presence in western Somalia is vital. The constitutional judges seem likely to dismiss the SPD's arguments. Two months ago, they turned down a similar bid to withdraw German airmen from Nato aircraft enforcing the UN no-fly zone over Bosnia. However, Mr Kohl's government is still immersed in wearisome negotiations over constitutional changes to clarify the overall legal framework for Bundeswehr deployment. The decisive element in this juridical quagmire is likely to be the question of political will. Mindful of the constitutional limits, Mr Kohl's government has, sensibly, been extremely cautious in using the country's armed forces in the Bosnian and Somali conflicts. However, in other policy-making fields, Bonn's stance has been less restrained. German pressure was the main reason for the EC's rash decision to recognise Croatia in December 1991. Yesterday, Mr Kohl called for the EC to lift its arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems, risking yet another EC split. Meanwhile, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, has ruffled feathers in the UK and France by suggesting that Germany should become a permanent member of the UN security council. These ill-judged actions cannot be ignored when they come from a government as important as Germany's. This makes it all the more important that Bonn should adjust its constitutional and political framework in line with its international responsibilities. Germany's willingness to place its military at the service of the international community is a concrete test of this process.</p>

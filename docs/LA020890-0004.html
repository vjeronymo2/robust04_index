			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BEVY OF TAX, FEE HIKES IN OFFERING FOR SAN DIEGANS  </P> <P> San Diegans face the prospect of sizable tax and fee increases as the San Diego  City Council today considers $119.7 million in new revenue-generating proposals  that City Manager John Lockwood says are needed for fiscal year 1991.  </P> <P> Imposition of property tax increases totaling $156 a year for a $150,000 home,  a new 5% utility users' tax on businesses, and a new $90 annual trash  collection fee for homeowners are some of the ways that Lockwood is proposing  to cover just part of a large budget deficit and the council's demand for  several new expensive projects and programs.  </P> <P> Lockwood described the city's budget plight as the worst in 56 years, since the  1933-34 fiscal year, and significantly more difficult than the budget cutting  necessitated by the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978. Because of population  growth, it will take an additional $66 million in fiscal 1991 just to keep city  services operating at present levels, he said.  </P> <P> Without new revenue sources, budgets will "get progressively worse,  unfortunately," said Pat Frazier, the city's director of financial management.  "The base upon which our revenues are built is not sufficient to keep up with  our growth."  </P> <P> But some council members said they are not ready to start loading the June  ballot with tax increases at such an early date in the city's budget process,  especially without reviewing possible budget cuts.  </P> <P> "I'm not willing to put those things on until such time as we've taken a look  at the budget," Councilman Ron Roberts said.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Judy McCarty said that she is willing to ask voters to repeal a  1919 city ordinance mandating free trash collection because the move will  promote trash recycling, but "other than that, I don't know what I'm going to  do tomorrow."  </P> <P> Lockwood also wants the council to ask the public to waive the Gann spending  limit to allow as much $700 million more in spending during fiscal years 1991  through 1994. The city's current Gann waiver runs out July 1, 1991.  </P> <P> Some of the revenue proposals require only the council's approval, while others  need either majority or two-thirds support of the public on the June ballot for  enactment, according to a report from Lockwood to the council.  </P> <P> But Mayor Maureen O'Connor wants to place all of the proposals on the ballot,  regardless of whether the council has the authority to enact them itself, said  her spokesman, Paul Downey.  </P> <P> "Anything where taxes are going to go up, she wants to give (voters) a menu  kind of a format where people are able to pick and choose what they're willing  to pay for," Downey said.  </P> <P> Even if Lockwood's total package is approved, about $99 million in identified  city needs will be unfunded next year, and one controversial new program will  be far short of the funding approved by the council.  </P> <P> That program is the Housing Trust Fund for the poor, which the council  conceptually approved in December at $54 million annually. Lockwood is  suggesting that the program, designed to generate housing and housing subsidies  for low-income city residents, be financed at $13 million next year via  imposition of new development fees.  </P> <P> Lockwood also is looking for a state grant to provide the $4 million needed to  build a new city jail for people arrested on misdemeanors.  </P> <P> The report includes several other potentially sizable tax and fee increases not  currently being recommended, some because they require further study. Among  them are fees for parking at city beaches, a utility users' tax for residential  customers, an increase in the city hotel tax and a new assessment district to  pay for citywide lighting and landscaping needs.  </P> <P> Lockwood's proposal includes:  </P> <P> * A special tax to beef up the city's police force to two officers per thousand  residents. The measure would raise property taxes by $54 per every $100,000 of  assessed valuation in fiscal 1991, $100 in 1992, $152 in 1993, and $155 in  1993.  </P> <P> The $23.7 million proposal for 1991, which includes $6.2 million that would go  to the county to pay for probation officers and other costs, requires approval  of two-thirds of the electorate.  </P> <P> * A $44 per $100,000 of assessed valuation tax increase to generate $20 million  annually for the city employees' pension fund. The tax could be enacted by  council vote.  </P> <P> * A $6 per $100,000 valuation property tax increase to generate $25 million  needed to expand the Police and Fire Departments' communication system.  Two-thirds of the voters would have to approve the general obligation  borrowing.  </P> <P> * Repeal of the People's Ordinance of 1919, which mandates free trash pickup  for anyone who brings their trash to the curb, and imposition of a $7.50 per  month trash pickup fee that would generate $25 million annually. Single-family  homeowners, who make up about half of the city's 435,000 dwelling units,  receive the free trash pickup, but residents of most apartment and condominium  complexes, where trash is thrown in dumpsters, already are paying a fee.  </P> <P> * $13 million in new commercial development fees for the Housing Trust Fund.  </P> <P> * A new $5 million gross receipts tax on business that could be enacted with  council approval.  </P> <P> * A new 5% tax on commercial and industrial users of electric, gas, telephone,  cable TV, water and sewer utilities. The council could enact the measure.  </P></p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Third world urged to open textile markets TEXTILE coalitions from the US and Europe yesterday united in Washington to demand changes in the Uruguay Round negotiating text to force developing countries to open their textiles and clothing markets to the industrialised countries. Mr M L Cates, president of the American Textile Manufacturers' Institute, cautioned against a 'rush to a quick and crippling conclusion in the Round', so as to give the Clinton administration a chance to address issues neglected in the negotiations. These include closed markets, export subsidies, child labour, piracy of designs and environmental concerns. The textiles producers are newcomers to environment and labour rights issues, according to Mr Martin Lewin, a lawyer for the US Association of Importers, Textiles and Apparel. 'They fought tooth and nail against every labour and environmental reform. . . but now you have a president (Clinton) who is more sympathetic to labour and environmental issues, so they are now talking the rhetoric of labour and environment,' said Mr Lewin. Mr Cates and Mr Wolfgang Sannwald, president of Comitextil, a coalition of European producer groups, presented what they called 'a Magna Carta' for the industry and urged that it be adopted in the Round. It provides for market openings 'on a reciprocal basis among free market economy countries'; vigorous measures against piracy of intellectual property; commitments on labour rights like child labour laws; and enforcement of environmental standards. Mr Sannwald said last year textile exports from India and Pakistan totalled Dollars 4bn while the home markets were closed to imports. China last year exported textiles worth Dollars 9bn and imported Dollars 61m's worth.</p>

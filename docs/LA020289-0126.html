			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTSSCOPE;  </P> <P> FIRST-PLACE CAL POLY WOMEN WILL FACE TOUGH TESTS AGAINST NORTHRIDGE, CSLA  </P> <P> First-place Cal Poly Pomona has been impressive in building a 4-0 record in the  California Collegiate Athletic Assn. in women's basketball, but the Broncos  have their toughest games ahead.  </P> <P> Pomona, 15-4 overall and ranked No. 2 nationally in NCAA Division II, must  visit 16th-ranked Cal State Northridge at 5:45 tonight and Cal State Los  Angeles at 8:05 Saturday.  </P> <P> Northridge entered this week at 15-4 overall and 3-1 in the CCAA. Cal State  L.A., which has won six of its last seven games, is 12-8 and 3-1.  </P> <P> After watching her team roll over Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 99-72, last week,  Pomona Coach Darlene May says her team is starting to play at the level she had  wanted.  </P> <P> "For the most part, I was pleased with the way we played against Cal Poly SLO,"  May said. "Both of our freshmen, (forward) Tami Chick and (guard) Yvette Hill,  are providing us some solid play and making us a better all-around team.  </P> <P> "Northridge and Los Angeles are solid teams that will challenge us for the CCAA  title. This week should tell us where we are with them."  </P> <P> Pomona, which has won the conference title seven straight years, has been led  by its All-CCAA tandem of junior center Niki Bracken (6-2) and senior point  guard Cathy Gooden (5-5). Bracken is averaging 18.4 points and 8.6 rebounds and  Gooden 14.9 points and 5.6 assists.  </P> <P> The Broncos also start forwards Susan Luckinbill (5-9) and Stephanie Coons  (5-10) and guard Carrie Egan (5-8).  </P> <P> They will face a Northridge team that has three players scoring in double  figures, including center Chris Cavalin (5-10), who averages a team-high 16.6  points and 10.1 rebounds. The others are forwards Julie Arlotto (5-11) at 12.2  points and Bridgette Ealy (5-8) at 11.7.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the Broncos will meet a team playing particularly well since  the start of January. Coach Fran Buckless said part of the reason for her  team's resurgence has been the addition of 6-0 forwards Trisha Maly, who  transferred from Pepperdine University, and Tina Slatinsky, who missed the  early portion of the schedule after an appendectomy.  </P> <P> Maly has averaged 13.9 points and has made 59% of her field-goal attempts and  90% of her free throws. Slatinsky is averaging 11.5 points and 6.7 rebounds.  </P> <P> The leader for the Golden Eagles has been senior center Lupe Quintana (6-0),  averaging 14.7 points and 10.2 rebounds. She is the all-time CCAA leader in  rebounds.  </P> <P> Before facing Pomona, the Golden Eagles will entertain UC Riverside in a  conference game at 5:45 tonight.  </P></p>

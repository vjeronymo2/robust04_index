			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / People: Knowles steps down from Birmingham Sir Richard Knowles, leader of the Birmingham City Council, the largest local authority in England, will retire later this year. The feisty, cigar-smoking 75-year-old, a traditional Labour political boss who believes in what he calls 'sensible socialism', said yesterday that he will accept a nomination to continue as leader at an internal election next month but will step down later. Knowles departs as the political tide in Birmingham has begun to swing against Labour which has been in power, under his leadership, since 1984. During this period he fended off opposition from ideologues on the party left and fought an unsuccessful campaign to stop Conservative attempts, especially under the then Mrs Thatcher, to reduce the power of the town halls. He has always worked at the grassroots of the Labour movement, becoming an organiser in 1950, and nursed the safe Sparkbrook seat in Birmingham for Roy Hattersley, the former Labour deputy leader.</p>

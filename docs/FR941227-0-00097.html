			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another commenter requested that the Department provide an even playing field for small communities. In the history of the program, small communities have been successful in obtaining grants, and the Department sees no need to change the final rule in this regard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Involvement in the Rulemaking Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another commenter requested that people with rural backgrounds be involved in the rulemaking process. This was accomplished by two highly publicized meetings with that were held in Auburn and Goshen, New York as well as having the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development write to each eligible unit of general local government individually, asking for their comments in helping to shape the final rule and NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Administration of Small Cities Program by the State of New York <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters stated that the Small Cities Program should not be given to New York State to administer. Section 106 (d)(2) of Title I, gives States the right to elect to administer the State CDBG Program. The Department cannot administratively amend this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Single Audit and Davis-Bacon Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters asked that the Single Audit and Davis-Bacon Acts be made inapplicable to the Small Cities Program. To adopt this comment would require a statutory change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Rehabilitation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters asked that the non-targeted rehabilitation program be continued. Although this issue is too specific to be addressed by the regulations, there is nothing in the Small Cities regulations that would preclude a grantee from initiating a non-targeted rehabilitation program. A request was made by one commenter to fund more HUD staff travel. Although the Department is sensitive to the need of HUD Field staff to travel to small cities in New York, the travel budget is determined by annual appropriations and is not an appropriate issue to be addressed by the final regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that funds should be allowed to be used to rehabilitate pre-1976 mobile homes. While the Department is unclear as to the commenters' reference to pre-1976 mobile homes, manufactured housing can be rehabilitated in accordance with &sect;570.202(a)(4), since the State of New York recognizes manufactured housing as real property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that senior citizens on fixed income should be able to get rehabilitation grants. The major purpose of the CDBG program is to benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Senior citizens who are of low- and moderate-income are eligible to receive housing rehabilitation grants. Senior citizens who have higher incomes cannot receive grants unless the activity is to aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight. Title I does not give higher income senior citizens preference over low- and moderate-income non senior citizens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Household Incomes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked that households with incomes between 80&hyph;100 percent of median be eligible to receive rehabilitation assistance in non-targeted areas. The Department notes that this can be done under &sect;570.208(b)(2) as long as the rehabilitation is limited to the extent necessary to eliminate specific conditions detrimental to public health and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Multiyear Plans <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter said that community facilities should not be funded on a multiyear basis, but should be funded through a large grant of up to $900,000. The Department decided not to restrict community facilities from being part of multiyear plan projects. However, to the extent a project consisting, for example, of one large building cannot logically be subdivided into segments that are viable as separate grants, the project would have to be funded from a single year's grant funds under &sect;570.421(a)(1). Larger public facilities projects, however, can now be funded with Section 108 loan guarantee assistance under &sect;570.703(l).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter said that the first year of the multiyear plan should be fifteen months, and another commenter indicated that there should be a site visit 9&hyph;10 months into the multiyear plan. These comments are operational in nature and not appropriate to be addressed by the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Priority for EZs/ECs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that Empowerment Zones (EZ) and Enterprise Communities (EC) should not receive a priority in the final regulation. The Department agrees that the final regulation is an inappropriate place to show support for the EZ/EC program and can more appropriately lend its support in the NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Public Hearings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter stated that public hearings should be able to be combined with hearings for other purposes. The Department agrees, and notes that this is the Department's policy, and therefore, need not be stated specifically in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Abbreviated Consolidated Plan <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters requested that the abbreviated Consolidated Plan requirements be made as simple as possible. It is the Department's intention to do this, but the NOFA is a more appropriate vehicle for doing this since the abbreviated Consolidated Plan may need to be changed based on ongoing experience in program administration. At this time the abbreviated Consolidated Plan is not yet required. (The FY 1995 NOFA requires an abbreviated CHAS if the application contains housing activities.) After the Consolidated Plan final rule is published, succeeding NOFAs will explain the requirements. The final rule for the Consolidated Plan will make conforming changes to this regulation. The final rule will not apply to applications under the FY 1995 NOFA for the State of New York.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

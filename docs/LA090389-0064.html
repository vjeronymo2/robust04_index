			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> VERMONT PROGRAM HELPS TEEN-AGERS, LABOR SHORTAGE;  </P> <P> FARMERS REAP BENEFITS OF YOUTH CORPS  </P> <P> Teen-agers Beth Young and Nate Deslandes have no desire to spend their lives  baling hay and milking cows, but they didn't mind spending the last two months  in a program intended to give them farm experience while giving farmers a hand.  </P> <P> "We've had some problems, but we had some really nice success stories too, and  we had some farms having some good experiences," said Greg Voorheis, who runs  the Farm Youth Corps, a pilot program for the state Department of Employment  and Training.  </P> <P> The corps matched people ages 16 to 21 from northern Vermont with farm jobs.  The goal was to alleviate a labor shortage while the young people gained  experience and money for a summer's work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keen Competition  </P> <P> Farmers around the Northeast have especially had trouble hiring help since  wages at hamburger establishments have risen to $6 or $7 an hour. Few farmers  can offer more than $4 an hour for harder work, longer days and fewer benefits.  </P> <P> "One of my friends said he knew a kid who said, 'I don't touch a bale for less  than $7 an hour,' " John Lincoln of Westfield said.  </P> <P> The Farm Youth Corps took care of the problem of finding young people who were  willing to work for less money. A combination of state and federal funds, plus  some volunteers, provided training.  </P> <P> The farmers pay their hired hands $4 an hour, and state funds will pay the  youths a $1-an-hour bonus at the end of the summer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grew Out of Survey  </P> <P> The idea for the corps came out of a survey of Vermont's 2,500 dairy farms.  More than one-third of the 700 respondents said a lack of employees kept them  from expanding. Nearly two-thirds said they would consider hiring young  Vermonters for the summer if the state would help find them.  </P> <P> Young, 17, hooked up with Jim Jones, a Craftsbury farmer.  </P> <P> "I like being outdoors and I've been around a farm," said Young, who rides her  bike 2 1/2 miles to Jones' farm each day. "I like the animals. I think I like  milking -- it's nice after working hard in the woods all day -- and just joking  with Jim or whatever."  </P> <P> The experience helped confirm that she had rather not farm for a living.  </P> <P> "It's a lot of hard work and it's stressful," she said. "But I think (the  corps) is a good idea because farmers need help, and I think kids are a lot  more willing to work than people think."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 8 Leave Program  </P> <P> Most kids. Voorheis said eight of the 20 youths dropped out of the program.  </P> <P> Young's supervisor, Danny Paquin, said one girl dropped out because she  couldn't stand the thought of sending cows and calves to slaughter.  </P> <P> And some couldn't handle a tractor. "One farmer tried to teach one of the kids,  and he was almost run over himself," Paquin said.  </P> <P> Paquin also had a problem with a young woman who refused to eat from her  employer's table.  </P> <P> "Her family background -- these people just eat out of cans. We're talking Chef  Boyardee and Franco American. She wouldn't eat fresh vegetables," Paquin said.  </P> <P> Before going out to the field, 16-year-old Deslandes and the others spent a  week in classes at a state technical college, where they learned crop and  livestock management, milking techniques and tractor safety.  </P> <P> </P> <P> He's a Convert  </P> <P> "He didn't want to go at first. He didn't think he'd need it," Lincoln said of  Deslandes. "Now he wants to go back and do more."  </P> <P> "It gives me a lot of experience in mechanics and carpentry and different kinds  of trades," said Deslandes, of Westfield, whose buddies are spending the summer  baby-sitting or working in stores.  </P> <P> He also learned about growing up.  </P> <P> "Responsibility. There's a lot of trust, I think, that goes into it," he said.  "I trust him, he trusts me. I think the responsibility's the No. 1 thing. It  makes you work a lot harder on goals."  </P></p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Senior Engineering bucks sector trend with 14% rise SENIOR Engineering Group, the specialist engineer with interests ranging from construction services to flexible tubing, bucked the gloomy sector trend with a 14 per cent increase in annual profits. The pre-tax line for 1991 rose from Pounds 16m to Pounds 18.3m, despite lower group turnover of Pounds 297.6m (Pounds 318.3m). Professor Sir Roland Smith, the chairman, emphasised the results were achieved while many engineering companies had experienced significant downturns, and that they followed a 'very creditable' performance in the previous year. Earnings per share edged up from 6.1p to 6.56p. A recommended final dividend of 1.95p makes a total of 3.15p (2.86p) for the year. The pay-out is covered more than twice - contrasting again with the uncovered dividends paid by several other engineering groups. The performance of Senior's four business areas and its Australasian business varied widely, with thermal engineering, the largest division, lifting operating profits from Pounds 2.63m to Pounds 4.28m on turnover down from Pounds 129.5m to Pounds 125m. Mr Don McFarlane, group manufacturing director, said the division had benefited from cost reductions carried out in 1990 and from two important industrial trends - power station refurbishment and the 'tremendous progress' in industrial boilers linked to combined heat and power (CHP) and waste recovery projects. The engineering products division saw profits fall from Pounds 6.43m to Pounds 4.21m as turnover slipped from Pounds 103m to Pounds 90.6m. However, Mr John Bell, the division's chief executive, said the return was reasonable given that the tubing, heat treatment and expansion joint businesses had been hit by the recession. The construction services side raised profits from Pounds 4.84m to Pounds 6.71m as turnover edged up from Pounds 49.8m to Pounds 52.3m. Business has been aided by the focus on high-specification, non-commercial contracts, and by the acquisition of Nordclima, a German air handling business. On acquisitions, Flexonics, the US flexible hose and expansion joint company purchased in February for Dollars 40m (Pounds 23m) was performing better than expected, said Mr Bell. The company also wants to increase its presence in the German flexible hose market. Elsewhere, said Mr McFarlane, Senior is keen to make a further construction services acquisition in Germany to complement Nordclima. COMMENT Senior has taken a few knocks from the City over the years for being unexciting, but in the current climate there is much to be said for a virtually debt-free company that has consciously aimed for steady growth. The results reflect the prescient round of cost-cutting in 1989 and 1990, along with Mr McFarlane's philosophy of devolving profit responsibility. As for the outlook, Senior is not seeing any significant signs of change in business levels, but is well placed for the recovery: a 4 per cent return on sales in engineering products at the bottom of the cycle augurs well, while acquisitions such as Flexonics have boosted non-UK earnings to 40 per cent of the total and could go higher. At the very least, expect maintained earnings this year, putting the company on a prospective p/e of about 11.</p>

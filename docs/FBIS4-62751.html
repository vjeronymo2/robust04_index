			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Petrenko] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 18 -- Russian civil aviation pilots went  on general strike at 9:00 A.M. Moscow time today. The personnel  of over 90 per cent of civil aviation enterprises from all over  Russia, beginning from Kaliningrad in the extreme west of Russia  to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in the Far East, have confirmed their  intention to participate in the strike, ITAR-TASS learned from  the strike headquarters.    The protest action began on Tuesday when Moscow pilots  staged  pickets outside the building of the State Duma. The strikers  hope to make the government meet their demands which were  formulated in a package of documents which had been submitted to  the government for consideration in February.    President of the trade union of Russian Pilots, Alfred  Malinovsky, told ITAR-TASS that they suggest lifting unjustified  tariffs for transportation imposed on civil aviation and  introducing an efficient system of non-cash payments. He  pointed out that it is important to create an employment fund  for the aviation personnel to promote that experienced pilots  remain on staff of civil aviation enterprises, at present,  around 7,000-8,000 experienced pilots aged from 27 to 37 are  facing redundancies, Malinovsky said.    Among other demands pilots propose to introduce a new  aviation code to meet international rules, ensure the safety of  flights, normal pensions for pilots and their social insurance.    "All these problems are quite solvable and part of them  might  be resolved within a few months. However, the problem of  pensions should be settled until May 18. Since it requires no  particular modifications in the legislature or additional funds.  But despite all our efforts, the authorities declined to open a  dialogue with us to discuss our demands," Malinovsky said.    Pilots engaged in sanitary aviation, air search teams and  some other kinds of civil aviation are not taking part in the  strike.</p>

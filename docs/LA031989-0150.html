			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COCAINE PUTS ANTLEY AT CAREER CROSSROADS  </P> <P> Jockey Chris Antley, at Laurel, Md. Saturday to ride the favorite in the  Federico Tesio Stakes, is at the crossroads of his career -- and his life.  </P> <P> He is America's best rider under the age of 25, and he has the potential to  move to the very top of the racing game.  </P> <P> He also has the potential to self-destruct -- to become the most noted cocaine  casualty in his profession.  </P> <P> Drug tests taken at the New York tracks have turned up two "positives" on  Antley -- once for marijuana a year ago, and then for cocaine in November. If  it happens again, his license will be revoked for a minimum of a year. "One  more time," says his agent, Drew Mollica, "and it's professional suicide."  </P> <P> Antley knows that. But will the realization make him change his life? Many  people in racing have their doubts, for they look upon Antley as a kid spoiled  by his sudden success.  </P> <P> Antley burst into prominence in New Jersey, where his success made him the  country's top race-winning rider in 1985; he had little trouble making the  transition to the tough New York circuit, and in 1987 his mounts earned more  than $8 million. Last year, he started getting his first real national  attention, as the jockey for the Kentucky Derby favorite Private Terms.  </P> <P> Antley celebrated this whirlwind success -- and his first taste of money -- by  partaking of life in the fast lane. His most visible outward symbol was his  car, a huge white Mercedes 560SEC.  </P> <P> It couldn't have surprised many people that cocaine was a part of the lifestyle  he had chosen. "I started experimenting off and on with cocaine 2 1/2 years  ago," Antley said. "It never seemed to be a problem for me."  </P> <P> The jockey had seen a good first-hand lesson for thinking that cocaine could be  a problem. His brother, Bryan, wrecked his own chances for a career as a jockey  because of his drug use.  </P> <P> Why would an athlete with the talent to earn money, fame and success take a  chance of throwing everything away so recklessly?  </P> <P> To this question, Antley answered, "Just because you're making big money  doesn't mean everything is perfect with your life. People don't know your  family problems, your individual circumstances. I was unhappy, I wasn't  content," he said.  </P> <P> When Antley tested positive for cocaine at Aqueduct last fall, his life fell  apart. He didn't want to leave his house, didn't even want to turn on a radio  or television to face up to his disgrace. "I was shattered," he said. "I came  to the point where I just about wanted to die."  </P> <P> Antley entered the prescribed 30-day rehabilitation program, then started to go  to three-a-week meetings with a support group. He made changes in his  lifestyle. He gave up his old nightlife. He even bought a Blazer 4X4 to help  eradicate his life-in-the-fast lane image. He said, "I have no temptation  whatsoever to use cocaine. I have a hatred for what it caused me. I look down  on it now."  </P> <P> For the time being, at least, his life and career are back on track. Antley  resumed riding Jan. 25, and he said, "Walking out of the jockeys' room that day  I was more nervous than I was before the Derby. But I got a lot of support from  everyone, even the fans; I didn't hear anything negative."  </P> <P> Antley promptly showed that he was as sharp as ever, and despite the time he  had missed he ran away with the riding title at the Aqueduct winter meeting,  winning a remarkable 27 percent of his starts. He has a chance for success in  this year's 3-year-old stakes with A.M. Swinger, the colt he rides at Laurel  this afternoon.  </P> <P> And he has done all of this by the age of 23. The only thing that can keep  Chris Antley from reaching the acme of his profession is Chris Antley.  </P></p>

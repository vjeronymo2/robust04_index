			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Outdoors: Russia's river of high returns - Angling East of Murmansk, a large snout of taiga called the Kola Peninsular noses into the Barents Sea. Its few inhabitants, famed for their extremes of inebriation, herd reindeer. It used to be one of the world's more forgotten places. All this changed in 1990, however. That was when an American sporting outfitter called Frontiers discovered that the rivers on the near-deserted Russian peninsular supported stocks of Atlantic salmon in numbers not seen in Europe or America for more than a century. Most of the waters meander through trackless wastes, cuckoo-haunted forests and immense, glacially-scoured plains largely untouched by man. When the salmon smolt heads for salt water, it finds unobstructed passage to the wintering grounds, patrolled comfortingly by the Russian navy. It is all quite a change from the mayhem of the EU-regulated North Sea. This has led to big changes. The shacks of Murmansk airport are now full of colourfully-clad fly-rodders - an international coterie of fishing enthusiasts who will do almost anything to make contact with their premier game fish. From a battered Russian airport bus, they creep into the cavernous holds of even more battered Russian helicopters. These huge ironclads thud over the taiga, depositing their human cargoes at camps newly constructed in the forest. Polystyrene igloos, tents, anything will do. Nothing like this invasion of fly-pole artists has been seen before. The river to which I went is 260 miles long and queen of the lot. Of the 11,000 fish caught by rod annually on the Kola Peninsular, 7,000 come from the Ponoi during a season that lasts four months starting in June. It is remarkably consis-tent. Two camps operate over a fishing concession from the Russian government that covers 80 of the prime 120 miles that are suited to fly fishing. The luxurious Upper Ponoi camp, my abode for a week, not only has a stretch of this great salmon river but also flies devotees out daily to two dreamily beautiful tributaries, the Aacheriyok and the Pournache. When salmon are encountered in these rivers, they can be blissfully forgiving. After a botched cast and a poor strike, even after having been hooked and lost, they return to the attack with an aggression that usually occurs only in fishermen's wilder fantasies. Statistics may be inconclusive, but salmon talk is rarely devoid of them for long. One British woman landed 42 salmon in a day from the upper Ponoi. My own fishing partner found creative embellishment of the day's proceedings unnecessary - he hooked and landed nine salmon in two hours in a pool requiring only half a cast. Three years ago, 12 rods on Lower Ponoi camp averaged 66 fish apiece for each of their two weeks there. Contrary to expectations, I found that the fishing was usually sporty despite the occasional 'taking frenzies'. Pound for pound, these Russian fish punch above their weight. Indeed, much Stolichnaya has been sunk in sorrowful meditation on their breakaway powers. I found unshaven, bleary-looking men slumped in the airport reflecting ruefully on the inadequacies of their tackle and competence. On the Kola, the accent might be mainly on salmon - but you can never quite forget the stories of Stalin's extermination of the Lapps, or overlook the feeling of history that permeates all Russian soil. Together, all these things make this migration of western sportsmen a particularly interesting one in which to take part. Michael Wigan flew Finnair to Murmansk. The trip was organised by Frontiers' London office at 14 Old Bond St, WIX 3DB, tel: 071-493 0798. Prices for a Ponoi package run between Dollars 5,650 and Dollars 7,500, starting from Murmansk.</p>

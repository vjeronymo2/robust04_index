			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Arab group pays Westland Pounds 115m The Arab Organisation for Industrialisation has paid a further Pounds 115m to Westland Helicopters, taking the legal tussle between the manufacturer and several Arab governments a step forward. The case followed the collapse of an Egyptian-based helicopter manufacturing project in 1979. The organisation was set up by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Egypt to make Lynx helicopters under licence. A year ago the Geneva-based Arbitral Tribunal, which deals with international disputes, put the damages owed to Westland at Pounds 385m. A payment of Pounds 25m was made in February.</p>

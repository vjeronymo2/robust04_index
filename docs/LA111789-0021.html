			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FLORES SEEKS MERCHANT SHIP BERTH  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores has asked the Port of Los  Angeles to reconsider docking the merchant ship Lane Victory at Berth 87, which  would place the vessel near popular tourist attractions along the San Pedro  waterfront.  </P> <P> "I'd like to have the port tell its engineers to look at this site and pretend  that a very prosperous shipping company" has a ship this size, which it wants  to dock at Berth 87, and see if they can make it work, Flores told port  officials at a City Council committee meeting Tuesday. "Try and be a little  creative."  </P> <P> Port spokeswoman Julia Nagano responded in an interview after the meeting: "We  will evaluate it. And I am sure we will continue to look at other sites as  well."  </P> <P> A group of merchant marine veterans is trying to convert the 455-foot-long  vessel into a museum to honor their fallen comrades. They want to dock the ship  at Berth 87, just north of the Los Angeles Maritime Museum and a statue that  honors merchant seamen. But port officials say that berth, along the main  shipping channel, is needed as a cargo terminal.  </P></p>

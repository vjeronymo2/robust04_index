			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Jurisdiction of CFI extended - European Court The first major increase in the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance since its creation in 1988 came into effect last week. By its decision of June 8 this year, the Council of Ministers extended the jurisdiction of the CFI to cover all direct actions brought by private parties against the Community institutions. The transfer, however, is not to apply to anti-dumping cases until the Council says so. The practical implications of the Council's decision have become apparent from an order of the European Court of Justice, transferring cases within this general category to the CFI. As a result, in the region of 450 individual cases have descended to the CFI from the ECJ. These cases include an exceptional number - 380 - of milk quota cases, in which compensation is claimed from the European Commission for mishandling milk market regulation. Many more may have been filed directly with the CFI under its new jurisdiction before the expiry of the deadline for making compensation claims. The others are mainly judicial review and damages claims in the fields of state aids, external trade relations, environment and consumer protection as well, as employment (pensions) questions involving the EC institutions. One of the main purposes of the Council's decision to extend the jurisdiction of the CFI is to permit the ECJ to reduce still further delays in hearing cases by cutting the court's case load. In fact, leaving aside the exceptional number of milk quota cases, each of the 13 ECJ judges is unlikely to lose more than four or five cases for which they bear primary responsibility as the reporting judge. Similarly, the 12 CFI judges individually will receive only a few additional cases. Nevertheless, the increase in case load will be welcomed by the CFI judges who have been restricted previously to competition, staff and certain coal and steel cases. The ECJ will, however, take on a new role as the appeal court for all the cases transferred to the CFI. All cases heard by the CFI at first instance may be appealed to the ECJ on a point of law. ECJ Order, September 28 1993, applying Article 4 of Council Decision 93/350/ECSC/EEC/Euratom of June 8 1993, OJ 1993 L144/21, June 16 1993, modifying Council Decision 88/591/ECSC/EEC/Euratom establishing the Court of First Instance. Pensions judgment The European Court of Justice has announced that it will give judgment tomorrow in the Ten Oever equal pension rights case. This case was referred to Luxembourg on questions concerning pension rights in the light of the court's 1991 Barber judgment. The Court has decided to give judgment in this case alone rather than together with the cases joined with it, which include the Coloroll case. C-109/91: Ten Oever v Stichting Bedrijfpensioenfonds voor het Glazenwassers. Competition cases Last week, the ECJ held oral hearings in two competition cases involving the Treaty ban on abuse of a dominant position. The first concerns the scope of the competition rules and their application to the public sector in the case of Eurocontrol. In particular, the Court has been asked to rule whether operations such as Eurocontrol are 'undertakings' (or the sort of economic enterprise) covered by the competition rules. C-364/92, SAT V Eurocontrol, hearing ECJ FC, September 28 1993. The second concerned the appeal by Hilti to the ECJ against the CFI's December 12 1991 decision (Case T-30/89), rejecting Hilti's original appeal against the Commission decision fining it for abuse of a dominant position in connection with the tying of the purchase of Hilti nails to the purchase of Hilti nail guns. Hilti is challenging the CFI's determinations of the relevant product market, the finding of dominance and the burden of proof. C-53/92-P. Hilti v Commission, hearing ECJ FC, September 29 1993.</p>

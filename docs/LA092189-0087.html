			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: HUNTINGTON PARK;  </P> <P> COUNCIL CERTIFIES RESULTS OF FAILED UTILITY TAX ELECTION  </P> <P> The Huntington Park City Council on Tuesday certified the results of last  week's special election on a proposed 7% utility tax, which was defeated.  </P> <P> Nine hundred people -- about 64% -- voted against the proposed tax on  electricity, natural gas, water and telephone usage, City Clerk Marilyn Boyette  said Wednesday. The tax was favored by 507 of those voting. A simple majority  was required for passage.  </P> <P> Money from the utility tax was to have been used for employee raises and to  hire 15 more police officers.  </P> <P> The City Council approved a $27.8-million austerity budget during the summer  that includes no raises for the city's 200 employees. The council also cut  spending by more than $150,000 in various areas.  </P> <P> City officials are reviewing the budget for additional spending cuts to free  money for employee raises, among other things, Chief Administrative Officer  Donald L. Jeffers said.  </P> <P> The three associations that represent city employees agreed to work at last  year's pay levels pending the outcome of the election. Negotiations with those  associations are scheduled for next month.  </P></p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (21): Preparing for eventual membership of EC / A look at the Phare projects AT Natolin Palace, in an old park on Warsaw's southern outskirts, postgraduates from the two halves of Europe are completing a 12-month course devoted to every aspect of European integration. The house, built in the 1780s for Princess Elzbieta Lubomirska, is where communist party hardliners had plotted their power plays in 1956 during the Hungarian crisis and Poland's concurrent liberalisation. It is a fit setting for academic endeavour to help stitch together the formerly divided eastern and western parts of Europe. The course is organised by the Bruges-based College d'Europe and financed out of European Community funds. And Natolin is being refurbished with money generated from early EC food transfer programmes. The project is part of the Community's Phare effort, the largest of the programmes aimed at helping Poland and her neighbours prepare for eventual Community membership. The sums involved are paltry compared to regional aid programmes within the EC, but each year since 1990 Poland has been allocated Ecu 200m under Phare. This annual amount is being increased to Ecu 225m for three years from January 1993. The size of the annual allocation is decided in Brussels, but its various end-users are selected through a time consuming process attempting to match, with varying success, not only Brussels' wishes but also the needs and priorities of the Poles. In 1990 food aid received a high profile with half of the funds made available devoted to supplies of animal feed, pesticides and credits for the farming sector. Owing to the slump in Polish farming incomes and continuing high interest rates, the Ecu 30m credit line then allocated has yet to be taken up. But the pesticides and feed has been sold with the proceeds going into a co-operation fund now worth 300bn zloty. This fund supports other Phare projects which have local input. Since then farming has been a smaller recipient of EC aid programmes, not least because Polish government priorities have tended to play down the sector. Indeed for the next three years a mere 7 per cent of the Ecu 675m allocated to Poland will go to farming. As most aid organisations know, collection and allocation of funds is only half the struggle. There have been controversies over whether the projects chosen in Poland have been the right ones and *something in here (HP) * whether they have been designed more to favour the donor than the recipient. Spending the money can be a problem in itself. In Poland's case there have been delays, with only 60 per cent of the total funds allocated for 1991 and 1992spent, and only 12 per cent of the Ecu 200m for this year disbursed. The higher and secondary education sector has been a star performer with the beneficiaries promptly drawing and spending the Ecu 53m allocated to them since 1990. The British government's know-how fund is one of the first bi-lateral funds to have become operational and has spent Pounds 30m of its Pounds 50m allocation to Poland, with most allocated to providing advice on privatisation and other financial matters. Phare, by contrast, is giving a high priority to education exchanges and educational reform. As much as Ecu 125m, or nearly one fifth of the total Phare fund for the next three years, is to be spent on this sector. Phare has also made financial assistance available to assist privatisation, financial reforms and industrial restructuring. At the government-owned Industrial Restructuring Agency, Dr Lothar Nettekoven, an EC-funded expert, says that the technical assistance provided to the agency, and through it to enterprises, has transformed the unit completely. It is now a much more sophisticated organisation capable of dealing on its own terms with the outside world, he says. Mr Marek Krawczyk, a director at the agency agrees, pointing to the EC funds which have been spent hiring advisers for the Ministry of Industry. They have helped the ministry deal with Lucchini, the Italian steel maker which took over the Warsaw steelworks, Pilkington, which set up a joint venture with the Sandomierz glass works, and Volkswagen, which linked up with the Tarpan light truck factory in Poznan. But the Phare programme is soon to undergo a subtle shift, in line with the wishes of the Poles. The new policy will take it away from technical assistance and towards direct investment projects aimed at generating growth in high unemployment areas. Four such areas have now been identified, Walbrzych in the south west, the textile town of Lodz, 130km west of Warsaw, Suwalki, in the north east and the Mielec area to the south. Here Ecu 60m worth of funds are to be spent this year under the Struder programme, followed by another Ecu 32m and Ecu 37m in 1994 and 1995 respectively, on equity investment, grants and loans, in an effort to generate jobs. Other areas covered by Phare include aid to Poland's foreign investment agency as well as export and tourist promotion efforts. A main chunk worth Ecu 80m is to be spent on rail and road transport planning schemes. Fewer funds are available for other urgently needed projects such as modernising the Polish customs service and tackling environmental problems.</p>

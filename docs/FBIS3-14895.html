			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Yavorskyy: "A Man of Uncommon </F> Intelligence and Weak Will"]    [Excerpt] A man is judged by his deeds and not by his  words, because it is a man's deeds that reveal his nature.    Keeping this in mind, let us try to portray the nature of  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. This is important, because  he personifies the entire current Ukrainian leadership -- the  union between democrats and postcommunists. As everybody knows,  the former as well as the latter had been rejecting the idea of  Ukrainian statehood before the "reconstruction," and became  advocates of independence only under the pressure of  circumstances -- the collapse of the USSR. Therefore, knowing  who Kravchuk really is, we will know where Ukraine is going, and  what we should expect in the future.    President Kravchuk seems to be a man who is able to view  issues comprehensively. One should be particularly alarmed by  his speeches, in which he consistently explains his opinions,  covering any acute issues with apt metaphors and arguments, as a  result of which the issue no longer seems as acute as before.    Many people ask themselves: Why do people like the  president's speeches? The answer is simple. There is a certain  probability in his words. This is merely a probability, not the  truth. Additionally, it is hard to avoid the feeling that his  reasoning is meant to be admired. Moreover, it is meant to  satisfy all people.    Therefore, while estimating the president, an open-eyed man  experiences a harassing duality of feelings: sympathy on the one  hand and dissatisfaction on the other. The first feeling is  induced by the president's intelligence, the second one -- by  the lack of clear goals.    The events of the last three years have convinced many  people  of the certain incongruity and even vulnerability of Kravchuk.  It must be pointed out that this incongruity is characteristic  of the entire current leadership of Ukraine, whose best  representatives, though they represent the right way of  thinking, actually lack an essential element of spirit -- the  ability to see the main goal and consistently pursue it. This  is why estimates of various democratic or postcommunist leaders  imply an opinion about their affectation and even insincerity.  Despite their words, suspicions occur that those are not their  words, that their beliefs are far from these words, and that  none of them will keep or is even able to keep their promises.  Such a feeling is induced, first of all, by the lack of the  above-mention element.    There is no doubt that this element is the strength of will.  Kravchuk and the entire democratic-postcommunist Ukrainian  leadership lack strength of will. This makes Ukraine's leaders  incongruous and ephemeral. They resemble people who bargain at  the market with a serious look but have no money in their  pockets.    Summarizing the above, it can be said that Kravchuk has  gifted, uncommon intelligence but also a very weak will. His  activities in the offices of Supreme Council chairman and  Ukrainian president have confirmed this.    Let us more carefully examine the internal mechanism of  behavior of the current Ukrainian president.    All his "successes," which actually reduce to a masterful  balancing of Ukraine's political temporariness, are exclusively  based on his natural slyness and ability to predict people's  moods. He bets everything on intensifying tactical steps and  accomplishing superficial tasks, while avoiding resolution of  any fundamental issues, which, of course, may lead to minor  victories, but which will never result in a global victory.  These are the typical deeds of a weak-willed man, who is afraid  of everything great.    It is evident that the president does not have any  state-building program. Since he does not know what he wants,  what should he do, and where should he go; he is merely forced  to respond to external stimuli. This is the only thing he does.    President Kravchuk's activities have explicitly testified to  the fact that he is unable, and does not want, to accomplish  great tasks connected with the development of the Ukrainian  state. Probably, he does not even realize that this is an  important matter. This is why he has neither a concept of state  nor an approximate plan of action. A man who is not going to do  anything does not need any plans.    Such an assessment of President Kravchuk is not groundless.  The fact that he catastrophically neglects the factor of  strength is significant. If someone wants to achieve something,  he usually accumulates his strength. Any task is doomed to  failure without strength. This relates to any task,  particularly, the building of a state.    If the Ukrainian president realized the importance of  strength in state-building processes, all of his energy would  focus on forming such strength. This means that he would  undertake intensive work aimed at increasing the number of  people devoted to the idea of Ukrainian independence, that he  would support -- at the state level -- all activities aimed at  boosting patriotic attitudes, and that he would mercilessly  terminate all antinational activities. In such a case, massive  patriotic-educational work would be conducted in our country,  and anti-Ukrainian propaganda would be banned. All this would  have to be carried out within reasonable boundaries, respecting  reality, however consistently and steadfastly.    As a matter of fact, the president would have to make a  clear  ideological choice, and, having divided the people into two  sectors -- supporters and enemies of independent Ukraine -- he  would bet on the first one. Understanding that the fate of the  Ukrainian state would depend on the strength of the supporters  of independent Ukraine, the president would make all possible  efforts to strengthen them. A patriotically educated population  is the foundation of a state; it is its force that creates and  maintains a state. If there is no such foundation, there is  also no sense to deal with such attributes of state as political  system, economy, democracy, culture, and religion.    Meanwhile, Kravchuk completely ignores the main problem of  Ukraine -- developing such strength, which means forming a great  number of patriots, whose support could help resolve any  problems. He attempts to build the state in a different way,  which has been unknown in the history of the world -- not by the  strength of united people, but by cunning, acrobatic diplomacy.    This has not given any positive results during the two years  of Ukrainian independence, because it could not give any.  Ukraine today resembles an amorphous social substance, all the  spheres of which are ruined. There is no order, laws are  ineffective, and nobody listens to anybody. No reforms are  conducted. Everything is plunged into inactivity and the realm  of daydreams. There can be only one answer to the question of  who rules Ukraine -- inertia.    It is President Kravchuk who is responsible for this  situation, because he has never had his own political line, but  has always followed an average line of the entire society, not  advocating the creative minority, but the inert majority. His  willingness to make compromises kills any attempt to move  forward. Therefore, there has been no such movement. The lack  of movement has resulted in the current decay.    This is quite normal, since society can change, and  therefore, develop, only if it adapts new ideas advocated by  minorities or even separate individuals. The responsibility of  a state leader is to select from new ideas the most suitable  one, and to guide society in the right direction. A leader  should steer society. He should not be an average voice of  inoperative mass that does not have any intelligence, but only  potential energy.    All that has been said above allows one to come to the  conclusion that the activities of Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk are determined by two factors -- bright intelligence  and weak will. The lack of a precise concept of state-building,  the slyness of his policy, his willingness to make compromises,  and neglecting the factor of strength are the results of these  components. Knowing this, one can easily explain and predict  every step of the president. [passage omitted]</p>

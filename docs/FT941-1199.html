			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Japan's property prices fall Japanese land prices dropped for the third consecutive year in 1993, writes Paul Abrahams in Tokyo. The fall, the aftermath of property speculation during the late 1980s 'bubble economy', is a serious problem for Japan's banks which hold about Y14,000bn (Pounds 89.7bn) in bad loans, on which most of the collateral is property. The National Land Agency said residential property prices fell 4.8 per cent last year and would fall further this year. That compared with an 8.7 per cent fall in 1992. Commercial property prices dropped 11.3 per cent on average, against 11.4 per cent the previous year. Tokyo has been hit by the collapse in prices far more than other cities. In many regional cities prices were unchanged or fell only slightly, according to the agency. However, commercial prices in the capital fell 19 per cent last year, while in central Tokyo they plunged 23.7 per cent. Residential prices in central districts fell 24 per cent in 1993. The continuing strength of the recession in Japan was underlined yesterday when department stores reported sales down 4.2 per cent in February, against the same month last year. Cold weather and consumers buying cheaper goods were partly to blame.</p>

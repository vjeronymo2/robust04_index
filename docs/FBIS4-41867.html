			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Andrey Kirillov and </F> Vladimir Solntsev]    [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun -- Talks between Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen  culminated today in the initialing of a bilateral agreement on  the western sector of the Russian-Chinese border. The document  is expected to be signed in early September during the second  Russian-Chinese summit meeting.    The USSR and China concluded an agreement on the eastern  sector of the border in 1991. ITAR-TASS was told at the Russian  Foreign Ministry that agreement has now been reached on a 55-km  stretch of the border with Altay Kray, on which Russia has never  had a treaty with contemporary China.    "There are no problems or disagreement between us, so the  talks were a success," a Foreign Ministry official said. He  added that there have been no territorial concessions by either  side.    After the agreement is signed it will have to be ratified by  the parliaments of both countries.</p>

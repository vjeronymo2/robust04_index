Every Development  Needs Visions as well as Promoters.    Economy and Science Must Adapt to Internationalization  of Markets    HANDELSBLATT, Wednesday 24 Nov 93. The less than  satisfactory  growth of the German economy during the past few months has made  it clear how an even most stable boom can come to an end.  Despite all the austerity measures and consolidation required at  this difficult time, we must not neglect to also provide for  tomorrow. An essential requisite for this is, among others, a  tight international dovetailing of economic management and  science: above all in the so-called "high-tech" area.    When viewing the status of scientific organizations at the  threshold to the next millennium from the economic standpoint,  we must ask ourselves whether we are adequately equipped to deal  with anticipated developments and problems. We have to recognize  that flexibility and productivity of scientific effort will be  adversely affected by overregulation and inadequate budget  authorization for smaller R.&amp; D. units.    A further impediment is the widespread adherence to the  regionalization (territorial demarcation) principle. The Bonn  University is beholden to the City of Bonn, the universities of  North Rhineland - Westphalia are beholden to the provinces, and  the German universities are beholden to the German Federal  Republic. Europeanization must not pause while science is  organizing itself. For a model let us look at the U.S.A., where  private American universities are internationally oriented.  Japanese universities and research organizations, for instance,  are in this way gaining a foothold in Germany.  <H5>  ICSI: Bridgehead for German Scientists </H5>   Globalization of the economy as a necessity must also  include  international extension of national research organizations and,  therefore, German participation in the international contest  between science systems. This means that there is a need for a  presence of German scientific organizations acting as business  enterprises abroad, because a target of the international  contest is always one or another national entity.    In order for the changeover from a service-oriented society  to a science- based society to be correctly understood, it is  necessary for the "science industry" to follow the overall  global economy distribution pattern. The developments point  unequivocally to globalization of institutional structures.    It is in these terms that one should look at the  International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley,  established by both economic and scientific communities.  Development has been found to need visions as well as promoters.  The success of this initiative hinges on the trilateral relation  between the University of California in Berkeley, the ICSI, and  the German support association: a consortium of companies  serving as a bridgehead for German scientists as well as for  private and public research and development organizations.    The consortium formed by Daimler-Benz, Mannesmann,  Siemens, Krupp, Bertelsmann, and SEL, also the Mathematics and  Data Processing Society (GMD), and the president of the  German Patent Office takes all the credit for having opened a  technological front window to most advanced research and  development by launching this joint venture with the University  of California in Berkeley with the establishment of its  International Computer Science Institute in 1988 and by thus  successfully integrating German scientists into joint projects  with top American researchers.  <H5>  Results of U.S. Research Hardly Made Available to Europeans </H5>   Technology transfer from the U.S.A. is particularly  important, because crucial developments in these key  technologies take place there and yet the results of those  developments are hardly or not at all available to Europeans.  This protectionist stance is taken by the U.S. Department of  Commerce on behalf of industries fearing that an outflow of  know-how will adversely affect their competitive position  internationally.    The technology transfer through the ICSI is yielding  impressive results, which German member companies can utilize  and evaluate at no cost and without restrictions. The outpost in  Berkeley plays here a double bridging function: in the  transatlantic German-American axis and in the significance of  California's Bay Area to the Pacific region.    Neither is the technology transfer from California to  Germany  meant to be a one-way street but rather, and this is especially  important in the keen international contest, California is also  meant to serve as a base for dissemination of German products  and processes. It is precisely this aspect of German-American  cooperation within the framework of the "Joint Venture" which is  promoted by the Governor of California ("... My administration  recognizes the value of developing global ties at the early  stages of research, in order to ensure international cooperation  through the commercial development stages. ... Our  administration looks forward to playing an active role through  the implementation of this joint venture" wrote California's  Governor George Deukmejian on 9 May 1990).    The requisite for global competitiveness of the German  economy is that it not only be represented by a production and  marketing organization abroad but also be tightly linked,  through research and development, to the scientific community  abroad.    It is exactly in medium-size enterprises where the ability  to  innovate is assuming an increasingly important role. While  opened up to innovations, however, they must also be in a more  vigorously manner given the opportunity to utilize newly  acquired scientific and technical knowledge. Professor Syrbe,  former president of the Fraunhofer Society, has found  the distribution of expenditures by an enterprise to be so  skewed that per 80&percnt; of its outlays today only 5&percnt;  is allotted  to research and development.  <H3>  Japan's Machine Manufacturing Industry Enhances Its  Competence </H3>   This lop-sided distribution pattern indicates how necessary  it is to boost joint projects involving science and economic  management so as to accelerate research and technology transfer  to the medium-size industry. For new products and processes are  being developed predominantly in the area of research-intensive  technologies and a key role here is being assumed by the  information technology, a technology which has already  penetrated all sectors of industry at a breathtaking pace.    A glance at Japan reveals that there for instance the  machine  manufacturing industry, also structured as a medium-size one,  consistently invests in enhancement of its R.&amp; D.  competence. Up  to 20&percnt; of its investments have gone into R.&amp; D.:  above all in  areas of control engineering, robotics, and materials research,  where the top technologies yield highly innovative and intensely  worth-creating processes and products.    Information science and information technology are crucial  driving forces in other sectors of industry: one DM worth of  output in information technology results in about 7-8 DM worth  of output in other sectors as, for instance, in machine and  plant construction. Today about one third of Germany's national  product is built around a microelectronic kernel.    New information techniques have meanwhile reached a level of  development and thus become focally significant for our  middle-class economy as well. Until now the German medium-size  industry has been completely bypassed by the much needed  technology transfer. Cooperation with science is of vital  importance to precisely this industry, inasmuch as it has only a  limited own research capacity available. Conversely, science  depends on confrontation by problems of industrial practice for  working out competitive solutions.    The key results achieved by the Project ICSI in neural  information technology and high-capacity computer networks have  become decisive future- outlook factors in the global contest.  Among the 500 principal enterprises in the U.S.A. there is today  hardly one not intensely involved with these concerns and not  assigning inside development teams to deal with them.    Establishment of the European Domestic Market and the  increasing globalization of trade will continue to increase the  dependence on innovative telecommunication and telecooperation  systems. It is to be feared that companies which do not have  this technology at their long-term disposal will not be able to  hold their ground in the international contest.  <H5>  Door to Development of Intelligent Technologies </H5>   We cannot afford to be represented internationally by Goethe  Institutes only. We must get our foot in the door to development  of intelligent technologies such as those which the  International Computer Science Institute is making available to  us. Let us not forget that it takes less and less time to  convert the results of research and development into producible  items.</p>

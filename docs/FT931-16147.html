			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: British Airways There are so many cross-winds buffeting British Airways at present that it is difficult to tell where the shares should head. BA's shares have dipped 7 per cent this week. Embarrassing as it is, though, the news about its dirty tricks campaign against Virgin is unlikely to make matters worse for its share price. More important are its poor passenger figures, especially since BAA, the airport operator, cast further doubt on the outlook yesterday. Unfortunately for BA, the continuing tightness in the market coincides with a significant increase in capacity. Either BA leaves seats empty, or the airline chops prices to sell those seats. Both ways profits suffer. Such pressures, combined with BA's hectic round of acquisitions and hefty aircraft replacement programme, must only increase the temptations for a cash call. BA's long-term attractions remain intact. The airline's rigorous cost-cutting campaign and high operational gearing make BA a classic recovery play. Sterling's devaluation will help this year as about 60 per cent of BA's revenues are earned in foreign currencies while the majority of costs are in sterling. BA is also well-placed to benefit from the sporadic liberalisation of international routes. The short-term difficulties are daunting, though. It may be a while before the market peers through the ominous tidings.</p>

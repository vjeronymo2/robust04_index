			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesian copper/gold reserve estimates lifted Further confirmation came yesterday that the highlands of Irian Jaya in Indonesia contain one of the world's great copper-gold ore bodies. Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold revealed that proven and probable reserves at the Ertsberg/Grasberg mining complex there had been increased substantially in the past year and said that the current USDollars 140m expansion programme was on schedule to boost annual production to about 1.1bn lb of copper and 1.5m troy ounces of gold in 1996. This will make the complex the world's second-largest copper producer - accounting for about 5 per cent of western world demand - and one of the top ten gold producers. Last year Ertsberg/Grasberg sold about 644m lb of copper and 740m ounces of gold. Grasberg already had the largest published gold reserve of any single operating mine. Freeport said yesterday that in the past year another 7m ounces had been discovered, boosting reserves by 22 per cent to 39.1m ounces. Copper reserves were up by 28 per cent, or 5.9bn lb, to 26.8bn lb and silver reserves jumped by 72 per cent, or 32m ounces, to 76.7m ounces. Even at the expanded capacity the increased reserves give the mine a life of about 25.5 years but Freeport continues to explore - it has nine drilling rigs in operation. Freeport also announced that its fourth-quarter 1993 net income would be about 15 cents a share compared with 17 cents in the same months of 1992. The latest figure includes an estimated Dollars 9m loss at Rio Tinto Minera in Spain, which Freeport acquired last year so as to have 'captive' copper smelting capacity for some of the Indonesian concentrate (an intermediate material). Freeport Copper, 72 per cent-owned by Freeport-McMoRan, another US quoted group, in turn controls 85 per cent of Freeport Indonesia, which owns and operates the Ertsberg/Grasberg complex.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (13): An irresistible opportunity / Profile of Banesto WHAT, analysts wanted to know, did J. P. Morgan, the US investment bank, see in Banesto? Most people looked at Spain's fourth-ranked bank in terms of assets, and saw the sharpest growth of non-performing loans in the sector and an exposure to industry that barely met the capital adequacy ratios set by the bank of Spain. At the end of last year Banesto posted a 23 per cent fall in net profits. J. P. Morgan, however, looked at Banesto and liked what it saw. It liked it so much that in May it co-ordinated a three-stage plan that aims to raise up to Pta130bn in fresh funds for the bank, a sum that represents the biggest capital increase ever recorded in Spain. The US investment bank put the full weight of its prestige behind Banesto's future fortunes and it put its money - and that of its clients - where its mouth was. J. P. Morgan's Dollars 1bn Corsair fund will invest Dollars 200m in a three-for-one rights issue, the first stage of the capital increase, and the fund will end up owning some 10 per cent of Banesto. J. P. Morgan spent seven months last year researching Banesto. Behind the bank's poor balance sheet it saw in Banesto a potential that others had failed to value. Simply put, the J. P. Morgan team that burrowed into the heart of Banesto discovered an irresistible investor opportunity. They found a bank that had a country-wide retail outlet; that had invested strongly in information systems; that had a strong management; and that was very undervalued by the market . Banesto, J. P. Morgan perceived, lacked specialised banking knowledge and was strapped for capital. These shortcomings were exactly what the US investment bank could provide. J. P. Morgan believes there is great room for improvement in Banesto's treasury department and that new approaches, on swaps and other trading skills, could raise the margins of the bank's core financial business. In the short term, however, Banesto requires more funds rather than more know-how. The US investment bank, which has set up its Corsair portfolio to invest in the sort of opportunities afforded by the Banestos of this world, has the funds readily available. The all-important feature of the arrival of fresh funds to Banesto is that it will strengthen the bank's capital base at a very crucial time. Banesto is the dominant shareholder in a spread of domestic enterprises which come under the umbrella of its conglomerate, Corporacion Industrial. It is this corporate involvement that has prompted the Bank of Spain to take a long and critical look at the bank's capital adequacy ratio. An injection of funds does two things: it deflects the Bank of Spain's spotlight and it gives Banesto time to avoid a fire sale. The bank will now be able to dispose of its industrial assets to the best bidder and without pressure from Bank of Spain authorities. Banesto clearly gains breathing space through a capital increase but J. P. Morgan, which is masterminding the arrival of fresh cash, stands to make important deals as it advises the Spanish bank in the sale of its assets. In the mid-term, Banesto is due to sell off Acerinox, Spain's leading stainless steel producer and Union Carburos, its industrial gases group. The bank is also understood to be open to possible buyers for Tudor, Europe's third-ranked battery producer, Agroman, the big domestic building group and Asturiana de Zinc, a highly profitable mining business when the cycle is right. Banesto's weak capital base has consistently dragged down the bank's profitability and the rights issue is expected to raise Banesto's Bank for International Settlements ratio from 9.3 to 12 per cent even with all the Corporacion Industrial assets in place. As disposals are realised, Banesto will emerge with a very sound balance sheet and fully prepared to reap the profits of its core banking business. Among the aspects of Banesto that J. P. Morgan very much liked was its big investment in the past years in new information systems. These, which are reckoned to be the most advanced in the domestic banking sector, are now poised to deliver significantly-increased efficiency and lowered costs to Banesto's banking operations. The US bank also approved of the leadership exerted by the mercurial Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's chairman, a self-made millionaire who took over the bank in 1987 at the age of 38. At the end of last year, Mr Conde reshuffled his top management and, to J. P. Morgan's delight, promoted Mr Enrique Lasarte, a highly regarded and experienced financier, to become chief executive of Banesto's core banking business. What J. P. Morgan expects is that Mr Conde will give Mr Lasarte all the support he requires to severely cut back Banesto's overweighted staff and to rationalise the existing spread of its banking network. J. P. Morgan sees profitability for itself through the disposal of Banesto's assets and also profitability for its Corsair funds as the bank turns around its business. It also senses that it would be impossible to buy into Banesto, a big bank by any standards, at a cheaper price. The new shares that J. P. Morgan will acquire in the rights issue will be priced at Pta1,500 with an extra Pta400 offered for subscription rights. At the time of agreement, Banesto shares stood at about Pta2.645 - they have since fallen off - and broking houses reckon that equity in Mr Conde's bank is a clear buy below Pta3,000.</p>

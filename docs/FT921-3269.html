			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Arts: Recruitment without the cutting edge - Malcolm Rutherford reviews Farquhar's play at the National WITH THIS production of The Recruiting Officer, the National theatre has completed a 180 degrees turn. George Farquhar's play was the first restoration comedy to be staged by the National Theatre Company when it was in its infancy at the Old Vic in 1963. The production then was directed by William Gaskill and had more than a handful of stars in the cast: Laurence Olivier, Robert Stephens, Colin Blakely, Max Adrian and Maggie Smith among them. The Gaskill approach drew heavily on an adaptation of the play by Bertholt Brecht, Pauken und Trompeten, which emphasised the horrors of war, imperialism, the exploitation of the working class and everything else that you might expect to go with a title like The Recruiting Officer. The new production, directed by Nicholas Hytner, puts Brecht firmly behind it. The setting, the style, the tone are all positively bucolic. There is hardly a hint of war in the background, any class exploitation is most gently done and scarcely a blow is struck in anger. Almost the only moment of shock comes when an officer reaches for his sword on being alarmed by the mooing of a cow. I suppose that I am too much of an innate Brechtian wholly to welcome such a total reversal and admit to some surprise that it should come from the National Theatre. Nevertheless, there is some justification for this kinder, gentler approach in the original text. Writing at the beginning of the 18th century, Farquhar was plainly influenced up to the hilt by Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. The Recruiting Officer has parts of Henry 1V and Much Ado About Nothing written all over it. Jonson's influence is most apparent in the fortune-telling scene, which could have come from The Alchemist. The striking fact, however, is that Farquhar drew only on the romantic side of his forebears. There is a lot about recruitment and war in Henry 1V and, a military man himself, Farquhar clearly borrowed from it. For the Gloucestershire of Henry 1V, Part 2, he substitutes Shropshire, which is not so very different. But the characters that he picks up are the Shallows and the Silences, not the Pistols. There is more than a touch of Falstaff in his Captain Brazen, but it is Falstaff the lovable, not Falstaff the coward and cynic. As for Ben Jonson, Farquhar has embroidered on his theme of the gullibility of human nature, yet none of his dupes are villains. In the world of this Recruiting Officer, everyone is ultimately well-intentioned at heart. It is a pastoral society where sheep may safely graze, as indeed in Ashley Martin-Davis's setting they do, alternating with the cows and the pigs. Such an interpretation, which may be literally correct, has its limitations as drama. The first half of the production seems at times painfully slow and even after the interval, when the threads are put together, you sense a contradiction between recruiting for war and the idyllic setting in which it takes place. Still, the play has some individual virtues. There is a wonderful twist at the end when Captain Brazen, who has seemed a bit of a name-dropper, turns out genuinely to know some of the people being mentioned. Unlike Falstaff, he ends on a note of triumph. Farquhar's writing, almost entirely in prose, is consistently direct and witty: he was Irish by birth. And this being the National Theatre, the acting is uniformly excellent. Desmond Barrit plays Brazen as a huge, cumbersome, yet endearing figure. Alex Jennings is an aesthetic as well as athletic Captain Plume, and Sally Dexter's Syliva is even better when she is dressed as a man. For the record, the piece has a number of firsts behind it. It may have been the first play staged in North America - in New York in 1732. It was certainly the first in Australia where it was performed by a group of convicts in 1789. One suspects that they gave it slightly more edge than Hytner. This production is sponsored by the private contributors to the Royal National Theatre.</p>

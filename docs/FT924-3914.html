			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Nasdaq plans to double trading capacity IN an attempt to double trading capacity, Nasdaq plans to replace its computerised trading system in a multi-year effort costing around Dollars 100m, Reuter reports. Nasdaq will install new hardware and software to boost the volume of trades that can be processed, cut operating costs and make it easier to introduce new trading products and dealing systems to the market. Nasdaq said it will be able to handle up to 800m shares a day, double the current capacity. Nasdaq handled its highest volume in mid-January when trading hit 328m shares a day. Nasdaq unveiled the overhaul - which will occur over the next five years - at the Securities Industry Association's annual meeting. To lift trading capacity, Nasdaq will replace its communications network so that its computer system operates much faster.</p>

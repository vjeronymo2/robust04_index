			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Heritage setback in second half A setback to trading in the second half resulted in a loss for the period at Heritage, the USM-quoted housewares distributor. On sales up from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 12.7m, the company reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 105,000 for the year to April 30. This compared with Pounds 115,000 at the midway stage, which was also the same sum as for the whole of the previous year. The company said trading had been affected by a kiln explosion at its main ceramic supplier and poor sales and lower margins at the discount end of the market. Earnings per share worked through at 1.85p, compared with 2.14p.</p>

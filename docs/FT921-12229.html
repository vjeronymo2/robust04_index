			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Yeltsin leaves Moscow after cancelling engagements RUSSIAN president Boris Yelt-sin cancelled all engagements for yesterday and today and has abruptly left Moscow on what his aides described variously as 'domestic business' and the need to prepare for a visit to Britain and the US later in the week. Speculation that he might be ill - following recent reports of heart problems - was strongly denied by Mr Pavel Voshchanov, his press spokesman, who said: 'The president is absolutely healthy and in excellent shape.' Mr Yeltsin's whereabouts were not made known, though officials promised a statement today. Senior Russian government officials said last night they had been given no further information. However, western diplomats said they were reassured by news that his foreign trip would go ahead. Although it was not being suggested that his absence had any more ominous political explanation, the haste of Mr Yeltsin's departure was, if nothing else, being viewed last night as having been poorly handled in diplomatic terms. Japanese officials were told on Sunday that a meeting scheduled for yesterday with Mr Michio Watanabe, their foreign minister, had been cancelled without a new date being set. Mr Seiji Morimoto, a the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said: 'We were told that a meeting on Monday was impossible, and that perhaps the meeting would be possible at another time.' Japanese press reports yesterday had quoted unnamed officials close to Mr Yeltsin as saying he had a heart ailment. However, a Yeltsin aide told Japan's Kyodo news service he was suffering from a cold. Mr Yeltsin had also been due to attend the opening of the Middle East talks today. His planned trip to the UK on Thursday to meet Mr John Major, the prime minister, and to New York for the United Nations Security Council summit on Friday, was said yesterday by Russian and British officials to be still on course. He is due to spend Saturday - his 61st birthday  - at Camp David with US president George Bush. In recent weeks, Mr Yeltsin has travelled to the Urals, the Volga region, St Petersburg and Ryazan for speeches and to meet workers and shoppers - trips which saw him heckled for the first time since becoming president. He has been under growing pressure from former close allies such as Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, for insisting on price liberalisation.</p>

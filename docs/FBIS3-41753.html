			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. Serdykovskaya, N. Kuindzhi, ``We Are Behaving </F> Like Comprachicos'']    [Text]One of us has already written in Retsept how for many  decades we have built--and are continuing to build!--school  buildings which do not meet hygienic standards and how the  health of many generations is affected by it. Our Institute of  Child and Adolescent Hygiene (the only such science  establishment not only in Russia but in the entire CIS) is  engaged in research in many directions, studying the health of  children and adolescents in all its diversity. Some of such  studies are unique.    In examining one of the biological criteria of women's  health, we examined the case histories of the school period of  today's first-time mothers [primapara]. They were interviewed in  one of Moscow's maternity wards. Data from the questionnaires  administered to each woman were complemented with information  about the course of her pregnancy and the gynecological  diagnosis of labor activity. The resulting studies made it  possible to establish the relationship between the course of  pregnancy and birth and the characteristics of their lifestyle  as children and adolescents.    Thus, the first year of menstrual age in 78% was  accompanied  by various specific manifestations of yet-unformed menstrual  cycle whereby 43% of the respondents indicated a general  deterioration of health or academic activity during menstrual  periods. Approximately 20% of the women identified the  menarche  year as the most difficult year of learning at school. Among  these data, the following highlights are the most interesting.    Only about 20% of today's first-time mothers had  normal  course of pregnancy and physiological delivery. The lowest  percentage of unfavorable social and biological factors during  the school years was identified in this group of respondents:  excessive intellectual or athletic stress, chronic pathologies,  and complications during the child-bearing age.    The most numerous (approximately 40%) was the  contingent of  women whose pregnancy and delivery pathology was due to the  presence of extragenital processes in the organism as a result  of an explicit or, evidently, latent chronic pathology. Allowing  for the time factor, we have established that chronic pathology  formed in more than 30% of first-time mothers in their  childhood and adolescence. Among those under considerable  intellectual stress (students at specialized schools of varying  intellectual orientation as well as those combining education in  a conventional school with training in a music or art school),  the frequency of pregnancy complication by anemia increased by  threefold and by hypotonia--by tenfold; labor activity anomalies  were noted 1.5 times more frequently and surgical intervention  during labor compared to the frequency of these indicators among  the entire contingent of respondents was more frequent by  threefold.    The total number of pathological manifestations during  pregnancy and labor in each of the women who, during childhood  years, combined chronic pathology with considerable intellectual  stress was especially significant. In this contingent of  first-time mothers, the proportion of various complications in  the infant status increased by almost twofold: fetal hypoxia,  hypertrophy, and asphyxia.    At the same time, moderate athletic activity which was  evaluated in women who since childhood participated in  extracurricular activities with physical stress in public  schools, clubs, palaces of culture, etc., ensured the lowest  incidence of pathological manifestations with respect to the  course of pregnancy and labor and did not lead to complications  in the state of the infant. In this first-time mothers'  contingent, all indices characterizing the progress of pregnancy  and labor were most favorable.    We would like to report one more extremely important fact  recorded by anthropological researchers from our institute. Some  time ago, the public was well informed about the spread of  acceleration among the young generation. But no one has written  anything about the phenomenon of retardation. Yet it does take  place. Especially among our girls. In recent decades, they have  become not only shorter in height but also lighter in weight and  began menstruating later which, in women, is the principal  indicator of biological maturity.    We promised to present the conclusions at the end of this  publication--they are alarming if not tragic. The regimen of  academic life has a negative impact on the health of our  children, especially girls. And if in the case with school  building construction much can be attributed to our constant  poverty, how can one explain the unjustified and hygienically  unsound prevailing conditions? This does not require any capital  outlays but rather an investment of heart, mind, and after  all--concern. Are we also short on that too?    We picked up the pen with the intention of focusing  attention  once more on the fact that the five-day week cannot and should  not be a universal feature.</p>

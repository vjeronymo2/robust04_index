			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Letter: Islamic fund represents only one among many Sir, In your coverage of the First Islamic Venture Capital Company ('Islamic venture fund plan', September 21), you state that: 'This is believed to be the first time that a specificaly Islamic or ethical fund has been launched.' In fact, several such funds have been launched. In 1986, the Amana Mutual Fund was launched in the US by the Islamic Society of North America, and the Islamic Fund/ Falcon Fund was launched by Kleinwort Benson in the Channel Islands. The latter reports its results in your newspaper. In 1991, Mendaki (an Islamic social welfare organisation) jointly launched the Mendaki Growth Fund with the Development Bank of Singapore. Only a few weeks ago, Arab Malaysian Bank launched an Islamic Unit Trust in Kuala Lumpur. Many Islamic unit trusts and mutual funds operate out of Bahrain, Dubai, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The novelty of Islamic funds has long ago worn off. Now, the issues are the performance of these funds compared with conventional funds, and the depth of the market.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Under this approach, beneficiaries will continue to make use of existing CHAMPUS rules and administrative structures to receive their medical care and have medical claims paid. This feature will allow enrollees to make use of discounts and reduced copayments and provider arrangements already part of CHAMPUS in some locations. As previously noted, a third party administrator (TPA) will act as a central agent for the program. The functions of this TPA will be to: receive applications for enrollment of beneficiaries; verify eligibility and approve enrollment; notify the Defense Enrollment and Eligibility Reporting Systems (DEERS) of enrollment; collect premiums; and provide administrative services. CHCBP eligibles will obtain information concerning the program and the application process and other TPA functions at their local base transition office or through the nearest military treatment facility's (MTF) Health Benefits Advisory (HBA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is expected that premium rates for this program will be comparable to the premium rates of a mid-range Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) offered in the FEHBP. The Department of Defense has contracted with a private sector actuarial firm to help develop premium rates. It is anticipated these rates will include individual and family premiums, but will not be age/sex adjusted. (Similar to FEHBP premium schedules). Premium rates for fiscal year 1995 are currently being calculated, however, it is expected that these quarterly rates will be in the range of $250 self and $625 for family. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> II. Rulemaking Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Executive Order 12866 requires certain regulatory assessments for any ``significant regulatory action,'' defined as one which would result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or have other substantial impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires that each Federal agency prepare, and make available for public comment, a regulatory flexibility analysis when the agency issues a regulation which would have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is not a significant regulatory action under the provisions of Executive Order 12866, and it would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule will impose additional information collection requirements on the public under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 USC 3501&hyph;3511), because beneficiaries will be required to enroll. Request for approval and review has been submitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is a proposed rule. Public comments are invited. All comments will be considered. A discussion of the major issues received by public comments will be included with issuance of the final rule, anticipated approximately 60 days after the end of the comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 199 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Claims, Handicapped, Health insurance, Military personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Accordingly, 32 CFR Part 199 is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=2 --> PART 199_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> 1.

Medical coverage under this program will mirror the benefits offered via the basic CHAMPUS program. Premium costs for this coverage are payable by enrollees to a Third Party Administrator. The CHCBP is not part of the CHAMPUS program. However, as set forth in this section, it functions under most of the rules and procedures of CHAMPUS. Because the purpose of the CHCBP is to provide a continuation health care benefit for DoD beneficiaries losing eligibility, it will be administered so that it appears, to the maximum extent possible, to be part of CHAMPUS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General provisions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except for any provisions the Director, OCHAMPUS may have, the general provisions of section 199.1 shall apply to the Continued Health Care Benefit Program as they do to CHAMPUS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except as may be specifically provided in this section, to the extent terms defined in section 199.2 are relevant to the administration of the Continued Health Care Benefit Program, the definitions contained in that section shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to CHAMPUS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility and enrollment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Eligibility.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Enrollment in the Continued Health Care Benefit Program is open to the following individuals: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Members of armed forces, who: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Are discharged or released from active duty (or full time National Guard duty), whether voluntarily or involuntarily, under other than adverse conditions; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Immediately preceding that discharge or release, were entitled to medical and dental care under 10 U.S.C. 1074(a) (except in the case of a member discharged or released from full time National Guard duty); and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) After that discharge or release and any period of transitional health care provided under 10 U.S.C. 1145(a) would not otherwise be eligible for any benefit under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A person who: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Turkish banking reforms blocked Turkey's prime minister Mrs Tansu Ciller suffered another setback to her economic reforms yesterday when the constitutional court in Ankara cancelled the new banking law, writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul. The court action follows a decision blocking the sale of the state telecom monopoly PTT, the cornerstone of the government's relaunched privatisation programme. The bank legislation sought to bring Turkey into line with European standards on capital adequacy and other prudential ratios, ahead of the move to customs union with the European Union in 1995. Mrs Ciller will now have to present the proposals to parliament for debate, causing further delays. Mrs Ciller has used decree powers to bypass parliament and introduce banking, insurance and privatisation reforms. Last month, following appeal from the main opposition Motherland party, the court declared the government's use of decree powers as unconstitutional.</p>

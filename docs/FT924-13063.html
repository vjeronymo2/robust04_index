			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Italian dock law provokes strike ITALY'S 144 ports were yesterday paralysed at the start of a four-day strike by transport unions in protest at the government's decision to push through a new law abolishing their monopoly on dock labour. The move to convert into law the previous bill on abolishing the closed shop and opening the way to greater private-sector participation in the ports followed action against Italy by the European Commission on competition grounds. The Commission became involved in the long-running battle between dock unions and private-sector port operators after the latter protested to Brussels that the monopoly breached EC competition rules. The festering conflict has periodically erupted in violence in Genoa, Italy's biggest port, where private-sector interests are being given greater flexibility in running dock activities. Separately, a subsidiary of the Fiat group is managing a huge new container facility at Voltri, west of Genoa, due to open next year. Earlier this week, hundreds of self-employed lorry drivers drove through Genoa to demonstrate against the monopoly. Transport unions claim the decision to convert the reform bill into a decree law, bypassing parliamentary debate, is undemocratic. However, support for their stand outside militant strongholds like Genoa is thought to be limited. The Italian government has decided to leave unchanged for another year the current structure of the television industry, split among the three state-controlled channels of RAI TV and the private concessions dominated by Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest media group, Robert Graham writes from Rome. This will allow time for a more measured assessment of the role of state television at a time of financial uncertainty and political change.</p>

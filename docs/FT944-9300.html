			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Observer: Rats rule OK? Apparently Malaysia has a problem with stray dogs. About 1m of them are plaguing life, despite the official extermination of 205,000 since 1990. Dog bite cases rose from 73 in 1990 to 95 in 1992, with two human fatalities in the last year. Grim stuff. But things are not that much better back in the UK, where the problem is not so much stray dogs as an exploding rat population. The 1993 National Rodent Survey - carried out by the Chartered Institute of Environmental Officers - shows that since the last survey, 20 years ago, rat infestation has grown by 40 per cent. Nice to know that something has prospered under the Tories.</p>

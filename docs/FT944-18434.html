			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Cook renews attack on Archer Lord Archer, former deputy chairman of the Tory party, came under fire from Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, and Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, when they renewed their attack on government 'sleaze'. Both highlighted the involvement of the peer and millionaire author in share transactions which were investigated by inspectors of the Department of Trade and Industry after allegations of insider dealing. Mr Cook recalled that Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, had decided that no action would be taken against Lord Archer. He claimed that the share purchases arranged by Lord Archer had given rise to profits in five days 'from speculation' which were more than most workers in Mr Cook's Livingston constituency made in five years. Mr Cook said: 'I can think of no clearer way in which Conservatives believe that you can make money without making goods.' Mr Brown said Lord Archer had lost his 'appeal' to the hierarchy of the Conservative party, and would not be attending its conference at Bournemouth next week. 'What are we to think of a public figure who collects thousands of pounds for a friend from a television station and hands out thousands of pounds to a friend at a railway station?' he said. Mr Brown was apparently referring to the 1986 incident when Lord Archer sent Pounds 2,000 via an intermediary to a prostitute, Monica Coghlan, at a railway station, to help her escape from hounding reporters. Lord Archer won Pounds 500,000 damages in a 1987 libel case against a newspaper which suggested that the gift was intended to stop her revealing that he had slept with her.</p>

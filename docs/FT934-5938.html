			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Gonzalez in bid to avert general strike Spain's prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, is to meet union leaders and employers representatives next week in a bid to ease mounting industrial tension in Spain and avert a possible general strike. Mr Gonzalez's mediation bid came the day after hundreds of thousands demonstrated in 50 Spanish cities to protest against the government's plans to reduce dismissal costs and remove rigidities from domestic labour legislation. The unions are now considering a 24-hour national stoppage before Christmas. Officials said the prime minister would meet both sides on Thursday but the cabinet still planned to draft emergency labour market legislation next week. Talks between the government and the unions yesterday and between the government and employers the day before have failed to establish a consensus on what Mr Gonzalez has termed a 'social pact' to restore competitiveness and reduce unemployment. The urgent need for initiatives to rekindle the economy was underlined by a sharp rise in unemployment between July and September which pushed the jobless total up to 3.5m, or 22.9 per cent of the working population. Figures for the three monthly employment survey conducted by the national statistics institute showed that 150,000 more Spaniards were seeking a job at the end of the third quarter. According to separate monthly data released by the labour ministry, which does not include first time job seekers, 96,000 signed on for unemployment benefits in October, raising the total number registered as jobless by the ministry to 2.6m or 17.2 per cent of the working population. October saw the highest monthly rise since 1982. The government plans to reduce unemployment by introducing part-time labour contracts and apprenticeship schemes as part of its emergency package. The unions view such initiatives as undermining the fixed employment guidelines of the domestic labour legislation. A government proposal to speed up redundancy procedures is meanwhile termed as 'too weak' by the employers and as 'a provocation' by the unions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Askar Akayev met a large group of senior  citizens, veterans of war and labor from Bishkek and all oblasts  of the country. A long, open, and interested conversation about  the plight of the Republic, responsibility of the authorities,  and the nation's unity took place. Without these things there  is no way out of the crisis and no well-being for the people.    The president told the veterans about the situation in the  Republic, about the authorities' efforts to lift the country out  of the economic crisis and stabilize the situation. Akayev paid  special attention to such a worrying tendency as a growing rift  between the representative and Executive Branches of power,  between the president and the Zhogorku Kenesh.    Dangerous political gambling, intrigues, blackmail, and  hysterical witch-hunting by certain media will not result in  anything good. They threaten to divide society and bring about  a situation similar to those taking place in Tajikistan or  Russia.    The president asked the veterans to use all their wisdom and  lifelong experience to persuade both deputies and public opinion  that a course towards confrontation, elucidation of relations,  and discredit is fruitless and dangerous. I have quite a few  compromising materials on some of the deputies, the president  said, and I could have used them at the sessions of the Zhogorku  Kenesh. But I would not like to resort to this. I would not  like to discredit the deputies' corps. Let law and order  enforcement bodies deal with investigations of such materials.  Our parliament has turned into an investigation commission.    The veterans supported the president. They demanded he make  state power stricter. The heads of local administrations should  be controlled tougher. The veterans promised [words indistinct].    Rustenbekov, state secretary and head of the presidential  apparatus, and Sapubek Begaliev, president of the assembly of  Kyrgyzstani peoples, attended the meeting.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) When locating dry-type collection chambers outside the operating building is not feasible, a separate room shall be set aside for this purpose in the building. This room shall neither contain other operations nor be used as a communicating corridor or passageway between other operating locations when explosives are being collected. Walls separating the room from other portions of the operating building shall meet the requirements for operational shields for the quantity of explosives in the collection chamber. If more than one collection chamber is to be located in the room, the room shall be subdivided into cubicles, with only one collection chamber per cubicle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Stationary and portable wet-type collectors may be placed in explosives operating bays or cubicles, provided the quantity of explosives in the collectors does not exceed five pounds. Placed in separate cubicles, quantities may increase to 15 pounds. For wet collectors containing more than 15 pounds, location requirements set forth in &sect;184.190 (e)(1) through (e)(2) apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Explosives/munitions awaiting destruction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Material awaiting destruction when stored in the open shall be inhabited building distance from explosives being destroyed. Provided with adequate frontal and overhead protection, material awaiting destruction may be stored at intraline distance from the explosives being destroyed. All such material shall be protected against accidental ignition or explosion from ambient storage conditions or from fragments, grass fires, burning embers, or blast originating in materials being destroyed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Containers for waste explosives. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Containers for these explosives shall be the original closed packages or equivalent. Closures shall prevent spillage or leakage of contents when handled or overturned, and shall not pinch or rub explosives during closing and opening. Containers shall be marked clearly to identify contents. No containers constructed from spark-producing or easily ignited material shall be used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.191 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Destruction sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Site criteria. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Destruction of ammunition and explosives shall occur as far as possible from magazines, inhabited buildings, public highways, runways, taxiways, and operating buildings. Separation distances shall be at least 1,250 feet or the applicable fragmentation distance unless pits or similar aids limit the range of fragments. Natural barricades should be used between the site and operating buildings or magazines. The possibility that the explosives may detonate when being burned requires use of appropriate protective barriers or separation distances for the safety of personnel and property. Explosives shall not be burned or detonated on concrete, nor in areas having large stones or crevices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In all disposal and destruction activities, the number of A&amp;E units or the explosives quantity that may be destroyed safely at one time shall be predetermined consistent with safe and efficient operations. When tests or other substantiated documentation reveal that fragments and debris are adequately controlled, appropriate inhabited building distances may be used for separation of the destruction site based on the maximum amount of explosives to be destroyed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Firefighting equipment should be available to extinguish grass fires and to wet down the area between burnings and at the close of operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Ordinary combustible rubbish should not be disposed of near areas where explosives and explosives-contaminated material are destroyed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Material and equipment usage. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Detonation of ammunition or explosives should be initiated by electric blasting caps, using blasting machines or permanently installed electric circuits energized by storage batteries or conventional power lines. When items to be detonated are covered with earth, the initiating explosives should be primed with enough primacord to allow connecting the blasting cap above ground level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Special requirements for using electric blasting caps and electric blasting circuits follow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The shunt shall not be removed from the lead wires of the blasting cap until the moment of connection to the blasting circuit. If the shunt shall be removed to test the blasting cap before priming the charge, short circuit the lead wires again following the test by twisting the bare ends of the wires together. The wires shall remain short circuited in this manner until the moment of connection to the blasting circuit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) When uncoiling the leads of blasting caps, the following shall apply: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) No one shall hold the cap at its explosives end. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The explosives end of a hand-held cap should be pointed down, away from the body, to the rear. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The wires shall be held carefully so that there is no tension where it connects to the cap. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The lead wires of electric caps shall be straightened as necessary by hand. These wires shall not be thrown, waived through the air, or uncoiled by snapping as a whip. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Firing wires shall be twisted pairs. The connection between blasting caps and the circuit firing wires shall not be made unless the power ends of the circuit leads (firing wire) are shorted and grounded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Electric blasting or demolition operations and unshielded electric blasting caps shall be at safe distances from radio frequency energy transmitters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) The blasting circuit shall be tested for extraneous electricity before electric blasting caps are connected to firing wires. To do so, arrange a dummy test circuit similar to the actual blasting circuit except that a radio pilot lamp of known good quality, using no electricity, shall substitute for the blasting cap. If this pilot lamp glows in the dark, indicating possibly dangerous amounts of RF energy, blasting operations shall proceed with non-electric blasting caps and safety fuses. Other instruments, such as the DuPont ``Detect-A-Meter'' or ``Voltohmeter,'' may be substituted for the radio pilot lamp used in testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb (XINHUA) -- The State Planning  Commission and the State General Administration of Taxation  recently issued a "Circular Concerning Being Sure To Maintain  the Stability of Commodity Prices After Tax Reform."    The circular says: Beginning 1 January this year, China is  conducting a major reform in its tax system, which is an  important measure for the establishment of a socialist market  economic structure. After the introduction of the new tax  system, some taxpayers do not completely understand the system,  believing that the practice of the value-added tax means to add  17 percent or 13 percent for tax to the original prices. There  are some taxpayers who avail themselves of the opportunities  afforded by tax reform to gain windfall profits by jacking up  prices. As a result, prices are pushed up and the price system  becomes chaotic, causing dissatisfaction among the people. To  guarantee correct implementation of the new tax system, avoid  price increases, maintain the stability of the market, and  ensure a stable livelihood of the people, the circular is hereby  issued as follows:    1. The major goal of current tax reform, for the most part,  is to convert product taxes and turnover taxes into value-added  taxes. Generally speaking, the newly designed value-added tax  rates will not increase the tax burden for enterprises. The tax  rates under the former tax system were uneven; now they are  simplified and unified as two categories. Consequently, the tax  burden for many enterprises is fair or somewhat lower. However,  tax burden for a small number of products has increased  somewhat. Enterprises should assimilate an increased tax burden  through changing their management mechanism, tapping inner  potential, and increasing economic performance. Meanwhile the  state should correspondingly adopt such measures as lowering  income tax rates for enterprises and exempting state-owned  enterprises from turning over their profits to the state for  "two kinds of funds" [funds collected for construction of key  energy and transport projects and funds for state budget  regulation] so as to alleviate enterprises' burdens. Therefore,  enterprises which do not experience increased tax burdens after  the tax reform should not increase their prices; enterprises  which enjoy a low tax burden by a fair margin should  appropriately reduce their prices; and enterprises which  experience increased tax burdens should, in principle, not  increase their prices. Individual enterprises which are  overwhelmed by their tax burden and need to increase their  prices should have such changes approved by departments in  charge of commodity prices.    2. At present, taxes are included in all current prices;  that  is, they are tax-included prices.    The formula enabling enterprises to change original  tax-included prices to non-tax prices is as follows:    non-tax price = original tax-included price / (1 +  value-added tax rate)    No taxpayers are allowed to add value-added tax or any other  tax burden onto current prices.    3. Current factory prices, wholesale prices, and retail  prices should not be increased because of the tax reform.  Taxpayers should pay value-added taxes and other taxes or fees  included in current prices. The current price (including tax)  system should be conscientiously introduced to any commodities  whose prices are set by the state (including maximum prices).  In considering whether or not enterprises experience increased  tax burdens, it is necessary to take many factors into  consideration, such as reduction of taxes on purchased goods,  reduction or exemption of "two kinds of fund" and income taxes,  as well as cost-affected interests of loans for fixed assets.  Without approval, no enterprises are allowed to readjust their  prices. For commodities whose prices are regulated by market  demand, enterprises should also try to maintain price stability  in accordance with the abovementioned requirements.    4. For linking wholesale and retail prices of all consumer  goods and capital goods, the rate of difference between prices  for purchased goods and prices for sold goods (calculated on the  basis of current tax-included prices) remain unchanged. Various  tax burdens will be levied with or under such rates. No  enterprises or units are allowed to increase such rates without  authorization.    5. Departments in charge of commodity prices at all levels  should strengthen their supervision over and check on prices.  They should seriously deal with and immediately correct  activities including unauthorized price increases for  commodities whose prices are set by the state, price increase  because of miscalculations due to a misunderstanding of the tax  system, and availing oneself of the opportunities afforded by  tax reform to gain windfall profits by jacking up prices.    6. Departments in charge of commodity prices and taxation in  all localities should pay close attention to the market trend  after the introduction of tax reform. They should also promptly  report to the Administration of Commodity Prices under the State  Planning Commission and the State General Administration of  Taxation on newly emerging situations and problems as well as  suggestions for their solutions. The State Planning Commission  will hold a special meeting to study some issues concerning  pricing policies after the tax reform.</p>

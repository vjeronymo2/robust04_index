			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / French rivals wave their flags: Fireworks - and politics - mark commemoration of Paris liberation The successors of General Charles de Gaulle yesterday used the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Paris to promote their rival presidential bids, with Mr Jacques Chirac wrapping himself firmly in the mantle of the late general and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur presenting himself as the unity candidate representing all conservatives. Their language was inevitably coded, given the nature of the occasion and the fact that neither is yet a formal candidate. The French press, however, was quick to interpret Mr Balladur's citing of the call of General Leclerc, whose French division freed Paris, for an end to 'fractious divisions' as reflecting the prime minister's own strategy to unite the centre-right behind him. It saw in Mr Chirac's fulsome repetitions of De Gaulle's commentaries on the events of 50 years ago an attempt to ensure that the RPR neo-Gaullist party lines up behind him. This commemorative summer of wreath-laying and speech-making about the final year of the second world war, taking French dignitaries and Resistance veterans to the beaches of Normandy in June and Provence earlier this month, has been largely free of internal politicking. But at these earlier ceremonies Mr Chirac and Mr Balladur were both said to have felt that President Mitterrand somewhat underplayed the role of the French Resistance, and thus saw in this week's events in Paris a chance to redress the balance. Both, however, have vied to be the one to do the redressing. As mayor of Paris, Mr Chirac has been busy at centre stage, though taking time off to give interviews this week complaining that successive Gaullist governments - and by implication Mr Balladur's - have lost sight of the 'social goals' of the revered general. Not to be left entirely in the wings, Mr Balladur is today giving his own reception for Resistance heroes. The celebrations climaxed yesterday with a procession taking the route into the city of Gen Leclerc's armoured divsion, in a repeat of the feat of the lone fireman who climbed the Eiffel Tower to hoist the tricolour, and in a mass fete on the Place de la Concorde preceded by chain explosions of fireworks along the bridges of the Seine. Today sees Gen de Gaulle's march down the Champs Elysees commemorated. The progression of the liberators through Paris was last night marked by a firework spectacular successively lighting up the city's bridges, symbolically detonated by water-skiers passing under them. The peaceful explosion of the 10 tonnes of fireworks was an indirect reminder of the explosives the Germans placed on the main bridges and buildings 50 years ago and which Hitler ordered to be detonated. But for the mediation of an exceptional Swedish consul, Raoul Nordling, and the Nelsonian blind eye that the German commander, Gen Dietrich von Choltitz, turned on Hitler's orders, Paris might have met the fate of Warsaw whose uprising and buildings were destroyed three weeks earlier, while nearby Russian troops stood by. Gen Leclerc's US superiors wanted to push on without being distracted by freeing and feeding Paris, and thus only gave him the go-ahead to march on Paris three days after the uprising had started. Had this delay been fatal to Paris, it would have turned the chip-on-the-shoulder that some French still bear about having their country liberated by the 'Anglo-Saxons' into a deeper emnity like that between many Poles and Russians. As it turned out, there was nothing to mar the welcome for Allied troops following Gen Leclerc - and Ernest Hemingway - into Paris. Last night the Ritz Hotel unveiled its bar revamped in honour of the American writer who 'liberated', and drained, it on August 25, 1944 and who later said his dream afterlife was always the Paris Ritz.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Flying Flowers leaps 89% The acquisition of DPA Direct in March helped fuel growth at Jersey-based Flying Flowers, which saw pre-tax profits jump 89 per cent from Pounds 312,000 to Pounds 589,000 in the six months to July 1. DPA, which specialises in reader offers in the UK national press, contributed Pounds 2.52m to group sales of Pounds 6.25m (Pounds 2.99m) while its pre-tax profits of over Pounds 190,000 were more than it achieved in the previous full year. Mr Walter Goldsmith, chairman, said the acquisition was proving encouraging. 'DPA's strong relationship with certain national newspapers has produced excellent results and we are exploring opportunities in database development and other activities which will benefit all areas of the group,' he said. He cautioned that the company, which joined the market a year ago, did not expect the first-half growth rate to continue 'at quite the same level'. However, with all divisions doing well, he looked forward to another successful year. A continuing healthy level of off-peak orders for postal packs more than offset lower-than-expected order levels for Mothers' Day in the UK, which this year was earlier than usual requiring orders to be received in February rather than March. In northern Europe, the introduction of a delivery facility had produced a good response and an experimental service for Mothers' Day in France had produced 'encouraging results'. Half-year earnings per share rose from 1.54p to 2.36p; an interim dividend to UK holders of 0.76p gross, net of Jersey tax, is declared.</p>

"Leaders at all levels must take into consideration the  interests of the nation as a whole and firmly control the annual  price index in the prescribed range," he said.    Zhu made the remarks when he joined deputies to the National  People's Congress (NPC) from Hunan Province in a group  discussion on premier Li Peng's government work report. Zhu  himself is an NPC deputy from the province.    "Some people attribute the current price rise to reform  measures introduced this year," Zhu said. "This is a gross  misunderstanding."    The inflation, which had started two months earlier than  their introduction, has had little to do with this year's reform  measures, he said.    In the past two months, the national economy has shown  unexpectedly good performance, the vice-premier said. He based  his assessment on the following indicators: First, government  revenues jumped more than 30 percent over the January-February  period last year; second, money supply has been controlled  effectively; third, the exchange rate between reminbi and  foreign currencies has remained stable and the country's foreign  exchange reserve has increased; and fourth, supplies of goods  are sufficient.    "Tightened controls over the scale of capital construction  and over consumption spending are the fundamental measure to  keep inflation at bay," he said.    The central government, Zhu said, will adopt other major  measures to control inflation. They include: To develop  agriculture and improve the economic performance of "vegetable  basket projects" for stabilizing the prices of grain and  foodstuffs; to exercise strengthened management over prices; and  to adopt soon a number of major price-control measures.</p>

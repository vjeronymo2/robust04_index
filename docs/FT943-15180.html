			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Foreign cash for bricks and mortar: UK housing associations are today trying to woo German bankers The UK's housing associations, which build low-cost homes largely for rent, may have their roots in medieval alms-houses and the Victorian philanthropists who provided homes for the working poor during the industrial revolution. But in recent years, they have been quietly transforming themselves into leading players in the UK housing market. The largest now own tens of thousands of homes with assets worth hundreds of millions of pounds. To fund their expanding programmes, they are seeking ever-increasing amounts of finance and have become among the most active issuers of sterling bonds. Today, the search for new sources of finance moves overseas. The Housing Corporation, the organisation that distributes government grants to associations, is holding a seminar in Frankfurt to persuade German banks to invest in UK social housing. If the corporation is successful, housing associations could be the first UK organisations to raise funds through the issue of Pfandbriefe, the uniquely German bonds used by banks to finance mortgages and municipal loans. The seminar is targeted at Germany's 26 mortgage banks, which account for 60 per cent of Pfandbriefe issued in Germany. These long-term, fixed-interest bonds are secured on the property and also guaranteed by the issuing bank. Loans are normally restricted to 60 per cent of the value of the property. Germany's tough regulatory regime for the issuing of Pfandbriefe has ensured there have been no defaults since 1900. The yields on what has proved to be a secure form of investment are only a small margin over German Treasury bonds and thus offer a low-cost source of finance. The banks have been allowed under German law to issue Pfandbriefe in other European currencies than the DM since 1991. Earlier this year, the German Mortgage Banks Association launched a campaign to find opportunities to issue sterling Pfandbriefe in the UK. Mr Anthony Mayer, chief executive of the Housing Corporation, will suggest today that housing associations - of which there is no equivalent in Germany  - offer just such an opportunity. Housing associations could certainly prove attractive to the German banks, says Mr Frank Kennedy of S G Warburg Securities, the securities house. 'Associations are closely regulated by the Housing Corporation and no lender has lost money lending on a secured basis to a registered housing association.' The Housing Corporation believes that German mortgage banks could be a useful source of funding for housing associations, which often find it hard to raise the sort of long-term finance appropriate for residential property. 'There is a natural synergy between the terms associations are seeking and those offered by Pfandbriefe,' says Mr Mayer. Associations are already raising large amounts of private finance to supplement government grants for building affordable homes for rent. Since the 1988 Housing Act permitted private funding, more than Pounds 5.5bn has been raised from banks, building societies and institutions. The Corporation expects, however, that associations will need to raise even larger amounts in the future, with the government reducing the amount of grant from Pounds 2.4bn in 1992-93 to Pounds 1.5bn in 1994-95. It estimates that an additional Pounds 7bn of private finance will be needed over the next four years to fulfil their plans for building new homes and funding the transfer of local authority homes to associations. The increasing importance of private finance in social housing led to the appointment of Sir Brian Pearse, former chief executive of Midland Bank, as chairman of the Corporation earlier this year. His predecessor was Sir Christopher Benson, a property developer. Bringing in a banker reflected the need to open up the housing association movement to the financial markets. Sir Brian is keen to widen the housing association's investor base, which is currently dominated by the largest UK financial institutions. 'I hope to persuade investors to see housing associations as big business occupying a significant sector of the economy,' he says. 'They employ 50,000 people and indirectly tens of thousands more in construction. I am confident that they offer attractive lending opportunities that are as safe as any other.' To some extent a broadening of their investor base is already happening. Since 1988, associations have raised finance from a lengthening list of lenders, even if few yet account for substantial sums. The Corporation has joined with the Chartered Institute of Banking, which offers training to bankers, to run short courses on lending to housing associations to increase familiarity with the sector. Associations have also entered the sterling debenture market in a big way. With more than Pounds 1bn of housing association paper issued, they now account for about 10 per cent of the market. Most of this has been raised through group, or 'club' issues that bring several associations together to share costs. These also give some security to the investors, who often find it hard to assess associations' credit-worthiness. But it is becoming clear that housing associations need to look elsewhere. The markets began to choke on association paper towards the end of last year. NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of NatWest bank, was left with much of a Pounds 125m issue in November. Soon after, Hambros delayed a planned issue for medium-sized housing associations and Peabody Trust, the only housing association to have issued stock in its own name, postponed a Pounds 50m issue. 'The markets became clogged,' says Mr Charles Arbuthnot of Hambros. 'Investors became worried that there'd be an endless flow of paper.' Although Peabody and Hambros got their issues away earlier this year, it is clear that the appetite for further housing association paper in the debenture market is limited. One alternative way of raising capital from investors would be to give them an equity stake in social housing. Chaco Investments, a subsidiary of TR Property Investment Trust, has already raised more than Pounds 20m for housing associations by offering a stake in the freehold of their properties with an indexed return linked to rental income. 'Institutions are very interested in the low risk and stable returns available from housing associations,' says Mr Leon Clifton, managing director of Chaco. 'The income stream and capital growth potential is offering returns as good as anything else the institutions can go into at the moment.' One development that might help housing associations raise money is moves towards giving them credit ratings. NatWest Markets has just launched a triple-A rated issue, an insured Guaranteed Enhanced Secured Bond, to buy out the stock left after its offering flopped in November. 'The success of the issue is very good news for housing associations,' says Hambros' Mr Arbuthnot. 'It has brought down the margin over gilts by almost a half, making it much cheaper for associations to raise capital. That is more than enough to cover the cost of credit rating.' If credit-rating catches on, financially strong associations would be able to draw on a much wider investor base, in the UK and abroad. Today, however, the attention of housing associations will be on Pfandbriefe as a new way of attracting investors into social housing. The success of the Frankfurt meeting may take some time to become clear, given that it would represent a big step into unknown territory for the German banks. But with the demand for housing association homes showing no sign of abating, tapping into the global capital markets may be the only way that they can hope to raise the funds they need.</p>

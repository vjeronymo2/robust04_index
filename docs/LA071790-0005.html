			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION'S ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WOES  </P> <P> Williams' analysis of the staying power of communism in Russia ("Soviets Try to  Repair Communism, Won't Give It Bum's Rush," July 6) in which Marxism "was the  deliberate choice of the majority of the Russian people" is rather wide of the  mark. While it is true that the ruling Communist Party is much more entrenched  within the structure of Russian society than in other East Bloc countries, it  is not popular support that must be overcome in unseating the Communists from  power.  </P> <P> This misconception, believed in the West for decades, is at the heart of  Kremlin leader's misreading of the events taking place within their empire and  explains their inability to cope with the changes that will eventually sweep  away the Communist Party, or at least, render it insignificant.  </P> <P> Contrary to party doctrine, communism was never "accepted" in Russia. By 1917,  the czar and the nobility had been ousted, the Kerensky government was  foundering and thousands of foot soldiers had come home, refusing to continue  fighting against Germany. It was in this state of anarchy that the Bolsheviks,  led by Lenin, seized power, and it was with brutal suppression of dissent that  they consolidated and maintained it. To suppose that Lenin and his men were  swept into power on a ground swell of popular support for Marxist ideology is a  gross misinterpretation of historical fact. There was never any mandate for  Communist rule; the Bolsheviks were simply the most cohesive and ruthless  political faction in Russia at the time. The same can be said of all Marxist  revolutions.  </P> <P> PHILIP D. ADAMS  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

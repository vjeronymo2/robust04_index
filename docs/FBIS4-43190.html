			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "A Made Decision"] </F>   [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis' decision to resign if  the British and Americans pressure the UN Security Council and  the UN secretary general to continue the process of the  so-called confidence-building measures should not be  misinterpreted by the Foreign Office and the State Department.    The Cyprus Government cannot threaten. However, it has the  right to protest and warn against the consequences of the  criminal policy being followed by the governments of the two  countries.    The confidence-building measures are dead, even if Hurd,  Christopher, and Cetin do not want to accept this reality. Our  side's appraisal of the confidence-building measures is also  supported by the secretary general, his representatives, and  even by members of the Security Council. It is only the United  States and Britain who do not want to be convinced and are  actually plotting to undermine the Government of the Republic of  Cyprus, which they allegedly recognize, to satisfy the desires  of Ankara.    The press reports that the contents of Kliridhis' letters  was  leaked out by the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia prove the coarse  policy that Washington wants to impose. However, it must have  realized that the decision to terminate the confidence-building  measures has already been made. No substantial results will be  achieved by the scandalous and provocative U.S. and British  behavior to drag us once again into procedures that have served  the Turkish side's intransigent tactics and filibustering.</p>

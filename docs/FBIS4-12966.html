			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "F-16's -- Money or Aircraft; No Third Option, </F> Nor Nuclear Deal Acceptable"]    [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto stated in a news  conference that Pakistan will not open its nuclear installations  unilaterally to international inspection nor will it roll back  its nuclear program. As far as the F-16 aircraft are concerned,  they cannot be linked with the nuclear program. The United  States should either hand over the aircraft to Pakistan or  return the payment made for their delivery. The prime minister  has forgotten about compensation. The payment should be  collected along with compensation. One day prior to the arrival  of the U.S. delegation to Pakistan, the prime minister precisely  explained the country's stand on the nuclear program and also  took efforts to dispel the doubts and apprehensions that the  government would succumb to U.S. pressure or that the nuclear  program would be rolled back or frozen and would be subjected to  international inspection. Although the prime minister said this  after getting a green signal from General Waheed, may God make  her stick to her words and not succumb to any counsel on the  question of the country's security and stability. In principle,  the F-16 aircraft transaction has nothing to do with the nuclear  program. Pakistan struck a deal with a U.S. firm for the  purchase of more than 70 F-16 aircraft purely on a commercial  basis and in the meantime had paid in installments an amount of  $700 million, which is equivalent to the cost of 38 aircraft.  The United States should fulfill its obligations in this direct  commercial transaction and should not set a despicable example  for dishonesty, breach of promise, and unethical business  practices in international commercial dealings although earlier,  it had committed such a practice in the Arshad Parvez case. If  the pro-Indian and pro-Israeli lobby does not want to see  Pakistan become strong, the United States should face this lobby  with confidence and not kneel before it and involve it in the  conspiracy to weaken the security of Pakistan. It is  regrettable that influenced by the propaganda of this lobby, the  United States Government has been persistently refusing to hand  over the F-16 aircraft; and now, the latest case is that if  Pakistan wants to get F-16's, it should roll back its nuclear  program and should subject it to international inspection in  order to get ratification for the level of its capping.    U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has arrived in  Islamabad by passing through New Delhi and as per international  media analysis, this visit is a ploy to exert pressure on  Pakistan although Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had stated that  Pakistan would not come under any pressure and would not accept  any conditions unilaterally. Prior to this, Army Chief Abdul  Waheed also voiced the same feeling. We, however, are of the  opinion that the mere precondition "unilaterally" is not enough  now and even at the regional level, Pakistan should not  compromise. Even if India accepts the conditions of the NPT  [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] (the chances for which are  remote), its military superiority over Pakistan will be intact.  Besides making a nuclear bomb, India has amassed a heap of  missiles and acquired a huge quantity of weapons; in  conventional weapons it also is better off than Pakistan.  Therefore, as long as India's wings of aggression are not  clipped and a cut is not imposed on its armed forces, defense  allocation, and stockpile of arms under a collective and  comprehensive package, there will always be the threat of a war  being waged by India. Pakistan now should insist on the  introduction of some sort of a collective and comprehensive  package first, which does not put the balance of power in favor  of India. Otherwise, Pakistan cannot sacrifice its defense  capabilities. It is a blessing that the U.S. officials have  revealed that Pakistan is capable of producing an atom bomb  within minutes or seconds. There cannot be any other good news  and a matter of satisfaction to the Pakistani people than this.  So far, responsible institutions in Pakistan have declined to  say anything to the people about this. Now, Pakistan can in no  way forego this invaluable possession. It is imperative that  the U.S. delegation should be given this impression and sent  away from Pakistan.</p>

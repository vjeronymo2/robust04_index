			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / OFT to probe sales of electrical warranties Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, has asked the Office of Fair Trading to investigate the sale of extended warranties on electrical goods, following allegations that consumers were being 'ripped off' by retailers. In a written question last week, Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, claimed electrical stores were selling extended warranties for up to three times more than manufacturers charged for their own schemes. Retailers were failing to tell customers that cheaper extended warranties - which provide additional protection after the expiry of standard product guarantees - were often available directly from manufacturers. The OFT confirmed yesterday that the matter had been referred to it by Mr Hamilton, and it was conducting inquiries with a view to launching an investigation. Such an investigation would have important implications for electrical retailers, and particularly Dixons, the UK's largest, where extended warranty business is thought to account for up to 10 per cent of sales and gross profits. Mr Griffiths said electrical stores were using the sale of warranties to inflate profits during the recession. 'What is at issue is the failure to spell out to purchasers any alternative to the stores' own warranty schemes,' he said. 'Stores must not be allowed to profiteer at the expense of consumers.' Among examples cited by Mr Griffiths were a branch of Currys, part of the Dixons group, selling a five-year warranty for a Sony hi-fi system for Pounds 155, when Sony could provide its own warranty for Pounds 60, and a branch of Comet, part of the Kingfisher group, charging Pounds 119 for a five-year warranty for a Sony system, compared with the manufacturer's Pounds 60. Mr John Clare, Dixons' chief executive, said retailers' warranties were more expensive 'because they are different'. Manufacturers' warranties often covered only the failure of parts - sometimes with important exclusions - while those offered by retailers included all parts and labour, as well as accidental damage. He said: 'Retailers can give better service than manufacturers. We would often exchange a product with a new one if it was not repairable, or even replace it with another manufacturer's product.' Mr Clare added that manufacturers' schemes were sometimes priced unrealistically. Kingfisher criticised the proportion of Dixons' profits from extended warranties during its failed takeover bid in 1990. Dixons no longer publishes separate results for its financial services division, which includes extended warranties, but the business is thought to make a gross profit of about Pounds 30m a year. One retailing analyst said: 'Extended warranties are part of the cut and thrust of negotiating over pricing.'</p>

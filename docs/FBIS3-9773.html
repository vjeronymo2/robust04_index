			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrey Sharkov] </F>   [Text] Sofia, March 28 (BTA) -- "We are the country to  open the doors of all Western institutions for Bulgaria," German  Federal Minister of Defense Volker Ruehe today told journalists  on the first day of his three-day formal visit to this country.  Mr. Ruehe is here at the invitation of his Bulgarian  counterpart Valentin Aleksandrov. This is the first visit by a  German defense minister to this country for the past 70 years.    Valentin Aleksandrov and Volker Ruehe today signed an  agreement on cooperation between the German and Bulgarian  defense ministries. "This is the third document on bilateral  cooperation in the military sphere but I am deeply convinced  that its contribution to cooperation will be greater than that  of the conventions with the central powers and the Tripartite  Pact," the Bulgarian Defense Minister said after the signing of  the agreement. During World War One and Two, and until the  monarchy's downfall in 1944, Bulgaria was allied to Germany.    Germany can do much more for Bulgaria than just give it the  military equipment of the former East Germany, Defense Minister  Ruehe said, answering a question. According to him, material  and technical aid would not be in the spirit and letter of the  agreement signed today. Germany, however, might deliver spare  parts to this country. The outdated military equipment of the  Bundeswehr, including that of the ex-East German Army, was  either donated or sold to other countries under agreements  effective in the Warsaw-Pact times, Mr. Ruehe said.    Investing in material things is now outdated. Investing in  people -- in the exchange of trainees and expertise -- this is  the investment of the future, the investment of friendship," the  German Defense Minister said, commenting on the agreement the  two ministries signed today. The document envisages the  extending of technical and economic assistance to Bulgaria.    The newly signed agreement is more or less identical with  those Bulgaria has signed with the other NATO member-states,  Valentin Aleksandrov told journalists. It provides for exchange  of information pertaining to the political and legal aspects of  defence, the Armed Forces management and cooperation in some  specific military sub-sectors, including officers training. The  goals set forth in this agreement will be accomplished through  visits by delegations and working groups to exchange information  and through exchange of trainees.    The sides also exchanged views on the Yugocrisis during  talks  between the top officials of the two defense ministries. The  meeting, however, did not discuss the UN decision to sent  Turkish "blue helmets" on a peacekeeping mission in former  Yugoslavia. "The agreement between Muslims and Croats is already  yielding results. I hope the sides will find a just solution to  this issue," Mr. Ruehe also told journalists.    In their recent history, the two countries started  exchanging  delegation in 1991 when a group of Bulgarian officers visited  the NATO Academy in Oberammergau, Germany. According to a  statement made by President Zhelev, this marked the beginning of  a closer Bulgaria-NATO cooperation. A Bulgarian delegation led  by Valentin Aleksandrov last autumn paid a visit to Germany, the  first one after half a century's break. During that visit, the  two countries reached specific agreements for a closer  cooperation, including the training of Bulgarian officers at the  Bundeswehr academy in Hamburg and at the military school in  Muenster. And the exchange of military delegation tends to get  busier.</p>

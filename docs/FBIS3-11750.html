He said that "we  are not for the division of the world into huge commercial  blocs," and that, consequently, this trend should not be  fomented.    According to Figueroa, experience shows that markets are  subject to "up and down cycles," and that no clear, marked trend  has emerged in either direction so far.    In this regard, he recalled that the universalist strategy  defined for the development of the export sector, in addition to  being more efficient from an economic point of view, has the  advantage of reducing the country's economic vulnerability. In  this regard, he noted that the fight against protectionism is  one of the axes of Chilean foreign policy.    Figueroa said the emphasis on unilateral economic  liberalization "made us more competitive and played a decisive  role in our joining the international community." He said,  however, this policy does not exclude supplementary efforts to  open new markets.  <H5>  Diplomacy for Development </H5>   In another speech he delivered on 14 March, Figueroa  outlined  his portfolio's role in this phase. He emphasized that Chilean  foreign policy should attach priority "to diplomacy for  development." The foreign minister said this policy provides for  external action, which is not undertaken because of "mere  goodwill" but "as a function of Chilean interest."    He added that foreign policy must accompany the country's  development process, emphasizing that the internationalization  of the economy calls for the Foreign Ministry's support in  coordination with the other ministries. "It would be absurd and  even self-defeating if we demand a monopoly of the country's  external action."  <H5>  Agreements </H5>   In another speech during the entrepreneurs' meeting,  Figueroa  reiterated that Chile's unilateral strategy should be  supplemented with "progress in multilateral and bilateral  negotiations." He said that even though the Uruguay GATT talks  has been a significant step forward, "we are not fully satisfied  with its results."    In this regard, he emphasized that the policy of "multiple  insertion" that the Foreign Ministry is proposing will have a  priority area in Latin America and will seek to develop close  ties with Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and "take  advantage of the potential of existing agreements."    Figueroa added that for the same reason, they  "enthusiastically welcome" the U.S. Administration's interest in  negotiating a free trade agreement.    He also emphasized that Chile became an APEC (Economic  Cooperation in Pacific Asia) member this year, highlighting that  it is one of the most innovative aspects of Chilean foreign  policy. He also mentioned Chile's interest in strengthening its  relations with the European Union.    Finally, he underlined the role that Chile can play as a  supplier of services and as the entryway to Latin American  markets, based on "the network of our relations with our  neighbors and our free trade agreements," also highlighting the  role as a port of access to the Pacific Ocean that Chile can  play with respect to other Latin American economies.</p>

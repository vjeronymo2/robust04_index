			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Danish SDP oppositionleader faces challenge DENMARK'S opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) was thrown into disarray yesterday when its deputy chairman, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, mounted a challenge to the leadership of party chairman Svend Auken. Mr Auken, 48, has led the party since 1987, but under his leadership the party, which holds 69 of the 179 seats in the Folketing, has been plagued by personal conflicts. More importantly, the small centre parties in the eight-party parliament do not have confidence in Mr Auken, and, without the support of the centre parties, the SDP cannot hope to end a 10-year spell in opposition. Unless Mr Auken withdraws, it is expected the leadership fight will be settled at an extraordinary party congress in April. Mr Nyrup Rasmussen, 48, formely the chief economist at the Confederation of Danish Trade Unions, is a moderate, a strong pro-European, and is respected in business circles. His challenge has emerged because the SDP believes the Conservative-Liberal minority government may run into such serious trouble next autumn that an election will be called. With Mr Nyrup Rasmussen at the helm, the party's chances of returning to office are considered to be greater. However, Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, said yesterday he expects his government to remain in office until when the next general election would normally be held, in two-and-a-half-years' time. 'With the problems the Social Democrats have, I can't see them forcing an election,' he said.</p>

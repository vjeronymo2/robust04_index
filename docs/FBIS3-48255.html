			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jotaro Yabe of the Japan Fair Trade Commission: </F> "Freedom of Distributors Restricted; Problems Include Rebates  for Reaching Goals"]    [Text] 1. It makes economic sense for automakers to  organize their distributors into keiretsu. For example, it  contributes to maintaining after-sales service and to raising  sales efficiency. On the other hand, it prevents the entry of  foreign cars into the market, and is thus seen as a problem.    2. There are no contractual restrictions on the  handling of competitors' products by dealers. Business practices  such as rebates, however, restrict the freedom of dealers to  handle other manufacturers' cars, including foreign cars.    3. In order to make the auto market more open, it is  necessary to change both the system of rebates linked to sales  goals and the practice of assigning clearly defined sales  territories to dealers.  <H5>  No Contractual Restrictions on Handling Competitors' Products </H5>   Both domestically and abroad, interest in the pros and cons  of keiretsu is increasing. As part of its survey on keiretsu,  the Fair Trade Commission investigated the actual state of the  transactions among companies in four separate industries: plate  glass, paper, automobiles, and automobile parts. The results of  the survey have already been made public. With regard to  automobiles, there are two types of keiretsu transactions:  transactions between auto makers and parts makers (manufacturing  keiretsu), and transactions between auto makers and dealers  (sales keiretsu). Both types are problematic. The one that will  be discussed here, however, is sales keiretsu. To begin with,  the actual state of these keiretsu will be broadly analyzed.    In recent years, foreign cars have comprised a growing  proportion of the passenger cars sold in Japan. Nevertheless,  this proportion is still around 5 percent. It is believed that,  in Japan, the distribution networks are controlled by auto  makers and exclusionary business practices are conducted, making  it difficult for foreign cars to enter the market.    Passengers cars are sold from the manufacturer, through the  dealer (retailer), to the customer. Manufacturers have built  sales channels for selling their products. The top manufacturers  deal with dealers through multiple sales channels, each for a  different model of automobile. In the case of Toyota, for  example, Toyopet stores mainly sell Mark II and Corona, while  Toyota stores mainly sell Crown and Carina.    In Japan, there are 3,759 companies classified as dealers  (the number of stores is approximately 17,400). Auto makers have  invested in about 16 percent of them. The vast majority of  dealers are thus independent companies. Dealers are essentially  free to choose which manufacturer's cars to sell and which  region to sell them in. In regard to the Antimonopoly Law,  questions about keiretsu arise in connection with whether the  means of keiretsu organization--the exclusionary conditions and  the restrictive conditions--interfere with fair and open  competition in the sale of automobiles.    If a manufacturer imposes on the dealer a restriction saying  that the dealer may not sell the products of competitors, then  the transactions that follow, due to this exclusionary  condition, will be problematic under the Antimonopoly Law. In  trade contracts between manufacturers and dealers there used to  be a clause stipulating that the dealer could not sell the  products of competitors. In 1979, however, this clause was  removed under instructions from the Fair Trade Commission; but  there was subsequently another provision stating that the dealer  had to consult with the manufacturer before changing an  important matter of business, and it was not clear whether the  handling of other companies' cars was something requiring  advance consultation.    Following the issuance, in 1991, of the "Antimonopoly Law  Guidelines for Distribution and Trade Practices," all auto  makers voluntarily reviewed the problematic terms in their  contracts, clearly stated in their contracts that the handling  of other companies' cars by dealers was not something that  required advance consultation, and notified dealers that they  were free to handle the products of competitors. Accordingly,  provisions that might restrict dealers from handling  competitors' products no longer appear in current contracts.  <H5>  Restrictions on Selling Outside One's Territory Are Illegal </H5>   In this latest survey, not a single case was found of a  dealer handling the cars of more than one domestic manufacturer.  On the other hand, dealers handling imported cars have recently  increased. Most entered the field in response to efforts by  domestic manufacturers to recruit dealers to sell imported cars.  The reason, they say, that they have not sought on their own to  handle the cars of other manufacturers, is that they would  become unable to provide detailed service if the car models that  they handled became numerous. But there are probably other  reasons as well.    Manufacturers, in their contracts with dealers, stipulate  goals for the number of cars to be sold. In principle, this  number is decided by consultation between the manufacturer and  the dealer. There have been cases, however, where the decision  tended to be linked to coercive practices, such as the  manufacturer unilaterally designating the sales goal or  assigning the dealer a certain number of cars; or where the  sales goal was decided based on the dealer's full sales capacity.    At the same time, manufacturers pay dealers a variety of  rebates. There is a rebate for each car sold, of 30,000 yen.  However, the large rebates are for reaching the sales goal and  for expanding market share. The amount of the former is based on  the number of cars established in advance as the sales goal. The  latter is based on the market share attained in the dealer's  main sales territory.    In general, a manufacturer setting a sales goal and paying a  rebate if the dealer reaches it is not itself a problem under  the Antimonopoly Law. However, the manufacturer setting the  sales goal near the dealer's sales capacity and using such  methods as rebates to ensure that the goal is reached, in effect  restricts the dealer from handling the cars of other  manufacturers. So, from the standpoint of free and open  competition, it cannot be said that nothing is wrong [with these  practices].    Manufacturers designate a certain area as the dealer's main  sales territory. Within it, the dealer is obliged to conduct  vigorous sales activities. Where the dealer can locate his  dealership[s] is thus limited to his territory. As their sales  territories, Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. basically  use the nation's prefectures, for each of which they have one  dealer. If this practice does not restrict sales to customers  outside the territory or sales to customers coming in from  outside the territory, then it is not a violation of the  Antimonopoly Law.    The reasons for establishing sales territories include: it  enables quick, accurate after-sales service; it prevents  overlapping investments by dealers; and it enables sales  activities to be conducted effectively within the territories.  Many dealers feel that they are not contractually restricted  from conducting sales outside their territories. However, not a  few feel, "I can't conduct sales activities outside my  territory," or "I can't sell to customers from outside my  territory, even if they come to me."    In a questionnaire survey on how dealers handle customers  who  come to them from outside their territories to make a purchase,  less than 20 percent said that they voluntarily refuse to make  the sale and instead, for example, refer the customer to the  dealer in his territory. Also, some manufacturers use the number  of cars sold to customers from the dealer's territory, rather  than the total number of cars sold, as the basis for rebates. In  such cases, the dealer does not get a rebate on cars sold to  customers from outside his territory, and so ends up losing  incentive to sell to such customers.  <H3>  The Market for Maintenance and Repair Parts Is Also  Exclusionary </H3>   It has been pointed out that the market for maintenance and  repair parts, like that for passenger cars, is exclusionary.  There are two kinds of maintenance and repair parts: genuine,  brand-name parts supplied by auto makers; and non-genuine parts  supplied directly to the market by parts manufacturers. Before  auto makers can supply assembly parts, that they purchase from  parts manufacturers, directly to the maintenance and repair  market, they must obtain the consent of the parts manufacturers.  This done, they can purchase as repair and maintenance parts the  same parts that they use as assembly parts, and then supply them  directly to the market through their sales channels.    In their contracts with auto makers, dealers used to be  obliged "to use genuine parts" for maintenance and repair. Then,  in 1991, when these contracts were revised, this clause was  eliminated. However, there are certain sales channels that  provide a rebate that promotes the handling of genuine parts and  so has the effect of restricting the handling of non-genuine  parts. Moreover, when the auto maker demands the parts  manufacturer's advance consent in order to supply the market  with parts independently developed by the parts manufacturer  without any contribution of know-how by the auto maker, the  parts manufacturer, if he grants his consent, ends up with the  freedom of his business activities restricted, which is a  problem.    As mentioned before, the number of dealers handling foreign  cars has increased. However, these dealers have not always been  acting voluntarily. In order to open up the market for cars and  parts, the Fair Trade Commission has pointed out to auto makers  both the problems revealed by the latest survey results and the  Commission's views about them, and has encouraged auto makers to  voluntarily grapple with solving those problems.    In the future, the Fair Trade Commission will work to  understand the kinds of measures [that automakers] take in  response to the problems that were pointed out to them; and will  watch, from the standpoint of free and open competition, whether  the factors causing the exclusionary and closed character of the  auto and auto parts markets are eliminated.

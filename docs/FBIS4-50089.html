			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  said here today that China's contracting status in the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) should be restored based  on the principle of seeking a balance between duties and rights.    Li made the remarks when meeting with GATT Director-General  Peter Sutherland this afternoon in Zhongnanhai, headquarters of  the State Council.    The Chinese premier said that China's foreign trade is  developing in tandem with the growth of the country's gross  national product.    Preliminary estimates show that the annual import and export  volume will reach 400 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000, he  added.    China will continue to import raw materials and primary  products which are in short supply in China while importing more  technologies and equipment, Li said, and the prospects for  China's economic cooperation and trade with foreign countries  are promising.    The premier said that China's bid for re-entry into GATT is  a  result of the country's reform and open policies which have been  implemented since the late 1970s.    China's foreign trade regime has basically met GATT  requirements through its economic reform in more than a decade,  he said, and China will observe the rules of the Uruguay Round  and shoulder corresponding duties, while enjoying its due rights.    He said that China is willing to resume its GATT membership  at an early date and will make its greatest efforts to realize  the target based on the principle of balance between obligations  and rights.    Yet, he stressed, whatever efforts China makes must be in  line with the level of its economic development.    Li cited China's signing of the final act of the Uruguay  Round and the agreement on the establishment of the World Trade  Organization as a good demonstration of China's determination  and sincerity to re-enter the world multi-lateral trading system.    The Chinese premier expressed his thanks to the  director-general and the GATT Secretariat for their support for  China's re-entry into GATT.    Sutherland said that he was very much impressed by China's  efforts and sincerity in the process of negotiations on its re-  entry, and he appreciated China's courage in its reform.    The GATT chief said he had always believed that China should  be brought into the world multi-lateral trading system.    It will substantially benefit both China and the world if  China bases its foreign trade regime on the rules of the  multi-lateral trading system, Sutherland said.    China's fast economic growth based on controlled inflation  is  not an easy target, he said, and he expressed hope that China  will make greater achievements in future economic reform.</p>

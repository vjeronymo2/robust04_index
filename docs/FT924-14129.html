			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / French Government Bonds: Beregovoy in hands of Bundesbank IF there is one thing that Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, hates it is being reminded of the extent to which the course of the French economy is dictated by Germany. Unfortunately for Mr Beregovoy, the single most important issue on France's economic agenda - whether and when official interest rates come down - is firmly in the hands of the Bundesbank. France cannot risk lowering its interest rates until the Germans do so. Last week French government bonds staged a slight rally as fears of another attack on the franc receded and hopes rose that the Bundesbank will reduce interest rates. The yield on the benchmark 10-year OAT government bonds ended the week at 8.53 per cent, against 8.61 per cent a week before. But if there is the slightest sign of a change in attitude from the Germans, French bonds could plummet again. For the moment investors appear optimistic. Mr Francois Systermans, a bond trader at Paribas in Paris, says: 'The market seems a bit more confident. Domestic investors are putting their money back into bonds. The UK houses have stopped selling and are starting to buy again, so are the US investors. The French market is much more stable.' But the chief source of this new-found stability is the expectation of a rate cut by the Germans. This means that French government bonds are still very vulnerable to the threat of another volte face from the Bundesbank. Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist with Salomon Brothers, says: 'The market is still jittery. There has been an improvement in French bonds on expectations of a reduction in German rates. If there is a reduction in Germany, France will follow. French bonds will then rise further and the spread with German bunds should narrow. 'But if the hopes of a cut in German rates are disappointed, we could see a very different scenario. The market would become nervous about how much longer France could sustain high real interest rates and stagnant growth.' In theory the bond market should be bolstered by the underlying strength of the French economy, which is still performing better than most of its international competitors. However, the economic outlook is now far less rosy than it seemed even a few months ago. The recent stream of lacklustre interim results from France's big industrial groups has raised concern about growth prospects for the second half. There are also fears about the impact of the strong franc on French exports next year. In the meantime a sharp fall in corporate investment - and in demand for consumer credit - illustrates the impact of high real interest rates. Goldman Sachs, already forecasting growth of just 1.5 per cent for France in 1992, rather than the official projection of 2 per cent, has reduced its growth expectations for 1993 from 1.6 per cent to 0.7 per cent. The position could worsen if official interest rates remain high and French banks are forced to pass on the increase in their own credit costs to their customers, thereby increasing the financial pressure on the corporate sector and triggering another round of investment cuts. Such a turn of events could be avoided, of course, if France is able to lower official interest rates, and that depends on the Bundesbank. Mr Mercier says: 'All the signs suggest that we should see a reduction in German and French rates within the next quarter. But we've been saying that for the past two years.'</p>

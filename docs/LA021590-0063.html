			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VEGETABLES, INSTEAD OF BUTTER, ADD SAUCY FLAVOR TO PAIR OF SEAFOOD DISHES  </P> <P> Seafood plays a leading role in two main dishes that are deceptively rich in  flavor. The sauce for Crab Gratin is prepared without butter or oil and  contains only two tablespoons of cream. Linguine adds substance to the dish,  and mushrooms and tomatoes add fresh contrast.  </P> <P> Like the crab dish, Oyster-Zucchini Chowder appears rich and creamy, but the  texture is produced by pureed vegetables. Some of the oysters are pureed with  the vegetables, and the remainder join zucchini cubes as a garnish.  </P> <P> CRAB GRATIN  </P> <P> 6 ounces dry linguine  </P> <P> 1/4 pound mushrooms, sliced  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons lemon juice  </P> <P> 1/4 cup water  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons flour  </P> <P> 2 cups clam juice  </P> <P> 1/2 cup white wine  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon dried tarragon, crumbled  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon light soy sauce  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons whipping cream  </P> <P> 1/4 cup parsley, chopped  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped tomatoes  </P> <P> 3/4 pound crab meat, cartilage removed  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons unseasoned bread crumbs  </P> <P> Cook linguine according to package directions until firm-tender. Drain at once,  Rinse with cold water and drain thoroughly. Place in large bowl.  </P> <P> Place mushrooms in small saucepan. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon lemon juice and  add water. Place foil sheet directly over mushrooms. Cover pot and cook over  high heat about 1 minute, just until steam begins to escape from saucepan.  Drain mushrooms, reserving juices and place in dish.  </P> <P> Place flour in 1-quart saucepan and stir in enough clam juice to make smooth  paste. Stir in remaining clam juice, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, white wine and  reserved mushroom juice. Season with coriander, tarragon, pepper and soy sauce.  Place over medium heat and bring to simmer, stirring constantly. Cook and stir  until mixture thickens, about 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in cream, then parsley and  tomatoes.  </P> <P> Add mushrooms to pasta in bowl and pour 1/2 of sauce over pasta. Mix well and  place in lightly oiled 6-cup gratin dish. Pat into smooth layer. Gently mix  remaining sauce with crab meat and spoon over linguine. Sprinkle bread crumbs  over top. Bake at 375 degrees 15 minutes, or until heated through. If top has  not browned, place under broiler just long enough to brown. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> OYSTER-ZUCCHINI CHOWDER  </P> <P> 1 1/4 pounds zucchini  </P> <P> 1/2 pound potato, cut into chunks  </P> <P> 1/4 pound carrot, cut into chunks  </P> <P> 3 green onions, sliced  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, chopped  </P> <P> 1/4 cup parsley leaves, chopped  </P> <P> Pepper  </P> <P> 2 cups fish or chicken stock  </P> <P> 1 pint shucked oysters  </P> <P> Juice of 1/2 lemon  </P> <P> Few drops hot pepper sauce  </P> <P> Cut 1 pound zucchini into large chunks. Cut remainder into small cubes for  garnish and reserve.  </P> <P> Combine zucchini, potato and carrot chunks in 3-quart saucepan. Add onions,  garlic, parsley and season to taste with pepper. Pour in stock. Bring to simmer  and cook 20 minutes, until potatoes are very tender.  </P> <P> Place 1/2 of oysters and their liquor in small saucepan. Add lemon juice and  hot pepper sauce and bring slowly to boil over low heat. As soon as mixture  simmers, stir oysters. Cook until edges begin to curl. Remove from heat. Cover  and set aside.  </P> <P> Cook zucchini cubes in boiling water 1 to 2 minutes, just until tender. Drain  and rinse with cold water. Drain well and reserve.  </P> <P> When chowder vegetables are cooked, puree in food processor or blender,  dividing into batches if necessary. Add reserved raw oysters and their liquor  and puree again.  </P> <P> Rinse out pot in which chowder was cooked. Return chowder to pot. If too thick,  thin with liquid from poached oysters or little water. Gently reheat to simmer  and simmer until heated through. Ladle about 1 1/2 cups chowder into each bowl.  Garnish with poached oysters and zucchini cubes. Makes 4 main dish servings.  </P></p>

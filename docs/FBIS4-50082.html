			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Marching Toward the Modern Enterprise System" column by </F> staff reporter Zhu Jianhong (2612 0494 4767): "Hongyun Company  Builds the Bridge -- Series of Reports on Comprehensive Reforms  Carried Out by Beijing No. 1 Light Industrial Corporation (Third  Installment)"-- first paragraph is editor's note]    [Text] Editor's note: If the previous installments of  this series, namely, the first installment, "The Market Calls  for a New Role," and the second installment, "Molding Oneself  According to the Owner's Demands," focused on introducing the  mental approach of Beijing No. 1 Light Industrial Corporation  [BLIC] to reforms, the following installment concentrates on  explaining in specific terms how they operate. Reforms require  inputs. The "Hongyun" Company is a "starter [qi dong qi 0796  0520 0892]" of the BLIC for pooling input funds. With the  special powers vested in it by the higher authorities, Hongyun  gave play to the corporation's advantage in available resources  in accordance with Beijing's urban master plan and the state  industrial policy, thus allowing the re-exploitation of the  BLIC's stock assets. Within six months, the "starter" activated  the entire BLIC community. With the BLIC's change of  identity, a definite goal came to be seen, i.e., ensuring the  increasing value of state assets.    Increasing value is possible only when the assets are  in active operation. For assets to be adjusted from an idle  state to an active state, inputs of capital are needed. Among  the three major difficulties facing state enterprises, "lack of  money" is a key problem. The BLIC used a weapon unique to the  market economy, namely, the joint-stock system, and activated  management of state assets.    Before this, in fact, they had thought about how to make  state assets active and had taken action accordingly.    A large work force, a small amount of money, and an asset  stock that was hard to activate were like three mountains  pressing on the BLIC, making it hard to breathe. The most  important inspiration they drew from Deng Xiaoping's remarks in  South China in 1992 was that they must make efforts to  emancipate their minds and change concepts, choose the right  point of breakthrough, and break out of confinements.    They looked back and reviewed a series of past reform  explorations which had somewhat stepped beyond prescribed limits:    Beijing No. 3 Glass Factory used to operate in a busy  downtown area and caused pollution and disturbance to residents.  It was only after it received foreign investment through equity  participation that it could move from the downtown area to  outside the city's No. 4 Beltway and embarked on a new phase of  development from a high starting point.    Beijing No. 2 Spectacles Factory stopped producing glasses  and started doing business in the optical market . By doing so,  it not only adjusted its industrial line according to the  orientation of the market, but also materialized differential  earnings from land [tu di ji cha xiao yi 0960 0966 4787 1567  2400 4135].    Beijing Lighting Equipment Factory also adjusted its  structure according to the orientation of the market,  revitalizing itself and achieving the optimal disposition of its  assets....    Judged by the old standards, a large work force and numerous  enterprises making little profit or at a loss were all burdens  that were hard to get rid of. However, when viewed from a  different angle, the stock assets of the BLIC are actually an  enormous pool of resources. They had 56 enterprises within and  along the No. 3 Beltway in Beijing, occupying a total of 1.3  million square meters of land. Once exploited, these resources  would make an inestimable contribution to changing BLIC's  situation when the development and renovation of Beijing reached  a high tide. The BLIC drew up a new development strategy:  backing away from the secondary and entering the tertiary,  i.e., conducting industrial transfers on urban enterprises  engaged in secondary industry in order of priority to exploit  differential earnings from land and develop tertiary industry;  and moving beyond the No. 4 and entering the secondary, i.e.,  moving production elements transferred from the urban area to  outside the No. 4 Beltway in accordance with state industrial  policy and the urban development master plan and developing  secondary industry on a high basis.    This is a major example of industrial transfer executed by  way of the re-exploitation of assets. The number one task was  to put capital into circulation.    Methods of financing are many, but not for BLIC. BLIC at  that time was a nominal enterprise, which was in fact merely an  administrative organ without the authority to extend credit.  Funding from the government was for the purpose of sustaining  the corporation's administrative operations. Therefore, they  had to resort to different channels of financing. They chose  the mode of a limited liability company and raised large amounts  of money from society at large by setting up joint-stock  companies and obtaining the capital funds for the ongoing  exploitation [gun dong kai fa 3340 0520 7030 4099] of assets.    In July 1993, Beijing Hongyun Property Company Limited,  which is held by BLIC, was founded by "special approval." The  capital stock of Hongyun was 150 million yuan. Of this capital  stock, 135 million yuan comprised corporate shares, of which 110  million yuan was subscribed by the five promoters. In addition,  25 million yuan was raised from designated legal persons from  society at large and internal staff shares were worth 15 million  yuan. In this way, the Hongyun Company managed to raise a total  of 190 million yuan.    "Money spent should buy in a new mechanism." If the  Hongyun Company had not faced the market but had continued to  operate in the mode of administrative management, the bridge it  had built would not have led BLIC toward the modern enterprise  system.    The Hongyun Company is a product of the market economy. It  was incorporated under the rules of a market economy and the  degree of standardization in this company was fully affirmed by  relevant personalities.    In enlivening the state asset stock of BLIC as a whole, the  Hongyun Company undertook the heavy responsibility of raising  starter funds, implementing industrial transfer through ongoing  exploitation, and accomplishing the re-exploitation of existing  assets. To cater to this special mission, the municipal  government decided to grant the Hongyun Company the right to  (general) real estate development. In other words, the Hongyun  Company could develop real estate in all BLIC enterprises and  was authorized to transform parts of the urban area in complete  plots.    This economic entity, carrying the mission of activating  state assets, began to operate by the rules of the market  economy.    The first project was the Beijing Match Factory. It was  located in Beijing's Chongwen District, occupying 47,000 square  meters of land. It had a work force of 868, with 500 retired  workers. Heavy burdens and high operating costs caused the  enterprises to suffer high production costs and low profits. It  had started to operate at a loss in the first half of 1993. In  the process of transformation planned according to the new  approach, the factory was first moved outside the No. 4 Beltway  and a new match factory operating under the joint-stock system  was set up in conjunction with Tongxian County. Because a new  operational mechanism was used, the work force was streamlined  to about 300 and, in the meantime, a large number of contract  workers were recruited, taking advantage of inexpensive labor  from suburban counties. In the middle of February 1994, the new  factory went into trial operation and the estimated profit rate  for the whole year will be over 10 percent. On the site of the  old match factory, the construction of a residential  subdistrict, with a total floor space of over 120,000 square  meters, began at the end of last year. The whole project will  be completed in about two years. The total investment is 273  million yuan and income from sales will reach 344 million yuan.    The transformation of the match factory was a big success,  as  well as a big sensation. A lossmaker had disappeared and, in  its place, a new-type enterprise and a large tract of high-value  property had been born. That is why Fu Lin [0265 2651], the  director of the old match factory, vividly described the  metamorphosis of his enterprise as "experiencing a rewarding  death." Society's comment on this example was: "Move one spot,  enliven the whole area."    In less than a year since it started operating, the Hongyun  Company has displayed extremely strong vitality:    --It has completed the investigation of 32 BLIC enterprises  located within the bounds of the No. 3 Beltway. Their  properties have been reappraised and the results show that they  occupy a total of 1.008 million square meters of land.  According to Beijing's urban development plan, this amount of  land can be redeveloped into 3 million square meters of  commercial and residential floor space worth about 18.3 billion  yuan and generating an estimated profit of 4.5 billion yuan.    --Three projects, including the match factory project, have  been started, with the total floor space under construction  being 170,000 square meters. Returns had been quite handsome by  the end of last year and shareholders are expected to receive  satisfactory dividends.    --It has pre-injected 87 million yuan of project funds into  such enterprises as a battery factory, a light bulb factory, a  general winery, a glass company, and the No. 1 Foodstuffs  Company. This move has not only helped relieve a shortage of  working capital in these enterprises, but has also laid the  foundation for the development of future projects.    The Hongyun Company's investments are extensive. Besides  real estate development carried out in conjunction with the  industrial transfers in its sector, it has also started equity  participation in other fields. So far, the value of its equity  investments in commercial circulation enterprises, the garment  industry, real estate, and exchange markets has reached 20  million yuan. According to Li Xiaohong [7812 2556 1347],  general manager of the Hongyun Company, the company's investment  policy is: Invest in various fields, extend feelers in various  directions, and establish many fulcra to distribute investment  risks, adjust the orientation of operations whenever necessary,  obtain market information, converge with domestic and  international markets, and strive for stable returns.    There are similarities and differences between the Hongyun  Company's behavior and that of ordinary joint-stock companies.  The similarities are that they operate in the same market  environment, have decision-making powers in operations, and are  developing their business according to the orientation of the  market. Differences are that the Hongyun Company shoulders the  heavy responsibility of activating state assets in a whole  sector and in the meantime also has unshirkable social  responsibility; therefore, it has secured government support and  enjoys advantages in resources that ordinary companies do not  have.    Because of this special role that the Hongyun Company plays,  BLIC sees itself as a starter for managing state assets and,  relying on the strength of the market, uses it to transform the  old system bit by bit with the new system, activate the  reorganization of stock assets according to market orientation  with new development in a step-by-step way, and eventually reach  the goal of activating all of its state assets. Notable results  were generated within a few months. Last year, the total  industrial output value and sales income of the corporation  increased by 6.8 percent and 24.2 percent respectively over the  previous year, its profits and taxes increased 61.7 percent and  16.3 percent respectively, and the number of lossmakers and  losses within the budget fell by 37.5 percent and 52.5 percent  respectively. Its rate of profit increase was the highest in  Beijing's industrial sector and among the highest in the light  industry sector nationwide.</p>

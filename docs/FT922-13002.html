			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Roskel declines 28% to Pounds 1.57m Roskel, the suspended ceilings and partitions group, which moved to a full listing last summer, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.57m for the year to end-December. Although that was a decline of 28 per cent on the previous year's Pounds 2.18m, the directors said the figures were helped by a significant second-half improvement. Turnover slipped to Pounds 43.79m (Pounds 46.22m). Pre-tax profits were struck after taking account of a Pounds 150,000 rise in bad debts, provisions and related costs to Pounds 930,000 and interest charges of Pounds 586,000 (Pounds 862,000). Earnings emerged at 7.22p (9.4p). A final dividend of 3p makes a same-again 4.3p.</p>

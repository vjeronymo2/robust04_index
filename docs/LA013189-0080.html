			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARRY BERNSTEIN / LABOR: IMMIGRATION REFORM A SUCCESS -- FOR SOME  </P> <P> The historic law passed by Congress in 1986 to stem the flood of illegal aliens  who poured into this country for many decades seems to be doing remarkably well  after a fitful start.  </P> <P> Its success has been largely unnoticed amid the welter of complaints about it,  complaints largely arising because the law is doing what it was supposed to do:  curb the flow of illegals by reducing their chances for jobs.  </P> <P> But even as the law shows its value, at least two fundamental problems that it  created are becoming painfully visible and urgently need congressional action.  </P> <P> One is the issue of dealing with the millions of illegal aliens -- no one knows  exactly how many -- who came here before the law was passed but who were  excluded from its protection because Congress arbitrarily picked Jan. 1, 1982,  as a cutoff date.  </P> <P> The huge influx of ineligible aliens who came after 1982 cannot and should not  be rounded up like criminals and thrown out just because Congress guessed that  date would be as good a cutoff point as any other. And yet the people trapped  in that congressionally created time box are more open than ever to vicious  exploitation by unscrupulous employers who take advantage of the fact that the  workers have few job options anymore.  </P> <P> Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), a key architect of immigration reform,  says he and others in Congress are studying legislative approaches to help  those trapped workers.  </P> <P> Another increasingly serious problem is the massive sales of forged documents  to newly arriving illegals who use them to try to claim, fraudulently, that  they were here before the 1982 cutoff.  </P> <P> The obvious solution is a tamper-resistant Social Security card that would be  used by all workers applying for jobs. Forgeries would be far more difficult  (the system works well for credit cards); workers could be protected against  discrimination, and honest employers could quickly determine if a job applicant  is here legally. All workers are already required to have Social Security  cards, so a new card would be no more intrusive on one's privacy.  </P> <P> The serious problems do not diminish the remarkable success of the Immigration  Reform Act. Its achievement can best be estimated by the precipitous drop in  the number of people picked up by the Immigration and Naturalization Service  since the law was adopted.  </P> <P> In fiscal 1986, before the law took effect, the INS apprehended 1,767,400  people who were trying to slip into the United States illegally. In fiscal  1988, which ended last September, the number plunged to 1,008,143 -- a drop of  more than 40%.  </P> <P> For the first three months of this fiscal year, the total is down an additional  15%. Huge numbers of illegals are still getting here, but at last this country  is gaining control of its borders.  </P> <P> Credit for the diminished influx goes to a provision in the law that for the  first time requires fines and even prison sentences for employers convicted of  knowingly hiring illegal aliens.  </P> <P> That provision means that the exploiters of illegals can at last be punished.  In the past, only the worker was punished, by being deported, and the exploiter  was free to hire other illegals.  </P> <P> Penalties against the exploiters are just starting to bite. So far, about 1,200  employers have been fined more than $4 million for knowingly hiring illegals.  </P> <P> But even that token amount seems to be having the desired effect of reducing  the number of employers who hire illegals. This creates openings for workers  who are in this country legally but who cannot compete for jobs with the often  desperate illegals, who are usually willing to work for wages far below the  legal minimum.  </P> <P> The newly legalized workers, along with millions of other domestic workers,  need to be helped by rigorous enforcement of worker protection measures such as  minimum wage laws.  </P> <P> But worker protection laws have not been seriously enforced during the past  eight years despite the calls for more "law and order" from former President  Ronald Reagan and President Bush at the national level and from governors such  as California's George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> Enforcement of pro-worker laws is especially difficult when illegals are  involved, because they fear deportation and are afraid to file complaints  against their bosses.  </P> <P> INS and local authorities report a substantial increase in street-corner pickup  spots where employers prowl daily for the cheap labor of illegals.  </P> <P> As troublesome as that increase is, it is another indication that employers in  established businesses are no longer as willing as they had been to hire the  illegals, and many of those already here or still coming in are being forced to  hustle jobs on street corners.  </P> <P> Also, wages in many of the lowest-paying menial jobs are increasing slightly as  employers try to find domestic workers to replace illegals.  </P> <P> More than 3 million former illegal aliens have filed applications for amnesty  and, therefore, are eligible to legally get jobs here.  </P> <P> These workers are no longer so easily exploited because they do not face the  threat of deportation if they complain. Also, their availability has reduced  fears of massive labor shortages caused by the immigration law.  </P> <P> Although it needs improvement, the immigration reform measure that was passed  after decades of debate appears to be improving what was an unacceptable way of  helping jobless foreign workers and providing cheap labor for devious  employers.  </P></p>

The opposition delegation to the talks is expected  to respond to Russia's offer to hold the first round of talks in  Moscow, Adamishin told TASS. He reported that his visit to Iran  aimed to negotiate a political settlement of the Tajik conflict.    Tajikistan has been in turmoil since independence after the  Soviet Union's collapse in 1991.    Adamishin, whose government has thousands of troops in  Tajikistan guarding its southern border with Afghanistan against  Moslem rebels based here, told Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali  Akbar Velayati that Moscow was not seeking a military solution.    He stressed Tajik opposition had come to understanding there  was no alternative to a political solution of the problem.  According to the Russian diplomat, the main thing now is to  open talks. To get this process moving, Russia suggested that  the confronting sides enter dialogue on March 16 and pledged  safety for both parties to the talks.    According to Adamishin, the programmes of settlement set  forth by the sides differ considerably, but the negotiating  process is designed to draw them closer.    The deputy foreign minister stressed that nobody but Tajiks  themselves could settle their problems. For this reason, Russia  thinks participation of any third countries in the talks to be  unnecessary. U.N. mediation will be quite enough.</p>

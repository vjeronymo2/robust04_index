			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Herbert Grab: "Growing Pains"] </F>   [Text] The mobile communications market in Germany is  taking off in a big way. Manufacturers cannot meet the demand  for equipment. Network operators and service providers are  struggling hard to keep up with the mass of subscribers in the  D-networks. Hardware prices are plummeting. The extent of the  continuing boom has evidently surprised all parties involved.    In the spring of 1992, Deutsche Telekom proudly pointed out  that the number of subscribers to mobile services in the whole  of Germany -- adding all services together -- amounted to one  million: 600,000 in the analogue C-network, over 360,000 in the  paging services Cityruf (Citycall) and Eurosignal and a few  thousand in the first PMR regions and the old B-network.    At the time, about a year and a half ago, the Federal  Republic, with its analogue C-network confined within national  borders and barely eight mobile telephones per 1000 inhabitants,  was an underdeveloped mobile market.    Today, these figures seem to date back to another era.  Germany has climbed to the top of the world's market with its  two digital networks, technologically as well as in terms of  subscriber numbers. In no other mobile markets are growth rates  as enormous as here.    Around 800,000 subscribes populated the D-networks at the  end  of October. In addition, 800,000 more Germans use mobile phones  in the analogue C-network. With a population of 80 million,  this amounts to 20 mobile phones per 1000 inhabitants.    If one adds up the totals of mobile subscribers in Germany  including paging services, PMR, satellite and mobile data, the  two million limit has long been passed. Within 18 months, the  mobile market within Germany has doubled -- and thus changed  fundamentally.    There are several reasons for this boom -- the extent of  which surprises even the experts. One source of the increase in  subscribers is the backlog created during the 1980s. The  restricted C-network, and terminal prices which were extremely  high compared with other countries, kept the market artificially  small.    And the D-networks came into operation a year later than  originally planned. During this year (mid-1991 to mid-1992) the  mobile market grew much more slowly than before -- many  subscribers were waiting for digital mobile services.    Plummeting prices for mobile phones are another phenomenon.  Today, in Germany you can buy a mobile phone for about DM500  [German marks] -- subsidised by network operators and service  providers who are hell-bent on flogging their wares, cost  notwithstanding.    First generation GSM terminals, according to the German head  of British manufacturer Orbitel, Klaus Angermuller, "will  practically be given away for free soon." And Kalevi Kaartinen,  managing director of Nokia Mobile Phones Deutschland, states:  "The Germans create English conditions, but with German  thoroughness." Similar comments are heard from the managing  director of service provider Unicom, Stefan Sieber: "We now have  a situation in our market that took the English five years."  <H5>  Problems for Service Providers </H5>   Manufacturers are complaining about the minimal profit  margins achieved with mobil radio telephones. Bundling is  weakening the business foundation of dealers and service  providers. They are selling terminals below purchase price:  their margins have to come from premiums tied into the SIM  cards and subsequent call volumes.    But this calculation has not turned out as expected. The  cheaper mobile phones are being sold over the counter and are  being bought by private customers. And they are using them  significantly less frequently than professional users.    The result: Not only the hardware profits, but also the  commissions from call volumes are far too low. Most service  providers made their calculations assuming about DM200 per  subscriber per month (including the basic charge) but, so far,  nobody is actually realising this margin. "We are in danger of  simply maximising our losses with increasing numbers of  subscribers," complains the managing director of a well know  service provider.    But falling prices and profit margins do not seem to deter  newcomers. More and more firms from other industries hit by the  recession are constantly looking for salvation on the mobile  market. The consumer electronics sector jumps onto the mobile  train as do office equipment and computer dealers, petrol  stations and car dealers. And the mass marketers' golden hour  has already arrived -- mail order companies, department stores,  supermarkets. Mobile phones can be obtained at every corner.    Consumer electronics manufacturer Grundig is starting to  market cards for the D-network through its car hi-fi dealers.  Its partners is service provider D-plus, in which Grundig is a  25 percent shareholder. In the near future Grundig is also  planning to enter the market with its own mobile phones.    Leading computer multiples Vobis and Escom are also hopeful.  For the past few weeks they have been offering cards and  terminals for the D-networks. Escom is selling Motorola  terminals and D2-cards according to Gorbachev's maxim: "If you  are too expensive, life will punish you." Vobis is coming along  with a wide range of equipment, featuring, amongst others, the  brand new pocketphone from Orbitel -- and D1-cards.    The problem is that the more the marketing people from other  industries want to benefit from this booming market -- and put  their money on rapid, uncomplicated turnover of mass product  mobile phones -- the lower the quality of consultancy and  service.    D-plus managing director Hansjurgen Roesch: "The more  consumers are lured into the networks without sufficient advice  and service, the higher the number of potentially dissatisfied  clients later on." The result will be high cancellation rates  and lots of swaps from one service provider/network operator to  the next -- increasing the cost but not the profit below the  line. "And this," says Roesch, "cannot be in anyone's interest."    All 13 service providers are currently operating. But the  industry is certain that by the end of 1994, the first few will  have given up. It is predominantly the traditional mobile  dealers who are about to drown. They are complaining about more  customers, more demand for advice and consultancy services, but  less money in the till. Lower hardware margins and their  aggressive rivals constitute a serious challenge.    "Although at the moment, there are no mass casualties in the  dealer environment," warns Harald Koester, managing director of  service provider proficom, he is certain that this will happen.  And for his colleague, Kai Uwe Ricke, son of Telekom's chief  Helmut Ricke and head of service provider Talkline, the real  price battle is yet to come.    The industry's view of the future is equivocal. On the one  hand, everyone is hoping for profits from a vigorous start to  the mass market. On the other hand, even 18 months after the  opening of the D-networks in Germany, there is absolute chaos  behind the scenes. And many of the problems which will become  acute next year have not yet been solved.    For example, airtime billing with the network operators is  done "manually". Online connections between the data processing  systems of network operators and service providers will only be  introduced from early next year.    "Let's hope", comments an insider, "that before then there  will be no more European roaming agreements." Because these are  presently dealt with bilaterally between individual roaming  partners -- a "homespun" solution requiring massive amounts of  staff.    Meanwhile, service providers are waiting for network  operators to introduce data over GSM services. This, they hope,  will provide a new stimulus to the market and the opportunity to  distinguish themselves from the others.    Individual tariff structures are one key mechanism through  which some service providers are already trying to establish  themselves. But this requires considerably more processing  capability than is provided by service providers' current  management and billing software. Without large investments,  nothing is possible at all.  <H5>  E-Plus </H5>   And, as if service providers and dealers did not have enough  problems already, the next player to enter the market is E-plus  -- the third big network operator. In the first few months of  1994, the PCN operator (the network is marketed as E1 in  Germany) will launch service in two densely populated areas of  the new German "Lander". By the end of 1994, E-Plus chief  Herbert Brenke is hoping to have covered the 17 most important  economic centres in Germany.    The main emphasis of the E-Plus rollout lies -- as requested  by the Federal Ministry for Post and Telecommunications, who  awarded the licence -- in the new German Lander. They are  supposed to have 88 percent coverage by the end of 1995 --  serving essentially 100 percent of the population.    The chaotic market already creates more than enough problems  for Brenke. His company does not intend to distinguish itself  from the D-network operators in terms of hardware prices. The  PCN handsets used in E-Plus are technically little different  from GSM terminals. Motorola, for example, will offer its new  MicroTAC in an almost identical form to its current PCN version  in the United Kingdom. In Germany, it will be available with  the start of E-plus. The price, according to Motorola manager  Georg F. Langheld, will be based on that of the GSM terminals.    Call tariffs will also prove an ineffective weapon in the  battle over mobile phone customers. Until now, D1 and D2 have  kept their airtime prices artificially high. If E-Plus offers  lower rates, then its two GSM rivals will be able to follow suit  without problem -- especially as upgrades of their network  infrastructure can now be achieved much more cheaply than two to  three years ago, thanks to the worldwide availability of GSM.    It is particularly difficult, according to Brenke, to set up  a sales network. Service providers and dealers are too busy  solving their existing problems. "What they need least of all  now is another network operator," says a market expert.    Mobile dealers are not therefore particularly willing to  busy  themselves with E-plus at the moment. Brenke will almost  certainly have to strengthen his own service provider -- the  14th on the German market -- more than was planned originally.    The sole cause for optimism in the industry at the moment  concerns growth rates. In the five months from March to August  1993, the number of D-network subscribers doubled from some  300,000 to almost 600,000. And in September the growth rate  increased even more, to a record 106,240 new subscribers within  a month.    The industry is expecting to reach one million subscribers  in  the D-networks by the end of this year. Monthly growth rates of  100,000 and more new subscribers for 1994 are already almost  taken for granted.  <H5>  PMR and Mobile Data </H5>   But a lot has happened in Germany within the last few  months,  not only within the GSM and PCN sectors. Two more mobile  markets are beginning to become noticed in public: PMR and  mobile data.    While Telekom -- or, more precisely, its mobile daughter  DeTeMobil -- is already active in both these markets (Chekker in  PMR, Modacom in mobile data), private competitors are moving in.    The new licensees for regional PMR networks in urban areas  ("A" regions) have joined up and formed two nation-wide  competitors: RegioNet and Terrafen. With four regions only,  Sprintel (a subsidiary of Swiss company Swissphone) is trying to  keep up.    The networks for these already exist -- except for Sprintel  -- and the fight for market share is ongoing.    Meanwhile, DeTeMobil has founded an association, the  Funkfachhandels Organisation (TFK), which builds up and markets  Chekker networks outside urban areas. The concept is to tag  these networks onto "A" networks so they can serve as the link  between two large conurbations. Participants are TFK, DeTeMobil  and large local radio/mobile dealers.    The first few TFK Chekker networks already exist. DeTeMobil  and the private PMR operators are competing for those GSM  customers whose activities are mainly confined within a region.  Roaming possibilities between individual PMR networks are  intended to help in this process.    The mobile data market in Germany is not quite so advanced.  DeTeMobil's Modacom network has been running since the beginning  of June -- but terminals have only been available in reasonable  quantities since October.    And a private mobile data licence has yet to be granted.  Applications have been submitted since mid-October but the  process continues until February 15. The Federal Ministry for  Post and Telecommunications will not decide on this licence  until 31 May 1994.    DeTeMobil is expecting half a million mobile data  subscribers  in Germany by the year 2000 in both future networks. Other  observers estimate a market potential of about two million  subscribers.    Four companies are expected to apply for a mobile data  licence; D2 operator Mannesmann Mobilfunk and its subsidiary  Eurocom, the electricity utilities Rheinisch-Westfalischen  Elektrizitatswerken (RWE) and Preussen Elektra, and BellSouth in  association with RAM Mobile Data.    D2 chief Peter Mihatsch already announced his interest in  such a licence last spring. He wants high usage of his  infrastructure -- mobile data seems ideal.    For BellSouth, the situation is quite similar. The United  States company holds 21 percent in E-Plus (Table 1). If this  consortium is granted the licence there would be obvious synergy  effects with E1.    Klaus Kirchhoefer, responsible for new business developments  and expansion at RWE: "We are currently examining our  participation in the application process." And VEBA-subsidiary  Preussen Elektra is considering participation "with interest",  as they say.</p>

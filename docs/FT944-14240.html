			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Buckingham sells Portuguese arm Buckingham International, the lossmaking property and hotels group, has sold a Portuguese subsidiary to an associate company of two Buckingham directors. The aggregate consideration for Clima Sol, which owns a partially-finished block of luxury apartments in Parede, is Pounds 400,000, less than 5 per cent of the Pounds 9.2m which Buckingham paid Naaz Holdings for the company. The sale will reduce its liabilities by Pounds 1.3m, which includes Pounds 600,000 of bank borrowings, the directors said. The purchaser is Sentinel Holdings, a subsidiary of Naaz.</p>

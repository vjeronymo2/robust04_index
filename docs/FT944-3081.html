			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / BR forecasts shake-out of train operators Britain's railway network could be owned in 10 years by three or four large companies that have made a speciality of acquiring and operating franchises, Mr Roger Salmon, BR franchising director, forecast yesterday. Mr Salmon, whose task is to auction off the franchises of the 25 passenger train operating companies, unveiled details of the first eight companies to be sold. He also explained the rules that would apply to the timetables, fares and tickets to be offered by the privatised railway businesses. Bidders will be allowed to acquire more than one franchise as long this does not lead to a reduction in competition on the network, Mr Salmon said. Companies specialising in running train services are expected to emerge to bid for new franchises when existing ones lapse. Mr Salmon insisted yesterday that his passenger service requirements would maintain a level of services 'based on the current structure'. Operators would be expected to maintain - and would be subsidised to run - at least 70 per cent of existing InterCity services, 90 per cent of commuter services and 'practically 100 per cent' of rural services. However, sleeper services between London and Fort William and between Plymouth and Glasgow/Edinburgh would no longer be guaranteed. 'We will subsidise a good level of service and above that leave it to the market,' he said, adding that there would be a strong commercial incentive to run more trains. But Mr Michael Meacher, Labour transport spokesman, said Mr Salmon's timetables would lead to cuts in services. 'When this government places a minimum requirement you can bet it will be a minimum service,' he said. Fears that the government subsidy of Pounds 1.7bn a year would be reduced were dismissed by Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary. 'I can confirm that subsidy will continue to be available,' he said. Management buy-out teams and commercial organisations wanting to bid for franchises will be expected to pre-qualify by March and to make firm bids next summer. The sale of the first six should be concluded by the end of 1995. Midland Main Line, which runs services between London and Leeds, and Network SouthCentral, which operates routes between London and the south coast, have been added to the original list of six franchises announced last year. Mr Salmon also invited proposals on arranging the franchising of the west coast main line, the future of which has been complicated by plans for an Pounds 800m upgrade. The initial six to be franchised in the first round were Great Western, Gatwick Express, East Coast Main Line, London, Tilbury and Southend, ScotRail, and South West Trains.</p>

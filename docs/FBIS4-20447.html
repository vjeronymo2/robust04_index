To construct the genomic  DNA library, DNA from the adult F. hepatica was cut  with Sau3AI to an average length of about 2.0 kb and inserted  into the BamHI site of the expression vector pUC18, the size of  the genomic DNA library of F. hepatica being 1.5 x  10[.sup]5[/] recombinants.    Three recombinants expressing antigenic determinants of  F. hepatica pFH16, pFH23, pFH48 were detected through  primary screening and rescreening with F. hepatica  infected rabbit serum (1:50) preabsorbed to remove antibodies to  E. coli and SPA-HRP (1:40). The test of the ability  of expressing fusion proteins showed pFH16 &gt;  pFH48 &gt;  pFH23.  These studies provide the possibility of further research on the  expression of recombinant antigenic genes, the immunity of their  expressed products and the protection of animals.    Key words: Fasciola hepatica, secretory antigen,  genomic DNA library, immunoscreening</p>

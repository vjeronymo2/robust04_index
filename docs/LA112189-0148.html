			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOOD SHIFTS TO MORE CABLE-TV REGULATION;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: RISING CONSUMER COMPLAINTS MOVE MANY IN CONGRESS TO LOOK FOR  WAYS TO IMPROVE COMPETITION.  </P> <P> Growing viewer dissatisfaction over rates and service in the cable-television  industry has convinced many members of Congress and the Federal Communications  Commission that it needs more government regulation.  </P> <P> In 1984, Congress passed a bill that ended regulation of cable rates and left  the power to grant franchise rights to local governments. Since then, rates  have jumped by more than 100% in many areas, and the leading companies have  gained an even greater market share by buying smaller cable concerns.  </P> <P> That has promoted the introduction of several bills in the House and Senate to  limit cable franchise ownership and encourage greater competition.  </P> <P> "They (the authors of the bills) see a problem -- shoddy service and excessive  rates," Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) said at the  opening of hearings on cable-TV problems.  </P> <P> "The huge multiple system operators get bigger, more powerful and exercise even  more anti-competitive muscle against their competitors," added Sen. Albert Gore  (D-Tenn.).  </P> <P> "We know we have a problem here. Some cable operators have taken advantage of  their freedom to set rates," responded National Cable Television Assn.  President James Mooney.  </P> <P> But Mooney said that rates for basic service had increased only by an average  of 26% over two years nationwide and that subscribers were getting more  channels for their money.  </P> <P> "Basic service subscribers now receive an average of 32 channels for 50 cents a  day. No other industry in America provides such a wide array of information and  entertainment at such low cost," he said.  </P> <P> "There seems to be plenty of room for shop-at-home networks and mud wrestling,"  Sen. Wendell Ford (D-Ky.) said in a jab at cable programming.  </P> <P> Cable subscribers represent nearly 55% of all households with television sets.  Cable industry revenue tops $14 billion a year.  </P> <P> FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes said concentration in the cable industry has  increased markedly, with the top four companies controlling about 43% of all  subscribers in 1989, compared to 28% in 1983. "The volume and intensity of  complaints does indicate that there are problems that should be addressed," he  said.  </P> <P> "Today, local cable-television markets are not open to competition. We believe  those restrictions should be changed," Sikes said. He said he would support  allowing each franchising authority to license two or more TV program service  providers rather than the one currently allowed.  </P> <P> "The FCC also plans soon to complete action on its pending inquiry regarding  possible telephone company provision of video transmission services," Sikes  added.  </P> <P> He said the FCC would complete an analysis of the industry by July for use by  Congress in considering whether more legislation was needed.  </P> <P> A bill introduced by Sen. John Danforth (R-Mo.) and 14 others would limit the  size of multiple system operators to 15% of cable subscribers. That appeared to  be aimed at Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, the nation's largest cable  operator with about 16% of subscribers.  </P> <P> "TCI, for one, is obviously hell-bent toward total domination as it buys up not  only more and more cable systems but major programming services and even movie  studios," Gore said in a reference to that company's possible purchase of a 50%  interest in the Showtime channel.  </P> <P> "We really are not bad guys," replied Tele-Communications President John  Malone. He said more regulation of cable was not warranted.  </P> <P> The bills have the support of many powerful legislators, but it is not certain  if any will pass next year. FCC support would improve the chances for some form  of legislation to increase competition.  </P> <P> There is also concern in Congress that too many sports events are switching  from free broadcast television to cable networks, raising the possibility that  fans one day might have to pay to watch the World Series and Super Bowl.  </P> <P> "The lure of big bucks may well prompt sports leagues and teams to completely  bypass free TV, writing off those people who can't afford cable or can't get  it," Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) said at a Judiciary Committee hearing on  sports television.  </P> <P> He added: "Congress has some leverage here, given the favorable antitrust  treatment granted to sports leagues. We'll use that leverage, if need be."  </P> <P> Metzenbaum and others said they were concerned by recent deals giving cable  systems exclusive rights for many sports events, such as the 175 major league  baseball games to be shown in each of the next four years by cable network  ESPN.  </P> <P> However, Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent and National Football League  Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said cable broadcasts would add coverage for sports  fans, not reduce it.  </P></p>

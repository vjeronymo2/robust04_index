			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Search for a cure to economic chill: How BP plans to recover after lean times The marble reception hall of British Petroleum's newly refurbished headquarters in the City of London has only one problem. There is no heating. As a result the management of one of the world's largest oil companies has had to install a number of small gas stoves to beat back the cold. This temporary unsightliness might be a parallel for BP's recently well-publicised difficulties: a blue-chip company undergoing what its management claims is a spell of seasonal difficulty, the chill being provided by recession in its principal markets rather than the weather. The company's poor results for the final quarter of last year, when profits fell 85 per cent and the dividend was unchanged (increasing 4.7 per cent for the year as a whole), drove home to the stock market how vulnerable BP was to the prevailing economic climate. But oil being a business with long lead times, where investments only pay off after several years, the deeper question is whether BP can spring back when conditions improve. Some industry observers are doubtful. They point to the company's heavy load of debt, its exposure to depressed oil prices, and its modest presence in the Far Eastern market, which represents one of the few areas of oil industry growth. BP's executives accept that there is something to these concerns, although they maintain that the market has exaggerated their importance. The City has focused its concern on the company's long-term debt burden. Its debt to equity ratio, an important measure of corporate indebtedness, rose to 69 per cent at the end of last year, compared with a modest 11 per cent at Shell, the rival integrated oil company. The company would like to try to stop it growing above this level, but has ruled out a rights issue in the medium term to raise cash to pay off some of the debt. 'I'm not greatly concerned about our debt levels, but my gut reaction is that we're at a prudent limit,' says Mr Bob Horton, BP's chairman. 'We need to adjust our capital expenditure and accelerate cost-cutting to stay within that level.' The need to rein in debt means that BP must set careful priorities in allocating financial resources. The company needs to balance capital expenditure, which is vital for future growth in the oil industry, with cash needed for debt reduction. It can buy itself some leeway by paring operating costs extensively: it is planning to save Pounds 750m by cost-cutting at its three main business divisions by 1994. There is currently a gap in funding of about Pounds 1.5bn. BP generated Pounds 4.2bn in cash from its operations last year and spent about Pounds 2bn on interest payments, tax and dividends. This leaves a shortfall, since it is committed to capital expenditure of about Pounds 3.5bn this year. But the current funding difficulties cast some doubt on BP's ability to continue growth in oil production and consequently profits in the long term. The company spent Pounds 4bn on capital expenditure projects last year which include payment for developing oilfields and investment in upgrading refineries. But Mr Horton has said it will cut this to about Pounds 3.6bn this year and the City is expecting further cuts of about Pounds 200m to Pounds 300m if the oil price continues to languish at its current level of Dollars 17.50 a barrel. At the same time, BP is under pressure to maintain its programme of spending on oilfield development. The need for new discoveries is ever more pressing because its two principal production areas, Alaska and the North Sea, are reaching maturity and are unlikely to see increases in production. Since Mr John Browne took over as managing director of the exploration division five years ago, he has tried to focus on areas of the world which offer growth. At the same time he has decided to pull the company out of areas where it is failing to build a 'critical mass', which he defines as a project with a market value of more than Dollars 1bn. The company's recent decision to withdraw from the Qatar gas project was an example of this. The strategy has seen BP focus its exploration efforts on Colombia, the Gulf of Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Papua New Guinea, and Australia. Mr Browne says: 'By the mid-1990s we should have new cashflow coming from places like the Gulf of Mexico and Colombia and I hope we'll have opened up a third potential profit centre.' Part of the company's spending on oilfield development will have to be constrained by the need to control its debt, but Mr Browne says the timing of some of these investment decisions can afford to wait. 'Sometimes the longer we sit on things, the better they seem because new technology means we can better exploit them.' However, the timing of investment in BP's refining and marketing division is more critical. The company is taking a similar approach to its downstream operations as to oil exploration, and focusing its activities on geographical regions where BP is a 'major brand'. Mr Russell Seal, head of refining and marketing, explains that for BP to consider itself a leading brand it must have a 15 per cent market share for its petrol in a given area. As part of its strategy of geographical concentration, the company is cutting its European operations from 200 regional centres to 150 and including them under central management from Brussels. But the most important issue for the future profitability of the downstream section will be the amount the company is forced to spend on environmental measures. This is particularly important in the US, where the Clean Air Act could cost the oil industry as much as Dollars 45bn over the next seven years. This will be spent on minimising emissions such as sulphur dioxide from refineries as well as upgrading facilities for the production of new 'cleaner' fuels such as reformulated gasoline. Mr Seal says that the refining and marketing division's share of the capital expenditure budget amounts to some Dollars 1.8bn a year, out of which Dollars 400m is spent on environmental measures. Mr Nick Antill, oil analyst at Hoare Govett, believes BP can ill afford the immense expenditure required to maintain production in the US in view of the Clean Air Act and given the current cut-throat competition in the market. 'If 15 per cent of the refineries can't afford to make the investment and close, that means margins will be higher for those remaining, but BP is perhaps not in the best position to take that gamble.' Industry observers believe that BP has more refining capacity than it needs in the US and will scale it down in future. But given the competitive nature and low returns offered by the US market at present, the environment is not right for divesting assets. BP, however, is pursuing a policy of divestment worldwide in all of its divisions to give it more focus. Mr Horton has classified the company's nutrition division as a 'non-core asset', a move interpreted by many observers as a prelude to a sale. BP says it will not necessarily sell, but it will cease to invest in nutrition. Mr Horton's move to distance the group from its nutrition interests leaves the company in two businesses that are highly dependent on world economic growth: chemicals, and refining and marketing; and in oil exploration, which is dependent on the oil price. BP is more exposed to the oil price than many of its rivals, as it does not have such an extensive network of refineries as, say, Shell. In addition, its oil price forecasts have tended to be more optimistic than many of the other majors'. Mr Horton insists that all projects are tested against an oil price of Dollars 18 a barrel and are found to be 'robust'. But the oil price remains stubbornly low at Dollars 17.50 a barrel. At the same time, BP's long-term plans are based on projections of revenues which require a rise in the price to about Dollars 25 a barrel by the second half of the 1990s. Much of BP's growth estimates for the whole company are based on an oil price above Dollars 20 after 1995. 'If the oil price continues at a level below Dollars 20 a barrel for a sustained period, BP will probably shrink in size,' says Mr Antill. This is because the company is unlikely to be able to invest enough to maintain and increase its oil production. Mr Horton explains: 'In one sense, BP is a growth company, but it doesn't necessarily mean growth in volume or in asset size, but it does mean growth in shareholder value: in earnings. 'We have absolutely no ambition to be the size of Shell of Exxon for the sake of it,' he adds. 'The challenge we must meet is to get our overheads down and operate at a lower cost. That is why technology is vital: we need to operate more efficiently and offer a better service to customers.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cairo correspondent Smadar Peri] </F>   [Text] Speaking to a special, closed session of the senior  Egyptian military command, President Husni Mubarak said: "We  are now moving toward full peace and normal relations with  Israel."    The meeting took place at the beginning of the week. It is  worth noting that the Egyptian regime relies on the military's  support and President Mubarak is the supreme commander of the  Egyptian Armed Forces. Emergency military law is still in  effect in Egypt.    Mubarak told the forum of the supreme military command that  he wanted to update them on his intention to encourage Egyptian  business to cooperate in full with their Israeli counterparts,  to permit Egyptian nationals to visit Israel, and to permit all  forms of normal relations.    At the meeting, Mubarak stressed: "The era of cold peace is  over -- we are moving toward full normalization." In the  discussion with the senior army commanders, Mubarak brought  Israel's impending natural gas deals as an example. "There is  no reason," the Egyptian president said, "why Arab countries  which do not have official relations with Israel (referring to  Qatar) can sell it natural gas, while we have surpluses that we  do not know what to do with. If we do not sell, these surpluses  will be wasted."    Within the framework of changing Egypt's policy toward  Israel  and moving from a "cold peace" to a "full peace," Mubarak met  with Egyptian newspaper editors several days ago in order to  explain the shift in Egypt's position. This meeting led to two  editorials -- published simultaneously in AL-AHRAM and  AL-'AKHBAR, Cairo's official newspapers -- about the "new  honeymoon."    It has been learned that Egypt is preparing to open an  Egyptian academic center in Israel and an AL-AHRAM office in Tel  Aviv.</p>

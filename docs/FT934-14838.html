			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Marubeni to write off Y23bn in loans MARUBENI, a leading Japanese trading house, will liquidate part of its securities investment made during the late 1980s, writing off some Y23bn (Dollars 217m) in extraordinary loans. Many Japanese companies poured money into the stock market during the economic 'bubble' of the late 1980s through tokkin, or specified money trusts. However, most companies suffered heavy losses due to the plunge in Japanese share prices in 1990. The move comes amid increasing fears that Tokyo share prices will slip again in the next few months. Sumitomo Corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation, leading trading houses, recently wrote off investment losses incurred by financial subsidiaries. Such affiliates were set up as 'profit centres', and to act as a banker for other subsidiaries, borrowing from banks and raising money on capital markets, and passing on savings to smaller members of the group.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Ex-BCCI staff sued by Abu Dhabi The government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, will today launch civil action against 13 former executives in the bank for up to Dollars 9bn, Andrew Jack writes. The proceedings, which will be given a preliminary hearing in the Abu Dhabi courts on Christmas Day, follow the commencement of criminal action against executives including Mr Hasan Abedi, founder of the bank now living in Pakistan, Mr Swaleh Naqvi, chief operating officer, Mr Hassan Kazmi, general manager of ICI in the Caymans, and Mr Ziauddin Akbar, who was recently jailed in London. The action alleges that more than Dollars 2.2bn in 'portfolio' funds provided by Sheikh Zayed and Crown Prince Khalifa was channelled into ICIC, controlled by BCCI in the Caymans, and used to prop up fictitious and non-performing loans and operating losses. The balance of the funds in the action includes money invested and shares bought in BCCI by Adia, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. Mr David Sandy, a partner with Simmons &amp; Simmons, the lawyer hired by Abu Dhabi, said a case had also been prepared to bring action against the executives and the BCCI companies in the English courts, which could threaten recoveries from the banks hundreds of thousands of other creditors around the world.</p>

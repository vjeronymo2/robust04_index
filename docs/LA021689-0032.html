			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LATE TAKEOFFS BANNED OVER TOPANGA AND CALABASAS  </P> <P> Residents of Topanga Canyon and Calabasas have won a partial victory in a  five-year campaign to keep noisy jets taking off from Los Angeles International  Airport from flying over their communities.  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that it has halted  late-night flights over the two communities by airliners heading from LAX to  Northern California.  </P> <P> Jetliner pilots will be prohibited from flying over the area between 9 p.m. and  midnight, said FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell. There are no commuter flights  between midnight and 6 a.m.  </P> <P> After 9 p.m., planes taking off from LAX are being required to fly farther west  over the Pacific Ocean to climb in altitude before turning north.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dozens of Aircraft  </P> <P> As many as 70 jetliners a day have been flying over Topanga and Calabasas on a  takeoff path known as "Gorman Five."  </P> <P> The new procedures went into effect over the weekend, O'Donnell said.  </P> <P> The change in takeoffs represents the FAA's first acknowledgment that jet noise  is a problem for residents of the two communities at the southwestern edge of  the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Last year, FAA officials brushed aside complaints by comparing jet noise over  the area with the sound of birds, dogs, cars and wind.  </P> <P> At the same time, the FAA removed an LAX administrator assigned to investigate  noise complaints who had criticized an FAA report that concluded that "there is  no appreciable difference between the aircraft noise and ambient noise for the  area."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Report Conclusions  </P> <P> The report stated that "ambient noise (bird/dogs/cars/wind)" registered at 65  to 80 decibels. Departing jets peaked in the 50- to 65-decibel range, the  report said.  </P> <P> That prompted angry community leaders to seek help from Rep. Anthony C.  Beilenson (D-Tarzana), who called for a formal FAA investigation into the  dispute.  </P> <P> Barry Glaser, president of the Topanga Town Council and one of the most  persistent critics of the over-the-canyon takeoffs, credited Beilenson's  intervention with prompting the ban.  </P> <P> "It's fantastic, just wonderful. We're already noticing a difference," Glaser  said. "We understand the airlines don't like it and it was difficult to do, but  we feel it's a good first step. Congressman Beilenson has taken a good, strong  position."  </P> <P> The takeoff change was announced by Jeffrey Thorstenson, manager of the FAA's  air space and procedures branch.  </P> <P> He declined further comment Wednesday, however, and O'Donnell said he did not  know how many nighttime flights were affected.  </P> <P> O'Donnell said he did not know if it is possible to route other Gorman Five  takeoffs farther west to avoid Topanga and Calabasas.  </P> <P> "If we can safely reroute traffic without impeding safety, we most certainly  would do that," O'Donnell said. "Noise abatement is an important issue with the  FAA. Until further notice, they will be directed to a Ventura departure."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hope Change Is Permanent  </P> <P> Opponents of the noise said Wednesday that they hope the change is permanent.  </P> <P> Virginia Hatfield, a field representative for Beilenson, said her office in  December appealed to FAA officials in Washington for a 60-day test period to  study the noise situation.  </P> <P> She said her office has not received official notification from the FAA of the  takeoff ban.  </P> <P> But blissful nighttime quiet the past few days has been notification enough for  such homeowners as Margaret Rawls of Calabasas.  </P> <P> "We can sleep now. It's a definite improvement," said Rawls, who has fought the  jet noise since 1984.  </P> <P> "There weren't that many jets flying over late at night. But those that did  were enough to wake you up."  </P></p>

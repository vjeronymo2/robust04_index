It devotes pages 1-4 and 7 to lengthy stories of demonstrations  and rallies denouncing the Hebron incident, citing speeches by  Socialist Labor Party [SLP] leader Ibrahim Shukri and others.  Speakers assail Israelis and Americans, denounce the United  Nations, call for jihad, and urge severing ties with Israel,  expelling the Israeli ambassador in Egypt, and boycotting  Israeli goods.    An approximately 600-word report on pages 1 and 7 says that  Egyptian mosques on the night of the Koran revelation were  filled with the worshipers' "imprecations" against the murderer  Jews and their supporters; against the murderers of Muslims, the  Serbs and Croats; and against "oppressive rulers who failed to  support the Muslims or who are involved in the killing of  Muslims."    The report adds that the largest gathering took place in  'Amr  Bin-al-'Ass Mosque, which was packed with over 3,000 worshipers  who repeated Koran reader Shaykh Muhammad Jibril's prayers that  God might destroy and eliminate the Jews, shake the earth under  the Serbs and Croats, and support the mujahidin in Palestine and  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Angry slogans of "No God but God," "The  Jews are the enemies of God," "Muhammad's army will return," and  "Jihad is our course and dying in the cause of God is our wish"  were chanted after the prayers. The worshipers urged the rulers  to expel the Zionist ambassador from Cairo, recall the Egyptian  ambassador from Tel Aviv, and to stop the "criminal" acts of  normalization with Israel and the "alleged" peace process.    In an approximately 300-word report on page 1, Mahmud Bakri  says trade unions, nationalist forces, and Egyptian parties in  Dumyat held a huge conference, denouncing the "Zionist massacre  of our fellow worshipers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron."  The report says the conference affirmed that the Arabs' and  Muslims' right will not be recovered as long as we continue  neglecting our rights, disregarding God's shari'ah, and silent  about "those impotent, treacherous rulers." The conference  called for opening the door to jihad for the Muslim youths to  enable them to join their brother mujahidin in Palestine and in  all Islamic countries. At the end of the conference, the report  says, the youths of Dumyat burned the Israeli flag amid slogans  calling for jihad and revenge against "those killers."    An approximately 500-word report by Nasir Faruq on pages 1  and 7 says a wave of anger prevailed after the Egyptian students  began their "blessed uprising" in protest against the Zionist  massacre in al-Ibrahimi Mosque. After prayers, worshipers in  northern Cairo emerged chanting slogans against "the enemies of  Islam, the Americans and Jews, and demanding revenge against the  Zionist enemies of God." The report provides detailed accounts  of similar protests in other places. The SLP organized a mass  rally at the party headquarters in Tanta to denounce the  massacre. University students and lawyers also staged  demonstrations, calling for severing ties with Israel and  staging jihad against the Zionist enemy.    Another 320-word report on pages 1 and 7 indicates that the  General Assembly of the Engineers Union urged the Egyptian  Government to close the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, recall the  Egyptian ambassador from Tel Aviv, and halt all forms of  dealings with the Zionist enemy. It also called on Arab  governments to withdraw the delegations taking part in the "lie"  of the peace talks, provide assistance to the Palestinian  intifadah, and launch jihad to "liberate Palestine."    An approximately 450-word report by Layla 'Abd-al-Hamid on  pages 1 and 7 says the SLP's Women's Secretariat organized a  seminar in response to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The  seminar called for severing relations with Israel, expelling the  Israeli ambassador from Egypt, reviving the common Arab market,  halting talks with Israel, and lifting the blockade against the  Iraqi people. A speaker, Asmahan Shukri, noted the frightening  Arab and Islamic divisions and the United States' "domination"  of the Islamic world. She says: "The United States is directly  responsible for killing and displacing the Muslims in Bosnia,  Iraq, Somalia, India, and Kashmir."    In an approximately 250-word report on pages 1 and 7 on the  state authorities' "campaign of arrests" against SLP members in  which 26 members have been arrested to far, the paper says the  Interior Ministry escalated its campaign and arrested four  others. They include Muhammad Muhammad al-Sunbati and his wife,  who, the paper says, was arrested on charges of teaching the  town's children the Koran, starting a Koran school,  disseminating ideas of extremism among the children in  preparation for overthrowing the regime. The report also says  that Mrs. Mazaj 'Abd-al-'Aziz, the wife of Muhammad al-Sunbati,  was also accused of performing prayers, leading women in  mosques, and preaching to them. The report adds that only Mrs.  Mazaj has been released but that the other four party members  remain in detention.  <H5>  BARUKH GOLDSTEIN IS ALIVE </H5>   An approximately 140-word report on page one of AL-SHA'B's  11  March issue by Mahmud Babri claims that Barukh Goldstein, the  Israeli who killed worshipers in a Hebron mosque, is still alive.    The author of the report says: "Important information  obtained by AL-SHA'B affirm that Barukh Goldstein, murderer of  the worshipers in the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque, is still alive  and that he has been transferred to a safe Zionist settlement in  the wake of the heinous carnage." The information, the report  says, indicated that the buried body belonged to another Jewish  settler who was killed near the site of the massacre. The  report adds: "The information revealed the details of the  Zionist plan to carry out the massacre, which was directly  supervised by Zionist Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Israeli  Army Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq."    The author says that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was  carried out as a substitute for another massacre designed to be  carried out in al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem during the 'Id  al-Fitr prayers, planned by Israeli leaders and a Jewish woman  settler, Theresa, the mastermind of the massacre. The report  indicates that seven Zionists who are members of the Kakh  Movement participated in the massacre.   <H5>    LAWYERS ASSOCIATION HOLDS CONFERENCE </H5>   An approximately 600-word report on pages 1 and 7 says that  the Lawyers Association's Egyptian committee in support of the  Palestinian people's jihad held a conference in protest against  the Hebron massacre, in which many intellectuals, preachers, and  "nationalist symbols" took part. Excited young men chanted  Islamic slogans denouncing the massacre and the peace talks and  demanding the launching of jihad to "liberate Palestine." The  conference decided to send protest memoranda to all ambassadors  in Egypt and to ask Arab rulers to hold an urgent summit and  take firm resolutions against Israel.    In his speech, Mustafa Mashhur, Muslim Brotherhood's deputy  general guide, said the Jews are the origin of terrorism, which  began "when the Jews killed the prophets," and that the Jews  harbor "deep hatred for Islam and Muslims." He called for  raising young men on the spirit of jihad and keeping up this  spirit in the "souls of the youths of Islamic awakening."    An Islamic preacher, Wajdi Ghunaym, charged that the Jews  were behind the explosions that took place in Egypt and that  they spread drugs and AIDS "in our country." He said the only  Islamic solution for the Palestinian cause is jihad and urged  police officers and men to point their guns at the Jews, not at  the demonstrators who protested the massacre.    Lawyer Ahmad Rabi' al-Ghazali delivered a speech on behalf  of  the young lawyers, in which he stressed that "the Islamic creed  is the sound and established basis which we should not abandon  in confronting the Jews and that it is the spiritual weapon that  must not be surrendered." He called for unity among all the  nation's Muslims and Christians to "fight the Jews who are the  enemies of all religions and races."    Another Islamic preacher, Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi, said the  Islamic soil is fertile and good to produce young men able to  lead their nation. He called for overcoming differences among  Islamic factions and said: "Everyone must know that the enemies  of Islam, led by the Jews, are working day and night to hit us."    The committee moderator Ahmad Sayf-al-Islam Hasan al-Banna  said the Hebron massacre is a message for the Muslims to wake up  and revert to Islam because "their nations are in danger."  <H5>  WRITER DENOUNCES HEBRON KILLINGS </H5>   An approximately 500-word article by Mahmud Fayid on page 2  denounces the Hebron killings and calls for ending the  negotiations. The writer says this was not the first crime, nor  will it be the last because both "the Bible and the Koran say  that the Jews are the killers of prophets and are traitors." He  adds that "they" are holding negotiations not to return the  usurped rights but are negotiating with us to perpetuate the  occupation. He notes that the remedy lies in God's shari'ah in  raising the nation on jihad against the enemy and that jihad, as  in the case of fasting, is a duty and both commandments urge the  Muslim not to limit his concern and interest to worldly pleasure  but to aspire to the "bliss of the world hereafter." At one  point he says: This crime should not drive us to despair. We  must realize that it is an enlightenment from God for us to be  aware of the nature of the Jews and their treachery so that we  may rectify our situation, stop being careless, and stop living  in illusions."  <H5>  SLP LEADER SHUKRI URGES ARAB, ISLAMIC UNITY </H5>   On page 4, AL-SHA'B files an approximately 850-word report  on  SLP leader Ibrahim Shukri's speeches in Asyut and al-Minya  Governorates about the Hebron killings and other topics.    Denouncing the Hebron incident, Shukri addresses those who  are in line with the United States and Israel, asking them:  "What do you say today about the United States, which prevents  the Security Council from passing a resolution to protect the  unarmed Palestinians from the evils of the Jewish occupier?" He  says: "What do you say about the United States' silence over all  forms of oppression, persecution, and horrors and liquidation  suffered by the Palestinian people? O Gulf Arabs, what kind of  normalization and peace are you seeking now that you have given  the control over your economic and political affairs to the U.S.  hegemony?"    At one point, he says that the United States and Zionism  have  rearranged their priorities after the collapse of communism and  that the Arab and Islamic nations topped their "list of  hostility." He calls for rebuilding the Arab and Islamic fold  to protect the nation's interests in accordance with "God's  injunction."  <H5>  SLP OFFICIALS DEPLORE MUSLIMS' SITUATION </H5>   Page 4 features an approximately 750-word report on an SLP  seminar in which participants discuss the Muslims' "weak"  situation, note "rulers' inaction," and demand the expulsion of  the Israeli ambassador. SLP official 'Abd-al-Hamid Barakat says  the Islamic nation has become "an easy prey for its enemies who  kill the nation's sons, rape its women, and violate their rights  amid the silence of everyone, "the silence of fear and  cowardice."    Preacher Mustafa Hammad, SLP branch member in al-Minya  Governorate, calls for caution against whom he describes  "Zionist elements" in Egypt who are fighting against God's  religion and urges adherence to the teachings of religion.    Another speaker, Islamic preacher 'Abdallah al-Samawi says  the young men spend their time watching television that perverts  them and destroys religion and morals. He notes: "Thus, some  of the criminal Egyptian media contribute to achieving the aims  of the Jews, who regard the neighboring nations as donkeys to be  ridden by God's chosen people." Our misled youths spend hours  watching television, which destroys religion and morals. The  television could have been a teacher and enlightener but it is  controlled by people who use it to wreck and destroy our youths."  <H5>  WRITER CRITICIZES MUBARAK'S SPEECH ON MUSLIMS </H5>   In an approximately 2,900-word article on page 5 of  AL-SHA'B's 11 March edition, writer 'Adil Husayn criticizes  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' recent book. After  reviewing the book, the writer criticizes President Mubarak's  recent speech which, in his view, focused on the weak points of  the Muslims. The writer says that the speech gave the  impression that all evils in today's world emanate from the  Muslims. Husayn adds that Islam is a religion of moderation and  Islamic civilization has taught all races of the earth the  meaning of tolerance but that tolerance for Muslims does not  mean surrender and ignorance.</p>

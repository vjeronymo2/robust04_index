Accordingly, the government will  reduce state subsidies for rice, barley, beans, corn, and rapes  -- its prices have been maintained by the government by  purchasing these items at a set price and making up for the  price difference -- by 22.8 billion won a year.    The Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishery said on 7  February that it will reduce tariffs and tariff equivalences on  14 basic farm products, excluding rice, and on 1,312 farm  products by an average 24 percent by 2004. Accordingly, tariff  equivalences on barley, corn, beans, potatoes, sweet potatoes,  red beans, green peas, and red ginseng will be reduced by 10  percent over 10 years.</p>

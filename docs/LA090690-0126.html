They are prehistoric inhabitants, Chinese, Spaniards, Chumash Indians and  Caucasians.  </P> <P> Along with tours and slide presentations, exercises in rebuilding broken  pottery will be conducted.  </P> <P> "Two hands-on artifacts tables will be set up for folks to examine, also,"  Robinson said.  </P> <P> The open house will be held noon to 4 p.m. and there is no charge.

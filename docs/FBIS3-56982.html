A final decision to hold such talks was  taken by the Japanese government on Saturday, the newspaper  SEKAI NIPPO reported on Sunday.    Representatives of the command of the Russian Armed Forces  are to arrive in Tokyo to attend a two-day seminar for the  military and experts from Russia, the United States, and Japan  on security in the northern Pacific. The seminar opens on  February 1. Immediately after the seminar, the two sides will  hold talks.    The Russian side intends to suggest setting about taking  measures to build confidence between the two countries in the  military field. In particular, Moscow will suggest implementing  a programme for exchanges of servicemen and mutual friendship  visits of the navy ships of the two countries.    The Japanese military, according to the newspaper, are  planning to urge Moscow to demilitarise the South Kurils as soon  as possible and provide Tokyo with full information concerning  the potential of the armed forces and defence construction in  Russia's Far East.</p>

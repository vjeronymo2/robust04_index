			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HEART HEALTH PROJECT PLAYS IN PAWTUCKET;  </P> <P> FITNESS: A 10-YEAR EXPERIMENT IN CHANGING RESIDENTS' LIFESTYLES IS SPREADING  THE WORD THAT A SMOKE-FREE, LOW-FAT, ACTIVE LIFE CAN BE PAINLESS.  </P> <P> Regular customers at the Cup 'N Saucer can order fried clams, but they may get  a turkey sandwich.  </P> <P> Wander in off the street, order a burger and fries, and owner Nick Georgitis  may suggest a boiled potato with lemon instead.  </P> <P> "I tell them right off -- I like to see these people have something good," he  said.  </P> <P> Georgitis is one of the more enthusiastic followers of the Pawtucket Heart  Health Program, a 10-year project to teach this working-class city of 72,000  residents better health habits.  </P> <P> The program is built on the belief that people with poor health habits learned  them in society, and can unlearn them, said Thomas Lasater, director of the  project and an associate professor of health at Brown University.  </P> <P> The project started in 1981 with a $20-million grant from the National  Institute of Health. Today, restaurants, grocery stores, schools, churches,  civic centers, businesses and 4,000 volunteers help spread the word that a  smoke-free, low-fat, active life can be painless.  </P> <P> One sausage maker worked with the program to develop a Portuguese sausage with  lower fat, Lasater said.  </P> <P> Former couch potatoes who joined a free fitness class designed especially for  non-exercisers continued when it was over, renting their own space, said Joan  Lovell, the program's marketing director.  </P> <P> Richard Carleton, principal investigator of the program and physician-in-chief  at Memorial Hospital, believes the program can work nationally -- good news for  U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, who recently announced  goals for improving Americans' health over the next decade.  </P> <P> "Healthy People 2000" identifies nearly 300 specific health objectives,  including several covered in the Pawtucket plan.  </P> <P> Statistics are not yet available for the Pawtucket program, Carleton said.  </P> <P> "We know that we have had huge numbers of people participate, that we  influenced their behavior," he said. "What we don't know is, will it reduce the  number of heart attacks?"  </P> <P> A similar undertaking in Stanford used preliminary data to estimate that the  risk of heart disease was reduced by 20 percent, he said.  </P> <P> The program works when health professionals, the food industry, government  agencies and educational resources act together, he said. Gregg's restaurant,  for example, marks menu items that meet the program's standards with a red  heart.  </P> <P> Pawtucket's guidelines are more restrictive than those of the American Medical  Assn.  </P> <P> "All along we kept getting calls from our customers that they wanted us to  expand on it and couldn't we have more items," said Bob Bacon, vice president  of Gregg's Restaurant Inc. "We decided that we would design a complete menu  from appetizers to desserts."  </P> <P> The menu was introduced last month at all three Gregg's restaurants in Rhode  Island and the response has been excellent, he said.  </P> <P> The Pawtucket Heart Health Program sampled the new creations, and helped the  restaurant determine the sodium, fat and calorie content, Bacon said.  </P> <P> "One of the things we've been learning is how it can be mutually beneficial for  everyone," said Lasater. "It's a win-win situation."  </P> <P> New York recently set up a program in eight communities based on the Pawtucket  model. People from more than two dozen countries have visited Pawtucket to  study the program, Carleton said.  </P></p>

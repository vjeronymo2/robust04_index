			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Competition backed for efficiency COMPETITION in all sectors of the economy is 'the spur to increased efficiency and innovation', Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, told an audience in London yesterday. His speech was a reaffirmation by the government of its commitment to competition as the best weapon against industrial decline. Speaking to the European Policy Forum, a rightwing think tank, Mr Hamilton said the government would continue with the policy set out in 1984. He was speaking on the day after Mr Heseltine, the Trade and Industry Secretary, apparently signalled a change of policy by waving through British Airways' takeover of Dan-Air. The takeover was allowed in spite of concerns about a reduction in competition. When Mr Michael Heseltine took over the Department of Trade and Industry after the general election in April, he was widely expected to pursue an industrial strategy rather than adhere to the strict competition policy that dominated the years of the Thatcher government. In dealing with mergers in particular, it was thought that Mr Heseltine might move away from the so-called 'Tebbit doctrine' of referring mergers to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for investigation mainly on competition grounds. Mr Hamilton denied that merger policy prevented UK companies becoming big enough to compete internationally. In general, the more competitors there were in a market, the fewer competition concerns there would be. That, though, he said was not to say that there could not be adequate competition where one company had a very significant share of the market. Mr Hamilton went on to stress the need for an even-handed approach to competition policy in the European Community. He said that when the EC merger regulation came up for review next year the government would want to test any proposals for widening its scope against the UK's original objectives for the regulation.</p>

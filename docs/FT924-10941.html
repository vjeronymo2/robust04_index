			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Zenith Electronics cuts payroll by 2,600 ZENITH ELECTRONICS yesterday reported a third-quarter loss of Dollars 41.8m and said it would lay off 2,600 employees, or 15 per cent of its US workforce. The Chicago-based manufacturer also said it would cut operations and jobs at its television plant in Mexico as part of its restructuring. In light of the third-quarter loss, the company said it was reconsidering a proposed public offering of 8m shares of common stock, announced in August. The third-quarter loss was equal to Dollars 1.42 a share and compared with a deficit of Dollars 1.5m, or 5 cents, the third quarter last year. The third-quarter results include a special Dollars 23m charge for severance and restructuring costs, and a Dollars 2m tax credit. Third-quarter sales fell to Dollars 313m, from Dollars 344m in the same 1991 quarter. The company said its slow response to industry price cuts for colour TVs and start-up costs at its Mexican assembly plants depressed third-quarter margins. For the first nine months, Zenith reported a loss of Dollars 85.6m, or Dollars 2.92 a share, on sales of Dollars 858m. That compares with a loss of Dollars 52.1m, or Dollars 1.82, on sales of Dollars 923m in the same 1991 period.</p>

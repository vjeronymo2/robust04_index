			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD WEATHER AIDING AQUEDUCT REPAIRS  </P> <P> Another sunny day aided heavy equipment crews as they worked round-the-clock  Sunday to clear tons of mud and debris that last week's thunderstorms and flash  floods dumped into a two-mile stretch of the Los Angeles Aqueduct near Olancha,  180 miles north of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "We are on schedule for our two-week completion date. Things are progressing as  we had expected," said Department of Water and Power spokesman Ed Freudenberg.  </P> <P> Officials expect the aqueduct, which provides 75% of Los Angeles' water supply,  to be back in operation by Aug. 25 or 26.  </P> <P> Freudenberg said repairs will begin early this week on 80 concrete slabs, each  10-by-13-feet and four-inches thick, that line the aqueduct. A storm last  Tuesday piled mud and debris into the big ditch, and a second storm Thursday  buckled about 1,000 feet of the concrete lining.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cautious Use of Water  </P> <P> Freudenberg renewed his request Sunday for consumers "to be mindful of how they  use water," while stressing that no shortages will result from the interrupted  aqueduct supply.  </P> <P> During the two-week repairs, water is being drawn from two reservoirs south of  the damaged area -- Haiwee about five miles from the blockage, and Bouquet near  Saugus. The Bouquet Reservoir was nearly full in anticipation of a regular  maintenance shutdown of the aqueduct planned in September, Freudenberg said.  </P> <P> The city is also purchasing 350 million gallons of water a day from the  Metropolitan Water District, about 250 million gallons more than normal at this  time, he said.  </P> <P> Whether the department proceeds with the planned shutdown of the aqueduct for  needed routine repairs in September may depend on how much of the water stored  for that project must be used now, Freudenberg said.  </P></p>

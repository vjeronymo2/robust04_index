			<p>BFN     [Text] Twenty-three-year-old 'Awwad Hasan Tabbash was  killed today by soldiers' gunfire in the al-Jalazun refugee camp  near Ramallah. Local Arabs told our correspondent Moti Amir  that soldiers opened fire at stonethrowers who attacked Israeli  cars driving on the Ramallah-Nabulus road. According to them,  the youngster was hit by the fire and died at the Ramallah  hospital. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is looking into the  circumstances of the incident.    A youngster from the Dayr al-Balah refugee camp in the Gaza  Strip was arrested near the industrial zone at the Erez  checkpoint. He was carrying a knife and a Koran. An initial  check revealed that he had been on his way to stab soldiers  stationed at the checkpoint.    At noon today, IDF troops demolished a building in which  armed Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorists were  believed to be barricaded. The house was surrounded early this  morning, and the IDF imposed a curfew on Ramallah. The security  forces tried for a long time to make the terrorists surrender.  In the last few hours, Fatah members phoned Tunis to inform  Yasir 'Arafat that the IDF had laid siege to the house of Dr.  al-Wahidi, a Fatah member and a personal acquaintance of  'Arafat. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that IDF  bulldozers demolished the house after all its inhabitants were  taken out and after the terrorists were urged several times to  come out and surrender. Our correspondent points out that Dr.  al-Wahidi is the father of the terrorist Avir al-Wahidi. She  was arrested about a year ago for taking part in the murder of  Israelis.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BON JOVI DRAWS SMALL N.Z. CROWD  </P> <P> American rock band Bon Jovi played to the smallest crowd in years at the  Western Springs Stadium Saturday, just a week after Irish band U2 wowed a total  of 80,000 fans in two shows.  </P> <P> Promoters blamed the poor turnout on the juxtaposition of the two acts and the  $25.87 tickets -- an amount beyond the reach of most of Bon Jovi's youthful  fans.  </P> <P> "I hear there was an Irish band here last week that played to 60,000 people.  Well, we're going to make just as much noise with 15,000," lead singer Jon Bon  Jovi told the audience.  </P></p>

The visit, according to these  sources, was more than just a mediation mission to resolve the  Yemeni crisis which has reached a difficult stage.    The sources, who met Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  last week, told AKHIR KHABAR that the Yemeni leadership asked  al-Sharif Zayd to help it reorganize the Yemeni Armed Forces  which appear to be gradually affected by the ongoing tribal and  party conflict in Yemen.    Al-Sharif Zayd will supervise the drafting of a plan to  reorganize the Yemeni Armed Forces which are facing technical  problems in terms of organization, training, general  mobilization, and combat capabilities.    Our sources added that al-Sharif Zayd was accompanied by a  number of specialists who reviewed the plan with the Yemeni  leadership. The sources added that the Yemeni president  officially asked the Jordanian leadership to prepare such a  plan. The Jordanian leadership held contacts with all parties  to find common grounds that would defuse the crisis before it  explodes.    Last week, the two parties to the Yemeni dispute agreed to  neutralize the Armed Forces and to avoid the provocations that  would involve them in the conflict.    Yemeni diplomatic sources in Amman told AKHIR KHABAR that  the  Yemeni leadership explained to mediators that it wants to remove  the roots of division which threaten the Yemeni Army ranks  following the emergence of signs of division. The sources  added: The Yemeni leadership is unanimous on the need to carry  out a comprehensive national military orientation plan and to  busy the Armed Forces with military training to keep them away  from tension points that would affect them as a result of the  tribal conflict.    The sources linked the recent Jordanian-Yemeni contacts with  the new trends produced by military incidents and tension. The  sources said: The Jordanian assistance in this regard will come  within the framework of the vital and important role played by  the Jordanian leadership which enjoys the confidence of all  parties in the conflict.</p>

The constitutional chamber of the  Supreme Court of Togo, which met on 25 March, invalidated the  election on 6 February of Bemba Bahissa, the candidate of the  Togolese Union for Democracy. The reason given by the Supreme  Court is that his alternate, Tiamoko Seydou, did not meet the  conditions concerning residence in Togo as envisaged by the  electoral code. The protest was filed by (Assabou Gyabite),  candidate of the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT]. According  to the electoral code, a new election must be held within one  month at the latest. In the same judgement, the Supreme Court  rejected other demands for annulment -- a total of 20 -- which  were made by the RPT, the Union for Labor and Justice, the Union  for Renewal and Development Party, and the Togolese Democratic  Party following the first round of the legislative elections.    The Supreme Court will also have to deliberate the RPT's  contesting of the results of the second round of the legislative  elections in seven constituencies. The probable deadline for  the verdict is 1 April.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. 'LECTURES' NOT NECESSARY, GORBACHEV SAYS  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, baring his frustration at U.S. reaction  to the Lithuania crisis, said Thursday that Americans should stop giving him  "lectures" that could imperil achievements in superpower relations made since  he came to power.  </P> <P> In talks with visiting Democratic senators, Gorbachev tried to shift the focus  of U.S.-Soviet relations away from their current fixation on the Kremlin's  treatment of the breakaway Baltic republic. He stressed that he is determined  to initial the framework for an accord to halve strategic nuclear arsenals at  his summit meeting with President Bush in Washington, scheduled to begin May  30.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said he is ready to make concessions to close a deal on the draft of  a strategic arms pact by then, but he added that he expects the President also  to compromise.  </P> <P> The future of Lithuania overshadowed three days of talks held in Washington  last week between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign  Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to lay groundwork for the summit, the second  between Bush and Gorbachev.  </P> <P> The Kremlin has been at odds with the republic since it unilaterally declared  independence a month ago, a decision that Gorbachev and the Soviet Congress of  People's Deputies have said is illegal and invalid.  </P> <P> After his meetings with Shevardnadze, Baker told reporters he made clear that a  Soviet military crackdown in Lithuania would jeopardize the entire gamut of  improved superpower relations.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell said his seven-member  delegation told Gorbachev much the same thing, face to face.  </P> <P> "A reversal would undoubtedly occur should the Soviet Union resort to force,"  the Maine Democrat told a news conference after the meeting with Gorbachev,  which lasted more than two hours. "Such action would, I advised President  Gorbachev, have grave consequences for relations between our two countries."  </P> <P> In remarks reported by the official Tass news agency, Gorbachev again said he  did not wish to use force to impose the central government's will on Lithuania,  but he showed obvious pique at the scope the question has acquired in the  superpower relationship.  </P> <P> "We do not need to be convinced that political methods are better," Gorbachev  told Mitchell's group. "Not everything depends on us, however. And senators,  like Americans in general, should realize this and avoid giving lectures.  </P> <P> "They might prompt resentment in our society, affecting Soviet-American  relationships."  </P> <P> The Baker-Shevardnadze talks made little apparent headway in narrowing  disagreements in the strategic arms treaty negotiations. Baker said the  superpowers had not yet "come to closure" on air- and sea-launched cruise  missiles, or on how to distinguish between missiles with nuclear warheads,  which would fall under the treaty, and those carrying high-explosive charges,  which would not.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said he had personally intervened to narrow the gap, but said he also  expects the Americans to do their part so that an agreement can take shape by  the time Baker is next scheduled to visit Moscow, which is two weeks before the  summit starts.  </P> <P> "I gave instructions to speed up work," the Soviet president said. "We shall  present our considerations by James Baker's visit in May. We hope that he will  not come with empty hands either."  </P> <P> Gorbachev noted that he expects Bush to "meet him halfway." Mitchell said that  in separate talks, the senators were told by Shevardnadze that Moscow wants a  finalized strategic arms treaty signed by the end of the year.  </P> <P> Including the majority leader, the visiting Senate Democratic delegation  consisted of Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota,  Wyche Fowler Jr. of Georgia, John Glenn of Ohio, Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland  and Jim Sasser of Tennessee.  </P> <P> The inhabitants of the three Baltic republics -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia  -- are striving at different cadences to restore the independence their  homelands enjoyed between the world wars. Consigned to the Kremlin's orbit by a  secret 1939 Soviet-Nazi agreement, they were annexed by the Soviet Union the  following year.  </P> <P> In Lithuania's capital of Vilnius, the prime ministers of the three republics  signed a "Baltic Common Market Agreement" on Thursday pledging mutual economic  and political assistance. It foresees the elimination of trade barriers between  the republics by 1992, mutually convertible currencies and an "open border"  policy.  </P> <P> Lithuania's prime minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene, said the pact shows  pan-Baltic support for her beleaguered government and presages a disengagement  of the three republics' economies from the vast state-run bureaucracy now run  from Moscow.  </P> <P> "The most important aspect of the treaty is political and moral support,"  Prunskiene told reporters in Vilnius. "Economic cooperation obviously has  economic aspects. The chief aim of this treaty is to remove the Soviet paws  from our economy."  </P> <P> Also Thursday, a mass student rally took place in the capital to support the  independence declaration, according to Tass, the official Soviet news agency.  It gave no details.  </P> <P> In another Baltic refusal to submit to policies made in Moscow, Estonia's  Parliament voted 71 to 3 to declare conscription for the Soviet army illegal in  the republic and to abolish criminal penalties for draft-dodging.  </P> <P> The Estonian lawmakers called for talks with the Soviet Defense Ministry to  discuss alternative civilian forms of service, and also asked Gorbachev to  begin negotiations immediately "on the restoration of independence."  </P> <P> There was no immediate Kremlin reaction to the Wednesday night vote by the  Estonian Supreme Soviet, but the official news agency Tass, in its report on  the session, complained that the decision "prods hundreds of youths to violate  the Soviet law on universal military service."  </P> <P> First Deputy Defense Minister Konstantin Kochetov had visited Tallinn,  Estonia's capital, on Saturday to insist that the spring call-up for the armed  forces proceed as scheduled.  </P> <P> If Lithuania's experience is a guide, the Estonian vote may provoke a tough  response from Moscow. Lithuanian lawmakers passed a similar measure, but the  Kremlin rejected it as illegal. Teams of Soviet soldiers were then sent into  two mental hospitals to grab deserters taking refuge there.  </P> <P> Free-lance journalist Esther Schrader contributed to this report from Vilnius.  </P></p>

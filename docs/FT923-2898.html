			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weather hits UK cereal harvest BAD WEATHER last month has helped reduce this year's total UK cereals harvest to 21.5m tonnes, worth about Pounds 3.2bn to the farming community, according to two leading grain traders. This compares with 22.7m tonnes in 1991. Most badly hit has been the wheat harvest. Dalgety Agriculture, the biggest UK grain trader, estimates 1992 wheat production at 13.3m tonnes - 'a far cry from the 15m tonnes plus many were predicting two months ago,' said Mr Andrew Barnard, arable crop marketing manager. Allied Grain, part of Associated British Foods, estimates the UK wheat harvest at 13.4m tonnes. Mr Peter Crisford, an Allied director, said last week that the wheat harvest in southern England was 75 per cent complete 'with the balance now in serious risk of major deterioration or total crop loss'. In contrast, barley was the crop of the year, according to Mr Crisford. Both Allied and Dalgety put the barley harvest, mainly gathered before the bad weather, at 7.6m tonnes. Dalgety estimates UK barley demand for 1992-93 at 5.88m tonnes, but believes that there are good export prospects for the surplus 1.72m tonnes 'in view of the excellent quality'. Wheat demand is put at 9.17m tonnes, leaving 4.14m tonnes for export or intervention. 'The poorer quality available presents us with a major challenge in locating overseas customers,' said Mr Barnard.</p>

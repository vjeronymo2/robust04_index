			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Observer: Hauled down The backlash following neo-Nazi violence against foreigners in Germany has now brought down one of the heads of the country's aerospace industry - and all because he flew the wrong flag in his garden. He is Karl Dersch, abrasive president of the industry's federation BDLI as well as on the board of the Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary of mighty Daimler-Benz, and one of Bonn's great defenders of the European fighter. Amid rebounding repugnance for all tokens of nationalism, his Daimler bosses were appalled by press reports that the flag flying in front of his house was the Reichskriegsflagge, a pre-1918 standard bearing an imperial eagle and the iron cross. Hence Deutsche Aerospace's blunt announcement that he'd be resigning because, according to the company's chief, Jurgen Schrempp, that was the only way to save Daimler-Benz's interests from further damage. Although the Reichs-kriegsflagge is now the emblem of skinhead gangs terrorising refugees and asylum seekers, the ousting might seem a bit hard on Dersch. In pre-skinhead days the flag was regarded as the one acceptable symbol of German national pride, representing the 'unspoiled' imperial navy. Even so, it is not the first corporate flap he has created. He was a prime mover behind the 'Peenemunde affair' in August, when the BDLI chose to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the flight of the first V2 rocket. He dismissed subsequent British protests as 'hysterical', but was overruled by higher authority as being insensitive. Few tears are being shed over him at Daimler-Benz headquarters . . .except the embarrassed variety.</p>

This question has been asked to  1,200 Yerevan residents by the Sociological Research Center of  the Armenian Academy of Sciences. Over 40 percent responded  that Nagorno-Karabakh has to become an independent state, 30  percent told that Karabakh must become a part of Armenia, 24.4  percent decided that Karabakh shall be included in Russia. A  little over 4 percent think that Karabakh needs to be integrated  in the Caucasus Federation.    Notably, only 0.6 percent of respondents voted for Karabakh  autonomy within Azerbaijan, and another 0.4 percent told that it  has to remain a part of Azerbaijan.

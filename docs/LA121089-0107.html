			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN;  </P> <P> PEDIMENTS, POLITICS AND PERSONALITIES  </P> <P> Just 50 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, when most  of America was still rural and raw, Greek Revival in all its formal forms  became the favored architectural style of the nation. Everyone, it seems,  wanted his house, store, church and city hall built with the ornamented columns  and pilasters, pedimented gables and heavy cornices with unadorned friezes that  distinguish the style.  </P> <P> What prompted this penchant for the classical look is the focus of Roger G.  Kennedy's Greek Revival America (Stewart Tabori &amp; Chang: $85; 464 pp.;  1-55670-094-6). The effort glistens as the gift of choice this holiday season  for those with an interest in architectural history. Attractively designed to  include about 190 full-color commissioned photographs, there also is an  annotated guide to the outstanding extant examples of the style.  </P> <P> But most engaging is Kennedy's narrative exploring how the political,  psychological, sexual and, in particular, social forces of the time prompted a  nation to embrace a particular design -- which is described by the author more  liberally as American Free Classicism -- and why it was eventually discarded,  and discredited. The result is a rare architectural history that goes beyond  simple explanations and descriptive chronologies of projects and their  architects to posit ideas.  </P> <P> Sketching architectural history also on a large canvas is Laurence G. Liu's  Chinese Architecture (Rizzoli: $75; 298 pp.; 0-8478-1082-8). The subject, of  course, demands such a canvas, given China's diverse geography, cultures and  3,000-year history. Liu responds with a broad stroke when citing the influences  of China's varied philosophies and religions, and a more precise and assured  stroke describing specific buildings. Helping are 300 color photographs,  numerous plans and maps, a comparative chronology of Chinese history, and a  glossary of Chinese terms.  </P> <P> The Art and Architecture of English Gardens by Jane Brown (Rizzoli: $85; 320  pp.; 0-8478-1089-5) celebrates four centuries of love by the British of their  gardens, be they in a royal expanse, a rambling country estate, a public park,  a London back yard, a few square feet in front of a row house or beyond a  kitchen door, or in a glass-walled conservatory.  </P> <P> In a different focus and scale is Steps &amp; Stairways by Cleo Baldon and Ib  Melchoir (Rizzoli: $45; 264 pp.; 0-8478-1075-5), which explores through history  the development of the singular design element of stairs, in all their diverse  settings, shapes, materials and surprises. Helping the climb and its  imaginative array of illustrations are photographs by Julius Shulman and a  striking book design by Dana Levy of Perpetua Press.  </P> <P> Of particular interest to California architecture buffs should be Gilbert  Stanley Underwood: His Rustic, Art Deco, and Federal Architecture by Joyce  Zaitlin, (Pangloss Press: $35; 185 pp.; 0-934710-18-X). The thin, modestly  illustrated monograph traces Underwood's maverick career, which included the  designs of the rustic Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite and, in Los Angeles, the  landmark post office and Federal Courthouse downtown, and the Wilshire Tower  building.  </P> <P> Other architecture and design offerings of note this holiday season include  Mackintosh's Masterwork (Chronicle Books: $35; 224 pp.; 0-87701-663-1), a study  of the design, detailing and furnishings of the Glasgow School of Art compiled  by the school's staff. The well-illustrated study places the school styled by  Charles Rennie Mackintosh a century ago into its proper perspective as a  seminal design, crafted within a variety of constraints to bridge the art and  architecture of the 19th Century to the 20th Century.  </P> <P> There also is the usual array of monographs this season. Among the more  engaging is that of the late Belgian architect and teacher, Henry van de Velde,  by Klaus-Jurgen Semach (Rizzoli: $50; 228 pp.; 0-8478-0858-0); the modernist  Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill by Carol Herselle Krinsky  (MIT Press: $50; 432 pp.; 0-262-11130-6), and The Architecture of Gunnar  Birkerts by Kay Kaiser (The American Institute of Architecture Press: $45; 206  pp.; 1-55835-051-9). Aided by Kaiser's insightful text, the latter illustrates  well Birkerts' sensitivity to site and client to defy categorization.  </P> <P> For those with an interest in planning, Downtown, Inc.: How America Rebuilds  Cities by Bernard J. Frieden and Lynne B. Sagalyn (MIT Press: $19.95; 375 pp.;  0-262-06128-7) offers an informed view of the politics and design involved in  the renewal of cities.  </P> <P> Touching upon urban renewal, and every other aspect of architecture and design  from personalities to planning theories, from vague theories to specific  buildings, has been the London-based Blueprint magazine. What makes the  magazine stand out among a gaggle of professional and trade publications is  that it has bite. This, happily, is very much in evidence in From Matt Black to  Memphis and Back Again (Architecture Design and Technology Press: $49.95; 238  pp.; 1-85454-250-8), a choice selection of articles from the magazine edited by  Deyan Sudjic.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the march of Post- Modernism continues, from art and architecture  into the applied arts everywhere. Very much in step is Post Modern Design by  Michael Collins and Andreas Papadakis (Rizzoli: $65; 288 pp.; 0-8478-1136-0),  which displays eye-catching examples of the style in the form of furniture,  lighting fixtures, glassware, ornaments and, of course, teapots. Explaining the  various leaps of inspiration from Post-Pop design to the various manifestations  of Post-Modernism is a welcomed, informative text. But it is the photographs  that dazzle, just as the lights on a Christmas tree.  </P></p>

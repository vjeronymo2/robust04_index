			<p>BFN     [Text] Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov has withdrawn  Russian banknotes from circulation and banned their acceptance  as payment as of 15 April. The decree he signed on Monday aims  at better money circulation and greater purchasing power of the  sum-coupon, the national currency. In the meantime, anyone,  regardless of what he or she owns, will be able to sell goods or  provide services for hard currency, provided they have cash  registers.    As of 15 April, the exchange rate of the sum-coupon to  foreign currencies will be fixed at the end of regular  republican currency auctions. So far, this rate has been  modelled on data from Russia's Central Bank.    In line with the decree, a chain of currency exchanges will  be set up across the Republic, and individuals will be allowed  to trade money by a central bank license.    All enterprises, private and state-owned alike, will have to  sell to the Central Bank 30 percent of their currency revenues,  of which 10 percent must be purchased by the Finance Ministry  for the Republic's monetary fund and 5 percent by the government  of Karakalpakia (an autonomy within Uzbekistan) and by regional  administrations for their local monetary funds.    As of 1 May, accounts with enterprises in former USSR  republics will be settled exclusively on a clearing basis or in  hard currency. Currently in Tashkent one ruble trades to 10-11  sum-coupons and one dollar to 20,000-22,000 sum-coupons.</p>

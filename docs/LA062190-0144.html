			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: LUTHER MEDICAL PICKS TATE SCOTT TO SERVE AS ITS NEW PRESIDENT  </P> <P> Luther Medical Products Inc., the Tustin-based maker of "stickless catheters"  designed to protect health care workers from AIDS, Wednesday named Tate Scott  its new president and chief operating officer.  </P> <P> Stepping down as president is company founder Ron Luther, who will remain as  chairman and chief executive officer.  </P> <P> Scott, who started with Luther in 1987 as director of marketing, was promoted  to executive vice president and elected to the board of directors last year.  </P> <P> Luther said in a prepared statement that Scott's "pivotal role in securing two  exclusive marketing contracts with Johnson &amp; Johnson/Critikon and his  success in the turnaround of our Neuro-Diagnostics division from near  insolvency to profitability speaks clearly of his abilities."  </P> <P> Three years ago Luther Medical bought Neuro-Diagnostics Inc., a financially  failing company in Garden Grove that made medical diagnostic instruments used  by neurologists. Luther said he called upon Scott, who was then Luther  Medical's marketing manager, to take charge of Neuro-Diagnostics.  </P> <P> "He reorganized the company and put together a team of technicians who  successfully developed a much improved instrument," Luther said.  </P> <P> After handing Scott responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the  company, Luther plans to spend more time developing new products and improving  investor relations. He said Luther's stock price, at about 60 cents a share,  does not reflect the potential of the company, which he predicts is about to  have its first profitable year.  </P></p>

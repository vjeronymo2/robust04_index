			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Fishermen warn they may become an endangered species: Rules to conserve stocks are being challenged in the courts A STIFF breeze is blowing across Newhaven harbour, East Sussex, and most of the port's trawlers are lying idle. Strong winds in the English Channel have put paid to another morning's fishing. It's a scene which helps to explain why fishermen are locked in bitter conflict with the government over the future of their industry. This autumn the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations will ask the High Court, through a judicial review, to block the introduction of new rules designed to conserve fish stocks. The rules, implementing an European Community-wide agreement, mean that boats over 10 metres long will be limited next year to the same number of days they spent at sea in 1991. The federation says a typical trawler spends about 180 days at sea and warn that this could be cut to 158 days under the new rules, reducing a crew member's pay of up to Pounds 15,000 by as much as Pounds 3,000. The fishermen say the unpredictability of the British weather adds to the injustice of being forced to tie up their boats for part of the year. 'A great deal of the UK fleet is controlled by the weather,' said Mr David Scott, federation president and chairman of the Newhaven fishermen's co-operative. The best fishing months in Newhaven are September to December, but if trawler crews save their quota of days until then, only to be stymied by the gales of the last couple of years, they would have to risk dangerous seas or be left with unused days and less fish. Mr Scott said: 'This question of tie-ups is the most immoral act that's ever been put upon one nation's fishermen.' The rules were designed to help reduce the UK's fishing capacity by 19 per cent by the end of 1996 in order to preserve dwindling supplies of fish. EC officials say cod is particularly hard hit, with North Sea breeding stocks at a record low of about 90,000 tonnes against what scientists warn is a sustainable level of 150,000 tonnes. Fishermen say they have no quibble with the principle of conservation. But this particular legislation has spurred them to blockade ports and organise lobbies of parliament. If the rules take effect, they will be forced to flout them to save their businesses, said Mr Scott. 'No way will they ever conform to being tied up. There will be head-on confrontation,' he added. Their main complaint is that other EC fishermen do not face such restrictions. 'We'll have UK vessels tied up and what they don't catch will be caught by the other member states, so it really won't do anything for conservation,' said Mr Scott. He was referring particularly to French and Belgian fishermen in the Channel. But EC officials point out that Dutch crews, the main catchers of sole and plaice in the southern North Sea, have for some time faced limits on the days they can spend at sea. The federation, which represents 6,000 fishermen in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands, also argues that costs such as insurance, harbour dues and boat maintenance will still have to be paid even though income may drop. Fishermen are already feeling squeezed by the 15 per cent to 30 per cent fall in the price of fish at the start of the year, when cheap imports from Russia, Iceland, Poland and Norway flooded the EC market. In tandem with its legal fight, the federation is drawing up an alternative conservation package to put to ministers in September. It includes larger mesh sizes for nets, bigger landing sizes and escape panels in trawlers - all designed to prevent juvenile fish from being caught before they can breed. Mrs Gillian Shephard, minister for agriculture, fisheries and food, called for common international action this month, warning that without it, 'there will be no fish for anyone to fish, no jobs for any fishermen and no security for any fishermen's families'. But conservationists are partly on the fishermen's side over the tie-up rules. Ms Mary Munson, fisheries campaigner at Greenpeace, said policing the seas is at the heart of the problem. UK fishermen have been incensed at the sight of trawlers from other EC countries fishing illegally in British waters. However rigorous the UK's 142 port inspectors are, said Ms Munson, 'it's the nature of fishing that you can't get an inspector to go on every boat'. She added that better monitoring of landings and inspection of boats at port by all EC states is essential, along with measures such as the European Commission's proposal to track boats by satellite. UK fishermen, suspicious of their European competitors, claim two hidden agendas: that the EC wants to reduce UK capacity to make way for the large Spanish and Portuguese fleets, and that Britain is intent on forcing its fishermen out of the industry without having to compensate them. Ministry officials agree the choice of the controversial 'tie-up' system was partly based on cost, although it is also seen as more enforceable than the conservation measures favoured by fishermen. The main alternative to restricting fishing days - a large-scale programme to pay fishermen to stop fishing - would be more than the Treasury would accept in the present financial climate. The government has already announced a three-year Pounds 25m programme, which it hopes will reduce the fleet by about 5 per cent. The UK has 11,000 vessels, of which 3,500 are over 10 metres. The fishermen and their supporters in parliament want a programme worth at least Pounds 50m. Introduction of the tie-up rules has been postponed from October to next January to allow for wider consultation. If the federation wins its High Court action, the government may be forced back to the drawing board. Other member states, facing the same pressure to cut their fleets, will watch the outcome with interest.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava March 14 (CTK) -- Slovak President  Michal Kovac confirmed to journalists that he had accepted the  proposal that former Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik become the  new Slovak premier. Kovac said that the representatives of all  the political parties with whom he had negotiated had been in  favour of Jozef Moravcik becoming premier.    "The entrusting of Jozef Moravcik with the task of composing  a new government is valid as of this moment," Kovac said, adding  that the letter of appointment would follow.    The composition of the new government should be known on  Wednesday [16 March], when the president wants to hand over the  letter of appointment. At the same time, the premier's vows  should be taken. On Wednesday evening, Kovac said, the first  session of the new government should take place.    The president said he had not wanted to deal with the  question of the individual filling of ministerial posts at  today's talks. However, he had asked that the political parties  acquaint him with their suggestions in time. "I would like to  talk to each candidate personally before appointing them," he  said.    Asked by CTK whether the new government would also mean a  signal abroad that the political situation in Slovakia was  stabilising, the president replied that he was hoping for a  positive appraisal. He added that Moravcik's representation of  Slovakia abroad had met with a good response.    "His appointment as premier indicates that the continuity of  Slovak foreign policy has not been interrupted," Kovac added.    On the statements of ex-premier Vladimir Meciar and his  calls  for Kovac's resignation, the president said he was "sufficiently  armoured against him (Meciar) psychologically as to be able to  withstand his attacks.    "Many of the people who have been demonstrating in squares  and calling for my resignation are not sufficiently aware of the  country's political situation," Kovac said. "Perhaps among them  there are some who will never be aware of it, and will always  stand behind Mr. Meciar," he added.</p>

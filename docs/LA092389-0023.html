			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DESIRE TO BUILD COMMUNITY LIFE  </P> <P> Thank you for the articles by Tracey Kaplan regarding the trials and  tribulations of us North Hollywoodians and our various neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Valley Village ("Battle of the 'Stucco Mountains' Heats Up," Sept. 18) will  continue to lose its country atmosphere just as our Toluca Woods area will have  to contend with the body and fender shops and their attendant blight. All of  North Hollywood will have to accept the fact that Lankershim Boulevard will  become an urban nightmare as Flower Street in Los Angeles has become.  </P> <P> But through the Los Angeles Times and reporters like Kaplan, we will know that  there are among us a few brave souls who have not lost or given up a sense of  belonging and a desire to build community life in this part of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> CHARLES J. THOMAS  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

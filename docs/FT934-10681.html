			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Feeding puzzle fever Locate, million, curator, wasteland: what have these words in common?* This and several dozen other brainteasers are this week arriving at 150,000 homes in Tyne and Wear and south Northumberland in the form of Witzend, believed to be Britain's first free-distribution, monthly puzzle magazine. Printed in colour, on A4 gloss paper, Witzend's appeal to the public's thirst for puzzles is intended to give it a much higher retention rate than the average free publication. To enhance its appeal, its range of puzzles supplied by Mensa, the high IQ society, is supplemented by quizzes and games offering prizes linked directly to advertisers and their products. 'This is something new and fresh, we were keen to get on board straight away,' says Paul Keenan, PR manager at Gateshead's MetroCentre shopping and leisure complex, a prominent advertiser in the first issue. The magazine's family appeal and high retention prospects were key attractions. Witzend was devised by Metromedia, a Newcastle-based design and marketing company. Editor Franco Polsinelli plans a Teesside version in early 1994 and envisages nationwide distribution in a year. Puzzles supplied by Mensa would remain the same throughout editions, with advertising geared to local markets. Advertising rates of Pounds 2,600 for a full page are pitched slightly below north-east free newspaper rates; Polsinelli has had no difficulty selling advertising, with minimal discounts. The first issue has broken even. Profits from subsequent Witzends will depend on raising the advertising ratio from the first issue's 25 per cent. Mensa's executive director Harold Gale is supplying the puzzles free; in exchange Mensa, which frequently co-operates in media puzzle promotions, receives free publicity and the assurance that the public's puzzle addiction is being fed. *Answer next Thursday.</p>

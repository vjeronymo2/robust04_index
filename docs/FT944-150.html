			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Minister presses on doctors' hours The government yesterday stepped up pressure on health authorities to reduce junior doctors' hours. Mr Gerald Malone, health minister, urged authorities and health trusts to act as soon as possible to set up the extra 300 consultant posts he recently announced. He said: 'The sooner these new consultants are in post the sooner we can achieve real and sustained improvements in hours.' Mr Malone also announced that tougher checks on the hours junior doctors worked would be introduced from February. The new system of checks would require returns on hours of work and contracted hours to be collected and validated in partnership with junior doctors, he said.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Arts: Today's Television Summer is upon us and there is a huge number of repeats. Watch the Lausanne Grand Prix meeting in Athletics (8.00 BBC1, then 9.00 BBC2) and you will be able to decide where the most amazingly brief clothing is worn on TV these days: the dance floor in 'Come Dancing' or the athletics track. Stars such as Heike Drechsler and Linford Christie are expected to compete. BBC2 repeats a good documentary about Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's minister of propaganda, called We Have Ways Of Making You Think (8.10). This programme reveals that Goebbels' own tastes were for Hollywood schlock and that he arranged for the making of very conventional entertainment movies to keep the people happy. In Discovering Beethoven (9.30 BBC2) Michael Tilson Thomas conducts the LSO at a concert-lecture in which he explains why Beethoven's 5th symphony was a turning point in music and influenced nearly every other symphony composed during the following 100 years. The programme ends with a full performance of the symphony. Channel 4 completes its thriller An Exchange Of Fire (10.00).</p>

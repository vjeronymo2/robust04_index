			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL PRESS QUITS STATIONS TO FOCUS ON RACE  </P> <P> Bill Press, under fire for months for allegedly using his KABC-TV and KABC  radio broadcasts to build an unfair advantage for himself in the race for state  insurance commissioner, delivered his last commentaries Monday before becoming  an official candidate.  </P> <P> And his pitch was highly political, prompting complaints from other  contestants.  </P> <P> "I want to make it official," Press said on KABC-TV. "I have decided, beginning  (Tuesday), to go for it. . . . This job really defines me. It really is a fight  for the people day in and day out. That's what the job is all about. It  combines that passion for public service I have with the passion of fighting  for people."  </P> <P> On KABC radio, he declared, "I'm convinced it's a job I want, taking on those  big insurance companies and forcing them to make those cuts in auto insurance  we voted for with Proposition 103. . . . This is the one job in state  government that appeals to me, fighting for the people day in and day out."  </P> <P> Press had remained on the stations making commentaries -- including one last  week critical of the job being done by the state Board of Equalization, chaired  by Conway Collis, one of his leading opponents -- during months of exploratory  efforts in the commissioner's race, including heavy fund raising, appearances  at candidate forums and solicitations of endorsements.  </P> <P> Press's opponents, and some outside commentators, have raised questions about  the propriety of his being allowed to remain on the air. Just last week Collis  unsuccessfully asked for equal time to reply to Press. For the most part,  station executives have avoided responding to the criticisms, and both stations  said Monday their general managers were unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> This was the third time in the last five years that a KABC-TV commentator has  used the station's newscasts to declare his intention to run for political  office. Press did it for the U.S. Senate in 1987, and Bruce Herschensohn for  the U.S. Senate in 1986.  </P> <P> On Monday, two of Press's Democratic opponents, Collis and former Common Cause  director Walter Zelman, expressed unhappiness with Press and the stations.  </P> <P> "My sense is that Bill should have been off the air a month or two ago," Zelman  said. "He has been a candidate for months and I think the station and he should  have recognized that."  </P> <P> Said Collis: "While Bill Press has been misusing the public airways to promote  himself, we've been fighting for California drivers. Ultimately, that is the  basis upon which voters will choose a candidate. Commitment not commentary.  Hard work, not TV talk."  </P> <P> But Wes Bannister, a Republican candidate, said he did not mind Press's  appearances. "I would prefer to see him on, because I think it's very helpful  to have him exposing himself on a daily basis," Bannister said.  </P></p>

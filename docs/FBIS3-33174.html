			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Miguel de la Guardia from the "Commenting on </F> the News" segment]    [Text] Many people view the recent measures taken by the  U.S. Government as strange, but there are some clues to indicate  the real intentions behind those actions. As of 1 October 1994,  every immigrant requesting political asylum in the United States  will be charged $130. A corollary to that measure is that any  person requesting political asylum will not be granted a work  permit in the United States for six months following the date  the petition was filed.    Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] officials  report  that 364,000 requests have accumulated with 10,000 new requests  being received each month. The aforementioned measures are  expected to help expedite processing. At this time there are  only 150 people who process political asylum and residency  requests, thus the decisionmaking process takes an unusually  long time to complete. There are plans to hire more personnel to  allow the INS to reduce the number of unprocessed requests to a  normal level. That seems perfectly normal and logical.    But there are other considerations. Not all immigrants to  the United States are unwanted, and political refugee status is  granted to some with extraordinary ease. One example is those  Cubans who dare cross the Florida channel in dilapidated sea  vessels and by the most unusual and risky methods. This a  politically oriented measure that is part of a crusade to wage a  negative propaganda campaign against Cuba, a country that has  adopted a social and political regime not to the U.S.  Government's liking. The intention is to present these people  as politically persecuted individuals who have escaped alleged  repression in their respective countries. In those cases, after  the newly arrived immigrants have made statements against their  governments, political refugee status is granted swiftly in  accordance with laws and dispositions in existence since the  early days of the Cuban revolution.    These Cuban immigrants are not the real targets of the  recent  measure to charge $130 for each political asylum request. There  are mechanisms in the [word indistinct] community such as the  relatives of the emigres or the counterrevolutionary  organizations that can provide the money.    The real issue is that there are hundreds maybe thousands of  other immigrants who claim to have been persecuted in their  countries in order to take advantage of the same benefits  accorded the Cubans. Among those immigrants who risk their  lives to travel under pathetic conditions to the United States  -- also aboard fragile sea vessels -- we can mention the  Haitians, who flee repression and famine in their country in  search of a better future in the United States. These displaced  persons have two monumental stumbling blocks that prevent them  from being admitted to the northern colossus. The first is that  they are black, and the other is that they are extremely poor  with very little education. Such traits make them unwanted in  affluent North American society, where there are already too  many blacks who are unemployed, destitute, and discriminated  against.    It is very unlikely that a Haitian fugitive will be able to  pay the $130 fee, much less be able to wait the established six  month period to receive a permit that will allow them to work in  the great northern country. The same can be said of the  numerous Mexican and other Third World immigrants who seek to  travel to the United States for economic reasons. Isn't the  real intention behind the unusual tax quite clear?</p>

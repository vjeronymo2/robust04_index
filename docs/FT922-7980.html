			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Bank of Ireland jumps to Pounds 77m but suffers higher tax charge BANK OF Ireland, the Dublin-based banking group, yesterday reported a 43 per cent jump in pre-tax profits from IPounds 53.5m to IPounds 76.8m (Pounds 70m) for the year to March 31. But a higher tax charge resulted in a more modest 6 per cent rise, from IPounds 27.4m to IPounds 29.1m, in after-tax profits. Mr Paul D'Alton, chief financial officer, said the increase in tax to IPounds 47.7m (IPounds 26.1m) was due to the group doing less tax-based lending in the past year, and heavier losses in the US which cannot be offset against profits in Ireland. Mr Howard Kilroy, the bank's governor, said the group's 'excellent' performance in the Irish market made this the 'key strategic strength.' A substantial reduction in loan losses in the UK demonstrated 'that our operations there are being managed back to profitability' However, in the US, results from the New Hampshire businesses were 'very disappointing.' The New Hampshire subsidiary lost IPounds 76.6m, but bank executives believe that improvements seen in the first quarter figures, with an easing of loan-loss provisions, mean this trend can be continued through 1992. Bank of Ireland bought the First New Hampshire Bank in 1988 for Dollars 370m (Pounds 203m) and has since had to write off almost Dollars 300m against bad loans. Mr D'Alton said most of the losses had occurred on the loan portfolio which the bank assumed at that time. This had been hit by the downturn in the New Hampshire property market. The bulk of those bad loans had been written off and although a recovery in the New Hampshire economy was not foreseen in the short-term the bank was 'cautiously optimistic' that there should be 'a substantial reduction in losses this year.' Losses in the UK were cut from IPounds 55.4m to IPounds 21.9m. Profits in the Irish division rose by IPounds 1.4m to IPounds 131.9m. A one-off payment of IPounds 7.6m was made in settlement of the recent industrial dispute which affected all four Irish clearing banks. Earnings per share were 6.1p (5.7p). The recommended final dividend of 5.84p makes an unchanged total of 9.17p for the year.</p>

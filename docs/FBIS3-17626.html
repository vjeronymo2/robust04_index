			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent]  Here is how President Yuriy Meshkov sees relations with Ukraine  and Russia. In an exclusive interview with NTV today he said:    [Begin Meshkov recording, shown seated at desk in front of  unrecognized flag] For the time being what we are proposing is a  kind of legislative initiative. We are appealing to Russia and  Ukraine to reach agreement on a problem which is common to all.  The initiative has been accepted by the Russian side and is  being worked on actively, but unfortunately there has so far  been no reaction from the leadership in Kiev. How does Crimea  see herself in this triangle? Of course we would like to have  an equilateral triangle, although of course the scale is  incompatible. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

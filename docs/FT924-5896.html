			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Goldman Sachs gets to work on BT debt restructuring ON A DAY which saw the launch of just two new issues, Goldman Sachs' restructuring of the British Telecom debt it bought last week went under the microscope. The rationale behind the restructuring is that, with a 12 1/4 per cent coupon, the bonds would trade substantially above par in current market conditions, deterring many investors. Goldman put the debt, which matures in 2003, into a special purpose Cayman Islands vehicle which is issuing depositary receipts giving the holder the right to the payments arising from the coupon and/or principal. To make it more marketable, Goldman stripped the coupon from the principal to create a total of 22 separately-priced smaller zero-coupon issues, largely made up of 21 semi-annual interest rate payments worth Pounds 11m each. The one Pounds 180m repayment of principal was priced at 40.74, a spread of 55 basis points over comparable gilts. Investors are effectively buying future cash-flows offering a pick up over gilts and a leveraged exposure to the bond market. A 10-year discounted zero in a rising market will move as much in price as a full coupon bond. Goldman, which believes sterling interest rates have further to fall, says the restructured debt is perfect for investors who are bullish on UK interest rates but less certain on sterling. Stripping is likely to remain a pretty specialised technique in the UK, given the difficulty in getting the right quality paper at the right price in the right amounts. With the positive yield curve environment today, the zero coupon approach will give 20 basis points differential in yield, according to one banker. The beneficiaries of the extra value unlocked are Goldman, the investors, and the UK Treasury. By the close of play, Goldman reported it had sold around two-thirds of the total face value, split equally between the principal and the coupons. Goldman's pricing highlighted again the difficulties in choosing the right benchmark to use. Picking the right gilt is made more difficult than usual in this instance as a 10-year zero-coupon bond has the same effective duration as a 25-year full coupon gilt and should be priced accordingly, say traders. Meanwhile, some French traders were less than enthusiastic about the timing of the European Investment Bank's FFr1bn reopening of an existing issue. While there was no criticism of the terms or the amount, the atmosphere in Paris was not really favourable for new issues, they said, given the weakening of the French franc against the D-Mark and the widening of spreads between German and French 10-year government bonds. Despite the bearish tone, the spread of 20 basis points over the OAT on the new tranche compares with a launch spread of 34 on the original issue. Others said they were not afraid of taking a position in a good issue at a good price for a quality credit while clients rediscovered their buying appetite. African Development Bank will price today a DM300m five-year bond at 43 basis points over German government bonds.</p>

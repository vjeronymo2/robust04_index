			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Go-ahead for Dollars 3bn Mexican roads sell-off MEXICO'S government is to go ahead with a Dollars 3bn road privatisation programme after its Congress approved changes to the transport laws earlier this week. The government owns about 1,000km of four-lane toll roads, for which it might receive Dollars 2.6bn-2.9bn for the sale of concessions for 15-20 years. The government will spend much of the money raised building free roads to link highways now being built by the private sector. The government has granted concessions for 3,500km of toll motorways at a cost to the private sector of around Dollars 5bn. Concessions for another 2,400km of toll roads will be granted soon. A senior government official said Mexico was considering two mechanisms to sell the highways. It might auction off concessions in the highways to groups, of which foreigners could own 49 per cent. The acquiring groups would probably follow the example of the private sector building new toll roads, and issuing bonds guaranteed by toll payments to finance their purchase. Alternatively, the government might form 'highway companies' that would issue bonds in the domestic and international markets, and whose interest and principal was backed by toll payments. The government would then sell shares in the highway companies. The Mexican government has backed down over its threat to suspend all US Drug Enforcement Agency activity in its country made in retaliation to a decision by the US Supreme Court that the kidnapping and spiriting to the US of a Mexican murder suspect was legal. The government said it would resume 'temporarily' drug co-operation with the US so as not to give an equivocal signal to drug smugglers. The DEA never received notification that co-operation had been broken off, despite Mexico's announcement on Monday night that its activities had been suspended. The temporary 'resumption' of co-operation will be made permanent once the revision of an extradition treaty is agreed, according to the Mexican foreign ministry. The US assured the Mexican government on Tuesday that co-operation over legal and drug matters would respect its sovereignty. See International Capital Markets; World Stock Markets</p>

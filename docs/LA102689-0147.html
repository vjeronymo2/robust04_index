			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> A THOUGHT-PROVOKING SIX-PART 'AMERICA'S CENTURY' ON PBS  </P> <P> If you've ever known the feeling of returning to an old house you thought you  knew, only to experience it again as if for the first time, then watching  "America's Century" (at 10 tonight on Channel 28) will bring that feeling back.  One of writer-host Lewis Lapham's points in this six-part series is that the  United States needs to retrieve its own history and, with it, a sober sense of  its position in the world.  </P> <P> It took the British (Panoptic Productions and Channel 4) to produce one of the  most remarkable contributions to that cause ever shown on television.  </P> <P> Since the death of Edward Abbey, Lapham is arguably this country's most  brilliant essayist, holding forth each month in the magazine he edits,  Harper's. He is almost alone among commentators in rising above ideological  niches, establishing a firmly personal and informed view that combines a more  soulful version of Henry Kissinger's Realpolitik with a less caustic version of  Gore Vidal's anti-imperialism. Like an intellectual alley cat, he slips through  the 20th Century's violent darkness, making his mark before it's registered in  the mind.  </P> <P> To write fine essays is one thing; to blend the essay's economy and depth with  the powerful iconography of newsreel footage is another. Producer-directors  Susan Crowther and Peter Bate, combining old film and new interviews with a  wide range of American observers, have managed to put Lapham's ideas into high  relief.  </P> <P> In the first two episodes screened for review, "Coming of Age" and "Familiar  Enemies," the overwhelming sense is of an innocent United States, adolescent of  mind yet adult in economic capacity. Teddy Roosevelt leads the charge  everywhere: San Juan Hill, the Philippines, anywhere the Navy can travel.  Millions flee Europe for a big land where they can start a new life. The Old  World burns, and the New World resembles a big toy store.  </P> <P> Then, like a nightmare after a long slumber, World War I, the Depression and  Hitler rumble in, with a brief pause for Calvin Coolidge and the Jazz Age. And,  with our new global role, the Republic gained its own tragic figures, like that  sublimely stunted idealist, Woodrow Wilson. Watching this, you have to pinch  yourself: This is one great story.  </P> <P> Like all great stories, Lapham's is full of contradictions and absurdities,  such as the images of American troops traipsing across the Russian snow, trying  to defeat the newly victorious Bolsheviks. Or the innocent faces of German  youth, which so resemble their American counterparts, singing "Our Hitler Is  Our Lord" in a prim classroom. Or the attempts by the media to depict the  murderous Stalin to the American public as a father figure.  </P> <P> The archival achievement here cannot be overemphasized. Film footage of Lenin  and Stalin speaking in Red Square, of passengers leaping like ants off of  luxury vessels hit by German U-boats, of Nikita Khrushchev watching Shirley  MacLaine perform "Can-Can," almost threaten to drown Lapham's extraordinary  narration.  </P> <P> But not narration like this, on U.S. foreign policy in the early part of the  century: "Nobody entertained the image of overseas American empire. Among the  privileged and well-educated classes, a few very polite gentlemen entertained  an eccentric interest in diplomacy. But, for the most part, they were amateurs,  the kind of people who joined the State Department in order to spare their  mothers the indignity of a baggage search when passing through foreign  customs."  </P> <P> Finally, "America's Century," though a powerful critique of U.S. global reach,  adopts no political line. It can't, when the interview subjects run the gamut  from George McGovern to Milton Friedman, from Hamilton Fish to Gen. Curtis  LeMay. There is no substitute for reading, but to miss "America's Century" is  to miss a piece of history.  </P></p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Sock Shop curbs staff hours: Switch to part-time working will affect up to 400 workers Sock Shop, the sock and fashion retailer, is to move its 400 staff from full-time to part-time contracts, adopting a growing trend in the retail sector. Managers of Sock Shop's outlets, of which there are nearly 100, were banned yesterday from giving details of the change, but it is understood that most full-time staff will be switched to 20 hours a week over three days. One manager, who contacted the Financial Times by telephone, said the company had made quite clear that the switch was mainly to save on employment costs. Ms Jenny Trotter, personnel manager, would not elaborate on a prepared statement that read: 'Sock Shop Holdings Ltd is introducing a number of changes to retail staff contracts. The main modification is in the area of hours worked, so that we have a greater percentage of part-time workers in the company. The changes are being introduced to secure a more flexible and cost-effective workforce.' The changes at Sock Shop are expected to affect about 400 people in nearly 100 shops. The company, built up by Ms Sophie Mirman in the 1980s, was sold for Pounds 3.25m after it collapsed in 1990. It was bought by former jeweller Mr Juan Olaso and venture capitalist Mr Barclay Douglas. Staff at Sock Shop outlets in the City were yesterday unwilling to discuss their employment prospects. At one outlet an employee said he was already part-time and that suited him well as he was a student. A driver supplying one outlet said he had worked for Sock Shop for six years. It was a good employer, he said, but he did not want to discuss the company. Mr John Fahy of the shopworkers' union Usdaw said: 'Sadly, this is a growing trend throughout the retail sector, and it is creating a lot of insecurity. Employers are being encouraged by government employment legislation.'</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] A broad dispute arose in Yemeni government circles  after a revelation from Aden concerning some details of the  state's public budget for 1993. These details included the fact  that the budget deficit amounted to more than 50 percent of the  total. At the beginning of this year, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT obtained  some information indicating that the budget deficit totaled 40  billion Yemeni riyals [YR]. This is something that recently came  to light when the new agencies said that the total budget was  about YR74 billion and that the public revenues amounted to YR32  billion, whereas the deficit amounted to about YR42 billion.  Yemeni economic, business, and financial sources had warned of  the dangers of this deficit if the economic situation in the  country continued as is as a result of matters piling up during  the nation's transitional period to national unity and unlimited  public expenditures. They warned of the consequences of the  monetary policy that is being followed and the government's  continued printing of more paper currency without sufficient  backing--something that has weakened the value of the domestic  currency vis-a-vis hard currencies and increased the rate of  inflation.    The sources, in subsequent statements, went on to say that  the political crisis that has afflicted the nation since August  [of 1993] has caused complication of the economic situation and  the addition of new factors to the problem facing the nation's  public budget.    It was not known precisely how the Yemeni Government has  managed to deal with the deficit in the nation's public budget,  which has been steadily increasing during the last year. But  economic sources have indicated that one approach it has used  has been that of printing more Yemeni currency bills and  flooding the market with them. This has recently led to the  collapse of the Yemeni currency vis-a-vis hard currencies,  especially the U.S. dollar, the price of which in the parallel  market has increased to more than five times its official price  declared by the Yemeni Central Bank. It has not yet been  possible to determine accurately how these huge amounts of  money, included in the public budget deficit, have been spent.  But the sources have indicated that the total spent on wages,  salaries, compensations, and other such payments amounts to far  more than 50 percent of the total budget, which is YR74 billion,  according to the latest information. What this means is that  even the total in revenues is unable to cover the salaries and  wages earned by more than one-half million Yemenis, that is, the  total number of persons employed in the nation's public sector,  administrative apparatus, and armed forces units.    The sources have said that the events of 1993--particularly  the public elections that took place in April and subsequent  political developments in the country, the last of which was the  public census project they decided to postpone--also resulted in  a new burden for the public budget. The government recklessly  spent billions in order to deal with the demands of this  experiment, and the two parties in power spent unlimited amounts  of money in order to gain more supporters and mobilize them to  confront the other side.    Concerning the development projects and services programs,  the sources have said that they were allotted only a small part  of the public budget. No improvement worth mentioning has been  noticed in services and infrastructure projects. Also, people  have not noticed any new additions. The situation has remained  as it was in previous years, or else has gotten even worse,  especially with regard to roads, electricity, and water and  sewage projects, which have noticeably come to a halt. The  sources doubt that the Yemeni Government has resorted to  borrowing from abroad to deal with the deficit that has  afflicted the public budget, because relations with the lending  nations that used to deal with Yemen are still angry about  Yemen's position concerning the recent Gulf crisis (Iraq's  occupation of Kuwait). Also, in the view of many of these  nations, Yemen has become an oil-producing nation. Even when  cooperation between Yemen and many of the nations and  international organizations has continued, it is restricted to  technical aid, consulting, [the acquisition of] special  expertise, and some services projects, especially in the fields  of public health, environmental health, etc. The sources  considered that it is not possible, in any case, to hold any  particular party responsible for the latest deficit afflicting  the Yemeni public budget, in view of the fact that the fiscal  and monetary policy does not differ much from that of the rest  of the policies which have been followed by Yemen during its  stage of unification. The government agencies have multiplied to  an extent previously unknown in this country, and the Ministry  of Finance, together with the Yemeni Central Bank, have been  transformed into mere executive agencies who have no say in the  formulation of policies and decisionmaking and cannot restrain  the higher authorities that merely want to have their orders  carried out without having to take into consideration the  consequences of these orders--especially those dealing with the  printing of more paper money to deal with ever-increasing  expenditures.    The sources remember how the statements exchanged between  the  leaders of the General People's Congress [GPC], and those of the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] contained accusations concerning  fiscal policy, public expenditures, wasting money, and not  adhering to the rules and clauses dealing with spending the  public budget. The leaders of the GPC consider that the YSP is  directly responsible, since the prime minister, who belongs to  it, is responsible for the steadily increasing expenditures and  the printing of more paper currency in order to cover the  salaries, wages, and compensations being paid out in the  southern provinces. The YSP leaders are saying that the salaries  they are talking about in the PCG do not amount to anything in  comparison with the unlimited expenditures of the nation's  president and the Ministries of Defense and Interior, and, in  this regard, they refer to what 'Ali Salim al-Bid recently  mentioned concerning the fact that the Central Bank is being  administered by telephone from the Presidential Palace.    Finally, the sources pointed out that the deficit that has  afflicted Yemen's public budget is also the result of the fact  that Yemeni society is accustomed to having the Public Treasury  meet all of the expenditures. Recently some newspapers, by means  of cartoons and satirical articles, have compared the treasury  to a dairy cow that is expected to provide all the members of a  family with what they need, without any serious thought being  given to how to make it possible for the cow to always be able  to do this.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / National Power takes another step The Hub project marks an important step in National Power's ambitions to invest Pounds 1bn overseas by the end of the decade to compensate for loss of domestic market share to independent power generators, writes David Lascelles. The privatised power generation company, the UK's largest, now has about 5 per cent of its generating capacity outside the UK, according to Mr Graham Hadley, its managing director for international business development, and with Hub its overseas investment will amount to Pounds 250m. 'That's starting to give us a track record', he said. National Power's other investments include American National Power in Houston, the Pego coal-fired power station in Portugal, and a share in a Spanish clean-coal technology plant. Projects in the pipeline include power stations in India and China. Mr Hadley saw prospects in the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Poland and the Czech Republic. The company is also looking at Morocco, Turkey, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam.</p>

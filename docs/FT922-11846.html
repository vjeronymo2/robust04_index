			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Ukraine tries to head off Crimean independence THE UKRAINIAN parliament yesterday gave preliminary approval to sweeping powers of self-government for the breakaway Crimean republic in a last-ditch effort to hold on to the region. Ukrainian lawmakers hope that the bill, which passed a first reading after a tense, late-night debate, will halt the drive to hold a referendum on independence in Crimea. The law, which has already been ratified by the Crimean parliament, grants Crimea control over land and natural resources, the pace of economic reform, migration and education, and gives Crimea a say in all military movements in the region. The lush Crimean peninsula, transferred from Russia to Ukraine in 1954, has become a lightning rod for escalating hostilities between the two Slavic republics. Russia's parliament has tabled a motion declaring the transfer illegal and many Crimean separatist leaders view independence as a first step toward reunification with Russia. Nearly 10 per cent of Crimea's 2.5m inhabitants signed a petition calling for a referendum but the Crimean parliament has not yet given the necessary endorsement. On the defence front, tension between Ukraine and Russia appeared to calm down, when Marshal General Konstantin Morozov, the Ukrainian defence minister, reiterated earlier promises to recommence shipping tactical nuclear warheads to Russia for dismantling. Reuter adds: Ukraine's parliament yesterday failed to approve the government's latest draft budget, despite warnings that western aid could be put in jeopardy. Deputies signalled their acceptance of the need for a tight budget by voting to limit this year's deficit to no more than 2 per cent of gross national product. But opposition centred on the proposed 28 per cent VAT level.</p>

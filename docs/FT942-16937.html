			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: GE acts to quell earnings fears General Electric, the US conglomerate, said its earnings during the first quarter of the year were 'at the high end of analysts' estimates', which it said ranged from Dollars 1.45 to Dollars 1.50 a share. The announcement marked an attempt by the industrial giant to scotch rumours that its financial services businesses, which have been one of the main engine of profits growth in recent periods, had suffered from rising US interest rates. In particular, market speculation centred on possible losses at Kidder Peabody, the group's Wall Street brokerage house. The concerns hit GE's share price during the day, pushing it down Dollars 2 1/4 at one stage to Dollars 96 5/8 . The shares staged a partial recovery later to close at Dollars 97 5/8 . In a statement, GE said that first-quarter earnings at both Kidder and GE Capital Services, its financial services unit, would be 'excellent'. Dennis Dammerman, the group's senior vice president in charge of finance, also said that GE continues to expect record earnings for 1994 as a whole. Kidder has had a patchy record in recent years and has been consistently less profitable than its main competitors, leading to frequent speculation that GE was looking to sell the business. Last year, though, operating profits jumped to Dollars 439m from Dollars 300m the year before.</p>

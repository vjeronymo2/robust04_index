			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Senior officials of  coalition parties finally struck a deal on a draft policy  platform for a new government early Friday [22 April], setting  the stage for Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's assumption of  power, coalition officials said.    "We have just agreed on a policy platform after having  continued eleventh-hour negotiations since yesterday," said  Social Democratic Party (SDP) Secretary General Wataru Kubo, who  chaired the coalition forum on policy talks.    Kubo, the No. 2 man in the largest party in the governing  coalition, said that at an early Friday meeting of the  secretaries general-level coalition representatives, the ruling  parties reconciled their positions on two key policies --  Japan's response to North Korea's nuclear arms program and tax  system reform.    The accord followed another agreement reached Wednesday on a  separate major element of policy -- national security.    The coalition executives also decided to ask all coalition  chiefs to convene a meeting around 2 P.M. on Friday to endorse  the draft policy platform and name a candidate to succeed  departing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Kubo said.    Coalition officials said heads and secretaries general of  coalition parties will hold a meeting after 2 P.M. Friday to  confirm the policy platform for a new government and also pick  Hata, leader of the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], as its candidate for prime minister.    But the House of Representatives Steering Committee agreed  Thursday evening not to convene a plenary session on Friday to  pick a successor to Hosokawa, who suddenly announced on April 8  his intention to resign.    The prime ministerial election in both houses of the Diet  may  be carried over to next week because of the delay in agreement  among the coalition parties over policies for a new government,  the officials said.    The main opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), has refused to attend vote-taking plenary sessions at the  weekend, the officials said.    A senior LDP official told reporters that the Diet has so  far  failed to hold the prime ministerial election only because of  the ruling coalition's indecisiveness. "We won't agree to a  weekend plenary session," he said.    The SDP's Murayama told an early Friday press conference  that  Hata is the best candidate from the viewpoint of common sense.  He denied speculation that he will become deputy prime minister.    The officials agreed on a phrase requiring the government to  seek cooperation with Asian nations concerned, in addition to  the United States and South Korea, in the event of an emergency  with North Korea's alleged nuclear program.    The SDP, the largest contingent in the ruling alliance, had  insisted on the inclusion in the coalition's policy paper of a  phrase obligating the government to consult with China, as well  as the U.S. and South Korea, if the United Nations decides to  slap economic sanctions on North Korea.    On tax system reform, the coalition parties agreed on a plan  to revamp the current tax system with a phrase seeking reform  based on public understanding through possible revision or  elimination of the existing consumption tax but focusing  attention on raising indirect taxes.    The SDP had demanded the abolition of the 1989 consumption  tax, a value-added tax, in exchange for a compromise that calls  for a creation of a new indirect levy with a public consensus.    The coalition parties have been under pressure to forge an  agreement on a policy platform for a new government since  Hosokawa's resignation announcement.    Hosokawa will remain on board until his successor is  selected.    Talks among the coalition partners had remained at an  impasse  over how to find common ground to document policies in two key  areas -- tax reform and the North Korean nuclear issue.    Earlier on Thursday, all the coalition parties other than  the  SDP spurned its demands to play down the wording on tax reform  and the North Korean nuclear issue in a policy document for a  new cabinet, officials said.    At a meeting of secretaries general-level representatives of  coalition partners Thursday, the majority of parties led by the  coalition's core party Shinseito told the SDP that they will not  accept its demands.    The SDP demanded that the term "national consensus" be  inserted into the policy document as a prerequisite for a hike  in indirect taxes, while other parties call for inserting an  indication of their readiness to hike the consumption tax from  the current 3 percent.    Hata, who is widely expected to be picked as a successor to  Hosokawa, told reporters that the SDP should make a decision in  order to maintain the coalition government.    At a news briefing following the afternoon bargaining  session, Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Secretary General  Takashi Yonezawa said the non-SDP parties "will have to accept  the possible withdrawal of the SDP from our coalition."    Komeito [Clean Government Party] Secretary General Yuichi  Ichikawa also ruled out a compromise with the SDP, but hinted at  efforts to bring together all forces ready to endorse the  coalition's proposed policy document.    Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, the main coalition  strategist, told Shinseito executives, "If we play our ace  (Hata) while leaving our policies ambiguous, we will definitely  fall into confusion in two to three months."    "We are now at a turning point where we have to decide  whether to put up the hardest fight now or at that time," Ozawa  said.</p>

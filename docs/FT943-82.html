			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Gold puts cap on S Africa Johannesburg finished mixed in mostly light trade as a softer bullion price slowed recovery attempts after heavy losses earlier this week. Currency factors were also seen plaguing sentiment, with uncertainty about the future of the financial rand keep-ing some investors out of the market. However, other investors were seen picking up export-related stocks in anticipation of the scrapping of the financial rand, since the expected resultant weakness in the commercial rand rate would boost earnings of those companies. The overall index lost 1 at 5,638 after initially slipping to 5,623. Golds ended 37 or 1.5 per cent off at 2,427 and industrials added 21 at 6,270. De Beers was flat at R100, but Anglos slipped R1.50 to R235.50 in line with its gold exposure. Gencor moved up 25 cents to R14.75 and SAB put on 50 cents at R83.50.</p>

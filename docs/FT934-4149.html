			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Brandenburg vote set to deal blow for Kohl support East Germany's former communist party of Democratic Socialists was last night poised to deal a heavy blow to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats in elections in Brandenburg, the first local-government polls in the east since unification. However, the CDU and the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the federal government, did not fare as badly as early opinion polls had predicted for the state, which surrounds Berlin and flanks Poland. The vote is the first in a marathon round of municipal and state elections which culminate in federal elections next October. Although local politics played a great part in yesterday's elections, the vote will provide a barometer for Chancellor Kohl's future support. His CDU-led coalition has been trailing in the opinion polls after several scandals and amid speculation that it might soon fall apart. In Bonn, senior officials shrugged off any suggestion that the coalition was strained to breaking point. 'We want this coalition, and we want it to keep its majority in the parliamentary election' in October 1994, Mr Wolfgang Schauble, head of the CDU/CSU parliamentary faction, said in an interview with Welt am Sonntag newspaper. 'Anyone who believes the coalition between the CDU and the FDP is finished is completely fooling themselves,' he added. An exit poll conducted for Brandenburg radio by Infas, an opinion poll company, last night gave the CDU 20.2 per cent, nearly 10 points down from the previous state elections in October 1990, and a decline of 16 points compared with the Brandenburg vote in the federal elections that December. FDP support was put at 6 per cent, the same as the federal elections but 3 points less than the state elections. Opinion polls last week had suggested that Mr Kohl's governing coalition would, combined, obtain only 12 per cent. Support for the PDS rose to 22.1 per cent, nearly 7 points more than the state elections and 9 points more than the federal elections. However, its support is unlikely to be carried throughout the eastern states next year. The final count, expected early today, while representing a warning to Bonn, may indicate that Mr Kohl's government might be able to weather the storm after last week's financial scandal among the conservative-led government in Saxony-Anhalt and the withdrawal by Mr Steffen Heitmann, the Chancellor's chosen candidate for the presidency. Brandenburg's governing Social Democrats, led by Mr Manfred Stolpe, an easterner, held on to its broad base of support in spite of high unemployment. It was estimated to have received nearly 36 per cent of the vote, just 2 points less than it received in the state elections and 3.1 points more than the federal elections. The Greens received an estimated 6 per cent of the vote, the same as in the federal elections. If the exit poll is reflected throughout the night's counting, in which 58 per cent of the 1.9m eligible voters turned out, then Mr Kohl will have been spared a far worse result. However, Mr Thomas Klein, general secretary of the CDU in Brandenburg, last night said the scandal in Saxony-Anhalt, which involved west German ministers receiving excessive salaries, 'was a big problem'. Brandenburg has traditionally had a strong socialist and communist base.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'JAPAN'S BMW' TARGETS U.S.;  </P> <P> MITSUBISHI, LONG KNOWN FOR ITS SPORTY CARS IN OTHER NATIONS, IS SET TO RAISE  ITS IMAGE HERE.  </P> <P> Mitsubishi ranks among Japan's four largest auto makers. And for years,  consumers in Europe have regarded Mitsubishi as the Asian equivalent of the  BMW: stylish, sporty, even sophisticated.  </P> <P> But until recently, American consumers at mention of the Mitsubishi name were  as likely to think of electronics or banking as automobiles.  </P> <P> "In Detroit, people have never even heard of Mitsubishi," said George Peterson,  president of Auto Pacific Group, a Newport Beach automotive consulting firm.  That may be a slight exaggeration, but in an age when Hyundai quickly became a  household word in the United States, recognition of Mitsubishi's arrival so far  has spread more slowly.  </P> <P> Last year, Cypress-based Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America ranked a lowly  seventh in U.S. sales among 10 Asian auto makers and had less than  three-quarters of 1% of the U.S. market. But in 1989, it hopes to capture the  attention and sales that so far have proven elusive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overcoming Shortage  </P> <P> With a new manufacturing plant in Illinois, a big new advertising campaign that  features Los Angeles Dodger Orel Hershiser, and rave reviews for its newest  models, Mitsubishi figures that a turnaround is at hand.  </P> <P> In January, Mitsubishi's first U.S. manufacturing plant began turning out the  firm's best-selling car, the sporty Eclipse, overcoming a shortage that once  choked growth. The company has doubled its network television advertising  budget and boosted its total ad budget to $80 million -- a 35% increase. And  the auto maker plans to add 85 dealerships in 65 new markets this year, for a  total of 350.  </P> <P> "Our plan is to expand the exposure of Mitsubishi to America's heartland," said  Jeanne Hoover, Mitsubishi's manager of promotion and merchandising. "That means  to have consumer recognition and it may eventually mean 475 dealerships."  </P> <P> The push couldn't have come at a better time for Mitsubishi. Its Galant sedan  has been named import car of the year by Motor Trend magazine, and all four of  the company's other new cars have won awards in categories like "best buy" or  one of the "10 best."  </P> <P> Hershiser is the pitchman for Mitsubishi's "Five-for-Five" television and radio  ads that promote the company's five award-winning models. The Cy Young Award  winner was signed in December as a spokesman for Southern California dealers.  Now, the firm is considering making Hershiser its national spokesman and part  of its effort to establish its name in Iowa and Indiana, as well as California  and New York, where up to now most Mitsubishis have been sold.  </P> <P> "This is our window of opportunity. There's no fluke about it, and we're  telling everyone," said Bruce McRitchie, executive vice president of Grey  Advertising, which has created the award-centered campaign.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Well Known Elsewhere  </P> <P> In other parts of the world, Mitsubishi's name is nothing new. In 1987,  Mitsubishi Motors Corp., the parent company, built 1.2 million cars in Japan,  or 10% of all cars made there. In Japan, Toyota and Nissan are the largest auto  makers, while Mitsubishi and Honda scrap for third place.  </P> <P> And Mitsubishi was a big seller in New Zealand, West Germany and Finland before  it ever began selling cars in America.  </P> <P> "When Mitsubishi first appeared in England in 1975, it was the BMW of Japan.  Everyone knew Mitsubishi made fine cars," said John Rettie, an editor at J. D.  Power &amp; Associates, an Agoura Hills auto consulting firm.  </P> <P> While Toyota, Nissan and Honda jumped into the U.S. market by establishing  their own distributor network in the early 1970s, Mitsubishi chose a different  strategy: It sold its cars to Chrysler.  </P> <P> That meant that Mitsubishi was earning revenue in the United States but gaining  no name recognition with consumers. One-fifth of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is  owned by Chrysler.  </P> <P> Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, the U.S. marketer and distributor of  Mitsubishis, began selling cars in America in the final months of 1982.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Took Much Patience  </P> <P> Last year, Mitsubishi's domestic sales were only one-tenth those of Toyota. And  Chrysler, which since 1970 has sold Mitsubishis under its own name, sells many  more of the models than Mitsubishi Motor Sales. For instance, the sporty  Mitsubishi Eclipse is sold as the Plymouth Laser by Chrysler.  </P> <P> "When we started in 1982, we knew it would be tough. We knew we were late. It's  taken a great deal of patience," said Dick Recchia, Mitsubishi's executive vice  president. In 1983, 32,755 cars were sold, and annual sales had climbed to just  49,439 by 1986.  </P> <P> With 70 dealers in 1982, the company didn't make the instant splash that  low-price South Korean auto maker Hyundai made when it came to the United  States in 1986 and opened hundreds of dealerships that sold more than 150,000  relatively low-priced cars.  </P> <P> Mitsubishi originally set up its U.S. headquarters in Los Angeles, but outgrew  those offices in 1983 and moved to rented facilities in Fountain Valley,  becoming the first of several Asian auto makers to locate in Orange County.  </P> <P> The Big Three Asian auto makers have remained in the Torrance and Gardena area  since coming to America. And Mazda, Suzuki, Daihatsu and Hyundai have made  their headquarters in Orange County.  </P> <P> Mitsubishi moved last year to Cypress, where it built a seven-floor  headquarters on part of a 22-acre complex it bought six years ago. The land  also includes a Mitsubishi design studio, research lab, parts distribution  center, and training and engineering centers. More than 350 people work for the  company in Orange County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sales Have Jumped  </P> <P> The new assembly plant in Bloomington, Ill., is expected to provide 37,000  Lasers to Chrysler and 37,000 Eclipses to Mitsubishi this year. When the plant  reaches its expected full production next year, 60,000 of each model will be  produced.  </P> <P> So far this year, Mitsubishi sales are up more than 20%, after a 6% increase in  1988, when 70,075 cars were sold. This year, the company expects to sell  130,000 cars.  </P> <P> Every day, car shoppers drop into Costa Mesa Mitsubishi for their first visit  ever to a Mitsubishi lot, according to Joe Coons, general manager of the  dealership, which opened in late 1982. "They say, 'Boy, I've never even been in  a Mitsubishi. . . . We've been on this street longer than most dealers around.  And only now do people realize we're here."  </P> <P> Rettie, at J. D. Powers, said Mitsubishi's recent attention is "rather like a  woman becoming Miss America. She was no different without the title. But  suddenly people are saying she's the best."  </P> <P> </P> <P> MITSUBISHI MOTOR SALES OF AMERICA AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Headquarters: Cypress  </P> <P> Employees in county: 350  </P> <P> Employees in U.S. (non-manufacturing): 466  </P> <P> 1988 sales: $2 billion (by Mitsubishi dealers)  </P> <P> Source: the company  </P> <P> </P> <P> ASIAN AUTO MAKERS' U.S. SALES  </P> <P> Includes cars, trucks and vans built in Japan and the United States.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.44IN:3.54IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Manufacturer  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988 U.S. sales Volume  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Toyota  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 926,569  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nissan  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 691,362  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Honda  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 625,373  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mazda  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 348,615  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Hyundai  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 264,282  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Subaru  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 155,956  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Acura  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 128,238  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Isuzu  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 114,925  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mitsubishi  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 113,591  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Suzuki  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 57,851  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Daihatsu  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11,460  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: J.

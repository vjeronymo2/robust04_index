			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Monday Interview: Cabinet's ideological juggler - David Hunt, UK employment secretary Mr David Hunt, like many successful politicians, is something of a chameleon. At an open-air dinner in Salt Lake City, Utah, last month, he donned a cowboy hat and did his bit for the 'special relationship' between the US and the UK. He lavished praise on the job-creating American economy, spoke admiringly of the 'workfare' system which requires people on welfare to work for their benefits, and asked for US support in the battle against the forces of regulation and protection within the European Community. His Mormon hosts might be surprised to learn that at home Mr Hunt is considered by some critics in the Tory party to be a left-wing Europhile, rather than a true Anglo-Saxon free marketeer. Hunt, who took over as employment secretary in the cabinet reshuffle in May, and is the government's newest rising star, denies that he belongs on the left wing of the Conservative party. He says he has always been a mainstream 'one-nation' Tory. But he was tagged with the left-wing label after his attack on Enoch Powell at the 1972 Conservative party conference over the issue of Ugandan Asians settling in the UK. He paid a price - he was immediately deselected as candidate for the winnable seat of Plymouth Drake. Yet, he is happy to hint at non-conformist sympathies. The sharp-featured 51-year-old, who backed Michael Heseltine for the Tory party leadership, describes himself as a Christian Democrat, speaks of the social market economy, and talks proudly of the public-private partnerships and close links with the trade unions he fostered in his three years as Welsh secretary from 1990-93. But is there a sturdy body of ideas behind these phrases? And can avowed post-Thatcherites, such as Hunt, who now dominate the cabinet, produce a distinctive new Conservatism for the late 1990s? 'The underlying theme for me is competitiveness,' says Hunt, looking rather crumpled after a whistle-stop tour of the US. He has won praise from many on the right of his party for his vigorous parliamentary performances defending the competitiveness of the UK's labour market and the 'opt-out' obtained by Prime Minister John Major from the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. He claims the employment debate in Europe is now shifting from labour regulation towards UK-style flexibility, partly inspired by the earlier-than-expected downward trend in UK unemployment. But has flexibility been bought at too high a price? Hunt forcefully rejects the criticism that Britain is pursuing a competitiveness strategy based on cheap and low-skilled labour. He is equally dismissive of the view that many British workplaces are ruled by fear of unemployment. 'I don't recognise this atmosphere and I've visited a lot of workplaces in the last three years,' says Hunt. He professes no interest in an overhaul of British labour law to improve employer-employee relationships. He does, however, accept that there can be some conflict between the goal of developing highly skilled, committed and secure workers, and the employment flexibility required by tough and sometimes unpredictable global markets. His answer is Investors In People, the government-backed initiative to encourage companies to connect training to their broader business objectives. However, after two years, fewer than 400 companies have qualified. The government cannot have a direct role in promoting competitiveness, Hunt says, reflecting his view that government is a 'necessary evil'. That fits with his concept of the social market that free markets create the prosperity to provide resources for generous welfare benefits. This all sounds very orthodox. But his right-wing opponents in the party - advocates of minimum welfare, minimum tax and minimum state - have some grounds for discomfort. Away from the Mormons, Hunt confides his doubts about whether US-style workfare can be applied to the UK's benefits system. As part of the government's public spending review in the run-up to the November Budget, he is examining ways of cutting welfare dependency, but he stresses: 'One of the strengths of our system is that we provide unemployment benefit indefinitely.' Hunt is also keen to see the government's 'highly successful' Training and Enterprise Councils 'getting much more involved in economic development' - in plainer words, industrial policy. He refuses to be drawn on whether there is, or should be, a future for collective bargaining in the UK, saying only that 'it is up to employers and employees to choose'. But he does say 'my door is open' to the Trades Union Congress, and even advises the unions to cut their exclusive links with the Labour party, in favour of broader political contacts 'with the Conservative party and others'. For all his radical gestures Hunt has prospered in his 14 years in government, including a period as deputy chief whip, and has survived close association with the poll tax. He has a courteous, clubbable manner, and has generally won the respect of colleagues and civil servants. He is a strategic politician, preferring to leave the details to officials. Speculation that he could succeed the prime minister seems far-fetched, although he appears to have the necessary ambition. As a political philosopher he has been less successful. A recent speech to the Tory Reform Group, written with Michael McManus, a former member of the Social Democratic party and now Hunt's political adviser, attempted a synthesis between the free-market individualism of the Thatcherites and his own more pragmatic views, but concluded rather limply that choice and responsibility were the Tory concepts for the 1990s. The attempt to express his views without causing too much offence to his free-market colleagues also leads Hunt into some strange convolutions. In a recent speech he said it was the government's duty 'where necessary, to remedy market failure through direct intervention'. He added later: 'When we in government speak about partnership, we are not therefore speaking about nationalisation, nor about interventionism nor about corporatism.' One of his close political colleagues says the real clue to Hunt is that his ideas spring primarily from sentiment and experience. What divides him from the Euro-sceptics, for example, seems to be more an attitude than strongly differing views about monetary policy or national sovereignty in Europe. He agrees, saying that much of the Maastricht dispute was 'completely unnecessary and not founded on true policy divisions'. His own Europhile roots he traces to his time as a leading member of half a dozen youth organisations - including the Young Conservatives and the British Youth Council - through which he became friends with young leaders from other European countries, such as Volker Ruhe, now German defence minister. Hunt also speculates that his enthusiasm for Europe, 'which really brought me into politics', stems from his background in an 'outward looking Liverpool shipping family'. The family owned the first iron ship to cross the Atlantic, but Hunt, who rejected the sea to become a solicitor before going into politics, says he has learnt a cosmopolitan attitude and a deep dislike of corporate socialism from his Liverpool roots. Yet when he talks about Europe it becomes evident that the differences within his party are not just of attitude. Moving up a rhetorical gear he speaks of 'deeper dimensions . . . ever closer union of the European peoples' and of Europe being 'substantially more than just an economic free-trade zone'. We are likely to see and hear a lot more of David Hunt in the next few years. To date he has made his mark as an ideological juggler rather than as the author of a coherent new Tory philosophy. But if his party ever loses an election, his hour may come.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1942    Born north Wales.

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo backs US drive on labour Developing country members of Gatt would benefit from a US proposal to establish an organisation to discuss the issue of labour standards and trade, Japan's ambassador to Gatt said yesterday, Michiyo Nakamoto reports from Tokyo. Mr Nobutoshi Akao said 'developing countries should not be too worried,' about the US proposal, since the proposal was merely to discuss the issue rather than make any decisions right away. The US has threatened to upset the signing of the Uruguay Round agreement in Marrakesh next week by insisting its proposal to establish a committee to discuss labour standards under Gatt be included in the declar-ation. The US proposal is strongly opposed by developing countries, which fear the issue of labour standards could be used against them as a protectionist measure by industrialised countries.</p>

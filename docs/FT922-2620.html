			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / BT loses at least CDollars 256m on disposal of Mitel stake BRITISH Telecommunications will suffer a loss of at least CDollars 256m (Pounds 116m) on the disposal of its controlling stake in Mitel, the troubled Canadian telephone equipment maker. BT, which put its 51 per cent stake up for sale more than two years ago, agreed yesterday to sell its shares to nine unidentified investment partnerships in Canada, Bermuda and the UK represented by Schroder Ventures, venture capital arm of Schroders, UK merchant bank. The investors are paying BT an initial CDollars 1 a Mitel share. They will also pay BT a third of any profit earned from the re-sale of the shares in the next five years, to raise the total to a maximum of CDollars 1.64 a share, or about CDollars 66m. BT will share in Mitel's profits after five years even if the new owners do not sell their shares. The buyers are not planning any follow-up offer to minority shareholders. BT bought its stake in Mitel in 1985 for CDollars 8 a share, or a total of CDollars 321m (then worth Pounds 160m). Mr Anthony Griffiths, Mitel's chairman, yesterday estimated BT's total investment at CDollars 350-CDollars 360m, including research and development grants. The investment was intended to be the first stage of a growing presence in telecommunications equipment manufacturing. BT subsequently decided to concentrate on network management, and put its Mitel shares up for sale in early 1990. The sale was announced after the close of trading in London, where BT shares had ended 3p lower at 348p, but while BT's American depositary receipts were still being traded in North America. In New York, the ADRs closed unchanged at Dollars 64 7/8 . Mr Barry Romeni, BT's group finance director, said yesterday: 'BT has focused on its key mission of providing network-based services to customers around the world. Manufacturing telecommunications equipment is not part of this strategy and this disposal effectively ends BT's direct involvement in manufacturing.' Mr Griffiths said uncertainty about future ownership was the single biggest difficulty Mitel has recently faced in the marketplace. He said BT's involvement was originally 'very positive' but it had provided no support for the past 2 1/2 years. Mitel has incurred losses for six of the past eight years. In the year to March, it lost CDollars 5.7m on revenues of CDollars 406m, although it earned a small fourth-quarter profit. Mitel specialises in small and mid-sized office switchboards. It has manufacturing facilities in Canada, the US and south Wales. The UK accounted for a quarter of revenues last year. Mr Henry Simon, a Schroder Ventures partner, said the buyers were especially attracted by Mitel's strong engineering expertise and the potential to develop new products. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A.'S HISTORIC AMBASSADOR HOTEL WILL BE OFFERED FOR SALE TODAY  </P> <P> The historic Ambassador Hotel, once a playground for film stars, business  tycoons and even royalty -- and the site of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's  assassination in June, 1968 -- will be offered for sale today through a sealed  bidding process, the owners announced.  </P> <P> The 68-year-old, mid-Wilshire hotel closed its doors last January amid reports  that a joint venture of British and American developers was negotiating to buy  the property for $60 million.  </P> <P> The partnership included London-based Walker Power Corp. Ltd., owners and  developers of retail and leisure facilities primarily in Britain, and Scott  Malkin, a New York City developer whose family owns or has controlling  interests in the Empire State Building and commercial properties nationwide.  </P> <P> Morgan-Stanley Realty in New York said that under the new bidding process,  potential buyers for the 23.5-acre site can submit a preliminary "non-binding  offer" by June 1. After that, a select group of bidders will be invited to  submit formal, binding offers.  </P> <P> The seller is the J. Myer Schine family trusts. Schine, a theater and hotel  magnate who died in 1971, bought the Ambassador in 1946.  </P></p>

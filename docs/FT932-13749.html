			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Governance changes 'not productive' THE LATEST innovations in corporate governance have had little effect in improving the performance of British business, according to a study released today. It says that adding non-executive directors to the board or splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive, as the recent Cadbury committee on corporate governance recommended, have hardly any impact on earnings per share or other key financial indicators. The study comes in the latest edition of the Corporate Register published by Hemmington Scott, the information group, and covers all 1,533 UK-quoted companies, excluding investment trusts. Mr Peter Scott, who co-ordinated the research, said: 'One can't point to any empirical evidence that this kind of governance has made any practical difference. I think the jury is out.' Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the Cadbury committee, said use of the indicators referred to was 'superficial' and gave no indication of the quality of the non-executive directors involved. The research does not consider the non-financial benefits which non-executive directors might bring to a board. But the Cadbury committee's voluntary code relies on shareholders to exert pressure on companies for better corporate governance. The findings indicate that they have little financial incentive to lobby for these changes. The study shows that for the median-quoted British company there was no earnings per share growth over the past five years, but for the median company, with a combined chairman and chief executive, reported earnings increased by 1.7 per cent. For the best-performing quarter of companies earnings per share rose 12.6 per cent, but the figure was up 13.9 per cent for companies with no non-executives and 13.4 per cent for those with a combined chairman and chief executive. Just 8 per cent of quoted companies now have no non-executive directors and only 21 per cent have a combined chairman and chief executive, the study shows. Arthur Andersen Corporate Register.

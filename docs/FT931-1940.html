			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Arts: Jackie Mason - Theatre Everyone should see Jackie Mason at least once, even Gentiles. The ex-Rabbi from Brooklyn has an indefatigable zest that makes it hard for him to know when to stop. Unless Jews really are different from other people, however, even they might begin to see through the formula. Mason has a marvellous talent for persuading an audience that he is up with the latest news, whatever country he is in. On a previous visit, London was in the throes of the salmonella crisis. 'This is the only country in the world,' he remarked, 'where the sex is safer than the food.' This time he seems to be equally up with the Maastricht Treaty and has fun about people claiming to understand it when plainly they do not. Any attempt at explanations ends in one of his many raspberries. That is in the first half and you go away to the interval thinking how clever he is. The trouble is that in the second half he uses exactly the same technique on Shakespeare. 'Everyone says he's the greatest writer who ever lived . . . How can you tell if no-one can understand a word of what he said?' He quotes a few Shakespeare lines to no particular effect: the result is bathos for the technique has been exposed - Mason trades on headlines, not subtleties. The show falls into two interspersed parts: one (about two thirds of it) is heavily Jewish, the other about broadly contemporary events such as the arrival of President Clinton and the marital failings in the British royal family. The first is hard for Gentiles (as he keeps calling us) to judge, except to say that the joke about prime minister Rabin wanting to give back the West Bank, but he can't because it's in his wife's name, is quite funny, and that a long story about why Jews steal towels from hotels is, well, laborious. Surely all Jews can't be as awful, the men so timid, the women so dominating, as he suggests. Yet maybe the largely Jewish audience, which kept up a murmur of approval throughout, think otherwise. Even the jokes pegged on Britain are largely about money and sex, picked up from the newspapers. 'Do you believe he had an affair with the caterer?' Mason throws in early on. Then on to the Duchess of York: 'You can't play with toes in front of the children]' As for her accountant escort, 'was he counting on her toes? Can't he afford a new computer?' It sounds better than it reads, but still wears thin. It is a pity he does not use talents more widely. He does a sparkling tour d'horizon of the troubles of the world - Iran, Iraq, Yeltsin etc, then retreats to the banal. There is a good take-off of Henry Kissinger being applauded for talking gibberish and an excellent exposure of Sinatra who never seems to finish a song. For the rest, Mason performs like a man who can stop a few nights in any theatre and pick up fistfuls of dollars. At least he admits it. He continues at the Dominion tonight and tomorrow and, for all the caveats, needs to be seen to be disbelieved. Dominion Theatre. Credit Card Hotline (071) 413 1411</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Marketing (Management and Advertising): A very spirited affair Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky is Guinness's most valuable brand asset. It accounts for an estimated third of the group's overall spirits profits and sells more than the combined volume of its two closest rivals, Chivas Regal and Remy Martin cognac, in the international duty-free market. Johnnie Walker's recent development not only exemplifies the Guinness group's shrewd marketing approach; it demonstrates how a good consumer brand can be revived and then extended with a range of complementary products. When Guinness's spirits subsidiary United Distillers acquired the brands in the 1986 takeover of DCL, the old Distillers' company, they were showing signs of neglect. DCL's marketing focus had become blurred in a drive for volume sales. Many of its whisky brands competed against each other. Positioning was confused. Red Label, the world's best-selling Scotch, was supported in Europe by seven different advertising campaigns, each delivering a different message. Guinness restored order. Key brands were repackaged and repositioned to cover different sectors of each geographical market. New advertising campaigns presented a consistent image of high quality and matching lifestyles. Prices reflected the up-market move. The distilling company Johnnie Walker is named after the Kilmarnock shopkeeper who founded the distillery in 1820. Johnnie Walker Red Label and Black Label, a deluxe blend of whiskies up to 12-years-old, were launched in 1909. In 1932, the brand was extended with the launch of Swing, a blend containing 17-year-old malts. Guinness's brand building has been based round Red Label, which was positioned as the leading international premium brand and given a significant slice of the advertising budget. It is now among the three leading brands in 16 of the world's top 20 markets. Priced at about Pounds 10 a bottle, it has sales of 6.5m cases a year. Black Label, with annual sales of 3m cases, provides the first step for aspirational consumers. It is also rewarding for Guinness. Selling one bottle of Black Label instead of two bottles of Red Label gives the company 24 per cent more profit. In some growth markets, such as Thailand, Black Label is the dominant member of the Johnnie Walker family. Swing has found niches in the US, Asia/Pacific, Africa and South America. During the past six years, Guinness has used the Johnnie Walker brand to fill more high-priced and profitable gaps in international markets. In 1987, it launched Johnnie Walker Oldest, since renamed Blue Label, in the duty-free market. It is now available through a few UK outlets at about Pounds 120 a bottle. Gold Label, a 15-year-old blend priced at about Pounds 60, was produced exclusively for the Japanese market in early 1990. It was followed the same year by Johnnie Walker Premier, blended with 25-year-old malts. In Taiwan, it sells for Pounds 400 a bottle. Last year, top-of-the-range Johnnie Walker Honour, a blend of 40-year-old malts, was introduced in Taiwan at Pounds 525 a bottle. Guinness is now test marketing a whisky-based liqueur under the Johnnie Walker brand name in the US.</p>

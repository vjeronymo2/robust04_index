			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Ex-Bestwood chief sentenced MR TONY COLE, the former chairman and chief executive of the Bestwood Group, yesterday received a two-year suspended jail sentence after admitting misappropriating more than Pounds 700,000 from the company to finance his personal share dealing. He was also disqualified from being a company director for 10 years. Sentencing him, Judge Pownall QC said Mr Cole had always intended to repay the money but must have known the misappropriation of the funds was wrong. However, the losses he sustained after the October 1987 stock market crash meant not all the funds could be repaid.</p>

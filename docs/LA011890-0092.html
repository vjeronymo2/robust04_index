			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> YAROSLAVSKY THREATENS TO BAN DEVELOPMENT ON VENTURA BLVD.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky accused developers and city  planners Wednesday of stalling a plan to control Ventura Boulevard growth,  warning that he will try to block all development on the boulevard if the  proposal does not reach the city Planning Commission by the end of February.  </P> <P> "I'm outraged that the consideration of this plan has been delayed,"  Yaroslavsky told an overflow crowd of about 250 at a meeting of the Sherman  Oaks Homeowners Assn.  </P> <P> "If the planning commission does not hear this case by the end of February,  then I will introduce a motion for an ordinance that will stop all development  on Ventura Boulevard," he said, drawing heavy applause. "That's a message to  the Planning Commission."  </P> <P> "I don't want to do a moratorium," he said. "I don't want to have to resort to  radical steps, but I will respond to radical stall tactics."  </P> <P> The Planning Commission had been scheduled to hear the plan in November. The  hearing was first delayed until this month. City planning officials now say  legal difficulties will postpone it until February.  </P> <P> The plan -- which was shaped by city planners, consultants and a citizens  advisory committee -- calls for construction restrictions and traffic  improvements along a 17-mile stretch of Ventura Boulevard in Studio City,  Sherman Oaks, Encino, Tarzana and Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Motorists make about 70,000 trips a day on the busy thoroughfare.  </P> <P> If there were no controls on development, about 40 million square feet of  additional commercial development could be built, generating 150,000 more  vehicular trips, which would result in round-the-clock traffic jams, according  to planners.  </P> <P> The plan proposes limiting development to 8.6 million square feet of commercial  space. With upgraded traffic signals, street widening and other improvements --  to be paid for by assessments on builders -- the boulevard could handle an  additional 29,000 trips a day by the year 2010, planners said.  </P> <P> The proposal has provoked arguments among developers, community leaders and  homeowner groups since 1987. Property owners say it is too restrictive on  development and too expensive for builders. Homeowners complain that it is not  restrictive enough.  </P> <P> Details of the plan may be revised in other hearings before it reaches the Los  Angeles City Council for final approval.  </P></p>

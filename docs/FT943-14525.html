			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Mercury in row over network fee A war of words erupted yesterday between Mr Don Cruickshank, the telecommunications regulator, and Mercury, the main competitor to British Telecommunications, over payments the company has to make to BT for the use of its network. In unusually strong language for a regulator, Mr Cruickshank condemned as 'unnecessary and shrill' recent Mercury statements about the unfairness of the regulatory regime. However, Ms Maev Sullivan, Mercury's director of strategy, cited remarks of Mr Cruickshank's in March in support of her view that payments made by Mercury to BT for the loss it makes on its local network amounted to a 'tax on competition'. She said Mr Cruickshank had said that the payments - called 'access deficit contributions' - would come to look like an accounting fiction. Oftel said the remarks referred to the case for greater transparency in BT's accounts, a policy it is currently pursuing. The dispute came as Mr Cruickshank announced a two-year exemption from the payments for eight new operators in the UK. Until March 1996 the operators - ACC, Worldcom, Colt, MFS, Energis, Telewest, Videotron and Nynex - are unlikely to have to pay BT to help cover the estimated Pounds 1.45bn it lost last year on maintaining its local network. The loss is incurred because BT is not allowed to raise its line rental and connection charges in line with its local network costs. Under the terms of BT's licence, Oftel can grant waivers to operators, provided their traffic does not exceed 15 per cent in each of the UK's international and national telecoms markets. The maximum value of the waivers to other operators is about Pounds 150m. Mr Cruickshank said the waivers would 'assist new entrants to establish themselves in the UK'. But he committed himself to a broad review of the future of access deficit contributions, which was welcomed by Mercury. Some analysts were surprised at Oftel's decision to grant waivers to operators competing largely or exclusively in the international market. They attributed the move to Oftel's desire to persuade US authorities of the openness of the UK telecoms market. Mercury has paid more than Pounds 50m in access deficit contributions in respect of its international calls. It is estimated to have more than 20 per cent of the UK's international market, but it is unlikely this year to reach the level at which it would have to make payments for its domestic traffic.

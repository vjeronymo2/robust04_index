			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Letter: Innocent have no need of silence Sir, Robert Rice's description ('The ass brays over the silence of the lamb', January 30) of the law as 'an ass' in the matter of a 'right to silence' is surely not only right but a reason to change it - the law, that is. The so-called right to silence is claimed on the ground of avoiding incriminating oneself. How ridiculous] In a just society the guilty should be encouraged to incriminate themselves, and the innocent would not be capable of doing so by telling the truth. As a layman, I despair at the widening gulf between the law and justice, which serves only to help lawyers get ever fatter by splitting hairs to protect the guilty.

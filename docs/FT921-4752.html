			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: How to protect the family nest egg - Tax-efficient settlements HARD TIMES mean that the preservation of wealth is top of the home agenda. The 'family settlement' is a vital tool in protecting the wealth of your family. It can be used for tax mitigation as well as a mechanism to preserve wealth against the ravages of spendthrift children and over-zealous creditors. Money in a family settlement is no longer owned by you, (the settlor). But, importantly, neither is it owned by your children or grandchildren (the beneficiaries), to do with and spend as they please. It is owned by trustees  -one of whom could be yourself  - who control and manage the trust money in accordance with your instructions as set out in the trust deed. This is of particular relevance to aspiring entrepreneurs who use a family settlement as a means of distributing the family's nest eggs to protect family wealth from bad luck in business. But this is not a wheeze to escape creditors altogether. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, if within two years of setting up the trust an order of bankruptcy is made against you, the trustee in bankruptcy can have the trust set aside and make the assets available to your creditors. Similarly a trust can be set aside if it took place within two to five years of the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, if it can be shown that you were insolvent at the time of, or as a result of, setting up the trust. Even after five years, a creditor can still have a settlement set aside but only if he can prove to the court's satisfaction that the settlement was created with the intention of defeating creditors. After five years, however, this is usually an uphill struggle. Another common incentive for setting up a family settlement is to protect the family wealth from bounty-hunting spouses. If you create a family settlement for your children or grandchildren it is unlikely that your spouse will be able to overturn it, or have this taken into account, unless it was set up deliberately to defeat a divorcing spouse's claim. The situation is not so clear if you set up a trust for a child, which specifically excludes his wife from benefit. Following the case of Browne v Browne 1988, a court can take into account the realistic expectations from a settlement. Just because money is in the family settlement does not mean that it is dead money. Provided the trustees exercise their duties in accordance with the trust deed and the ultimate benefit of the beneficiaries, there is nothing to stop them investing in the shares of your family company or in your new joint venture. There are also many tax advantages in setting up a family settlement, although these vary according to the type of trust created. If you set up a grandchildren's settlement, the income paid to your grandchild will be taxed as his or her personal income. This is not true of a children's settlement established by a parent. Very often it is overlooked that a grandchildren's settlement is of real financial assistance to the parents, since the income can be used for all spending in connection with the children - including school fees, and clothes. There can also be capital gains tax advantages in trusts. Capital gains made in a trust where income must be paid out to the beneficiaries (ie an interest in possession settlement) will be taxed at only 25 per cent. In other types of settlement the rate is 35 per cent - provided you, the settlor, are not also a beneficiary. Both rates are better than the 40 per cent top rate of CGT. Whether and to what extent the trustees have to pay money to the beneficiaries will depend upon what the trust deed says. Although most settlors would like a trust deed to be fully flexible as to when and to whom payments are to be made, the inheritance tax provisions usually dictate otherwise except for children under 25. Most settlements created today are therefore either flexible trusts for children under 25 (often called 'accumulation and maintenance trusts') or trusts for adults where the income must be paid out to a specific beneficiary and cannot be accumulated (often called 'interest in possession trusts'). Exactly what assets should be transferred into trust will largely depend upon the increase or decrease in value of the settlor's assets since they were acquired. In the Finance Act 1989, gifts into trust or otherwise became chargeable to capital gains tax with a few exceptions. The most notable exceptions are for gifts of private company shares and business assets. If the Labour party is elected, the preservation of wealth through the creation of family settlements could be seriously curtailed. Labour's Policy Review for the 1990s says it will introduce more effective and progressive taxation of inheritance, including lifetime gifts. From then inheritance tax could prohibit the formation of accumulation and maintenance trusts and interest in possession trusts. Therefore, if you are thinking of creating a settlement for your family, you may only have until the election to do so in a tax efficient manner.

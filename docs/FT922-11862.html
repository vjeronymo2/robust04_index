			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudis expected to resist further Opec cuts - Deborah Hargreaves on the issues that will face oil ministers at tomorrow's meeting WHEN THE Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' last meeting in February broke up with a lukewarm agreement on an oil production cut, an immediate slide in oil prices gave rise to fears of a looming market debacle. But this proved to be a knee-jerk reaction which was later reversed. The fact that oil prices have now recovered and are slightly higher than their February level is partly to the credit of Saudi Arabia, which moved swiftly to lead other producers in cutting output. It owes as much though, to renewed tension in the Middle East, in particular, the imposition by the United Nations of sanctions on Libya - although they do not cover oil. Traders have nervously pushed the price of North Sea Brent crude oil for June delivery up above Dollars 19 a barrel in recent days - the price slipped yesterday to Dollars 18.70. In addition, there are glimmers of an upturn in oil demand which are heartening to some market-watchers. But most agree that oil prices are unlikely to move up significantly, much less to approach the Opec target price of Dollars 21 a barrel for its basket of crudes, in the next couple of months. When Opec ministers meet again in Vienna tomorrow to review the state of the market they will hear renewed calls from smaller members for further cuts to be instituted in order to squeeze prices higher - the Opec basket price is at present about Dollars 17 a barrel. Ministers have been posturing in the run-up to the meeting: Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, the Algerian oil minister, would have preferred deeper cuts to be agreed at the last meeting. He now says Opec should not be lulled into a false sense of security by the firmness in oil prices over the past two weeks. Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Iran's oil minister, has said the producers' club needs to make further cuts in output to achieve its Dollars 21 target price. He also wanted a lower production ceiling to be adopted in February, when producers agreed to cutback by about 1m barrels a day to 23m b/d. Mr Aqazadeh pushed for a cut to 22m or 22.5m b/d, but was resisted by Saudi Arabia. The kingdom remains reluctant to trim its flow of oil beyond the 8m b/d mark and Gulf oil officials stress that it is highly unlikely to agree further cuts at Friday's meeting. Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi Arabian oil minister, is likely to press Iran to show its commitment to the last agreement and complete its own cutbacks. Iranian deliveries to the market slowed in February and March, but that was chiefly because bad weather shut its Kharg Island export terminal for several weeks. A survey by the Reuters news agency indicates Iranian production at 3.39m b/d in March, compared with its allocation of 3.184m b/d under the Opec agreement. At the same time, Kuwait's production has increased more rapidly than foreseen in February. It now stands at 900,000 b/d - and is still rising - compared with the emirate's informal quota of 812,000 b/d. 'There should be a lot of discussion about who's sticking to the agreement,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an industry consulting group, 'but they are unlikely to find any consensus for further cuts.' One issue that Opec ministers must address is the action they plan to take once Iraq stages a return to the export market. Baghdad is currently barred from exporting oil by UN sanctions, but remains in discussion with the UN on a plan that would allow sales worth Dollars 1.6bn. 'The return of Iraq to the market is a key variable in the outlook for Opec later this year,' said Mr Ken Miller, market analyst at Purvin and Gertz, the US consultants, 'if they don't come back at all, rising demand will push Opec producers towards their maximum again, which has implications for firming the market.' Mr Miller is predicting demand for Opec oil of 24.5m b/d in the third quarter of this year followed by 24.8m b/d in the fourth quarter (both figures include some 400,000 b/d of condensate). Rising demand - particularly if the US economy picks up - towards the end of the year would make it easier for Opec to accommodate Iraq's return without other producers having to make painful cuts in output. Mr Miller sees US oil demand rising to 17.1m b/d in the third quarter - up just 1 per cent from the same period last year. He is confident demand will continue to rise in the second half of this year and early next. The International Energy Agency, the west's oil industry monitoring agency, is forecasting a rise in world demand to 66.8m b/d this year - an increase of 400,000 b/d. The focus for future policy will be on Opec's full summer conference on May 20 when ministers must make decisions about the second half of the year. Opec policy is currently evolving away from basing output levels on historical production quotas towards a system that relates production much more closely to capacity. But this leaves room for much debate about actual capacity levels. Rising demand and prices later this year could save the organisation from any difficult decisions. Mr Mehdi Varzi, oil market analyst at Kleinwort Benson in London, believes that Brent crude prices will top Dollars 20 by the end of September and possibly peak at Dollars 21 to Dollars 22 a barrel.</p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME JUMPS SHIP, SIGNS WITH NBC  </P> <P> NBC and Notre Dame announced Monday that the network will carry live, national  coverage of all home Irish football games for five years, beginning in 1991.  </P> <P> Notre Dame thus becomes the first school in the 64-member College Football  Assn. to make a national television deal of its own.  </P> <P> Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal said that the school plans to remain a member  of the CFA but will not be a part of the organization's television deals with  ABC and ESPN.  </P> <P> Father E. William Beauchamp, Notre Dame executive vice president and  secretary-treasurer of the CFA, said: "The involvement with the television  package is separate from being involved with the CFA."  </P> <P> Terms of NBC's deal with Notre Dame were not announced, but television  executives speculated that it is worth between $40 million and $75 million, or  roughly $10 million per year.  </P> <P> ABC announced Jan. 17 that it had purchased rights to the CFA for $210 million  over five years. ESPN announced in October its purchase of the group's cable  rights for $110 million over five years.  </P> <P> Under ABC's deal, the three USC-Notre Dame games at South Bend, Ind., during  the term of the contract would more than likely have been shown nationally. But  most of the other Notre Dame home games would have been shown regionally.  </P> <P> Rosenthal said he had problems with ABC's plan to show Notre Dame games only  regionally.  </P> <P> "It would almost be better for us not to be on than to be on in only part of  the country," he said.  </P> <P> ABC said in a statement: "ABC and the CFA have an agreement to televise the  home games of all 64 member institutions beginning in the 1991 season. The  agreement was reached on Jan. 16 and ratified unanimously the following day by  the CFA television committee.  </P> <P> "At this point, ABC Sports intends to pursue all remedies available to protect  its agreement with the CFA from interference by third parties, including NBC  Sports, and to ensure participation of all CFA-member institutions."  </P> <P> ESPN declined comment.  </P> <P> David Ogrean, the CFA's assistant executive director for television, said: "It  would be premature to speculate on how the CFA membership may be affected.  </P> <P> "The CFA television committee will review the situation and consult with the  membership. Both ABC and ESPN, with whom the CFA has agreements commencing in  1991, have expressed interest in continuing their relationship with the CFA."  </P> <P> Notre Dame said it had not given the CFA any guarantees that it would be part  of the new television package.  </P> <P> "In the process of negotiating new contracts, Notre Dame's position was (that)  we would not indicate our position until we had a chance to review that  contract," Rosenthal said.  </P> <P> NBC said it was legally free to conclude a deal with Notre Dame, since the  school had not committed to the CFA's package.  </P> <P> "We did not interfere with an existing relationship," said Dick Ebersol, the  president of NBC Sports.  </P> <P> Ebersol said that, for now, NBC would not attempt to sign contracts with other  schools.  </P> <P> "We have no intention or any basis to seek out other schools," he said.  </P> <P> But he added that NBC "would stand by and see what the developments are in the  other schools."  </P> <P> Sam Jankovich, athletic director at the University of Miami (Fla.), said he  would not rule out a similar plan for the Hurricanes, the 1989 national  champions.  </P> <P> "Miami did approve the latest TV agreement that was proposed by the CFA with  ABC, but we have not signed off officially on this proposal," Jankovich said.  "At this point, we're going to have to take a step back and assess (Monday's)  developments. We will have to look at how the CFA's plan might be accepted and  then determine what impact it would have on the University of Miami."  </P> <P> The Notre Dame package will begin Sept. 7, 1991, with a game against Indiana.  Other teams on Notre Dame's 1991 home schedule are Michigan State, Pittsburgh,  USC, Navy and Tennessee.  </P> <P> The agreement will not prohibit Notre Dame's road games from being televised by  other networks or cable outlets.  </P> <P> SportsChannel America, the cable network that is 50% owned by NBC, also showed  games against Rice and SMU live, and the rest of the Notre Dame schedule on  tape-delay. It is highly unlikely SportsChannel will televise any games live,  but its delayed telecasts are expected to continue.  </P> <P> Today, one day after ABC apparently lost Notre Dame football, the network is  expected to announce a two-year deal to televise games involving the NFL's new  spring football international venture.  </P> <P> The league, now dubbed the World League of American Football after two name  changes, will start play in the spring of 1991.  </P> <P> The agreement, which is expected to pay the league $12-$15 million a year, will  start off with 12 franchises -- six in the United States, four in Europe and  one each in Mexico and Canada.  </P> <P> New York is the only U.S. city set, with the international sites expected to be  London, Frankfurt, Milan, Barcelona, Montreal and Mexico City.  </P> <P> The ABC contract is only the first step in the television arrangements for the  league, which is headed by Tex Schramm, former president of the Dallas Cowboys,  and overseen by the NFL.  </P></p>

Shortly before his departure, the head of the Romanian  Government delegation made the following statement to our  correspondents:    [Begin Cosea recording] We are leaving for a visit to the  People's Republic of China. Our delegation consists principally  of members of Romania's Council for Reform, but some delegates  of the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Industry have  also joined us. The visit is being made upon the invitation our  council received from China's Committee for Economic  Restructuring. We will have the honor of being received by  China's prime minister and vice president. Practically every  day, we will be able to meet with ministers and important  personalities involved in China's reform.    For us, this visit represents a very interesting element,  because as everyone knows, the Chinese experiment has been a  success. We are not interested in duplicating the Chinese  model; such a thing would be impossible, as the structure and  grandeur of that country compels us to observe the proportions.  However, the key elements of the way in which their new  economic apparatus and market economy was conceived might be  used by us as well. We could use certain elements that our  Chinese friends resorted to in the southern part of their  country, in building up a very large potential for exports there  and in attracting foreign capital. Therefore, this visit may be  regarded as a trip to accumulate experience and training in view  of the Romanian reform.    I would also like to mention another important element of  our  visit, and that is the revival of the economic and political  relations between China and Romania. This is to be a government  visit, and the Chinese Government considers it as an event that  could give impetus to the relations between Romania and China.  China has become an economic world power and forecasts show that  over the next 10 years, it will become one of the most important  economic powers in the world. In my opinion, Romania should be  very interested in not just profiting from that country's  experience, but also in keeping close relations to that Asian  area where such development is taking place and where we are  interested and able to engage in exchanges and cooperation.

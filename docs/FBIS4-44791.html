			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC press release No. IP/94/308: "Establishment in Seville </F> of the Joint Research Centre's Institute for Prospective  Technological Studies"]    [Text] This Friday, 15 April 1994, Professor Antonio  Ruberti, the Commission member responsible for research and  education, and Professor Elias Fereres, Spain's secretary of  state for universities and research, signed an agreement in  Seville setting up the Institute for Prospective Technological  Studies [IPTS] of the European Union's Joint Research Centre  [JRC] in the Cartuja Technology Park.    In the words of Professor Ruberti, the JRC's Institute for  Prospective Technological Studies is a key component of the  mechanism being set up by the Commission for the study and  monitoring of developments in science and technology and for the  assessment of research policy options. The institute, whose  mission is to provide the Community and other European  authorities with objective data and analyses on the broad trends  in science and technology in Europe and the world, will work in  close liaison with the organizations specializing in prospective  studies and technology surveillance within the ETAN network set  up in the framework of the future Programme of Targeted  Socio-Economic Research under the European Union's fourth  Framework Programme of RTD [research and technological  development] (1994-98).    At the same time as the establishment agreement was signed,  the IPTS and Seville University signed a collaboration  agreement. In addition, a European economic interest grouping  (EEIG) composed of the IPTS and undertakings from several  European countries will be created. The Cartuja site's role as  a regional centre for research, technology and innovation will  be further enhanced by the installation in the near future of  Spain's Scientific Research Council next to the IPTS.    The IPTS is one of the eight institutes of the Joint  Research  Centre. These institutes, each of which is specialized in a  particular field (environment, remote sensing, advanced  materials, etc.), conduct part of their activities under the  specific programmes of the Framework Programme of RTD. They  also provide scientific and technical support for the  implementation of the Community's major policies in the field of  the environment, energy, agriculture, etc.    In the coming years, the IPTS will set up a "European  Science  and Technology Observatory." This observatory, working in  liaison with the equivalent bodies at national and European  level, will be charged with collecting, processing and  disseminating information on research and technological  development policies in the industrialized countries, and their  evolution. In addition, a technology monitoring system will be  developed to detect new scientific breakthroughs and  technological innovations at an early stage, and to draw them to  the attention of community policymakers.  <H5>  Annex: List of the Eight JRC Institutes </H5>   --ISPRA (Italy): 1.

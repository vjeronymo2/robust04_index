			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tran Huu Nghiep, M.D., teacher, member of the Ho </F> Chi Minh City's Writers Association]    [Text] In the introduction to the "Human Comedy," Balzac  wrote: "French society is the real narrator. I am just just the  secretary who records things." I would like to ask if Vietnamese  society today has such a secretary in such works as "Noi Buon  Chien Tranh" [The Sorrows of War], "Ly Than," "Noi Loan" [To  Rebel], "Bi Kich Nho" [A Small Tragedy], "Chuyen Lang Cuoi" [The  Story of Chuoi Village], and so on. Naturally, in fictional  literary works, imagination plays a very important role. I am  not naive or simple-minded like the woman who looked at a  painting by Matisse and then said: "He painted this woman with  unequal arms." To which the famous painter responded: "You are  greatly mistaken! This is not a woman but a painting."    The act of creation, how the artist subtracts or adds  things,  starts from the guiding idea of the artist, because each artist  must obtain the "materials to construct" his works from real  life. Two-hundred years ago, Goethe said that the materials used  to create a work have things in common with the author that they  can easily see, grasp, and write about or create. Thus, the  plots may have something in common with the author, but that is  not true for the majority of readers. Three centuries ago, a  talented French writer who was a social realist, Boileau,  commented that the best poem or the loftiest idea cannot make a  person happy if that person's ears are damaged.    I think that the ears of many people were damaged when they  read "To Rebel," "A Small Tragedy," and a number of other recent  works even though, in the words of Goethe, they perhaps had many  things in common with the mood of the author. In "To Rebel," the  detailed descriptions in the rooms or beneath the waters off the  coast of Vung Tau and the "collapse" of the degenerate writers  in former Saigon all "salute defeat." I remember that the  "forces to defend national culture" at that time condemned the  immorality of a number of those works. "A Small Tragedy" is  another immoral work. Actually, the motive resembles that of  "Hon Vong Phu" as portrayed in several Taiwanese videos, which I  have seen recently: Two siblings have the same father but  different mothers. Because of historical events, they do not  recognize each other. They fall in love and intend to marry. But  in Taiwan, the writer did not dare allow the characters to  engage in incest. As for the concept that the family is  "lasting," when the young man arrives from mainland China, he is  constantly portrayed as stupid and rustic. In "A Small Tragedy,"  Quang, an overseas Vietnamese who is now a French citizen,  returns to his native country. He is wealthy, well-educated, and  polite. Uncle Ca likes him very much and says: "Vietnamese  should be polite like him. For several decades, we have been  waging a revolution and have forgotten how to be polite. That is  very important." (Page 36)    At the beginning of "A Small Tragedy," the author devotes an  entire page to write the one sentence: "I offer my great love."  Reading the book, I looked for the target of "my great love."  Was it a person? The fatherland? Or a system to constantly  improve mankind that we can respect? I had been very careless,  because the author had clearly provided the answer on page 34  (line 6): "If you have loved, will you encounter great love like  Cay? That is not easy."    Based on the examples cited, recent short stories and novels  in our country are filled with falsehoods. As the philosopher  Jean Paul Sartre would say, I hope that in the coming period,  these "falsehoods do not become beliefs" that writers want to  transmit to readers. In my view, all writers have their own  ideas about life. When they write something, they want to  construct a world of man and things in order to represent those  ideas.    Thus, after reading a short story or novel, I usually try to  understand what secret ideas the author really wanted to present  through his characters and scenes.    Even though I know that Vu Ngoc Phan, in his book "Modern  Writers," has divided Vietnamese novels into ten categories and  that the researcher Thanh Lang has organized works by their  creative tendency (emotion, struggle, realism, humor, memoirs,  and so on), I want to divide the works that I have read into two  types: the constructive type that fosters confidence in people  and the type that sows doubts in people. I would like to share  this viewpoint with readers.    Unfortunately, it must be noted that recently, many short  stories and novels of the second type have appeared on the  market.    Naturally, writers will counter by saying that "my intention  in portraying the evils in society is to help improve society."  I don't want to waste time arguing but would simply like to cite  an observation made by a well-known aesthetician: "Distortions  of reality and the truth certainly follow propagating unethical  principles and lead to nullifying what is beautiful. Even though  this may not be the intention of the writer, refusing to portray  social life as it is is a defense for base instincts, a  beautification of many evils in the hottest selling  publications, and a manifestation of what is called serving mass  literature." (Avener Ziss, "Elements d'Esthetique Marxiste,"  Progress Publishing House, 1977, page 60]    This phenomenon has existed in literary circles recently.  Without going into too much detail, I will limit my thought to  two works, "Ke Sat Nhan Luong Thien" [The Upright Murderer] and  "Noi Buon Chien Tranh."    After finishing "Ke Sat Nhan Luong Thien," I felt as if I  had  read a work steeped in the philosophy of "L'homme Revolte" [The  Rebel] by Albert Camus, ideas that he wanted to convey to  European youths following the world war. According to Camus, man  seeks the exalted in revolt, because this is the task of the  "present" of everyone. This is existentialism. In our society  today, not all murderers can be viewed as upright people. Isn't  there another way of revolting if we still believe in the system  and place ourselves among the people of the system? In the old  society, there may have been upright murderers. Such as Chi  Pheo, whom Thi Mo viewed as "at times being as mild as a dove"  but who later stabbed Ba Kien to death before killing himself.  In the story "Ke Sat Nhan Luong Thien," the system has never  rejected the main character's position as a human being. He has  never suffered injustices as great as those mentioned in the  press for so long without anything being done. Or we could ask  any elderly cadre who left home after 23 September 1945. They  could tell several stories about their old homes (the homes of  their parents or homes that they purchased being leaving), which  they have not demanded be returned to them. Instead, with  confidence in the system that they helped build with their sweat  and blood, their "revolt" has followed a different course. No  one has become a murderer. Instead, various medals are pinned on  their chests.    I would also like to say something about "Noi Buon Chien  Tranh." The great emotions that the author wanted to portray are  contained in the final section. Absurdly, "during the  Vietnamese-American war, people shared the same fate with ups  and downs, victories and defeats, happiness and suffering, death  and life." (page 281)    After finishing the book, I thought about a number of the  works of the great existentialist Jean Paul Sartre and his  arguments about the "nausea" of human existence.    The materialistic philosophers of Marxism-Leninism have  commented a lot on existentialism. Here, I will simply quote  Jules Romains, a very progressive writer: "In taking up arms in  war, no one can say that he is a victim or that he is naive or  uninvolved." Thus, people must think hard before deciding  whether to desert or enlist. Desertion? The person will lose  honor among people of his own generation and others in his  native village, and he may even lose his loved ones. Thus, he  must elect to "enlist," hoping for the day there is peace. After  the war, desires may not be fulfilled or they may be fulfilled  only partly. Thus, there is sadness.    As a doctor, I have had a chance to attend the "inventories  of individual assets" of many northern youths who went to B and  later died of malaria or hematuria. I have read the very private  diaries of a number of these people before the diaries were  turned over to their unit before being returned to the family. I  can assure you that none of these diaries contained any thoughts  about "the sorrows of war."    Meeting a number of cadres who were wearing military  uniforms  and handling B-52 bombs in the forests, I asked them their  feelings about past events. All of their views can be summarized  by a poem by the French poet Alfred de Vigny, who wrote a poem  in praise of the heroism of those who fight and make sacrifices  in self-defense: "Signs, tears, and cries for mercy are all  insignificant." Or as Goethe wrote: "If the suffering enables us  to gain happiness, what does the suffering matter?"    Someone will surely ask: How much does happiness cost? My  response is, We have already discarded two layers of "rock" that  pressed the heart and mind of Phan Boi Chau his entire life.  Those are the disgrace of losing the country and the nation's  poverty in the eyes of the world. We have replaced that with the  rose of wonderful hopes for the future of the country and men of  humanism.    Are there negative aspects in society today? Of course there  are. President Ho said: "There is nothing more precious than  independence and freedom." But because they were slaves for so  long, many people are not yet awake enough to realize that they  are the masters of their homeland and that they are free. I  would like to use the title of one of the novels by Albert  Camus. People mistakenly view themselves as "the stranger" in  their own land.    Our party knows that freeing mankind from unjust oppression,  poverty, backwardness, and corruption is very difficult. Thus,  it has called for a resolute struggle by all people. I think  that writers, more than anyone, should be aware of this.</p>

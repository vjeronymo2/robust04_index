			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara (DPA) -- On Monday [11 April], Turkey warned  Germany against "provocations and anti-Turkish propaganda from  the camp of the opponents of good German-Turkish relations."  Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said in Ankara on Monday  that "normal military cooperation" will also continue after last  Thursday's halting of arms deliveries. The auxiliary supplies  within the framework of NATO defense aid are affected.    Cetin affirmed that Turkey continues to adhere to the  conditions and is using the BTR-60 and BTR-80 armored personnel  carriers supplied by Germany from the stocks of the GDR People's  Army in the internal controversy with Kurdish extremists from  the ranks of the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). He thinks it  is completely normal that the FRG Government is taking the time  to follow up on the accusations because of the tremendous  domestic policy pressure and to examine whether the arms  delivered from Germany were used in violation of the agreements,  which, however, is not the case.</p>

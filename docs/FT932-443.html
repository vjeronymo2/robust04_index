			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: BR pressed over rolling stock MR JOHN MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday urged British Rail to decide 'as quickly as possible' where new orders for rolling stock should be placed. BR is in the process of inviting tenders for supplying new rolling stock financed by Pounds 150m of government money, Mr MacGregor told the Commons. The Pounds 150m was made available for leasing new rolling stock or trains. Mr Hugh Bayley (Lab York) called for a contract to be placed with Asea Brown Boveri. He said: 'This is the last surviving company in Britain that actually manufactures railway body shells, and unless we get orders quickly it will close.' Mr Bayley warned that closure would mean importing railway body shells 'at huge cost to the balance of payments'. He said 532 jobs had been lost at ABB's plant in York due to a lack of orders arising from the government's proposals for privatising BR. Mr MacGregor replied that the redundancies were largely due to the recession, rationalisation and the switching of priorities, and had nothing to do with the planned privatisation of the network. He said there had been a 'huge improvement' in productivity since ABB entered the private sector so that it now had improved opportunities for securing overseas orders. Sir Roger Moate (C Faversham) suggested that the Pounds 150m should be seen as the first stage in a continuing ordering programme. Mr MacGregor refused to predict the outcome of negotiations over the level of public expenditure in future years, and added that he hoped private-sector finance would be available for the leasing market.</p>

			<p>941022 FT  22 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: EU is about domestic policy Sir, Ian Davidson reproduces the misconception which is a flaw in the UK's attitude towards the EU - that European policy is a part of foreign policy and so is remote from everyday existence ('Blair's EU labours', October 12). The EU is about domestic policy and should be interwoven in all our debates. Only then will the British get to grips with 'Europe'. It was presumably in recognition of this that Tony Blair gave his deputy, John Prescott, a European remit. Gary Titley, 16 Spring Lane, Radcliffe, Manchester M26 2TQ</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Thai-Cambodia border at Aranyaprathet district  in Sa Kaeo province has been closed indefinitely in order to  protect the safety of Thai citizens, National Security Council  [NSC] secretary-general Charan Kunlawanit said yesterday.    Gen Charan said the action was taken because of a spate of  recent incidents that included the torching of a border market,  stray shells landing on the Thai side of the border and armed  robberies staged against Thai villagers by Khmer bandits.    "These are dangerous incidents and to prevent such threats  to  our people we have closed the border for an indefinite period of  time," Gen Charan said.    He did not say when the border, closed since April 5, would  be reopened.    Commenting on why the Thai authorities are taking action  only  when such incidents frequently recur, Gen Charan said: "The  truth is that the fighting in Cambodia has caused damage and  hardship to Thai people. Their livestock have also been killed  or wounded by stray Khmer artillery shells.    "But we have not complained and the world community does not  know how we suffer. And when the Khmer people are in hardship,  they run over to take refuge here. We helped them without  asking for assistance. Those that are criticising us should  look at themselves to see if they are doing the right thing."    Gen Charan said that closing the border was an attempt to  save Thai lives and reorganise regulations so that officials can  better look after the border area and reduce the danger faced by  Thai villagers.    Commenting on the Cambodian complaint that the border  closure  was harming them economically, Gen Charan said: "We have been  helping Cambodia since 1975. That's 20 years already and we  have never asked for anything back. It's normal that the  closure of the border would have some effect. Those who used to  have it good will start to realise what the situation really is.    "We insist that the closure of the border is necessary so  that we can reorganise law and order in the area to ensure  safety."    Commenting on the intentions of Cambodian government leaders  who repeatedly accuse Thailand of helping the Khmer Rouge, Gen  Charan said that Prime Minister Chuan Likphai had talked to the  Cambodian leaders, including the Khmer foreign minister, about  discussing problems through existing proper channels.    "However, the Cambodian Government has never contacted the  Thai Government through these channels when problems arise.  Given the good relations between the two countries the  Cambodians should not be saying anything to Thailand through a  third party -- the international wire agencies."    Gen Charan, however, said he did not believe agency reports  quoting Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh during  his trip to Malaysia that Thailand helped the Khmer Rouge escape  government attacks on Pailin.    During the interview the prince also called on Malaysia to  help persuade Thailand to allegedly give up supporting the  genocidal Khmer Rouge.    "I am sure the Cambodian leader did not say that and would  have kept the promise he made to our prime minister when he  officially visited Cambodia on January 12," Gen Charan said.    He added: "If the prince really criticised us in Malaysia,  our friend would have told us. But this is just news and we  honour the Cambodian leader as a gentleman and an intelligent  person."    Gen Charan said because Thailand had never complained about  stray Khmer shells falling in Thailand, the world community  appears ready to believe allegations of Thai support for the  Khmer Rouge.    "Why should Thailand be so stupid as to support the Khmer  Rouge since we have always wanted to see peace in Cambodia for  the past 20 years? Those saying this are not using their brains  before speaking out."    He said that when Thailand enquires about reported comments  made by the Cambodian Government, Phnom Penh "never says  anything".    Asked if Cambodia was making Khmer Rouge allegations against  Thailand to get international attention and win further aid  development, Gen Charan said that he did not want to answer this  question.    "I think the world community is more interested in peace  rather than seeing them kill each other," Gen Charan said. He  said the issue of Cambodia's allegations against Thailand may be  discussed at the next meeting of the National Security Council.</p>

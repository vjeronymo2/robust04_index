			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Observer: Gulag graft Talking of the EBRD, one man hoping to make a killing at the bank's annual meeting in St Petersburg next April is Roger Garside, former public relations chief of the London Stock Exchange. Garside and a couple of cronies are sending themselves to Siberia for three months to scout out promising investment opportunities, salt mines not excluded. Working out of the Siberian branch of the Academy of Sciences in Novosibirsk, they will prospect for investment opportunities all the way from the Urals in the west to the Kamchatka peninsula. The region has the highest ratio of untapped natural resources per inhabitant anywhere in the world, according to Garside, who hopes to launch the first European investment fund for Siberia. A man in a hurry, he wants to have a portfolio of investment opportunities ready in time to show them off at the EBRD's St Petersburg bash. Another sign that the fashion for emerging markets is getting out of hand?</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / US rate rises curb interest earnings across the spread: Flattening yield curve squeezes profits at securities firms While companies across the US this past week have been worrying about what the latest increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve will do to the economy and their earnings over the next year, Wall Street securities firms have been busy focusing on the flattening of the yield curve, and what it is doing to their earnings right now. The yield curve, a graphical depiction of interest rates on securities with varying maturities, has been steadily flattening since the Fed started raising interest rates in February. At the start of the year, the curve was relatively steep because of a wide spread between yields on short-term and and long-term government securities. At the time, the spread between the two-year and the 30-year bond was 210 basis points. Since then, the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening has pushed short-term yields up faster than long-term yields, so the spread has narrowed and the yield curve has flattened. Last week, the yield spread between two-year and 30-year bonds fell below 100 basis points for the first time since December 1990. The curve has flattened because investors in long-term government securities have begun to believe that the Fed's anti-inflation measures will work. This has restrained bond yields because the less fearful investors are of inflation, the less likely they are to demand a higher yield. Investors at the short end of the bond market, however, remain worried that the Fed may want to tighten policy further, and so have been pushing up yields on short-term government securities in anticipation of another rate rise. The flattening of the yield curve has important implications for earnings of financial companies, including commercial banks and securities firms. It is the latter, however, who are being most affected by the trend. Between 1991 and 1993, when spreads were wide and the curve was steep, Wall Street's biggest firms were borrowing billions of dollars cheaply in the short-term market and using that money to buy longer-term bonds paying rich yields. The result was interest earnings which helped Wall Street to record-breaking profits. Mr Guy Moszkowski, securities industry analyst at broking firm Sanford Bernstein, says: 'When firms carry longer-term debt securities and fund those positions with short-term money, they are earning an attractive spread. That spread is going to contract in a situation where the yield curve is flatter.' Today, such profits are not so easy to come by, he says. For example, Salomon Brothers - the biggest bond trading firm on Wall Street - earned Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 800m) in net interest income last year. This year, with a flatter curve, Salomon's net interest income is estimated to fall to around Dollars 940m. Other factors - the deterioration in trading and underwriting results sparked by rising interest rates and volatile markets - have hit earnings, but the decline in interest income is important because it made up such a large part of earnings during the 1991-1993 boom. Marketmaking and broking revenues are also affected, as a treasurer at a large securities firm explains. 'A flattening curve makes it difficult for us to carry securities, and forces us to shrink our inventory positions. This means that the willingness of brokers to hold positions (for customers) will decline, which generally hurts liquidity in the marketplace and discourages customer activity.' For the immediate future, the situation can only get worse because the yield curve will almost certainly get flatter, and may eventually become inverted. The curve inverts when yields on short-term securities are higher than on long-term securities, which usually occurs when interest rates have peaked and are about to head lower. The last time the curve inverted was 1989, before the Fed starting cutting interest rates, and given that the Fed may be near to ending its tightening 'some believe that an inverted curve is inevitable soon', says Mr Moszkowski. An inverted yield curve would play havoc with Wall Street, he says. 'Firms would begin shrinking their balance sheets substantially as inventories would become very expensive to carry.' Companies would widen the spreads between their buying and selling prices to make up for lost interest earnings, which would only further undermine liquidity and reduce trading activity.</p>

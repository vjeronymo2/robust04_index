			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Portuguese bank falls 42% to Es8.1bn Banco Portugues de Investimento (BPI), Portugal's leading investment bank, registered a 42 per cent drop in consolidated net profits last year, compared with 1992, to Es8.1bn (Dollars 46m). Mr Artur Santos Silva, BPI president, attributed the fall in profits to a 29 per cent reduction in the margin between loans and deposits, and a substantial increase in provisions from Es3.8bn in 1992 to Es8.3bn last year. BPI, which wholly owns the privatised retail bank Banco Fonsecas e Burnay, partly compensated for a slow 3 per cent growth in consolidated credit with a 22 per cent rise in commission-based earnings and a 59 per cent increase in profits from financial operations, mainly government debt security trading. Secil, a Portuguese cement producer due for privatisation later this year, has announced a 5.5 per cent increase in profits in 1993 to Es4bn. Sales remained virtually unchanged at Es22bn.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Sterling's weakness continued to carry the COPPER market higher at the London Metal Exchange. Prices ended higher in pound terms for the sixth successive trading day with cash metal closing at Pounds 1,537 a tonne, up Pounds 15.50 on the day and Pounds 114.50 from the level ruling just over a week ago. But virtually all of that rise reflected the currency factor. Dealers said an early rise on short-covering and options-related buying had taken the three months delivery price up to a resistance level between Dollars 2,400 and Dollars 2,500 a tonne. The subsequent fall had been cushioned by concern over the situation in Zaire, strike action in Mexico and a threatened strike in Chile, they said. Last business had three months metal at Dollars 2,235 a tonne, up Dollars 5 from Monday. ZINC prices surrendered some of the recent gains that had been prompted by production cut announcements. The three months price closed Dollars 13.25 down at Dollars 1,116.50 a tonne. Rising LME stocks and dollar strength kept ALUMINIUM under pressure. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Budget goes through The Clinton administration's Dollars 1,500bn (Pounds 1,027bn) budget for the fiscal year starting in October emerged virtually unscathed from its first run through Congress when the Senate approved it by a 53-46 vote, Jurek Martin writes. Early passage by both houses stands in sharp contrast to last summer's dramas, when it squeaked through by one vote in each chamber. Senator Jim Sasser, budget committee chairman, attributed this to the public perception that real economic progress was being achieved. The budget, with a projected deficit of Dollars 175bn, sets broad spending limits but leaves Congress free to change the mix.</p>

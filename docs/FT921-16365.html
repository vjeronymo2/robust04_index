			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Job cuts by nappy producer SWADDLERS, the Gateshead, Tyne and Wear producer of the UK's second most popular disposable nappy brand, Togs, is shedding 75 jobs. The company is blaming price cutting by retailers of Procter &amp; Gamble's Pampers brand, which has about 68 per cent of the UK disposable nappy market. Togs has a 9 per cent market share, compared with 14 per cent early last year, when Swaddlers employed 250 people. Mr Jim Clough, the managing director, said yesterday the company's 1991 turnover would be about Pounds 27m, 5 per cent to 6 per cent lower than in 1990. Mr Clough said Swaddlers had the support of its Italian parent, the Angelini Group. He was hopeful there would be no more redundancies. The cuts, which will reduce the Swaddlers workforce to 150, are the second blow to hopes of making disposable nappy manufacturing a growth sector in the north-east's economy. Last year Blue Ridge Care, of Consett, Co Durham, went into receivership with the loss of 125 jobs.</p>

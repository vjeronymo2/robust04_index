			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . .: KENNEDY COMEBACK  </P> <P> It's an unexpectedly high time in the career of 74-year-old Tony winner and  five-time Oscar nominee Arthur Kennedy. The veteran actor has two films out  this year.  </P> <P> First, there's the release of the restoration of the legendary 1962 "Lawrence  of Arabia," in which he played Jackson Bentley, an American photo-journalist  based loosely on Lowell Thomas. Then, next month, he plays a  </P> <P> seasoned Maine shipbuilder whose business has fallen on hard times in "Signs of  Life." It's his first film in a decade.  </P> <P> "I threw in the towel in 1978," he says. "I got a phone call shortly after  'Lawrence' in which I accepted an Italian-Russian film. It ("Italiano Brava  Gente") was a huge success in Europe and kept me busy in mostly Italian and  Spanish films for years."  </P> <P> In retrospect, Kennedy felt it turned into a major career mistake. He called  most of the films "stinkers." His feeling of isolation intensified with the  death of his wife in 1975 and a series of eye diseases. Then, he lost his  driver's license and decided, as he was still physically active, to move to  Savannah, Ga., a city where he could get around on foot.  </P> <P> "You have to remember that Los Angeles back in the '40s was a small company  town. The cops would actually drive you home when you got a little tight.  Drinking was the major social activity. I can still remember Errol Flynn giving  Ronnie Reagan a hard time on 'Desperate Journey' because he used to spill out  his glass when he thought no one was looking."  </P> <P> Kennedy graduated from Warner Bros.' stock company in the 1940s to his  Tony-winning role as Biff in "Death of a Salesman" and Oscar nominations as the  crippled brother in "Champion" and the blinded war hero in "Bright Victory." He  held a unique position in American movies for creating sympathetic though  flawed and tortured individuals in such films as "Peyton Place," "Trial" and  "Elmer Gantry."  </P> <P> Not a believer in fate, Kennedy insisted that craft is the only thing that  counts. Still, it was chance that led to his role in "Signs of Life." During a  visit to his daughter, a New York-based actress, her agent told him he'd like  to suggest him for a movie.  </P> <P> "I didn't give it much thought but, true to his word, he called back and set up  a meeting with the producer and director. I read the script and was mighty  impressed. The dialogue, the rhythms, had real quality. What began to seep  through my troubled brain was that I needed a good part and here it was."

Final  </P> <P> WATCH GIVEN TO FOXX BY ELVIS NETS $17,500  </P> <P> A watch given to Redd Foxx by the late Elvis Presley brought $17,500 Monday in  an IRS auction to help pay the comedian's back taxes.  </P> <P> The watch was sold along with about 70 other pieces of jewelry and other items  owned by Foxx in an auction that brought in about $34,000.  </P> <P> The auction followed a May auction of eight vehicles belonging to Foxx that  brought the IRS about $49,000.  </P> <P> Foxx didn't attend Monday's auction, but his attorney, Marc Risman, said he  would be disappointed that the Presley watch brought in so little.  </P></p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Carpet distribution a 'jungle' Carpet distribution in the UK 'has been described as a jungle', according to a recent report from Mintel, the market research organisation. It is 'highly fragmented with a large number of independent retailers and a small number of multiple operators', writes David Blackwell. Allied Maples was the largest single outlet, followed by Carpetright, with 116 stores and a turnover of about Pounds 78m in the year to end-May. Carpetright was set up in 1988 by Sir Philip Harris, former chairman of Harris Queensway, with MFI, and was floated on the Stock Exchange last June. An estimated 9,500 outlets sold floor coverings last year, including just over 6,000 independent retailers. About 2,200 stores were owned by multiples, with the remaining 1,300 belonging to voluntary buying groups such as AIS, Floreat and Green Group, as well as department stores and DIY sheds. Mintel estimates that retail sales this year of machine made rugs and carpets will reach Pounds 1.35bn, up from last year's Pounds 1.3bn but still below the peak of Pounds 1.5bn in 1989. The market has been affected by fragile demand and price discounting which has curbed margins for both manufacturers and retailers. The multiples deal direct with producers, and have the upper hand. The independent retailer either buys from a carpet wholesaler or belongs to a voluntary buying group. Wholesalers distribute 30 per cent of carpets and are reliant on the performance of the independent sector.</p>

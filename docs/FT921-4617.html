			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Consumers may shun high street, study shows THE chancellor may be disappointed if he is counting on tax cuts in this week's Budget to fuel a strong recovery in high-street spending, according to a survey. Asked what they would do if they received a cash windfall such as a tax rebate, 37 per cent of consumers said they would take a holiday, while 14 per cent said they would pay off debts. Only a third said they would use the money to buy clothes or home furnishings. The survey, conducted by Gallup for IPC Magazines in the middle of last month, found that half of consumers saw no end to the recession, while a third said it would last at least another year. In spite of the recession and falling property prices, a fifth of the sample considered their homes as the top spending priority at present, though twice as many said food was the single most important item. Asked what they would spend money on first once the recession ended, almost a third said holidays and a quarter said their homes.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Venezuela draws foreigners A TOTAL of 19 companies and consortia, including BP and Shell, have tendered to operate inactive oil fields in Venezuela, in the first attempt to open up the country's oil industry to foreign investment since it was nationalised in 1976. Over the last 16 years, private companies have not been allowed to work in the production of Venezuelan crude oil. The national oil company, PDVSA, asked for bids on 55 inactive oil fields in nine different geographical areas. Bids were made for five of the areas. PDVSA estimates probable reserves in the nine areas stand at 357m barrels, while possible reserves are 1.17bn barrels. Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez appointed two political opponents to his cabinet yesterday in a reshuffle designed to broaden his support and overcome a leadership crisis, Reuter reports from Caracas. The president, under pressure to resign since a failed February 4 coup attempt, shuffled seven ministers as part of a promise to cobble form a national unity government. He appointed Mr Humberto Calderon Berti, a former oil minister and Opec president, as foreign minister and Mr Jose Ignacio Moreno Leon, was made president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund. Both were members of the opposition COPEI party.</p>

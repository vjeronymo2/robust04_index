			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Brooks Service in Pounds 104,000 deficit A poor trading result has been exacerbated by reorganisation costs in the first half of 1992 at Brooks Service Group, and a pre-tax loss of Pounds 104,000 was incurred compared with a profit of Pounds 336,000. Since the half year the work wear side continued to trade steadily and the retail division had shown some improvement, but linen services had not shown any indication of recovery. Therefore the interim dividend is being passed (1.3p) on losses per share of 0.58p (1.85p). In the half year turnover was Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 11.8m) but generated a profit of only Pounds 55,000 (Pounds 574,000). After interest paid there was a loss of Pounds 214,000 (profit Pounds 288,000), but that was offset by Pounds 110,000 (Pounds 48,000) exceptional credits.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] After the seminar held by the Cabinet of Ministers  on the national programs, an extraordinary government session is  due to be held at Jurmala this evening, at which an official  statement by the Latvian Government will be adopted regarding  the decree of Russian President Boris Yeltsin on creating 30  military bases. As Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs stated  at a news conference this evening, this step by Russia seizes on  the intention not to allow the conclusion of a Latvian-Russian  treaty on troop withdrawal. The premier explained that this  action by Russia makes it practically impossible to conclude  this treaty.    Such a step was to be expected from Russia, as the package  of  agreements is favorable to Latvia and guarantees Latvia's  membership of Europe and the European Union, which is what  Russia dislikes most of all. The Latvian premier believes that  the document was adopted in the interests of Russia's  conservative circles and under their influence, which, as is  evident, concur with the interests of national radicals in  Latvia. Birkavs explained that such action by Yeltsin is also  unacceptable from the viewpoint of international law. Latvian  Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis expressed the view that no  military bases are in any sense necessary for Latvia.    Martins Virsis, leader of the Latvian delegation in the  Latvian- Russian interstate talks, also said that this action by  Yeltsin is contrary to documents already signed, and no such  thing was envisaged in the text of the agreement. This is a new  stance in Russian foreign policy, or it could also be viewed as  pressure from Russian radical forces on the president of Russia.  Virsis said he had consulted Zotov, leader of the Russian  delegation, but at present not even he has access to any more  precise information. Virsis also reported that consultations are  being held with representatives of those countries that  advocated concluding such a Latvian-Russian treaty. At present  it can be predicted that if this decree is not revoked, then the  Latvian-Russian treaty cannot be signed and ratified.</p>

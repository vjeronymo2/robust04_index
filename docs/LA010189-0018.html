			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: MATERIAL MOLL  </P> <P> Madonna and Beatty?  </P> <P> A Madonna rep tells us -- and production sources confirm -- that the blond  bombshell will play '30s nightclub singer-gangster's moll Breathless Mahoney  opposite Warren, who has the title role in the long-delayed "Dick Tracy."  </P> <P> As Breathless she'll sing at least two original songs, yet unwritten. And  she'll attempt to seduce the straight-laced copper away from lady love Tess  Trueheart, who is yet to be cast.  </P> <P> Beatty produces/directs the $30 million-plus Touchstone film, to begin  production in February, to be filmed on the Universal lot, according to  sources.

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTEST DISRUPTS BUSH'S SPEECH  </P> <P> I have known and admired Mary Brent Wehrli for many years, and have seen her  transition from a comfortable middle-class life of caring wife and mother,  including involvement in church and community activities, to that of an  impassioned, committed Christian. At some point, she decided to cross the line  between caring and total commitment, including the possibility of facing  ostracism, indignity and even danger. How much we need to be aroused from our  self-satisfied, self-serving complacency by those who remind us of a higher  moral purpose.  </P> <P> NANCY WEAVER DURKA  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Desmond Blow] </F>   [Text] The pensions for KwaZulu civil servants are assured  in South Africa's new constitution, no matter who wins the  elections -- but this does not apply to the homelands who took  so-called independence: Transkei, Bophuthatswana [Bop]; Ciskei  and Venda.    Civil servants, police and even politicians who held office  in the six homelands that did not take "independence" will be  treated in the same manner as those in the central government --  and are in fact part of the same pension scheme.    However, this does not apply to the four "independent"  states, who ran their own pension funds.    This was confirmed to City Press by Deputy Director of  Finance Dr Robbie Burton.    He quoted Section 212 of the Constitution, which guarantees  the pensions of civil servants; section 236 which guarantees  civil servants' employment; and section 246 which guarantees the  rights and pensions of political office- bearers.    Efforts by City Press this week to find out whether the two  collapsed bantustans -- Bop and Ciskei -- and Transkei and Venda  could pay out their civil servants were unsuccessful.    None of the four states were economically viable, and they  relied on heavy subsidies from the central government, so it is  not known if their pension funds are in a healthy state or not.    It appears that the misgivings of striking civil servants  that led to the TEC [Transitional Executive Committee] stepping  into Bop and Ciskei were justified -- but the take-over does not  ensure that their civil servants will get their pensions.    It will depend on the financial state of these funds.    KwaZulu civil servants were assured in 80,000 personal  letters this week that their pensions were safe, and Inkatha  spokesperson Suzanne Vos blamed the ANC for sowing false  insecurity among them.    This accusation was echoed by Tony Leon of the Democratic  Party [DP], who said: "The ANC created a Frankenstein by  unashamedly creating conditions on the ground calculated to  topple homeland leaders who do not support it."    The ANC vehemently denied this -- and called Leon the DP's  "brat who showed his immaturity".</p>

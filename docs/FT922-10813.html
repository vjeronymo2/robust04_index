			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris CAC-40 index closes above 2,000 PARIS bucked an easier continental trend as a series of suspensions enlivened trading, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS broke above 2,000 on the CAC-40 index after numerous attempts in the last week. Several stocks were suspended, pending announcements. The CAC-40 index ended up 10.90 at 2,006.62, its highest close since July 1990, in turnover of FFr2.1bn. Paribas shot up FFr19.90 or 4.9 per cent to FFr419 as the suspension of Ciments Francais fanned speculation that it was about to sell all or part of its stake in the cement company to Holderbank of Switzerland or Hanson of the UK. Holderbank denied the story and there was no comment from the other companies. Analysts said that Paribas was likely to part with Ciments Francais, held indirectly through Poliet, since it was under pressure to improve its earnings in 1992 after its poor results last year. Schneider, its parent Spep, and its subsidiary Merlin Gerin were all suspended amid talk that the group's structure would be simplified through a series of share swaps. Total rose FFr11.30 or 4.6 per cent to FFr258.70 on renewed optimism about its Colombian oil find while Elf added FFr6.90 to FFr384. FRANKFURT weakened further as strike action widened. The DAX index shed 6.28 to 1,735.94 while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, slipped 2.13 to 706.33. Turnover rose to DM5.4bn from DM4.4bn. Hoechst, which reported a 26 per cent decline in first quarter group pre-tax profit, fell DM5 to DM257.30. The figures were worse than expected but the company expects a turnround in the next few months. Other chemical stocks followed Hoechst lower with Basf shedding DM1.60 to DM248.30 and Bayer down 70 pfg at DM288.30. Linotype-Hell was one of the day's most impressive gainers, advancing DM26.50 or 6.8 per cent to DM416, following a presentation on Monday at which the company gave a positive forecast for 1992. MILAN failed to hold on to early gains as a poor fixing in Generali, down L110 to L30,000, prompted investors to take profits on industrial shares. The Comit index fell 0.85 to 507.58 in turnover estimated at near Monday's L88.8bn. Pirelli officially closed L25 higher at 1,430 but dropped to L1,392 after hours. Fiat fell to L5,020 in late trading after being fixed L124 higher at L5,109. Benetton lost another L200 to L13,400. Stet continued to drop on foreign selling, losing L45 or 2.1 per cent to L2,055. The company has denied rumours of a capital increase. ZURICH fell in light trading after Monday's public holiday. The SMI index was 15.2 lower at 1,859.5. Most of the decline was attributable to UBS and Alusuisse going ex-dividend. UBS bearers closed down SFr150 at SFr3,760 and Alusuisse bearers fell SFr46 to SFr936. Sandoz shed SFr20 to SFr2,600 after announcing a 17 per cent increase in first quarter sales. AMSTERDAM was little changed in lacklustre trading. The CBS Tendency index advanced 0.2 to 128.1 in turnover of Fl 623.7m. Akzo was up Fl 1.50 at Fl 156.10 ahead of today's first quarter sales figures. Some analysts are forecasting positive 1992 earnings. DSM was Fl 1.50 stronger at Fl 112.70. Elsevier gained Fl 1.80 to Fl 113.40 on foreign buying. KNP weakened Fl 1.50 or 3.1 per cent to Fl 46.70, although off the day's low of Fl 46, after the paper manufacturer said that earnings for the first six months of 1992 will be below the same period last year. Amev was down 30 cents at Fl 53 after forecasting a difficult year ahead. STOCKHOLM fell on profit-taking and interest rate worries. The Affarsvarlden General index eased 7.5 to 979.6 in moderate turnover of SKr496m after SKr784m. The decline was led by Asea, with the B shares falling SKr5 to SKr364 and the A shares down SKr6 to SKr364. BRUSSELS saw Delhaize fall another BFr320 or 3.4 per cent at BFr9,040. The Bel-20 index dropped 4.12 to 1,206.26. MADRID's general index lost 0.76 to 249.17 in turnover of Pta11bn. Telefonica rose Pta15 to Pta1,055 with 2m shares traded. ISTANBUL fell for the fourth consecutive day. The 75-share index declined 37.93 or 1.02 per cent to 3,679.95.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 28  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Hourly changes   Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1172.72  1171.98  1171.97  1170.95  1170.59  1169.46  1169.46  1169.61  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         Day's High  1172.79            Day's Low  1168.44  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      Apr 27       Apr 24      Apr 23      Apr 22      Apr 21     1169.59      1167.02     1169.11     1171.34     1166.73  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / US and Russia race to secure N-arms accord RUSSIA and the US yesterday made a final effort to bridge differences on nuclear disarmament in time for an agreement to be concluded at next week's summit between Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, met in Washington yesterday in a bid to decide on how to cut their nuclear weapons forces beyond the levels to which they are already committed by the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start) signed last year. Mr Kozyrev said the two countries had a 'unique opportunity to make a major step beyond the Start treaty'. His US counterpart, however, warned that the gap between the two remained wide. 'We're not there yet. We've got some substantial ground to cover,' Mr Baker said. Start set a limit of 6,000 warheads on each country's strategic nuclear arsenal, although differences in the way these are counted under the treaty would mean the actual number of warheads would be higher. As the Soviet Union crumbled last year the US proposed to cut the number of warheads to 4,700, with the elimination of all land-based multiple warhead missiles. The US is particularly keen to eliminate the Russian SS-18 missiles, which carry 10 warheads each. Russia countered with a suggestion for an even deeper cut to 2,500 warheads that would also eliminate submarine-launched multiple warhead missiles. While the two sides appear near agreement on a number close to the US proposal of 4,700 warheads, they remain far apart on the type of missile that should be cut. US insistence on eliminating land-based multiple warhead missiles is based on the principle that these missiles are uniquely destabilising. This is because in theory it would be tempting to launch the missiles quickly in order to stop the enemy from destroying them in their silos with a first strike - the 'use them or lose them' principle. The argument is also, however, disingenuous. Since land-based missiles make up the bulk of the Russian nuclear arsenal, whereas the US strength is primarily in its submarine-launched missiles, a ban on land-based multiple warhead missiles would weigh disproportionately on the Russians. There is some concern in the US that the Bush administration, by sticking to its demand for such an asymmetrical ban, may jeopardise the chances of winning substantial nuclear arms cuts. 'It would be foolish to forego the opportunity for steep reductions because you are hung up on a demand that isn't very realistic,' said Mr Jack Mendelsohn, deputy director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington group monitoring disarmament issues. Many arms control analysts believe it should not be beyond the wit of Mr Baker and Mr Kozyrev to craft a compromise - especially as any agreement on deep cuts in the number of warheads would force Russia at least to reduce its land-based multiple warhead missiles, since these make up such a large proportion of its total force.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: Moss Bros surprises City with 77% boost Shares in Moss Bros, the clothing outfitter, jumped by 46p to 325p yesterday as profits sharply exceeded City expectations. Pre-tax profits for the year ended January 29 rose by 77 per cent, from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 4.08m, on the back of an 11 per cent rise in turnover, from Pounds 55.8m to Pounds 62.1m. Profit estimates were pitched between Pounds 2.7m and Pounds 2.9m. Mr Rowland Gee, managing director, said the group had increased its share of the UK suit market from 5.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent. 'We have not sacrificed any margin - we certainly did not buy our turnover', he stated, adding that costs would continue to be tightly controlled. Operating profits rose from Pounds 1.37m to Pounds 3.69m. Earnings per share more than doubled from 8.52p to 18.86p after a Pounds 636,000 tax credit, which reduced the tax charge to Pounds 916,000. Without the tax credit, earnings per share were 15.07p. A final dividend of 5.5p (4p) is proposed, giving a total for the year of 7p, up from a previous 5.5p. Capital expenditure was three times ahead of the previous year's figure at Pounds 2.3m. Nevertheless, said Mr Gee, net cash at the year end expanded by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 15.5m. Net interest receivable fell to Pounds 700,000, compared with Pounds 933,000. The Moss Bros group now has 101 stores - 40 Savoy Taylors Guild branches, serving the classic suit market; 46 Suit Company outlets for the mainstream market and 15 Cecil Gee fashion stores. It has maintained its lead in suit hire, operating at 77 of its stores with a 40 per cent market share. Mr Gee said the current year had started well, with like on like sales running 12.5 per cent higher than last year.</p>

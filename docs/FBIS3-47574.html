			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Nongovernmental  organizations (NGOs) will discuss problems resulting from the  growing world population at a symposium from Saturday in  preparation for a United Nations Conference on Population and  Development in Cairo, Egypt, later this year, organizers said  Wednesday [12 January].    The symposium, which will be held at Waseda University in  Tokyo, is co-organized by the "Peoples' Forum 2001," an NGO  umbrella organization, and "Japan's Network for Women and  Health," which aims at increasing women's representation at the  Cairo conference.    Panelists will include Makoto Ato, head of the Health and  Welfare Ministry's Institute of Population Problems, Assistant  Prof. Chizuko Ueno of Tokyo University and representatives of  the U.N. Population Fund.    The symposium will adopt an appeal urging the Japanese  Government to include NGO and women representatives in its  delegation for the Cairo conference. The suggestions will be  submitted to the government-organized "Tokyo Wise Men's  Conference on Population and Development," which will be held on  February 26 and 27.    "Population growth in developing countries is a result of  environment destruction by developed countries. There the  Japanese bear responsibility too," said Shunsuke Iwasaki,  assistant professor at Tsukuba University and head of the  Peoples' Forum 2001.    "This problem is not that simple that it could be solved by  just providing means for birth control. As the Cairo conference  is drawing closer, we want to make the first step to give  ordinary people a say (in these matters)," Iwasaki said in  explaining the objectives of the symposium.    The U.N. holds its international Conference on Population  and  Development every ten years. This year's conference, from  September 5 to 13, will adopt an action program seeking to  establish a sustainable balance between the soaring population,  scarce resources and an increasingly damaged environment.    The U.N. estimates that the world population will grow by a  record 93 million to over 5.7 billion in 1994, with the majority  of the growth occurring in developing countries.</p>

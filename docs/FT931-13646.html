			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Airtours and Owners trade statistics on holiday sales AIRTOURS and rival holiday tour operator, Owners Abroad, yesterday traded statistics about the state of their sales for the summer 1993 holiday season, writes Richard Gourlay. Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, told shareholders at the annual meeting that bookings for summer 1993 and winter 1992-93 were up by 7 per cent and 17 per cent respectively, year on year. These figures demonstrate a greater increase in bookings than Airtours claimed in its offer document sent to Owners a week ago. Mr Howard Klein, Owners chairman, countered by saying industry surveys showed his company was continuing to get its pricing right for summer 1993. According to Stats MR, a respected industry monitor, summer holiday bookings to the end of December 1992 had fallen by 6 per cent. While Owners bookings had increased by 19 per cent, Airtours' bookings, however, had declined by 3 per cent. Bookings with Thomson, the market leader, fell by 14 per cent. Figures for the end of November showed that overall bookings fell by 9 per cent. Owners rose 20 per cent, Airtours' dropped by 6 per cent, and Thomson fell 21 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 20 (XINHUA) -- President Bill  Clinton will announce details of a new U.S. plan on Bosnia later  today, the White House said.    "We have new military and diplomatic initiatives which the  President will likely discuss later today," White House  spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said.    Clinton met twice with his national security advisers for  some four hours Tuesday [19 April] on how to deal with the  worsening situation in Bosnia, especially in the encircled  Bosnian Muslim enclave of Gorazde.    It was reported that the U.S. plan included the support of  wider use of air power against the Bosnia Serbs, not only in the  six U.N.-authorized "safe areas" for the Muslims but on other  Serb strategic positions.    The plan also called for tougher economic sanctions against  the Serb republic, seen by the West as supporter of the Bosnian  Serbs in perpetuating the two-year war.    In Brussels, NATO officials discussed the wider use of air  power on Bosnia but no final decision was reached.    Analysts believe that little objection will be expected to  stiffer sanctions on Serbia but the military moves might  encounter differences because many European countries have  troops on the ground in Bosnia and their governments fear Serb  retaliations.</p>

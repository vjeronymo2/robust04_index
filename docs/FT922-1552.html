			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Candour at last on health care: America Oregon is awaiting federal approval for a health care experiment that seems likely to influence the provision of medical services throughout the US and perhaps the rest of the world. Everybody in medicine knows that the steady advance of technology is making possible ever more complex and expensive treatments, especially for those approaching the end of their natural lives. Everybody knows that it is irrational to finance all the treatments that will be medically possible: at some point, other needs such as investment in education must take priority. But nobody wants to talk openly about the setting of priorities, still less mention that evil word 'rationing'. Nobody, that is, except a set of unusually courageous policymakers in Oregon. The state found that the soaring cost of ineffective organ transplants was blowing holes in its budget for Medicaid, the joint state/federal medical scheme for the poor. With thousands of poor children lacking access to routine care, it decided it had to find a more rational way of allocating a limited health care budget. The result is an innovative plan that divides all health services into 17 categories of care and a total of 709 condition/treatment pairs, ranked in order of importance. The top category includes acute fatal conditions where treatment prevents death and leads to full recovery. An example would be an operation for acute appendicitis. Maternity and newborn care is ranked the second most important category of treatment. The 17th and least important category includes treatments reckoned to result in minimal improvements in the quality of life: for example aggressive treatment for the terminal stages of cancer or Aids. The legislature was presented with the list last year and with a series of costings prepared by an independent actuary. It then faced a very simple task: finding how far a limited Medicaid budget would stretch. The cut-off point reached was condition/treatment pair 587; nothing ranked less important is to be made available by the Oregon public sector. Conditions no longer treated will range from trivial ailments, such as viral sore throats, to surgery for some kinds of lower back pain and infertility services. The scheme has been widely attacked as crude, unworkable and unjust. Critics are enraged by the planned exclusion of some treatments currently available under Medicaid. The explicit rationing, however, is only part of a broader strategy to provide universal health care. The plan offers health care to everybody living below the federal poverty line (Dollars 964 per month for a family of three). Medicaid currently excludes many below the poverty line, all childless adults and many categories of care such as standard dental work. In a linked reform, companies will either have to provide insurance for employees or pay into a state scheme; Oregon is also creating a state insurance pool for high-risk individuals (people who have had serious illnesses are often unable to get private insurance). Officials in Oregon point out that health care is rationed everywhere. In the US private sector it is rationed by price and by the onerous restrictions written into insurance policies. In Britain's National Health Service, rationing is even more opaque: public officials and doctors make key resource allocation decisions behind closed doors. The breakthrough in Oregon is the attempt to make the rationing open and fully accountable. The priorities were determined by an 11-member commission consisting of four consumers, a social worker, a nurse and five doctors. They reflect the social values expressed by Oregonians in numerous public meetings and surveys and expert assessments of the clinical effectiveness of different procedures. Treatments at the bottom of the list are those either not widely valued or judged futile. Several members of the commission told me they would happily join the Oregon plan themselves. They stressed that it was not just for the poor but a benchmark for all private sector plans, many of which currently offer inferior benefits. Public hearings and analysis of clinical effectiveness had resulted in priorities that differ radically from those embodied in the US's market-driven health industry. For example, the Oregon plan puts heavy emphasis on preventive and primary care. It stresses pain control and 'comfort care': unlike Medicaid, the plan thus pays for hospice care for the terminally ill but not for high-tech interventions to prolong life by a few days. Perhaps the most exciting innovation is a plan fully to integrate the treatment of physical and mental disorders. In future mental health will cease to be a poor cousin because funding, as on the physical side, will reflect clinical results rather than prejudice or custom. The moves afoot in Oregon are revolutionary. The state is saying that consumers, rather than physicians or bureaucrats, must take the lead in determining health care priorities. It is saying that a bundle of basic health care services can be rigorously defined and must be universally available. Above all, it is saying that decisions about the use of finite resources must be made openly. This is no easy task, but can anybody suggest a better way for approaching health care reform?</p>

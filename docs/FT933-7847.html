			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Currencies 'face more turmoil' EUROPE could be facing more currency turmoil in spite of the decision to widen the fluctuation margins of the European exchange rate mechanism to 15 per cent, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research warned yesterday. In its quarterly report the economic research body said the failure of the ERM demonstrated the weakness of market intervention as a means of defending exchange-rate bands. Moving to a system of wider bands or even free-floating 'does not put the monetary authorities back in control', it said. Mr Wynne Godley, professor of applied economics at Cambridge University and one of the Treasury's seven-strong panel of independent economic forecasters, today warns that market forces alone are insufficient to save the European Community from 'endemic recession'. Writing in today's London Review of Books, he says there is a pressing need for 'some supranational authority, call it a federal government' to pursue macro-economic policies. Letters, Page 14</p>

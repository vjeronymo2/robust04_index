			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Asda refund pledge steps up price war Asda, the UK's fourth-largest grocery retailer, is stepping up the supermarket price war with a promise to refund the difference on a basket of goods if customers can buy the same goods more cheaply elsewhere. The store chain said its guarantee did not mean it would refund the price of individual goods but it would make up the difference if customers found they could purchase their weekly shopping for less at a rival store. The move will put further pressure on profit margins in the grocery market, which has seen a huge expansion in selling space and the rapid growth of a new breed of cut-price discount stores. It comes as the UK's three largest groups - J Sainsbury, Tesco, and Argyll, owner of Safeway - were predicting that margins would stabilise after falling since last autumn.</p>

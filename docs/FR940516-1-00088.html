			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This rule's information requirements are similar to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in the nonroad large compression-ignition (CI) rule, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but reduced from the on-highway program requirements. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comment on whether patterning the small SI engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information requirements after the nonroad large CI rule is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate for the manufacturers of small nonroad engines. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular, EPA request comments on whether there are more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient or more effective ways than those proposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers to create, maintain, and report this information;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether electronic data interchange (EDI) is a common practice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within this industrial sector; and whether EPA should consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using EDI or any other technology in its information collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reduce the burden and costs of compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> See Control of Air Pollution; Emissions of Oxides of Nitrogen and Smoke From New Nonroad Compression-Ignition Engines at or above 50 Horsepower, 58 FR 28809 and 51595 (May 17, 1993).</FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> EPA is authorized under section 217 of the CAA to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fees to recover compliance program costs associated with section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 206 and 207. EPA will propose to establish fees for today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad compliance program at some future time, after this rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been promulgated and associated costs are determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> C. Program Description and Rationale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This section describes several features of EPA's proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Phase 1 small SI engine, vehicle and equipment compliance program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and EPA's rationale for including these features in the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific issues related to the proposed program which require in-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depth discussion are presented in ``V. Discussion of Issues.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 1. Applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This rule would apply to new nonroad spark-ignition engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that have a gross power output at or below 19 kW and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured after August 1, 1996 for use in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New engines that would be covered by this rule are used in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large and varied assortment of vehicles and equipment including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lawnmowers, string trimmers, edgers, chain saws, commercial turf  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, small construction equipment, and lawn and garden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA estimates that in the first year of regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 16,525,000 new engines, or approximately 19.4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the in-use fleet, would be subject to this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See Chapter 4 of the draft Regulatory Support Document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (hereafter, draft RSD) for this rulemaking. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> A copy of the draft RSD may be found in the docket for this rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> EPA is proposing to require certification of new small SI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines, not the vehicle or equipment which houses such engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, small SI engines are used in a variety of applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes it is inappropriate to mandate that a specific SI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine be manufactured for any given application. Second, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of manufacturers and the diversity of vehicles and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment in which small SI engines are used would present clear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative problems. Regulating primarily by vehicle or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment type would dramatically increase administrative cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with this rule with no comparable reduction in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. EPA is, however, proposing to require that vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and equipment manufacturers and importers use the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified nonroad engines in their vehicles and equipment. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement is discussed in ``V.H. Requirements Applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vehicle and Equipment Manufacturers.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also considered, but rejected, the idea of including SI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines above 19 kW in this Phase 1 rule. Engines above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed 19 kW cutoff tend to exhibit different operating cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics than small SI engines. This difference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessitates the development of additional test procedures. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not have sufficient data to undertake such a development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the timeframe of this Phase 1 rule. As part of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sierra  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Club  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Browner <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  settlement, EPA will determine by November 1996  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether to undertake a rulemaking which targets emissions from SI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines over 19 kW.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain small SI engines which otherwise would be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule would be explicitly excluded from regulation:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Engines used to propel marine ``vessels'' as such term is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined in 1 U.S.C. 3 (1992). EPA is not including these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines because they are currently subject to safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations by the U.S. Coast Guard (See 46 U.S.C. 331 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 46 U.S.C. 4302.), and EPA is developing a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking which will propose appropriate methods of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulating emissions from these engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Engines regulated by the Mining Safety and Health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration (MSHA) for underground use. EPA is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including in this proposal engines that are used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underground mining or engines used in underground mining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment as regulated by MSHA under the authority of 30 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parts 7, 31, 32, 36, 56, 57, 70, and 75. MSHA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for protecting miners from unhealthy levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air pollution in underground mines and has issued air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality standards for mines and standards for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and CO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from some types of mining equipment. Although EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered applying EPA regulations to these engines, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chose not to include them at this time in order to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dual regulation of these engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Engines used in motorcycles and regulated in 40 CFR part 86,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart E. EPA has regulated emissions from motorcycles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since 1978. A motorcycle means any motor vehicle with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> headlight, taillight, and stoplight and having two wheels or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three wheels and a curb mass less than or equal to 680  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kilograms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The boat that the Slovene Ministry of Internal  Affairs has ordered in Italy is a rescue vessel, not a military  vessel. This is what has been asserted by its designer in an  official police investigation. Here is a report by Mirjam  Muzinic:    [Begin Muzinic recording] While Italian newspapers have  swiftly taken up the story on the confiscation of a vessel  ordered in Viareggio for the needs of the Slovene Ministry of  Internal Affairs and paid for in Turin, today agencies devote  hardly any attention to the event. What is involved is one of  the large number of similar cases that our neighbors are used  to, colleague journalists (Luca Daldi) from the Viareggio IL  TIRENO told us on the telephone. It is known that the order was  made by a middleman from Turin, who received 3.2 billion Italian  Lire from Slovenia. The vessel is 20 meters long and a little  more than 5 meters wide. It is equipped with radar, satellite  navigator, depth gauge, night sights, and computer-operated  navigation, something that would indicate that what is involved  is a military vessel.    In the official police investigation, the designer, an  eminent expert, (Sergio Sardos), born in (Pula), Croatia, and a  long-time Italian citizen, denied this. Due to the bankruptcy  process, the respective court has excluded the vessel from the  estate fund, and ordered that it should be completed as soon as  possible and delivered to the purchaser. All that is needed is  the payment of the order, which has obviously stopped at the  Italian middleman and is in the hands of the court.    According to the IL TIRENO's journalist, a prominent  representative of the Slovene Ministry of Internal Affairs is  expected to visit Viareggio this afternoon, something that the  Ministry's spokesman Bozo Truden denied. Slovenia ordered the  vessel in Italy when Igor Bavcar held the post of the minister  of internal affairs. It should have been taken over in the  middle of last September. [end recording]</p>

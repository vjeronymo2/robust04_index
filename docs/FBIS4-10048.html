			<p>BFN     [Text] The executive phase of the Guerrillero-94 exercise  began on 5 April in Guantanamo. The purpose of the exercise is  to evaluate the efficiency of the Unified Vigilance and  Protection System. The exercise will enhance the control and  operation structures of the system at each level and increase  cohesion at workplaces, organizations, and enterprises to  preserve economic resources.    The Executive Secretariat of the Committees for the Defense  of the Revolution in Holguin has called upon its members to  honor their commitment to the people's surveillance program.  The measures include performing the entire watch, staying  alert, and not letting other tasks distract from the  effectiveness of the watch, as well as fulfilling the watch  during power outages.</p>

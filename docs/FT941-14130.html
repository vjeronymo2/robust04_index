			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Crest Packaging static at Pounds 2.4m after flotation costs Tough trading conditions and exceptional costs related to its flotation left interim profits from Crest Packaging, the flexible packaging and cartons group, flat at Pounds 2.43m, against Pounds 2.36m pro forma. The shares, which were floated in November at 135p, fell 1p to 143p yesterday. Mr Rodney Webb, managing director, said the results were in line with expectations. Operating profits fell 12 per cent to Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 2.54m) in the 26 weeks to October 30, on sales 7 per cent higher at Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 20.2m). There were exceptional flotation charges of Pounds 525,000, partly offset by a Pounds 400,000 release of provisions on site reorganisation. Interest swung from payable of Pounds 181,000 to receivable of Pounds 330,000. Flexible packaging increased market share with sales up 12 per cent to Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 12.3m) in a flat market. Pressure on prices and reorganisation costs left operating profits marginally lower at Pounds 1.82m (Pounds 1.84m). Cartons fared less well with turnover down 2 per cent to Pounds 7.72m (Pounds 7.87m) and profits 26 per cent lower at Pounds 640,000 (Pounds 870,000). However, Mr Webb said the division had borne heavy overtime costs on seasonal work for Christmas and Easter, which was not despatched to customers until after the half-year end. In November 1991 the group sold eight acres of its 18 acre site in Gillingham, Kent, to Tesco for Pounds 21.3m, giving a net profit of Pounds 12.7m. In the half year Crest paid Pounds 3.7m tax on the sale and Pounds 1m to Bowater, previous owner of the site. With capital investment of Pounds 2.9m, there was a cash outflow of Pounds 7.3m. Net cash at the half year end was Pounds 10.4m, down from a pro-forma Pounds 17.7m at April 30 last year. The float costs boosted the tax rate, leaving earnings per share down at 3.63p (3.95p pro forma). Excluding the exceptionals, earnings rose 8 per cent to 4.27p. There is no interim dividend but Crest intends to pay a final in October.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: SOMMARS ESCAPED WITH HER YOUTH INTACT;  </P> <P> ACTING: BEING TOO YOUNG FOR THE ROLE THAT BROUGHT JEAN SEBERG OVERNIGHT STARDOM  TURNS OUT TO BE A BLESSING.  </P> <P> There are plenty of cautionary tales in the Hollywood chronicles: careers that  rose and fell like rockets, careers that never quite got going, careers cut  short by mischance.  </P> <P> Few stories have seemed to me more bitterly sad than Jean Seberg's. The robust  and beautiful young woman from Marshalltown, Iowa, had won an audition to be  Otto Preminger's Joan of Arc in "Saint Joan," and you would have said, as the  press releases did, that it was an updated Cinderella story.  </P> <P> It turned out to be a nightmare of scathing, humiliating reviews that in effect  drove Seberg to exile. And while the career resumed, after a fashion, and there  were periods of happiness, the ending -- suicide in a car parked on a Paris  street -- seemed as inevitable as anything in classic tragedy.  </P> <P> I've often talked about the other side of the coin -- the disappointments that  can later be seen as blessings in disguise -- with another actress from Iowa,  Julie Sommars of Onawa, who shared a fateful afternoon with Seberg.  </P> <P> Sommars, who currently plays the assistant district attorney and love interest  opposite Andy Griffith on the "Matlock" series, knew Seberg because they were  fellow competitors in Iowa state oratorical contests. "She was a senior and I  was in ninth or tenth grade. She was doing 'Joan of Lorraine,' I was doing  'Sorry, Wrong Number,' " Sommars said over lunch recently.  </P> <P> The two young women -- and some 300 others -- went to Chicago to audition for  Preminger for "Saint Joan" and, the seating being alphabetical, Seberg and  Sommars found themselves sitting side by side. They sweated out the long parade  of girls reciting, or starting to recite, the two speeches Preminger had had  them memorize.  </P> <P> "She dumped her street shoes in my lap and told me to watch them when she went  in to see him," Sommars says. "She was in there what seemed like forever. When  she came out she grabbed the shoes and said, 'He listened to both my speeches,'  and marched away."  </P> <P> Preminger listened to both of Sommars' recitations too, and then chatted with  her. Would she like to go to New York? he asked her. "Not if it's anything like  Chicago," she said, innocently, and Preminger roared with laughter. He asked  how old she was. When she said 15, he said, "Thank you very much" and dismissed  her.  </P> <P> Sommars went back to Iowa, finished high school, came to California and studied  at San Bernardino Valley College. She moved into the now-legendary Studio Club  in Hollywood where many an aspiring actress lived. (Marilyn Monroe, another  cautionary tale, was one of them.)  </P> <P> Sommars got a job as a receptionist and began making the rounds, landing a job  understudying the lead in a small theater production of "Our Town." In the  useful show business tradition, the lead became ill, and Sommars went on and  got good reviews.  </P> <P> "It wasn't acting," she says. "Believe me, I was right out of Grover's Corners,  and it was me."  </P> <P> An agent saw her and two weeks later Sommars was playing Loretta Young's  daughter in one of the playlets on "The Loretta Young Show." She was 19. She  found more work in episodic television but felt she needed better training.  </P> <P> On money she'd saved she flew to London and enrolled at the Actors Workshop,  working briefly as a telephone operator but defeated by accents she found  incomprehensible. She subsisted, she once told me, on tomato salad, cheese and  warm Pepsis.  </P> <P> After a year she quit London for New York, where she did off-Broadway plays and  summer stock and toured with Edward Everett Horton, who told her she was the  second-best ingenue he'd ever worked with. The best, he said consolingly, was  Colleen Dewhurst.  </P> <P> The Horton play, "Miss Pell Is Missing," brought her back to Hollywood, where  she won an audition, this one with Ross Hunter for the lead opposite Brian  Bedford in "The Pad, and How to Use It," a pleasant, modest entertainment based  on Peter Shaffer's one-act play "The Private Ear."  </P> <P> Since then she has made other films, including "Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo" at  Disney and a now-you-see-her-now-you- don't appearance opposite Gene Hackman in  "Bat 21." But essentially Sommars has made a comfortable, successful career in  television movies ("The Harness") and series, including a run as the J. J. in  "The Governor and J. J.," playing Dan Dailey's daughter.  </P> <P> What began as a guest appearance on "Matlock," as a bright, flame-haired  assistant D.A. who keeps losing to Griffith, turned into a continuing role.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Sommars is happily married to a lawyer and has a daughter who will  shortly be 17. Hers can be thought of as one of those non-cautionary Hollywood  tales in which an actress's public and private lives are both eminently  satisfactory.  </P> <P> What seems clear is that she escaped -- and it's the only way to say it -- the  blinding light of overnight stardom that fell upon Jean Seberg and that proved  in the end to be cruel, cold and fatal.  </P> <P> There are worse things than being too young for a part.  </P></p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Strike to hit BA flights PASSENGERS flying British Airways from London Gatwick were warned yesterday to expect disruption over the holiday weekend after airline cabin crew voted to stage a 24-hour strike from midnight tonight. The strike has been called by the TGWU general union following a vote in favour of action by cabin staff protesting at plans to transfer some BA routes to a subsidiary company set up after the flag carrier took over Dan Air in October last year. As part of BA's plan to cut costs on the loss-making routes the subsidiary carrier will pay lower wages to newly-recruited staff. BA said existing staff who transferred to the subsidiary would not have their pay cut. The flights that could be delayed or cancelled are to Geneva, Faro, Naples, Genoa, Bordeaux, Malaga, Frankfurt, Copenhagen, Bergamo and Madrid. BA advised passengers to telephone the airline for news and said it hoped to get people away on other services. Although cabin staff voted by 175 to 35 to take industrial action, domestic flights, long-haul journeys and flights from Heathrow would not be affected, according to BA. Union officials said yesterday that the BA management had 'miscalculated badly by assuming that our cabin crew would quietly accept their work being done on worse pay and conditions'. It called on the company to 'call off its provocative plan to impose this measure on a loyal group of dedicated professionals'. BA said yesterday: 'We are very disappointed that the action disrupts the travel plans of the very people whose business will save jobs at Gatwick. Only by encouraging more passengers on to our short-haul services can we get our Gatwick operations into profit and protect employment.' The TGWU is also balloting 18,000 British Airways ground staff, clerical workers and cabin crew on industrial action over contracting-out of services and the setting up of subsidiary companies operating under allegedly worse conditions. The ballot result is expected at the end of the month. The British Airways board yesterday gave its public backing to Sir Colin Marshall, the airline's chairman, and Mr Robert Ayling, its managing director, following demands by Virgin Atlantic Airways that they should resign. Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, challenged the two to resign earlier this week after renewed allegations in a television documentary that they had been aware of their airline's 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin. The number of passengers passing through Birmingham International Airport rose 10.8 per cent to a record 3.885m in the year to March, largely because of an increase in charter services. Traffic in 1991-92 was affected by recession and the Gulf War.</p>

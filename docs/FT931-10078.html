			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (22): Shaping up for a split decision / Profile of Imperial Chemical Industries ONE OF the most exciting events of 1993 is the likely reshaping of Imperial Chemical Industries, the giant corporation which started life as a defensive cartel to supply the British Empire. This month ICI is to decide whether to split the bulk chemicals business from the bioscience side, which would include the pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and speciality businesses. If the split goes ahead, the European chemicals industry would undergo one of the largest restructurings since the end of the Second World War when the Allies broke up I G Farben. The plan was announced in July after Hanson had already sold a 2.8 per cent stake in ICI and was designed to release hidden value in the two businesses. Reversing the 1980s trend towards the creation of conglomerates, it would follow demergers of Vodafone and Chubb Security from Racal, and Courtaulds Textiles' separation from Courtaulds. After a split both ICI and its bioscience side would remain quoted companies. But the bio side, which has been called Zeneca, could go straight on to the acquisition trail - to gain critical mass in its markets - for which it is likely to require a rights issue. As for the bulk chemicals side, ICI will still be operating within a world recession and a highly cyclical industry. While the new ICI might have great recovery potential, it could have diff-iculty generating enough earnings to cover the dividend this year, a factor that could affect the timing of the demerger. The market, certainly, has been less than convinced that the ICI alchemy will make two halves worth more than the whole and the group has slipped within the FT500.</p>

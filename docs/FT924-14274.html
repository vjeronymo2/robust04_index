			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: CC&amp;P to transfer its Peps CC&amp;P TRUSTEES, which manages personal equity plans, is giving is giving up its corporate Pep business. The company, a subsidiary of Bacon &amp; Woodrow, has written to its 35,000 Pep investors to tell them their plans will be transferred. It is recommending to its corporate clients that they switch to Henderson Financial Management. CC&amp;P manages Peps for more than 40 companies including Marks &amp; Spencer, Boots, Hanson and TSB and, along with brokers such as NatWest, Hoare Govett and Cazenove, offered investors a low-cost, corporate Pep. Investors with such Peps will have to pay more because of the transfer. CC&amp;P had an annual management charge of 0.5 per cent but Henderson will be charging 0.75. The initial charge depends on the company in which the Pep investment is made. In most cases, the companies paid this themselves; and as long as they continue to do this with Henderson, investors should not see a difference in the initial charge.</p>

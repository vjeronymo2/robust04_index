			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Burrowing on amid the financial gloom: Eurotunnel's growing problems EUROTUNNEL'S 220 banks are becoming inured to crisis, though they fear that the channel tunnel company's latest financial problems are perhaps its most serious. The 19 leading lenders to the company, known as the instructing banks, were given the grim details of Eurotunnel's financial plight by Sir Alastair Morton, the company's chief executive, on Friday. He reiterated that Eurotunnel was in breach of its banking covenants and therefore needed their permission to continue drawing on its banking facilities. The deadline for receiving that permission is in June, when Eurotunnel will run out of cash. Under its borrowing contracts, Eurotunnel needs agreement from 65 per cent of banks as measured by the value of their loans. Bankers, led by four agent banks - National Westminster and Midland from the UK, Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris from France - say receiving that support is by no means a foregone conclusion. Many banks are feeling strapped for cash, given that so many companies are running into financial difficulties when capital is in short supply. Bankers say they expect Japanese banks, suffering from an acute shortage of capital because of the fall in the Tokyo stock market, to be particularly difficult to corral into allowing Eurotunnel to continue drawing on the facility. Eurotunnel has credit facilities of around Pounds 8bn, but the main lending facility from commercial banks is for Pounds 6.8bn (Dollars 12bn). Of this commercial line, Eurotunnel has already drawn Pounds 4bn. Though some banks may not wish to provide the remainder, bankers say that in the end they probably will give permission in the form of a waiver of the breach of the relevant banking covenant. 'With the tunnel just over a year from opening, it would be irrational to stop the funding now,' said a leading banker. Sir Alastair says he would not have had any doubts about getting permission from the banks, were it not for a decision last month by an independent disputes panel which tripled monthly progress payments made by Eurotunnel to its contractors to Pounds 75m, starting from next Thursday. The panel ruled that Eurotunnel should negotiate a new lump sum to cover the increased cost of fitting out the rail tunnels and building two passenger terminals at Folkestone in Kent and Sangatte, northern France. It offered to fix a price if the two sides could not agree. Eurotunnel says the panel has tilted a delicate balance of power in favour of the contractors. It 'tossed a hand grenade' into the negotiations, said an appalled Sir Alastair. Eurotunnel on Thursday took the issue of increased progress payments and the panel's request that it renegotiate a new global figure for this part of the contract to independent arbitration by the International Chambers of Commerce in Brussels. Meanwhile, Eurotunnel has still to decide whether it will increase progress payments. Transmanche Link (TML), the consortium of five British and five French construction companies building the project, has said it will run into cash-flow problems later this summer if payments are not increased. It has threatened to halt work on parts of the project where payments are insufficient to cover its costs. On the issue of the final cost of constructing the terminals and fitting out of the tunnels, the two sides are as far apart as ever. TML is claiming about Pounds 1.5bn at 1985 prices for the lump sum contract which was originally expected to cost Pounds 620m. Eurotunnel has offered to pay a sum approaching Pounds 1bn, leaving a gap of about Pounds 500m. Arbitration could take several years which would give Eurotunnel time to finish construction and open the project before it might need to raise more money from shareholders to to pay contractors - should arbitrators rule against the group. The uncertainty complicates an already difficult relationship with the banks. Because of the late opening of the tunnel and the delays in running a London-Paris passenger service, Eurotunnel was already in breach of its covenants and therefore in need of a waiver. However, it did not believe it would have any difficulty obtaining this waiver, until the ruling of the disputes panel was released. It would be devastating for Eurotunnel if TML were to win its claims. A TML victory would represent a much more serious breach of its banking covenants, because it would constitute a change to the construction contract. Equally serious covenant breaches would arise from any further significant delays in the opening dates or increases in interest rates, which seriously diminished the company's cash flow and forced it to raise new money. In those cases, Eurotunnel would require support from 90 per cent of its banks by value to have continued access to funds. Sir Alastair believes it would be impossible to win such a majority. If there were such an apocalypse, the outlook for Eurotunnel as a company would be uncertain. The banks could opt to keep the company in existence, but control it more tightly. Or they could replace it with a vehicle of their own, which would finish and operate the tunnel. In either case, there would be only one certainty - Eurotunnel's shares would be worth pennies or nothing.</p>

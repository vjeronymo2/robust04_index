			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Vladimir Taranov]    [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russian side will  not remain aloof and will undertake jointly with the official  Tajik authorities all the necessary measures in order that those  guilty of crimes will be punished. This was said at a briefing  today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the information and press  department of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry, in  connection with the killing of Colonel Yuriy Shkipkin, deputy  chief of troops of the Tajikistan Defense Ministry, in Dushanbe.    "There is no doubt," he stressed, "that forces that aim at  further aggravating the situation in the country, which is  already uneasy as it is, are behind the latest crime. It is no  accident that first and foremost it is servicemen, especially  ethnic Russians, who are carrying out their duty to help to  restore peace and stability in Tajikistan, who are becoming  victims of these obviously planned terrorist actions. An  obvious aim can be traced: "To sow uncertainty and fear among  the population and to provoke enmity between the peoples of  Russia and Tajikistan," the Russian diplomat noted.</p>

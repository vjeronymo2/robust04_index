			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 602.27&blank;Required Operating Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 496(c) of the HEA requires accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables institutions to participate in Title IV, HEA programs to take special action whenever institutions establish new branch campuses or undergo changes in ownership that result in changes in control. Accordingly, in &sect;602.27 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary reiterates the requirement for special action set forth in that section. For purposes of this section, the Secretary notes that the term ``branch campus'' includes any ``additional location,'' which the Secretary defines to be a location that is geographically apart from the main campus, that has its own separate administrative structure, services, and facilities, and at which the institution plans to offer a complete educational program. The Secretary believes the inclusion of additional locations in this requirement is consistent with the intent of Congress. The close scrutiny of branch campuses and additional locations includes the requirement contained in sections 496(c)((2) and (3) to approve a business plan for a branch prior to its opening; to extend accreditation to the branch only after determining that it has sufficient educational, financial, operations, management, and physical resources to provide education or training consistent with the accreditation standards; and to conduct on-site reviews within six months for all new branches and all institutions that change ownership that results in a change in control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another requirement of section 496(c) of the HEA is that any institution participating in Title IV, HEA programs that enters into a teach-out agreement with another institution must agree to submit to its accrediting agency for approval a teach-out agreement that is consistent with applicable standards and regulations. In &sect;602.27(b) of the proposed regulations, the Secretary reiterates this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 602.28&blank;Due Process for Institutions and Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 496(a)(6) of the HEA requires an accrediting agency seeking recognition by the Secretary to use procedures throughout its accreditation process that satisfy due process requirements. Accordingly, in &sect;602.28 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary sets out this due process requirement. Specifically, in &sect;602.28 the Secretary requires an agency to set forth in writing all of its procedures governing its accreditation and preaccreditation processes, including its processes for the appeal of an adverse action it takes against an institution or program, to notify an institution or program in writing of any adverse action the agency takes against it, and to afford the institution or program the opportunity to appeal the adverse action. In accordance with section 496(a)(6)(D) of the HEA, in &sect;602.28(b)(5) the Secretary specifically requires that an agency permit an institution or program the right to representation by counsel during an appeal of an adverse action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary acknowledges that the cost to an agency when an institution or program appeals an adverse action can be substantial. To minimize this cost, the Secretary has included in &sect;602.28(b)(5) a provision, suggested by non-Federal negotiators, that agencies be given the discretion to determine when an appeal may be made only in writing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 602.29&blank;Notification of Accrediting Decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 496(a)(7) of the HEA requires accrediting agencies to notify the Secretary, the appropriate State postsecondary review entities, and the public of any final adverse accrediting action regarding an institution or program. Accordingly, in &sect;602.29(a) of the proposed regulations, the Secretary establishes this notification requirement. The Secretary proposes an additional requirement in &sect;602.29(a) that is not specified in the law: that accrediting agencies notify other appropriate accrediting agencies of all final adverse actions. The Secretary believes this additional notification requirement, which was suggested after the negotiated rulemaking sessions by one of the non-Federal negotiators, is necessary because of the requirement, implied in section 496(l)(2) of the HEA, that an accrediting agency must take into account the adverse accrediting actions of other accrediting agencies in making its own accrediting decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 496(a)(8) of the HEA requires accrediting agencies to make available to the Secretary, the appropriate State postsecondary review entity and, upon request, the public a brief statement supporting any decision to deny, withdraw, suspend, or terminate the accreditation or preaccreditation of an institution or program, together with the comments of the affected institution or program concerning that decision. Accordingly, in &sect;602.29 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary establishes this requirement. To ensure that the statement is made available in a timely fashion, the Secretary proposes to require that the statement be made available within 60 days of an agency's final decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

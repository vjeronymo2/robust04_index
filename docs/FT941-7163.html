			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks falter after failure of merger talks Wall Street US stocks tumbled yesterday after the collapse of Bell Atlantic's proposed merger with Tele-Communications and another rout on the bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 51.78, or about 1.3 per cent, to 3,839.90, its lowest level since closing at 3,820.77 on January 7. Late in the session the Dow's move beyond the 50-point range triggered restrictions on program-trading. The sell-off was broad-based, with declines outnumbering advances by 1,809 to 434. The breadth of the downturn was reflected in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, which shed 6.43 to 464.26. The American SE composite was down 6.16 to 465.58 while the technology-rich Nasdaq composite sank 9.67 to 779.44. NYSE volume, at 344m shares, was heavy. Stocks were sent reeling by Bell Atlantic's decision to terminate its planned acquisition of Tele-Communications after months of fruitless negotiations. The bellwether merger, the largest ever proposed, was expected to spur the development of interactive communications services which were to form the foundation of a new 'information superhighway'. Investors feared the breakdown would lead to the scuttling of some of the other proposed link-ups between telephone and media groups agreed since the Bell Atlantic pact was unveiled last autumn. But the losses on the Big Board were spread across a range of sectors, partly because of another sharp drop in bond prices on fears over interest rates. General Motors shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 59, Caterpillar was Dollars 2 lower at Dollars 108 5/8 and DuPont fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 53 1/4 . Trading in Bell Atlantic shares was delayed at the opening because of an order imbalance. When it resumed, stocks climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 54 1/2 . On the Nasdaq, TCI's A shares sank Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 23 1/8 . Communications and cable-equipment companies were particularly hard hit by the announcement, which was made after the markets closed on Wednesday evening. Latin America Brazilian markets were battered for a second straight day by rumours - subsequently denied - that the economic stabilisation would curb foreign investment in stocks day. The Sao Paulo Bovespa index lost 651 points, or 6.1 per cent, to 9,979 and the Rio de Janeiro exchange dropped 2,930 points, or 7.3 per cent. Argentine share prices, stricken by a selling panic in the afternoon, trimmed their earlier losses in the local stock exchange, traders said. The Merval index ended 3.5 per cent off at 656.81 points. Mexican stocks recovered after being down almost 3 per cent at midday. According to preliminary official information, the key IPC index was up 19.98 points at 2,592.33 - a gain of 0.78 per cent - at the close. Canada Toronto shares tumbled in moderate trading. The TSE 300 composite index lost 39.23 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 4,329.12 in volume of 68.29m shares. Trading value was CDollars 909.6m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 12 (CNA) -- In hopes of speeding  Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT), Premier Lien Chan urged the government to increase and  coordinate efforts and cooperation with all social sectors.    Lien made the remarks on Saturday [12 March] at a briefing  by  Vice Economic Minister Sheu Ke-sheng on issues regarding  Taiwan's GATT membership, such as how membership would affect  the local economy.    Sheu said that if Taiwan fails in its bid to join GATT, it  will not be able to establish fair and normal trade relations  with other countries, which would badly hurt the competitiveness  of local industries in the world market because Taiwan products  would not be granted lower tariffs by GATT members.    Failing to become a GATT member would not only reduce the  chances of Taiwan's becoming a member of other international  organizations like the United Nations, World Bank and  International Monetary Fund, but would also negatively affect  Taiwan's bid to become an Asia- Pacific operations hub and to  become a member in full standing of the international community.    Sheu cited a report by the Chung-hua Institute for Economic  Research as saying that Taiwan's gross domestic product and  export volume would increased by 2.13 percent and 34.7 percent,  respectively, by 2002 after Taiwan joins GATT. Import volume  should grow by 58#8 [figure indistinct] percent, and the trade  surplus should decline about ntgdrtp billion [figure indistinct]  (US$17 billion), the report said.    Stressing that GATT membership is of great importance to  improving Taiwan's economy, Lien said that all relevant  government agencies should join forces to facilitate Taiwan's  entry into GATT.    Saying that the government is already taking measures to  ease  the impact GATT will have on local industries, Lien asked  relevant government authorities to work harder to communicate  with both the private and public sectors with the academic  community and the legislature in order to prepare Taiwan for  GATT entry.    Meanwhile, Hsiao Wan-chang, the chairman of the Council for  Economic Planning and Development, called on all government  agencies to increase the pace of reforms necessary to fall in  line with GATT rules.    Dismissing rumors that Taiwan's bid to join GATT is  politically motivated: Hsiao said the government has no choice  but to become a member of GATT because GATT policies would have  an influence on government policies whether Taiwan joins GATT or  not.</p>

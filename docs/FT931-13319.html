			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Bank of England Governor: Challenges in setting economic policies MR EDDIE GEORGE picked up his nickname of 'hard Eddie' for his unstinting efforts to secure price stability. Last night, in a brief statement welcoming the appointment, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said he had 'made clear to the new governor that his central responsibility should be to support the government in our determination to bring about a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation'. The statement encapsulated the relationship the chancellor expects to have with the top man in Threadneedle Street after he takes over in July. Mr Lamont (if he is still in Number 11 Downing Street) will be on the same wavelength as Mr George about the Bank's main policy goal. By recounting the chancellor's instructions to Mr George, the statement also made clear there is no possibility under this government of the Bank becoming independent so long as there is no move to a single European currency. But that does not mean that the Bank will not face economic policy challenges, and possibly tensions with the Treasury, during Mr George's five year term. Behind the windowless curtain wall that contributes so much to the Bank's aloofness and mystique, the Bank's court, or board of directors, has already started a debate about its future. This will have to consider how much priority to give to price stability and how much to the Bank's other tasks such as safeguarding and developing London's financial markets, supervising the banking sector and giving some protection to industry in times of trouble. On the question of supporting the government against inflation, Mr George will take over an institution that already has aspirations to play a more prominent role in policy making. Next month the Bank will publish the first of its quarterly reports on inflation that form part of the more open conduct of monetary policy that has followed sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the present governor, has promised that these reports will 'put the Bank's professional competence on the line'. They will not be restricted to a discussion of the past but will cover likely future developments to produce a 'wholly objective and comprehensive analysis of inflationary trends and pressures'. It is easy to imagine circumstances in which such reports could bring the Bank into conflict with the government, so long as the chancellor and Treasury call the shots on interest rate changes. Mr Lamont is no doubt sincere in his determination to bring underlying inflation down to between zero and 2 per cent by the end of this parliament. But will chancellors or prime ministers always be so high minded, particularly if an election is looming? Mr George will also become the UK's representative on the European Community's committee of central bank governors. Although the future of the EC's ambitious project for economic and monetary union has been under a cloud since the September crisis that saw sterling and the lira quit the ERM, the governor's committee is pushing ahead with work on Emu. As the committee considers a future Europe-wide monetary policy, the challenge for Mr George will be to ensure that he can prevent moves that might undermine London's role as an international financial centre. His expertise on financial markets will be an undoubted asset that should offset any difficulties arising from sterling's position outside the ERM.</p>

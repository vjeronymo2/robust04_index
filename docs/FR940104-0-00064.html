			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As shown in Chart 1, population risk is lower than that presented in the proposal for both fish/shellfish consumption and the soil ingestion pathway, due to a unit conversion error in expressing dioxin concentration. The dioxin concentrations in the formulation at one of the affected facilities (Aquasco, MD) were reported using incorrect units, causing a 1,000-fold error to be incorporated into the risk estimates for the fish and shellfish ingestion and soil ingestion scenarios. When this error was corrected, the TCDD-TEQ levels used as the source concentration for affected facilities (cross-contamination from past use of chlorophenolic formulations) and used in the lifetime individual risk estimates for the soil/fish and shellfish ingestion scenarios also were reduced 1,000-fold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The incremental population risk was revised for the ground-water scenario from an original 0.005 value to between 0.007 and 0.02 cancer cases. This range of 0.007 to 0.02 cancer cases was obtained because two different modelling scenarios were run to generate the extremes of this range. One model run used input parameters which would simulate decay for a small production plant. The input information was obtained from a mass balance iteration which showed that it would take a small plant approximately 6 years to decrease cross-contamination levels to near zero; likewise, the second model used input parameters for large facilities which predicted a two year decline to near zero levels of cross-contamination. The details of the mass balance approach and the resulting change in population risk can be found in the background document for this final rule. The Agency believes that these revised risk levels do not warrant a hazardous waste listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above two main factors ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) chlorophenolic production stoppage and subsequent chlorophenolic use decline and (2) revised risk due to cross contamination), the Agency looked closely at any potential environmental benefits that may accrue from a hazardous waste listing. Given the market trend, the Agency cannot identify any tangible benefits to be gained from listing wastes generated from the use of chlorophenolic formulations for wood surface protection. Environmental damages caused by previous use of chlorophenolics have already occurred. A listing of these wastes cannot mitigate past damages nor can it force the clean-up of these damages. Such potential jurisdiction exists under current programs. Authority under CERCLA and RCRA 3007 exists even if a decision is made not to list as is the case for this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Damage to the environment of this magnitude from previous use of chlorophenolic formulations within this industry are not expected to occur in the future unless use of full-strength chlorophenolics resumes. Furthermore, sampling data collected at surface protection sites indicate that dioxin concentrations in storage yards (the largest area of a plant) are below 1 ppb. The heavier contamination that occurs in the process area is confined to a small area and likely will not migrate off-site to environmental receptors. Therefore, the Agency finds that the risks posed by this residual contamination are limited and that a hazardous waste listing would likely simply result in these limited areas of contamination being left in place and not produce an environmental benefit. Thus the effect on past contamination does not justify a hazardous waste listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Operating Requirements for Surface Protection Plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the Agency is not listing F033 wastes, the operating standards for surface protection plants proposed in the April 27, 1993 notice are not applicable and, thus, are not being finalized. Furthermore, surface protection plants are not required to follow any specific waste management requirements regarding previous use of chlorophenolics as a result of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Addition of Chemicals to Appendix VIII of 40 CFR Part 261  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although this final rule does not list any wastes from wood surface protection processes as hazardous, the Agency believes that certain constituents contained in these wastes warrant inclusion in appendix VIII of part 261. 40 CFR 261.11 provides that ``[s]ubstances will be listed on appendix VIII only if they have been shown in scientific studies to have toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogenic effects on humans or other life forms.'' In the April 27 notice, EPA proposed to add six hazardous constituents of concern found in surface protection wastes to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261. Based on the information gathered during this listing investigation, the following four are being added to the list: sodium pentachlorophenate, potassium pentachlorophenate, the sodium salt of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol, and the potassium salt of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol. The Agency presented information in the proposed rule and supporting background documents on the adverse effects of these compounds. For those reasons, EPA is finalizing the addition of four of these constituents to appendix VIII of part 261. The Agency is not at this time finalizing the addition of OCDD and OCDF to Appendix VIII. As mentioned before, the Agency is investigating further the information submitted by the commenters regarding the effects of OCDD and OCDF reported in the Couture, Elwell, and Birnbaum study used to support the decisions made in the ``Interim Procedures for Estimating Risks Associated with Exposures of Mixtures of Chlorinated Dibenzo-p-dioxins and Dibenzofurans and the 1989 Update''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

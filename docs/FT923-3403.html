			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: EMS unaffected by dollar rise BOTH sterling and the Italian lira remained under intense pressure in the European monetary system yesterday despite a strong recovery by the US dollar against the D-Mark, writes James Blitz. In an erratic day of trading, the dollar rose nearly 4 pfennigs against the German currency. On previous occasions, the selling of D-Marks for dollars has helped to ease strains in the EMS. But yesterday the lira refused to move off its ERM floor against the D-Mark of L765.4 for long, despite huge intervention on its behalf from the Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy which bought lire for D-Marks. Sterling retained its beleaguered image, closing a  1/4 pfennig up on the day at DM2.7900. The European currencies failed to respond to the dollar's rise partly because it was not firmly underpinned. There was no significant indicator pushing the US currency up, but it closed at DM1.4500 in London. Dealers had a pot pourri of reasons for buying dollars yesterday. One operator was guided by a Japanese report that finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations would beef up their policy on central bank intervention when they meet next weekend. Mr Julian Simmonds, head of foreign currency at Citibank, also said that there were increasing signs that the Bundesbank would have to ease monetary policy before the year's end. 'But I wouldn't be so bold as to say that the dollar is on the way up again,' he added. One week before the French referendum, EMS currencies would probably not have rallied against the D-Mark in any event. There is profound uncertainty in the market about the future of the European cross rates. Trading remains thin, and most operators are unwilling to keep positions open for long. One sample of the volatility in Europe was the performance of the Finnish markka yesterday morning, which gained nearly 3 per cent in value against the D-Mark on very thin trading, despite this week's devaluation. 'It just shows how fickle the markets are,' said Mr Mark Slater, Director of Foreign Exchange at Merrill Lynch in London. Both the Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy spent billions of D-Marks yesterday trying to push the Italian lira off its ERM floor against the D-Mark. As usual, the currency came under intense pressure at the weekend because of fears of devaluation. Dealers said that the Bundesbank's obligation to buy the lira on its floor made it the victim of a lucrative ERM arbitrage play. Operators yesterday bought the Italian currency when it dropped below the official ERM floor. They then called the Bundesbank to sell the lira at a guaranteed profit at the ERM floor of L765.4.</p>

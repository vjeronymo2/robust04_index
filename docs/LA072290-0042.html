			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOOD FOR THOUGHT  </P> <P> Now, let me get this straight: La Jolla Gallery manager Joy Ortner is upset  because "people think they can spend $3 on a hamburger and be provided a place  to sit with a view like someone dining in a restaurant in a dignified way."  ("Fast-Food Outlet's Benches Stir McStrife in La Jolla," July 15) Well, excuse  me!  </P> <P> It's no wonder that La Jolla Village businesses are not prospering: Traffic  there is a nightmare, parking is next to impossible and many stores and  galleries employ people who share Ms. 0rtner's elitist attitudes.  </P> <P> Let's face it: The McDonald's benches really are not contributing to declining  sales in the surrounding businesses; they're just benches, for Pete's sake.  Maybe, if Ms. Ortner and her disgruntled neighbors were more willing to be  courteous, pleasant and non-judgmental to the variety of people who visit La  Jolla's Village, their businesses would actually improve. How about it, Joy? It  just might work. Lord knows, it couldn't hurt.  </P> <P> LAURIE RUGGIERO ORR  </P> <P> Encinitas  </P></p>

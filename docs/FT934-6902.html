			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Radio 1 'viable' with ads BBC Radio 1 would be viable if it were funded by advertising revenue, but large and medium commercial radio stations would be hit, says the Henley Centre for Forecasting. Research for the Radio Authority and the Association of Independent Radio Companies shows that if Radio 1 were transferred to the commercial sector it would increase total radio advertising by around 20 per cent in real terms. The Henley researchers believe that this would increase total annual national radio advertising from Pounds 97m to Pounds 116m at 1992 prices. 'However, Radio 1 will be able to command a substantial cost premium. This means that a commercial Radio 1 will steal revenue from existing services,' the report says. Radio 1 would take Pounds 53m or 26 per cent of total commercial radio revenue of Pounds 204m at 1992 prices.</p>

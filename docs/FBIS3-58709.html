			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed VDV: "Briquemont Says Improved Arming of </F> Muslims Means Strategy of Tension"]    [Text] Brussels/Sarajevo, 18 Jan (Belga) -- In a radio  interview with BRTN [Belgian Dutch-speaking Radio and  Television] from the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, General Francis  Briquemont, the Belgian commander of the UN troops in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, said that in his opinion the parties in  Bosnia-Herzegovina were following a "strategy of tension," with  the peace talks, which are to resume today in Geneva, as main  objective. He described the situation in Sarajevo on Tuesday  [18 January] morning as "relatively calm" and "far more peaceful  than during the Christmas cease-fire."    The general said that the Bosnian Muslim army was at present  far better equipped and armed and the Bosnian commander in chief  was convinced that the Bosnian Muslims can win the war. The  representative of the Bosnian president Izetbegovic also spoke  to this effect.    When questioned whether statements from Brussels or Geneva  about the latest of the innumerable cease-fires meant bad news  for the warring parties on the ground, Briquemont answered that  "the army generals do not always follow the politicians' orders"  and, after the Christmas cease-fire agreed in Brussels, the  commander in chief of the Muslim army assumed that the Muslims  should continue the struggle. Briquemont called last week's  "offensive" by Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo "a sort of  provocation."    The general explained the growing self-confidence of the  Muslim troops by better arms and organization, the replacement  of several commanders and "the embargo, which is difficult to  monitor." The general said he could not indicate the origin of  the improved arms, but on the ground he had observed that the  Muslims were indeed better armed at present and therefore,  rightly or not, refused a cease-fire.    Briquemont called the intention of the Bosnian Serbs to cut  off the road from Sarajevo to the industrial town of Tuzla part  of this "strategy of tension." "All parties attack where they  are strongest and the Serbs are clearly worried about the  possible reopening of Tuzla airport, where they are consequently  increasing the pressure. On the other hand in besieged Sarajevo,  the Serbs are for example not thinking of attacking the town  because they do not have the infantry to do so, while Muslim  troops are attacking Vitez to cut the centers of resistance  there in two," the general said, illustrating the strategy.    As for his criticisms about working resources, more  specifically troops, the general repeated that it was impossible  to apply UN resolution 836 on the protection of safe areas on  the ground. "So many UN resolutions do not help," he said.  "Thousands of soldiers are lacking." Briquemont referred to  Gorazde (where only a few UN observers remain), Zepa and  Srebenica (one company) and Tuzla, where one battalion  ("insufficient") is operational.</p>

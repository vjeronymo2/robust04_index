			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Switzerland (4): The global market is the real challenge / Banking, the big three ON THE surface, it has not been a particularly good year for Switzerland's big three banks. The recession in the domestic economy has continued, which will necessitate further heavy loan loss provisions for 1992. And two of them, Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corporation, have seen their debt downgraded by Moody's rating agency. Look a little deeper, though, and the picture becomes less negative. Neither the recession nor the liberalisation of the financial market in recent years has upset the position of the major banks at home. The real challenge, as before, remains that of tackling the international market. Admittedly, the Swiss economy stubbornly refuses to recover, but the impact of recession varies from region to region. It has been harshest in the French-speaking west part of the country, and closely associated with the property market. Its impact on the banks has thus been felt most keenly by smaller regional institutions. If anything, the large banks have benefited. Their grip on the domestic market has strengthened as the sector has restructured. Mr Robert Studer, chairman of the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), says 150 banks have disappeared in the last 4 1/2 years. And Mr Georges Blum, who is due soon to take the top position at Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), adds: 'The retail market for the big banks will increase even further. Because of the difficulties of certain local banks, many customers will be forced to spread their risks and will work even more with the big banks.' As for financial liberalisation, which has seen the abolition of both fixed commissions for equity trading and the foreign bond issue cartel, the impact on the big banks' market share has been minimal, mainly thanks to their large distribution networks. Seen from this perspective, the decision by Moody's to withdraw the top AAA rating from Credit Suisse and SBC seems perverse. By international standards, the banks are well-capitalised, solid institutions. Moody's cited the weakness of the Swiss economy as one reason for its action; though, in the case of SBC, it also pointed to the size of its exposure to such risky clients as the late Mr Robert Maxwell and Omni Holding, the collapsed Swiss conglomerate controlled by Mr Werner Rey. Neither bank admits to any material impact on its business from the downgrading. SBC's Mr Blum even claims it has helped impose greater internal discipline on credit control. Nonetheless, the fact that UBS is both the only one of the big three to retain the prized AAA rating and to forecast higher profits this year suggests that Moody's differentiation is not entirely baseless. Last month, SBC said it expected earnings to be little changed this year on the SFr1.03bn (Pounds 471m) earned in 1991. Credit Suisse said it expected net profits to be comparable with last year's SFr848m. It is perhaps a measure of Credit Suisse's lagging position in the Swiss market - where it is very much the junior player among the big three - that it has also long been the highest-profile player in the international market. Unlike the other two banks, it has also chosen a decentralised structure, whereby the group's various operations are separate entities in their own right under the umbrella of a holding company, CS Holding. The structure serves to emphasise the investment banking thrust of the group's international strategy. According to Mr Rainer Gut, CS chairman, the group's ambition is to be perceived as a top flight investment bank, like JP Morgan or Bankers Trust. That requires an Anglo-Saxon style investment banking culture. 'You can't integrate the commercial bank into the investment bank,' he says. 'You will kill one or the other.' If this approach undeniably fosters a high degree of entrepreneurialism, it also appears to be a striking admission that being Swiss does not on its own offer any particular advantage in the international marketplace. The various entities have to compete in their own right in their individual markets. Critics say it is also a structure that is harder to control. It was also expensive to implement, because of tax costs on the issue of new shares. In theory, concentration on investment banking should also make for more efficient use of capital. But there were also some anxious moments in this respect when the Swiss authorities decided the entire group should be subject to Switzerland's particularly stringent bank capital requirements. At one stage, CS was expected to resolve this problem by floating 20 per cent of Credit Suisse separately on the domestic stock market, a plan which was regarded with mixed feelings by some shareholders who felt they were to be sold something they thought they already owned. In the event, the return to profit at First Boston, in the US, helped render the flotation unnecessary. The group's spat with the supervisory authorities is, however, a reminder that it sails closer to the wind where local capital requirements are concerned than the other two large banks. This policy, says one analyst, may again prove painful if the dollar rises sharply over the next 12 months or so. SBC, by contrast, has been more actively involved in international commercial lending than the other two banks. But it is still living with the legacy of a decentralised past, in which individual general managers had considerable discretion over lending decisions. This resulted, as Moody's pointed out, in a chapter of accidents which have left the bank less time to concentrate on its international strategy. Analysts believe, however, that Mr Blum will bring a much firmer hand to the running of the bank than Mr Walter Frehner, the outgoing chief executive. Mr Blum, himself argues, that the bank now already exercises strong central control over credit risk and has largely shed its decentralised 'federal' approach of the past. In the international arena, SBC has taken a quantum leap forward with the acquisition nearly two years ago of the derivative business of the O'Conner Partnerships in Chicago. Not only is the contribution to profits from derivatives now rapidly increasing - as is also the case with CS Holding's Financial Products subsidiary - but Mr Blum also sees it as an entree to other forms of business. 'It gives us a very good platform for corporate America,' he says. UBS has been more cautious about developing a high profile in derivatives - a symptom, some say, of its slowness to exploit the strength of its balance sheet in international markets. Though it has capitalised on its high rating  -for example, by earning fees from credit enhancement business - the traditional strength of UBS lies in its strong portfolio management business. UBS also insists on rigorous centralised control of risk, a policy which Mr Studer believes would be harder to pursue under the type of decentralised structure preferred by CS Holding. Besides, he argues, the universal approach allows for a team effort to provide the corporate customer with the service he actually needs. As long as the bank can maintain critical mass in international wholesale markets, it is also in a strong position to transfer products and skills from one part of the world to another. The temptation for a bank in the position of UBS might have been to use its AAA rating and Japanese banks' withdrawal from international business to make a determined attempt to raise its international market share. That its approach is more cautious may mean fewer rewards in future, but it also means less risk. In these uncertain days, quality of earnings counts for a lot.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               SWITZERLAND'S TOP BANKS: 1991 (Dollars m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Tier One   Capital/                                   One      assets     Pre-tax                                 capital   ratio (%)   profits   Assets  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1   Union Bank of Switzerland    13,131     7.14       1,225   183,911 2   Swiss Bank Corporation        9,262     6.07       1,005   152,564 3   CS Holding (Credit Suisse)    7,033     4.32       1,115   162,661 4   Swiss Volksbank               1,617     4.72          66    34,298 5   Zurcher Kantonalbank          1,332     3.76          75    35,460 6   Banque Cantonale Vaudoise       603     6.12          56     9,858 7   Banca della Svizzera Italiana   562     7.68          55     7,318 8   Cantonal Bank of Berne          527     3.14          11    16,788 9   Union Bancaire Privee           479     7.21          69     6,651 10  Luzerner Kantonalbank           466     4.74          24     9,833  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Source: The Banker, September 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

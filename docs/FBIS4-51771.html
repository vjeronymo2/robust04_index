			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The conservative vernacular daily  CHOSON ILBO in Korean on 2 May publishes in its "Reporter's  Memobook" column on page 2 a 1,200-word article by Moscow-based  correspondent O Chung-sok, under the headline "Diplomacy for  Loggers."    Reporting that ROK-Russia foreign ministers' talks were held  in Moscow on 14 April to discuss the issue of North Korean  escapees from logging camps in Russia, the article notes the  Russian Government's basic position, according to the Russian  foreign minister during a news conference after the talks, that  Russia "promised" to protect the safety of the escapees and that  Russia is not opposed to their "defection" to the ROK. However,  he "politely" rejected the interference of a third party, such  as the United Nations, in the issue of giving them "refugee  status," stressing that the issue can be resolved through  "ROK-Russian cooperation."    Nevertheless, the article explains that a responsible  government office in Seoul said with a "preconception" that the  foreign ministers of the two countries "agreed" to give the  refugee position to the North Korean escapees and to "send" them  to the ROK "as soon as possible." Besides, despite a "frank  confession" by Foreign Minister Han that the two sides failed to  reach an agreement on the "refugee status issue," the mass media  reported that the foreign minister stated during a news  conference after returning to Seoul that the Russian Government  "completely agreed" on all issues including the refugee status  issue, thus "distorting" the truth. Noting that our diplomatic  activities are "ununderstandable," the article criticizes the  attempt of the ROK Foreign Ministry to "distort and exaggerate"  the result of the talks, and stresses that the issue of  defection of the North Korean escapees from logging camps in  Russia has now been thrown into a "deadlock," because the  Russian side is not moving toward the "concrete steps," although  it promised to "cooperate in principle."    The article points out that the ROK diplomacy, which  attempts  to resolve problems "at a breath" without paying attention to  the situation in its partner country, has now been "caught in a  trap," and that most of North Korean loggers, who escaped from  the camps, have "disappeared" fearing that their lives are  "threatened." The article concludes by asking our government how  it should take the "responsibility" if their defection is "not  realized" and their safety is "not guaranteed."</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Vehicle parts complex for Midlands THE first business park in the UK dedicated to the manufacture of automotive components will be set up at Wednesbury, north-west of Birmingham, on the sites of the former Patent Shaft steelworks and Moorcroft chemical works. The Black Country Development Corporation, which is responsible for the regeneration of 10 sq miles of land in the area, yesterday said it had signed contracts with Kyle Stewart, the property and construction group, to develop 30 acres. Mr David Morgan, development corporation chief executive, said talks were at an advanced stage with the first two prospective tenants of the park. He said they were British subsidiaries of German and US groups. The 250-acre park is aimed at exploiting the strengthening of the UK motor sector, with component manufacture expected to expand to serve new Honda, Nissan and Toyota plants. The park will be linked to the national motorway network by the Black Country spine road which will run between the M5 and the M6. Construction contracts for the road will be placed later this month. However, construction of the spine road has been delayed by escalating costs, and redevelopment of the land at Wednesbury, planned since the mid 1980s, has been thwarted by the collapse of the property market. It had originally been intended for a retail and leisure complex.</p>

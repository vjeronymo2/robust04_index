			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Cracks widen in the United Kingdom: James Buxton analyses the effect on electoral prospects of the Scots' desire for independence A sensational vision will have flashed through some people's minds on Tuesday night. It was the image of Mr Alex Salmond, the ever-smiling leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), winning a majority of the Scottish seats at the general election and claiming a mandate to negotiate Scotland's independence from the United Kingdom. That night, News at Ten revealed the findings of an ICM opinion poll showing that 50 per cent of Scots now want independence. Never before has a poll shown such a high level of support for Scotland leaving the UK. It was also a reversal of the established pattern of Scottish opinion polls, which for the past four years have shown that about 45 per cent of Scots want a devolved Scottish parliament and about 35 per cent want full independence, with the status quo being supported by only 20 per cent. The poll does not mean that Scotland is about to secede. The only party offering Scotland independence is the SNP and, although backing for the party has jumped to 26 per cent, its highest level since 1989, that does not match the the level of support for independence revealed by the recent poll. But it does mean that Scotland is set for a rumbustious election campaign centred on its constitutional future. The parliamentary seats at stake north of the border could be crucial to the chances of Labour or the Conservatives winning a close-run general election. Furthermore the result, whatever it is, is likely to lead to some kind of constitutional change in Scotland. Labour is promising a devolved parliament in Edinburgh, based on a blueprint drawn up by the Scottish Constitutional Convention, in which the Liberal Democrats are the other key players. So far, the Tories have doggedly upheld the status quo, but they are expected to offer some new constitutional formula if they win the election, especially if, as seems probable, they lose some of the nine Scottish seats (out of 72) which they now hold. 'Independence has become more credible as a realistic option for Scotland in the last few months,' says Mr John Curtice of the politics department of Strathclyde University. The momentum, he believes, began with the Kincardine and Deeside by-election in November, where the Tories lost the seat to the Liberal Democrats by nearly 8,000 votes, and became the third party in Scotland  - a reminder to Scots that Scotland is ruled by a party which most Scots did not vote for in 1987. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, responded by attacking Labour's plans for a Scottish parliament as unworkable and likely to lead down the slippery slope to independence. By so doing, he gave the impression that the only choice was between the status quo and independence, and may have boosted the case for the latter option. British Steel's decision early this month to close the Ravenscraig steel plant was seen as a further wound inflicted on Scotland by the English. Two weeks ago, the four Scottish party leaders thrashed out the constitutional issue before a vast audience in Edinburgh. In the debate, which was later televised, Mr Salmond of the SNP came off best against Mr Lang and Mr Donald Dewar, the Labour shadow Scottish secretary. Last week the Scottish edition of The Sun, once a backer of the Tories, achieved wide publicity when it said it was backing independence. Yesterday it began handing out car stickers with the words 'Arise now and be a nation again'. 'If Lang thought that by attacking devolution he could scare people into supporting the status quo he has failed,' says Mr Curtice. But he believes that this week's opinion poll is rather less clear-cut than it looks. Many Labour supporters also appear to back independence. Other questions asked suggest that many Scots are happy with either devolution or independence. 'What the majority wants is change,' he says. But Mr Lang and the Scottish Tories go towards the election without offering change. Although some Conservatives say the party should be promising to set up a Scottish parliament if they win the election, ministers seem to have decided that it is now too late to present a credible scheme of their own, while a hard core within the Scottish Conservative party opposes any form of devolution. The most Mr Lang would say this week was that the Tories 'would take stock of the situation after the election in the light of the result both north and south of the border'. He has repeatedly said that the British constitution is not 'set in concrete' but has given no hint as to how it might change. It is not a stirring basis for an election campaign. The Conservatives are seen as the English party in Scotland, partly because of their refusal dating back to 1979 to give Scotland its own assembly and partly because they used their English majority to impose their policies on Scotland. The election in Scotland will be a four-party fight, but as things stand Labour's block of 48 seats, vital to its chances of winning the election, should survive intact. The SNP's latest opinion poll level of 26 per cent is not enough to bring them big gains in terms of seats. In virtually all of the Labour-held seats the gap the SNP must make up is too great. Most Conservatives, by contrast, have narrow majorities. By giving credibility to the SNP with their anti-devolution campaign, they may hope that the Nationalists will take votes from Labour and so weaken the anti-Tory vote. The best prospects for this strategy lie in seats like Stirling, where Labour is hoping to unseat Mr Michael Forsyth, the Thatcherite minister of state at the Scottish Office, and possibly in Ayr, where the Tories only have a majority of 182 and where Mr George Younger, the former defence secretary, is standing down. There is a danger, however that this strategy could backfire. The stronger the SNP becomes, the better its chances of winning rural seats where it is the main challenger to the Tories: the most vulnerable is Galloway in the south-west, held with a majority of only 3,600 by Mr Lang. Next come Perth and Kinross, held by Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, and Tayside North, held by Mr Bill Walker. With gains by the Tories from the Liberal Democrats possible but unlikely, the Tories could, in the worst case scenario, lose five seats in the general election, leaving them with four. If, in spite of such a poor showing in Scotland, they were still the overall winners, there would be too few Scottish Conservative MPs to man the Scottish Office effectively. A victorious Mr John Major would at last have to confront the constitutional issue which the Tories have ignored for the past 13 years.</p>

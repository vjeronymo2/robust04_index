			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On 1 June Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO)  announced that in cooperation with Hitachi, Ltd., it had  developed a ceramic gas turbine blade. This blade has  successfully completed high-temperature rotation tests based on  models of gas turbines used in 20,000 kW output electric power  generation where the turbine inlet temperature reaches  1300&deg;C. There are 300 kW class ceramic gas turbines for use  in automobile engines, and 300 kW ceramic gas turbines have been  developed for cogeneration systems, but this is the first 20,000  kW ceramic gas turbine blade for electric power generation that  has ever been developed.    The turbine blades have the role of converting the energy of  the gas flow to rotational energy. This jointly developed  turbine blade is made of silicon nitride to withstand high  temperatures, and it was designed with increased anti-stress  properties to counteract the stress generated by centrifugal  force.    Performance was confirmed in rotation tests at a Hitachi  plant. Tests were conducted at a rated rotation of 11,214 rpm in  air (air temperature approx. 200&deg;C) using kerosene as fuel.  Researchers measured both the rotor shaft vibration and ceramic  blade vibration, and found no problems.    High-temperature combustion tests were also conducted.  Researchers found no abnormalities whatsoever when they  inspected the ceramic blades after a 2-hour test at 1,200&deg;C  at the rated rpm, a 4-hour normal operation test at 1,300&deg;C,  a normal shutdown test, and a fuel cutoff/emergency shutdown  test.    Tokyo Electric Power is working to increase its thermal  efficiency more than 50&percnt; via combined cycle power  generation  that uses both gas and steam turbines. Since 1984 TEPCO has  proceeded with development of a gas turbine for power generation  made of ceramic material, which can withstand high temperatures.  As part of this program in January 1990 TEPCO developed a  ceramic gas turbine combustor jointly with Toshiba, and in  November of the same year developed a ceramic stator blade for  expanding gas and converting pressure energy to dynamic energy  jointly with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.    This ceramic blade is a continuation of that program, and  its  development confirms that less cooling air will be needed than  with the current metal blades, and that researchers can now aim  for greater combustion efficiency.</p>

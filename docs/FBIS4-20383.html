			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Xirong (2621 1585 2837) and Dong Yiman (5516 </F> 0001 2581) of the Agricultural Economy Department of the State  Planning Commission and Sun Meijun (1327 2734 0689) of the  Agricultural Survey Team of the State Statistics Bureau: "Survey  of Hunan, Hubei Grain Circulation System Reform"]    [Text] I. Background and Main Methods of Implementing  Grain Reform    Hunan and Hubei, major Chinese grain producing provinces,  have for a long time suffered the constraints of the former  grain purchasing and selling system, causing the unreasonable  situation of grain production and business shouldering heavier  and heavier burdens. Governments at every level shouldering  heavy financial subsidies burdens in being responsible for grain  are responsible for shouldering grain burdens. Grain enterprises  bearing the burden of debts in dealing in grains have even more  grain burdens. Farmers bearing the burden of low efficiency also  bear a burden from planting grain. If this vicious circle  continues, the burdens will become heavier and heavier.    Grain reform is imperative and it is precisely the opportune  time. First because the stable social, political, and economic  situation throughout the nation provides a good general  environment for grain reform. Second, because grain resources  are ample. Both provinces' grain reserves are 10 billion  jin or more. Third, because market prices for grain  are steadily declining, essentially approaching the posted  price, and the market price is even lower than the posted price.  Fourth, because in recent years with economic development, the  standard of living of urban residents has greatly improved and  their tolerance has increased. According to a survey of the two  provinces, in the last two years , expenses for grain  consumption only make up about 5 percent of consumer cost of  living expenses for urban residents. People from all quarters  agree that now is an opportune time to conduct grain reform and  the pace of grain reform should be increased.    In the grain reform plan implemented throughout Hunan  Province and in some counties (cities) of Hubei Province, reform  consists of the following main aspects:    A. Grain purchases and sales and prices are opened up  in all directions and under state macroeconomic control they  mainly rely on the market adjustment of grain supply and  demand. Since 1 January 1993, fixed grain purchases have  been abolished in Hunan Province and the price is determined by  the market. Most of the counties (cities) in Hubei Province that  have opened up grain also have abolished fixed purchases and  because the grain department enters into intended fixed amount  but no fixed price agricultural commercial contracts with  agricultural households, the price is determined by the market.  Agricultural taxes still are levied in kind by grain departments.    In grain sales, they have abolished the fixed quantity  parity  price supply system and have implemented a new method of supply  guaranteed in accordance with market prices. At the same time,  it has been ordered that various types of grain coupon, grain  certificate, and residential grain inventory permit grain quotas  no longer be circulated.    B. Abolishing parity price grain allocation. Hunan  Province has come out with a regulation that after grain  purchases and sales and prices are freed up, they will abolish  the former provincial parity price system plan for allocating  rice. The special state grain reserves, the State Council market  adjusted grain, and the present state turnover grain and  provincial reserve grain allocation plans will still be  administered in accordance with state regulations. Counties  (cities) in Hubei Province that have freed up grain also will  abolish parity price grain submission tasking.    C. Abolishing the "three linkages" preferential  policy. Hunan Province has stipulated the abolishment of  the "three linkages" parity price materials supply for farmers  and will allow the price to be determined by the market.  Hanchuan County in Hubei Province has changed its "three  linkages" parity price grain material supply to comprehensive  price supply with the price determined by the county government.  Grain advance purchase earnest money has been changed to  production loans extended by county agricultural banks and  credit associations. Shishou city has stipulated that they will  abolish the "three linkages," but give preferential supply of  fertilizer and diesel below the market price and above the  parity price and low-interest loans to agricultural households  that have signed agricultural-commercial grain purchasing  contracts.    D. Implementing grain price subsidies for urban  residents. After all localities have grain reform, they  will implement grain price subsidies based on the principle of  common assumption by the state, enterprises, and individuals.  Generally, it will be the responsibility of the Ministry of  Finance to allocate subsidies to the staff of administrative  institutions and it will be the responsibility of enterprises  themselves to resolve grain price subsidies for enterprise  staffs, and subsidies will be allowed to be figured in their  costs.    E. Freeing up operations and enlivening  circulation. In every locality's grain reform plan it is  explicitly proposed that they should conduct multi-channel  operations and enliven circulation. Grain departments should  convert operating mechanisms as quickly as possible and actively  participate in market competition, establishing and performing  the main channel functions in competition. Other state-run,  collective, and individually-run enterprises, as well as  individual farmers also can operate retail and wholesale grain  businesses.    F. Establishing a grain risk adjustment fund  system. Grain is a special commodity directly related to  the national economy and the people's livelihood and the state  should enhance macroeconomic controls. So, all localities have  made the establishment of a grain risk adjustment fund an  important component and measure of grain reform. Generally they  have stipulated that on top of the Ministry of Finance grain  subsidies, "three linkages" material parity-negotiated price  differential funds, and advance purchase earnest money discounts  allocated according to policy, in cities and counties, for such  things as negotiated price operation tax reductions and  exemptions and payment of service and administrative fees for  "converting people from agriculture to non-agriculture,"  municipal and county grain bureaus will establish special  administration and government controls for special use in  curbing grain market prices in special years and supporting such  things as structural adjustments in agriculture, resolving grain  price subsidies for financial subsidy personnel, and dealing  with the debt burden of grain departments.    G. Implementing a special preferential policy to  support the conversion of grain enterprises. Hunan Province  has clearly announced that after grain reform, grain enterprises  will be responsible for their own profits and losses, but the  wages of grain enterprise staffs will be totally guaranteed by  the provincial finance department for three years and fees and  interest on central special grain reserves, current state  circulating grain, and provincial grain reserves also will be  borne by the provincial finance department. At the same time,  they have stipulated that grain enterprises and enterprises  newly developed after conversion will be exempt from taxes for  three years, except for taxes on monetary awards, and grain  enterprise bank loans will continue the originally designated  preferential interest rates.    II. Reflections Following the Grain Reform and Its  Affect on the Economic Life of Society    A. Reflections Following Grain Reform    1. Urban residents' spirits are steady. In the last few  years  with economic development, the income of urban workers has  clearly increased and residents' economic tolerance has  constantly increased. Several residents reflect that grain is  now plentiful, the market is flourishing, and grain prices are  steadily declining. Rather good quality grain can be bought  anywhere and any place for a suitable price, much better than in  the past. But there also are quite a few of the tiny minority of  workers seeking support who reflect that following grain reform,  increased grain consumption cost output has lowered their  standard of living.    2. Rural cadres and masses have mixed feelings. They believe  that only since grain reform have farmers truly had autonomy in  production and operations to plant whatever brings in money. But  at the same time, they also feel that in the past when grain was  tight the government stimulated sales. Now when grain sales are  bad, they have abolished the fixed quota purchases. In this  topsy turvy situation, in the end it is the farmers who suffer  the losses and are hurt. Rural cadres generally reflect that  since grains were opened up, planting, reaping, and sales are no  longer urged, but collecting collective submissions of  retentions and redeeming loans are rather difficult. In the past  cadres pursued the masses for grain. Now they pursue the masses  for money. And a new change has taken place in the relationship  between rural cadres and masses.    II. The Affect of Grain Reform on the Economy and the  Life of Society    A. It encourages changes in the way that government  departments take responsibility for grains. They have gradually  changed from mainly relying on planning and administrative  methods in the past to mainly relying on market methods. In the  past government departments took responsibility for grains.  Everything from planting, purchasing, processing, storage, and  sales was conducted according to the mandatory plan. Grain  reform can encourage government departments to respect and apply  economic laws and use market mechanisms to do a good job of  managing production, purchases, and sales. Relevant departments  also have paid attention to market surveys and research and  gradually learned how to set up production and organize  purchases and sales in accordance with market demands.    B. It encourages farmers to adjust the structure of the  industry. They have gradually changed from being mainly oriented  to the demands of the plan in the past to being mainly oriented  to market demands. The first thing is that following grain  reform market mechanisms have begun to perform a function.  Farmers one after the other are readjusting the mix of their  crops based on changes in the market and are diversifying and  are vigorously developing the production of high grade  agricultural products. After Chenzhou city freed up grain  prices, farmers conscientiously adjusted the make up of their  planting, reducing the area planted in grain and expanding the  area planted in cash crops; and reducing the area planted in  early rice which is lacking in quality and expanding the area  planted in middle and late rice and high grade rice. For the  year, early rice was reduced by 100,000 mu and high  grade rice was increased by 400,000 mu and cured  tobacco was increased by 120,000 mu. Secondly, the  internal structure of agriculture has been adjusted. As  reflected in Hanchuan County, since the beginning of autumn, the  county has stressed three major adjustments: adjusting the  25,000 mu of low lake fields to develop the aquatic  products industry; adjusting the 6,000 mu of hilly  country to develop tea, fruit, and wood; and setting aside  70,000 mu for grain, cotton, and pod vegetables. As  income increased, it also caused the internal structure of  agriculture to become ever more rational. The third thing is  adjustment of rural industrial structure. According to a  Hanchuan County survey of 80 rural households, before the price  of grain was freed up, 202 people, 94.8 percent, engaged in  agricultural labor and 11 people, 5.2 percent, engaged in  secondary and tertiary industry. After grain prices were freed  up, agricultural workers decreased to 169 people, 79.3 percent,  and those engaged in other industries increased to 44 people,  20.7 percent.    C. It encourages grain enterprises to convert their  operating  mechanisms. From simply grinding rice flour in the past, they  have gradually converted to diversified operations adapted to  the market. After grain prices and operations were freed up,  grain departments and enterprises very quickly shifted toward  the market and accelerated the transformation of operating  mechanisms and changes in operating methods. Presently, grain  departments and enterprises at every level are paying close  attention to changing course and changing their form. The first  is streamlining the structure; the second is starting  diversified operations and opening new methods of production;  the third is doing a good job of serial development of grain  products; and the fourth is increasing business network points  and increasing market competitiveness. According to the  reflections of the Shishou city grain bureau, since grain  reform, the entire bureau has engaged in risk mortgaged  contracts for the whole staff to guarantee returns. Of the  bureau's thirty enterprises, in 1991 nine enterprises lost 7.03  million yuan. In 1992, after the grain reform, they made a  profit of 1.095 million yuan and seven enterprises greatly  reduced their losses. State-run grain enterprises have acquired  new life and vitality and maintain a leading position in grain  purchasing and sales.    D. Since grain has been freed up, processing industries with  grain as raw material have expanded their markets even more. It  can be seen from the cities and counties that have freed up  operations that freeing up grain prices and operations not only  has not produced a major impact and a chain reaction on the  market, but the operations of grain processing enterprises are  even more flexible. Presently, grain processing enterprises are  converting from large batch operations to small batch, from  simple purchases and sales to integrated purchases, sales, and  processing, and from mainly having commercial grain enterprises  receive raw materials to mainly having the market receive raw  materials. These small scale and highly flexible enterprises  that can process and can diversify operations should indicate  that freeing up grain prices has injected new vitality into  these enterprises.    III. Major Problems Facing Grain Reform and  Suggestions    Grain reform is a major reform that is strongly policy  oriented and has broad involvement. In making the transition  from the old to the new system there will necessarily be a  series of understanding, system, and operational problems.  Judging from the situation in Hunan and Hubei provinces, we  believe that currently the most pronounced problems are mainly  exhibited in the following respects:    The first is that since grain reform, quota purchases and  the  "three linkages" preferential policy have been abolished and  this grain reform is being conducted in a grain buyers' market,  grain prices are low, purchasing funds are short, grain sale  difficulties are exacerbated, and farmers' income is reduced.  Hanchuan County in Hubei Province reflects that in July of this  year, after grain prices were freed up, the price for 50  kilograms of early rice dropped to 18-19 yuan and that for  middle rice fluctuated between 20 and 21 yuan, averaging below  the state fixed price. Although the market price of wheat was  higher than the fixed purchasing price and farmers throughout  the county could earn more than 780,000 yuan, income from early  and middle rice was down by 6.18 million yuan. So, grain  farmers' income was down 5.4 million yuan, a per capita  reduction of 7-8 yuan, because grain prices were freed up.  According to this calculation, in predominantly grain producing  regions, farmers' per capita income was reduced between 20 and  22 yuan because grain prices were freed up. The 1992 farmers'  net per capita income throughout the province was preliminarily  estimated at 663 yuan, a 6 percent increase over 1991,  essentially restoring 1990 levels. But the cash income from  grain sales was down by 13.3 yuan and grain planting experienced  an extreme drop. It is reported that Hunan and Hubei provinces  are prepared to reduce the area planted in grain by 5 million  mu and 3 million mu, respectively. This  will have a definite affect on future grain production.    The second thing is that grain departments have numerous  financial debts, a great deal of old grain, and heavy burdens  and enterprises have a number of difficulties converting.  Several localities reflect that when grain enterprises currently  bearing the "three major burdens" of numerous debts, a great  deal of old grain, and a number of retiring people, go to the  market, they lack competitiveness. In the past "the emperor's  daughter did not worry about marriage." Not only were there few  network points, but several grain stores, stations, and points  were established in rather out of the way places and the  infrastructure was backward. Grain departments in every locality  are striving to come to grips with developing diversified  operations as an important measure for converting enterprise  operating mechanisms, but it is generally felt that they lack  experience, lack skill, lack qualified people, and lack funds,  and have numerous difficulties.    The third thing is that in such respects as ideological  concepts, business awareness, and understanding of science and  technology, we still are far from meeting the requirements for  developing a post-grain reform market economy. Several farmers  reflect that "in the last few years, when we had no choice we  planted grain, but when we planted grain, we also had no way, we  could not sell it off. After grain reform, production was even  more difficult. They told us that we were allowed to seek our  own markets and no longer to seek the mayor. But where do we  farmers go to find a market?"    The fourth thing is that the grain market system is not  fully  developed and circulation channels are not open. The development  of such aspects of the infrastructure as both regional and  national wholesale grain markets, adjustment methods, and land  and water transportation are very unsuited to what is required  to reform the grain circulation system.    These issues must elicit a great deal of attention and we  must adopt feasible and effective measures and solutions,  because how these issues are resolved not only is directly  related to whether grain reform can be smoothly conducted in the  two provinces, but also will have a major affect on the national  grain situation. So, we propose the following suggestions:    A. Direct farmers, based on the fundamental stability  of overall grain production, to make appropriate adjustments in  the product mix and the make up of cultivation. From the  overall perspective of China's current grain situation, overall  supply and overall demand are essentially balanced with a slight  surplus. But there is a problem with the product mix. There is  mainly excessive paddy and insufficient high grade rice. But we  also must notice that the level of China's current grain  production still is controlled by nature. Overall grain supply  capabilities still are not strong and per capita levels are not  high. Strictly speaking, China's grain problem still has not  been solved. After increases in consumption levels, especially  rural consumption levels, and gradual adjustments in grain  varieties and production structure, the overall balance is  gradually becoming tight. So, after grain reform, we must adopt  measures to ensure the basic stability of grain production and  guard against major slippage. We now must adopt a policy of  "developing production, adjusting structure, guiding  consumption, and opening markets," and actively organize and  direct the broad masses of farmers to arrange production based  on changing market demands and ensuring grain stability and  strive to develop high-production, high-quality, high-return  grain varieties suitable to increasing beans, small mixed  grains, and other famous high-quality varieties with a foreign  demand, appropriately adjusting the make up of cultivation and  improving economy returns.    B. Pay close attention to solving the financial debt  problem. We should thoroughly and completely clear up  current debts and distinguish the funds owed, and then handle  them differently. Those owed funds that are policy, the Ministry  of Finance should help to resolve. If they cannot be resolved  for a while, we should stop the interest, make them  interest-free debts and not take additional interest or penalty  interest. For the portion that should have been subsidized by  the locality and was not subsidized, the local treasury is  responsible for allocating adequate subsidy. Debts that are  enterprise business losses should be absorbed by the enterprises  themselves. At the same time, a financial listing should be made  of historical policy debts and newly added debts and they should  have special administration, distinguished from regular  enterprise business.    C. Appropriately resolve the issue of old grain. A  significant portion of grain currently stored by several  localities is old grain and it urgently needs to be properly  handled. As reflected by Hubei Province, about 4 billion  kilograms, approximately half, of the grain currently stored is  very hard to sell early long-grained, nonglutinous rice. Of  that, a considerable portion has been there for three years or  more, some even more than five years, and is inedible. So, we  propose permitting early long-grained, nonglutinous rice that  has been in place more than three years to be used to process  feed or be sold on the market at the price that it can currently  be sold. The differential between the cost of this grain and the  actual selling price would be shared by the central government,  local government, and enterprises.    D. Enhance development of the market system and open  circulation channels. 1. We should adopt measures helpful  to accelerating the development of rudimentary grain markets in  grain producing areas, while selectively doing a good job of  establishing regional wholesale grain markets in regions that  mainly produce grain or have rather good conditions. 2. Guide  the farmers to enter the circulation sphere. We should actively  organize farmers, rural cooperative economic organizations,  special transportation and sales collectives, and individuals to  enter the market and directly engage in grain trading. To reduce  the current unchecked and arbitrary farmer production and  business activity, we should actively develop combined serial  production, supply and sales grain production and business  voluntarily participated in by the farmers. 3. We should improve  methods of grain allocation and transfer and do a good job of  coordinating relations between producing areas and sales areas.  For the grain required by sales areas, we can adopt such methods  as contract purchases and sales and purchasing and marketing  agents, or have production organized and arranged by producing  regions based on the varieties and volume required by sales  regions, using sales to determine production and using economic  forms to determine cooperative relations between producing  regions and sales regions. 4. Enhance grain infrastructure and  improve such basic conditions as storage and transportation.    E. Improve social services and direct and assist  farmers in adapting to the requirements of market economy  development as quickly as possible. Reform of grain  purchases, sales, and prices is being conducted in the current  situation where it is difficult to sell grain and it also is  difficult to sell cotton, oil, and sugar. So, a great many  farmers feel at their wits ends. Some feel that they cannot look  to the market and some feel that they cannot look accurately on  the market. Some look to the market and lack skill. Some,  although they have found markets and have a certain amount of  skill, lack funds. All of these need to be further resolved by  enhanced rural social services. In brief, since the freeing up  of grains, we must not simply orient farmers to the market, but  it is important to actively direct and assist them to take new  steps to adapt to the development of the market economy as  quickly as possible.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIGNING UP FOR LANGUAGE;  </P> <P> BOOKS: IN 'SEEING VOICES,' OLIVER SACKS EXPLORES WHAT IT MEANS TO BE DEAF AND  TO BE WITHOUT LANGUAGE, THE SOFTWARE OF HUMAN THOUGHT.  </P> <P> Oliver Sacks is both exhausted and exhilarated. His body advises him to sit,  enjoy a cup of coffee or an apple, and relax. But his mind will not listen.  </P> <P> Sacks has arrived at the California School for the Deaf, widely praised for its  progressive teaching philosophy, and despite a tiring cross-country flight and  a restless night's sleep, the veteran researcher's unquenchable curiosity  insists on a lightning tour.  </P> <P> Not long ago, Sacks -- neurologist, professor and best-selling author -- may  not have crossed the street to visit a school for the deaf, much less driven  himself to exhaustion. That changed when he wrote "Seeing Voices."  </P> <P> "Voices," subtitled "A Journey Into the World of the Deaf" (University of  California Press), is Sacks' fifth book, and his first since the best-selling  "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat" in 1986.  </P> <P> It is also Sacks' first book based on neither his own personal or clinical  experience (he is a professor of neurology at the Albert Einstein College of  Medicine in New York), but on the insights, research and experiences of others.  In it, he has explored what it means to be deaf -- and, by extension, what it  means to be without language, the software of human thought.  </P> <P> Readers share Sacks' interest. A first printing of 50,000 copies was sold in  two weeks, making "Voices" the best-selling general-interest book in University  of California Press history, said spokeswoman Denise Cicourel.  </P> <P> "It's our big book of the year -- maybe our big book of the century," said  Stanley Holwitz of UC Press' Los Angeles office. Holwitz, a friend of Sacks,  brought Sacks back to the academic publishing house -- where general-interest  titles normally sell from 5,000 to 25,000 copies -- after working with him on a  revised edition of Sacks' 1970 book, "Migraine."  </P> <P> Holwitz saw the seed of a book in two essays Sacks wrote for the New York  Review of Books on deaf history and the campus revolt last year when students  demanded more deaf administrators at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C.,  the world's only four-year liberal arts college for the deaf.  </P> <P> "Oliver has a compulsion about writing; if you want an essay of 2,000 words, he  will deliver 12,000," Holwitz said, "so I knew he was ready to write more."  </P> <P> Sacks was interested in writing more, and writing for Holwitz at UC Press. But  first there was the small matter of his contract with Summit Books, which had  published "Hat." Summit did eventually release Sacks from that contract, but  Holwitz said he believes Sacks will return to Summit following the "Voices"  publicity tour.  </P> <P> During a quick visit to the San Francisco Bay Area last week, Sacks sought out  members of the region's active deaf community, centered in Fremont and  Berkeley, and engaged them in discussions over the best way to teach deaf  people -- and the best way to learn from them.  </P> <P> "Deaf people may find themselves more linguistically sophisticated than hearing  people," he said. "I have spoken since I was an infant, for example, but I  never really thought about language until I started writing this book. Deaf  people think about sign language in a way we never think about English."  </P> <P> That is, in part, he says, because deafness gives the deaf a taste of the  somewhat unimaginable handicap and isolation of being unable to communicate in  any way with others -- or, in a real sense, with oneself, since some form of  language is essential to higher forms of internal thought.  </P> <P> But there is even more to it than that. As Sacks says, deaf people may think in  an entirely new -- and, in some ways, better -- fashion than the hearing. Sacks  calls it "a new form of visual intelligence."  </P> <P> "My feeling -- and it is only a hunch -- is that there are some things that  lend themselves more to signing and some things that lend themselves more to  English," he told an auditorium full of deaf students and their teachers in  Fremont.  </P> <P> Supporting this thesis are research experiments and practical experiences in  which hearing, English-speaking people also learn and use American Sign  Language (or, as Sacks prefers, simply Sign). Each of those languages has its  own distinct attributes, he writes, and bilingual people often jump back and  forth between them, shopping for the language best suited for the idea being  expressed.  </P> <P> For example, English, being more abstract and linear, is more effective at  metaphor and intellectual inquiry, while Sign, being more iconic and spatial,  is better at conveying context and emotion.  </P> <P> In his travels among deaf communities from Martha's Vineyard off Massachusetts  to Fremont, Sacks confirmed this himself in bilingual people. He found some,  for example, who chatted in English but joked in Sign. Others, he noted with  amazement, sat placidly in easy chairs and on porch swings, their hands  twitching slightly in their laps. They were daydreaming in Sign.  </P> <P> "With Sign, there is a special playfulness in narrative and thought," said  Sacks, whose own halting training in sign language has been interrupted while  he promotes the book.  </P> <P> "There is a terrible paradox here. There is no one worse at languages than I  am," he said. "My father was very gregarious and outgoing while my mother was  great at learning vocabulary and rules but never able to speak a word. I'm  afraid I rather take after her."  </P> <P> On his most recent return to the Bay Area -- the London native interned at a  San Francisco hospital in the early 1960s -- Sacks was eager to zip down to the  California School for the Deaf. His book praises the small, residential school  for advocating early and complete education of deaf children, embracing Sign,  and encouraging its students to pursue their interests as vigorously as do  their hearing peers.  </P> <P> He also has high praise for Fremont itself, a Silicon Valley suburb with an  unusual degree of integration among its deaf and hearing residents. Here, many  deaf people are an integral part of the local arts community and government,  and many hearing people are learning Sign to expand their social and financial  opportunities.  </P> <P> "There are some deaf people who say, with a smile, that they can no longer tell  secrets in restaurants," because so many hearing people in town have learned  Sign, said school administrator Diane Morton.  </P> <P> Treating deaf people as people might not seem unusual. But, as Sacks details in  "Seeing Voices," it is.  </P> <P> His book is actually a series of three essays, the longest of which is the  summation of research into the fundamental importance of language to mental  development -- an importance illustrated by several clinical tales of deaf  children denied all language skills until they are of school age.  </P> <P> This phenomenon usually results in permanently impaired language skills, he  writes, and is a big reason why so many otherwise capable and intelligent deaf  people read and write at no more than a fourth-grade level.  </P> <P> "The greatest calamity for deaf people is to be denied access to language when  they most need it, before the age of 4 or 5," he told Fremont students, many of  whom brought copies of Sacks' book for his signature.  </P> <P> "The denial may not be intentional. It may be just the result of exposure to a  language not easily understood" by a deaf child -- that is, English or a  tedious derivative called Signed English.  </P> <P> Denying language, and thus education, to a child may seem barbaric, but Sacks  asserts it actually was -- and, in too many cases, still is -- quite common.  </P> <P> Such abuse is chronicled in the book's first essay, a brief but impassioned  history of deaf people in Western society. In it, Sacks recalls how for  centuries deaf men and women, who as children were improperly denied an  education, endured unthinkable discrimination. Among other injustices, the deaf  were forbidden to own property or inherit it; they were denied work and  prevented from marrying.  </P> <P> Enlightenment for the deaf flickered first in Paris in the 18th Century, Sacks  recounts. There, priests first challenged a popular assumption that the deaf  were incapable of learning, then recognized the genius of the informal sign  language of the streets and standardized it for teaching to others.  </P> <P> Laurent Clerc, a deaf French teacher, brought sign language to America in 1816  at the request of the Rev. Thomas Gallaudet, a Connecticut minister who was  determined to nurture the intelligence he recognized in a neighbor's deaf  daughter. Together, they founded the American Asylum for the Deaf in Hartford  and used informal native signs to develop what is now American Sign Language.  Gallaudet University, the world's only four-year liberal arts college for the  deaf, is named after that visionary New England cleric.  </P> <P> Education of the deaf -- the key to a full and decent life, and for Sacks a  goal tied closely to the use of Sign -- flowered and died as a social priority  on several occasions in the intervening decades. With each historical retreat  from that "visual language" of the deaf, Sacks writes sadly of "egregious" and  "notorious" reformers who -- wrongheadedly, he argues -- sought to straitjacket  the deaf with what was for them an unwieldy language, English.  </P> <P> Despite his evident passion for early education, preferably in Sign, Sacks  holds himself out as an arbitrator, not an advocate of any education theories.  "The purpose of my book is to urge reflection," he said. "I am not a pusher of  ideas."  </P> <P> Indeed, on the way to Fremont, he recalled a confrontation the night before  with "angry and anguished" parents of deaf children at a Berkeley bookstore.  The parents, he said, were opposed to Sign because they felt it would exclude  their children from intercourse with hearing people.  </P> <P> "They were saying, 'Why are you trying to kidnap our children into the world of  the deaf?' " he said, looking pained at the thought of having upset so many  people. "The answer is, 'No, no, no, no, no.' I could not make them see the  critical importance of giving children language -- any language -- early in  their lives, to let them learn."  </P> <P> Sacks explains that his affinity for Sign is based on the ability of deaf  students to learn that language in a matter of months, compared to the 10 or 15  years of difficult and tedious training needed for a congenitally deaf person  to learn to speak English.  </P> <P> "Language development is a critical part of human development," he said.  "Acquiring language is a central part of being human, and a central part of  neurological development."  </P> <P> Even though deaf people themselves greet Sacks warmly -- students at Fremont  collected around him to discuss his work and seek his opinions -- the previous  night's confrontation with the hearing parents of deaf children still weighed  heavily on him. He said he did not sleep well, and finally telephoned his  friend, Gallaudet linguistics professor Robert Johnson, seeking counsel on the  subject.  </P> <P> Sacks clearly prefers consensus to confrontation. Along with a shoehorn, for  example, he carries in his briefcase a room thermometer, which he said he uses  to cut short any disagreements over whether the temperature in any particular  room is too warm for comfort.  </P> <P> "I have this idealistic view that if I could only get people to listen to one  another, they would not be at each other's throats," he said, then added with a  smile: "Of course, maybe if they really did (listen), they would be at each  other's throats more often."  </P> <P> Despite this disdain for disputes, Sacks carries a rainbow of colored pens,  with which he frequently jots observations and ideas in a worn green notebook.  Different colored pens, he explained, let him argue with himself.  </P> <P> "Voices" is filled with such personal debate. Several of the book's 98  footnotes contradict the main text. At one point, for example, he writes that  deaf people "live in a world of utter, unbroken soundlessness and silence." His  own footnote snipes: "This is the stereotypical view, and is not altogether  true. The congenitally deaf do not experience or complain of 'silence' (any  more than the blind experience or complain of 'darkness')."  </P> <P> "I'm trying to present all sides," he said. Besides, he added, "I think in  footnotes and asides and tangents. Why shouldn't I write that way?"  </P> <P> No reason at all. In fact, it fits perfectly with the impression one gets of  Sacks as a brilliant and charming but rumpled and somewhat absent-minded  academic. He could easily be cast as everyone's favorite professor, one whose  lectures are scribbled on paper scraps bulging out of every pocket, one who  somehow makes even the most arcane topics not only accessible but fun.  </P></p>

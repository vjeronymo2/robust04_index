			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ingredient for success pays off as Kerry achieves IPounds 35m Strong growth in its food ingredients division, supported by a strong dollar, helped Kerry Group, the Irish food manufacturer, lift pre-tax profits by 22 per cent to IPounds 35m (Pounds 34m) for the year ended December 31. Turnover grew from IPounds 827m to IPounds 880m. Food ingredients now comprise 40 per cent of turnover, having grown by a fifth in 1993. The meat division contracted slightly while the dairy activities grew only modestly. No divisional breakdown of profits was given but the company said margins had improved across the group. The tax charge rose from 11.4 per cent to 17 per cent, reflecting the group's broader geographic spread - especially into the North American market. Kerry now has six food ingredient plants in the US, two in Canada and, following an acquisition in December, one in Mexico. The latter is expected to boost group turnover by a further IPounds 70m within the next two to three years. Further acquisitions in this sector are being considered in both North and South America as well as in Europe. Capital expenditure more than doubled during the year to IPounds 41.7m, while a further IPounds 17m was spent on acquisitions. Borrowings increased by IPounds 38m to IPounds 142m, giving a gearing of 56 per cent. Interest charges were cut to IPounds 10.99m (IPounds 13.89m) largely as a result of the group's placing of Dollars 155m (Pounds 106m) in loan notes with US investors last September at what were described as 'historically low interest rates'. Earnings per share advanced to 18.5p (15.8p) and a final dividend of 1.69p makes a 2.6p (2.26p) total. COMMENT The strategic expansion of Kerry's food ingredients division in the US, Canada and Mexico has been clearly justified given the increasingly significant contribution of these investments to the bottom line, even if the company is paying top prices for its acquisitions. What is not so clear is whether the group's earlier diversification into the intensely-competitive and low margin red meat processing business was as well considered or planned - although it has successfully built up a strong customer base through multiple retail outlets in the UK and Europe and seems prepared to operate at tighter margins than some of its main competitors. Continued growth will come through the food ingredients and convenience meats divisions and pre-tax profits of IPounds 39m seem likely for 1994, giving earnings of 20p and a prospective p/e of 16.8. As the blue chip of Irish food stocks this looks sustainable, but don't expect it to outshine the market as much as it has in the past.</p>

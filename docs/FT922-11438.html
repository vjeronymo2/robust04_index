			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Barclays Sir John Quinton must take some comfort from the fact that he is not the only top banker in recent times to find that his tenure has been shorter than expected. The list, which includes the likes of Mr Tom Frost at National Westminster and Sir Kit McMahon at Midland, is a long one. Most of those on it would probably claim that they are direct or indirect victims of the recession. But it is in the nature of recessions to expose the real quality of management in banking. That is certainly true of Barclays, with its ill-judged dash for growth when Sir John took the chair. What is nonetheless perplexing is that the planned reshuffle involves the promotion of the present managing director, Mr Andrew Buxton, first to chief executive and then to chairman. There is room for doubt over whether the top position should go to a scion of a founding family. And his present position means he must take a share of the blame for the lax cost control which has been a substantial part of Barclays' problem. There is no obvious reason why Mr Buxton's elevation should of itself reverse a trend which has seen Barclays' shares underperform the sector by nearly 30 per cent over the past year. Barclays needs first a clear separation of the roles of chairman and chief executive. Then, if the non-executive directors want to make Mr Buxton chairman, they need to find a banker with both practical ability and strategic vision to work alongside him. With no outstanding internal candidate, it may be necessary to look outside. One answer might be for Lloyds, whose management has retained its reputation throughout the recession, to take over Midland and for Mr Brian Pearse to return to Barclays. Simpler still, Lloyds could merge with Barclays, a partnership which was mooted in 1968, only to be thwarted by the competition authorities.</p>

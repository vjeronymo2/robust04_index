			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / NY firm agrees Dollars 41m deal on S&amp;L lawsuit A NEW YORK law firm has agreed to pay the US government Dollars 41m and to bar two of its partners from acting for financial institutions as part of an out-of-court settlement of a Dollars 275m federal lawsuit charging that the firm withheld information from regulators about the collapsed Lincoln Savings and Loan. The failure of the California-based Lincoln, which was run by Mr Charles Keating, cost the government Dollars 2.6bn and is considered one of the worst S&amp;L failures in recent history. The charges were brought only a week ago against the New York law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), the regulator of the S&amp;L industry. The law firm agreed to settle the charges, without admitting any guilt, because federal officials moved to freeze the firm's assets. The OTS has now agreed to drop charges in exchange for the settlement. The New York settlement could set an important precedent as federal officials are planning to bring a number of legal action against lawyers, accountants and S&amp;L industry executives involved in failed institutions. In a separate development, the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), the US federal agency handling much of the clean-up of America's crippled S&amp;L industry, has brought lawsuits claiming Dollars 250m from two major accounting firms that are accused of 'gross negligence' in their audits of two failed thrifts. The RTC is seeking Dollars 150m in damages from Deloitte &amp; Touche of Wilton, Connecticut for alleged negligence in connection with the firm's audits of the failed Otero Savings and Loan Association of Colorado. The RTC charges that Deloitte's audits of Otero between 1983 and 1988 resulted in losses of Dollars 150m. The RTC has also filed a complaint against KPMG Peat Marwick of New York, seeking more than Dollars 100m of damages resulting from the firm's audits of the failed Hill Financial Savings Association of Pennsylvania. The RTC action against Peat Marwick charges the firm with negligence, negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract. The 1989 failure of Otero cost US taxpayers an estimated Dollars 195m, while the failure of Hill Financial carried a taxpayer cost of Dollars 988m.</p>

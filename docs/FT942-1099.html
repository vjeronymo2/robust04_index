			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Scrapyard with a taste for chips  -Clive Fewins visits a recycling business with a difference in Birmingham There are alarms on all the doors and windows of Bob Howes' 40ft high warehouse in the Aston district of Birmingham. But that did not stop thieves from breaking in through the roof of the 8,500 sq ft building and stealing Pounds 20,000 of precious metals. 'As the metals were uninsured and most had come from scrap printed-circuit boards I suppose you could say the chips are down,' said Howes, whose 'computer graveyard' is one of the biggest recycling operations of its kind in the UK. At any time there are up to 150 scrap minisystems and small mainframe computers, plus a handful of personal computers, awaiting the attention of Howes and his three staff. Howes buys the scrapped computers and recycles the precious metals they contain, as well as some of the re-usable parts. 'You could call it a low-tech business. We simply use reversible drills, chisels and the good old hammer,' said Howes, 47. The company, Elkarbor, may be low-tech but it is a high-volume operation, with a turnover of Pounds 300,000. Last year, Howes and his wife, Pauline, who is co-director, turned in a profit of just under Pounds 40,000 - one of the better years for a business that can fluctuate wildly. 'Because it is a rather up-and-down business run on tight margins the bad patches, when they come, can be very bad,' Howes said. 'A big robbery was the last thing we wanted at a time like this. The last six months have been particularly poor. After the robbery in May I shall be surprised if we make a profit at all this year.' He felt that, in a recession, it was his experience that scrap metal companies were often among the last to be hit. 'When companies are closing down all around you there is money to be made by going round metal auctions,' he said. 'But now there are not so many companies around - and those that are still in existence are carrying less stock and making sure they have less surplus to get rid of. 'Early on in the present recession, when I realised that the flow of precious metal scrap was diminishing, I started going to auctions to buy in more common metals for recycling. This helped cushion the immediate effects of the recession.' 'But,' he adds, 'now there are fewer auctions.' Howes' warehouse rings with the sound of a minicomputer cabinet being knocked away from its contents. While the cabinet is treated as normal scrap the electronic components are removed carefully. Items such as drives and transformers are put aside for the specialist disposal merchants who visit to view and buy. Computer backplates, with their gold-plated areas, and chips, often coated in precious metals, are kept separately. 'This bit is what I call the recovery service,' said Howes. 'Some of these materials are worth Pounds 70-Pounds 90 a kilo. It takes a lot of experience to estimate the gold content of scrap, but we usually have a good idea. 'Quite often we have an assay done on a sample of the material so the person we are buying from knows the precise value of the gold in the scrap computer. In this business you soon learn that all that glisters is not gold. 'In most mini-systems and mainframe machines there is also usually silver, paladium, and trace metals such as nickel, lead, tin, and copper from the solder. They are all worth recycling. Tantalum can also be found in the capacitors. 'Generally we process surface-plated gold, and the rest of the material is sent off-site to be granulated.' This means it is chopped into small pieces and heated to form a low- grade bullion bar. This might then be reprocessed, or the gold removed and refined. As well as recycling computers Elkarbor dismantles telephone exchanges, usually for companies updating equipment. Elkarbor is often contacted by a local broker or scrap metal merchant - unless it hears about a job over the grapevine, 'which frequently happens', says Howes. 'Precious metal recycling is a complicated field, in which you need a lot of experience and a good knowledge of the trade. I often feel I am not really geared to this business as I started life doing something else - as a metallurgist working in steel rollmaking factories here and in Sheffield. 'Sometimes I feel I am too honest and not suited to it simply because I am happy just making a living, and not going all-out for a big profit.' Howes described some of the problems he encountered in 1986: 'I was four years into the business, having started up from home in 1982. In some instances I was putting up to Pounds 10,000 up front, only to find the material I bought-in was worth less than I had anticipated. In three instances the job was recovering copper and other precious metals from cable. As the value of the metals was lower than had been indicated we rolled the jobs over, in effect granting credit to three companies to the value of Pounds 7,000 to Pounds 10,000 each. All three companies went bump within a few months of each other.' Howes survived. And he learned a few lessons. Nowadays he puts up only 70 per cent of what customers expect. Howes says: 'However careful you are this is a business that survives on trust. Customers trust me to take away their materials and weigh them honestly when it comes to calculating the value of the metals to be recovered. I respect this.' To ensure that the new trading year is better than the current one, Howes has two schemes in mind. The first is putting far greater emphasis on chip recovery and the second is expanding into Europe. 'We can now separate chips by their number, their manufacturer and their speed, and we can do this fast enough to make it profitable,' says Howes. 'We have built up a small network of customers who will ring us up for anything from 50 to several thousand of a particular kind of chip. We charge anything from 20p upwards for a chip and the more we can segregate and identify particular makes and types of chip the better price we can get for them. This is a growth area at present, so we might expand this process ourselves, or we might merge with people I know in the trade. It depends.' Howes has already organised brokers to bring scrap machines to him from all over the UK and Elkarbor has carried out three successful jobs in Europe. 'We have made money out of these jobs and everybody seems happy,' he said. Elkarbor Ltd, Ashford Street, Newtown, Birmingham, B6 4RE. Tel: 021-359 1908</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri, the minister of  foreign affairs, said that he had received a report from the  Thai consul general in Hong Kong regarding the arrest of an army  officer on narcotics charges. He has ordered the Thai consulate  to coordinate things, help find a lawyer, and provide other help.    Hong Kong police officials and U.S. DEA [Drug Enforcement  Administration] officials arrested Major General Thanat  Phakpadiphat, who is assigned to the Supreme Command, in Hong  Kong on charges of trafficking in heroin.    The minister of foreign affairs, who was interviewed by  reporters before leaving on a trip to Cambodia on 11 December,  said that he has not been contacted by Major General Thanat. If  it is found that he actually was involved in illegal activities,  resolute action must be taken in accord with the law. As for  whether he will be extradited to the United States for trial,  that depends on the extradition treaty between the United States  and Hong Kong. [passage omitted]    In an interview, General Wichit Sukmak, the minister of  defense, said that Major General Thanat's arrest by DEA  officials in Hong Kong is a personal matter and will not affect  the Army's image.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Berlusconi under coalition pressure Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of Italy's populist Northern League, a member of the government coalition, has dismissed as wholly inadequate the proposals by premier Silvio Berlusconi to distance himself from his Fininvest media empire. Speaking at the weekend, Mr Bossi said: 'The proposals won't stand up.' The League leader went on to announce he would be presenting a completely new approach to resolve the worsening crisis over the conflict of interest between Mr Berlusconi's role as prime minister and his ownership of Fininvest, Italy's second largest private group. The challenge from Mr Bossi followed earlier misgivings voiced by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro over the plans which Mr Berlusconi unveiled on Friday. This suggests Mr Berlusconi will face a much tougher task than originally expected when he defends his proposals in a special parliamentary debate tomorrow. Mr Berlusconi proposed that President Scalfaro, in conjunction with the speakers of the two houses of parliament, nominate a five person commission to monitor the conflict of interest. They could also monitor the management of Fininvest. At the same time, Mr Berlusconi would be able to nominate an 'administrator' who would be able to sanction management decisions as an impartial trustee for the prime minister as principal owner of Fininvest. Mr Bossi waited 24 hours before commenting, in contrast to the immediate favourable response from Mr Gianfranco Fini, the leader of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance and Mr Berlusconi's other main partner in the right-wing coalition. He said it was essential to place all Mr Berlusconi's assets in a foundation which would be run by a board 'completely free from any association with the boss of Forza Italia'. The objections of President Scalfaro in the form of a much-publicised note centred on him being required to play a role that exceeds the constitutional powers of the head of state. The president, he said, could not nominate such a commission. Some political analysts said President Scalfaro was reluctant to nominate a commission when he had to co-ordinate with the speakers of the two houses. Yesterday, both the president's office and that of the prime minister were at pains to play down any differences. Berlusconi caught in web, Page 2</p>

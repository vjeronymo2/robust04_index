			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Social justice body to probe tax and pension benefits AN INVESTIGATION into integrating the tax and benefit system for pensioners is to be carried out by Labour's social justice commission, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said yesterday. Mr Brown said that he and Mr Donald Dewar, the social security spokesman, wanted to see the end of means-testing pensioners to see if they were eligible for state benefits. But there was a setback for the leadership when conference defied the national executive committee and supported a motion calling for equalisation of the pension age at 60 - by almost 60 per cent of the vote to just over 30 per cent. Labour's policy is to support a flexible decade of retirement, and the government is expected to announce shortly plans to equalise the state pensions age at 65. Labour is certain to be pressed to explain how it would pay for the earlier pension age for men. At a fringe meeting later, Mr Dewar urged the refocusing of the social security system in order to tackle the ways in which it encouraged dependency. He said that Labour could not simply defend the welfare system of the late 1970s and argue that it just required better funding. Instead, it needed to address issues such as the high marginal rate of withdrawals from a combination of tax and benefits, which acted as a disincentive to people on income support to take up work. He added, however, that in his view the social security system was sustainable in the short-term, and attacked right-wing ministers for using the immediate problem of government borrowing as cover for bringing in major changes to the welfare state.</p>

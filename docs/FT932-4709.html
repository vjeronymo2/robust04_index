			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Weak beer EVER SINCE Britain's ill-fated Beer Orders were introduced four years ago, beer drinkers have had to swallow annual price rises well above inflation. Now they are to get less for their money as well. But while the government is to blame for the Beer Orders fiasco, this time it is up to the brewing industry to account for its actions. In recent weeks, several large brewers have quietly decided to lower the alcohol content of their products. Bass, the biggest, is reducing the strength of almost a third of its brands by as much as one-seventh, while raising wholesale prices by 3.6 per cent. That is well ahead of the headline inflation rate in the year to April. Producers are fully entitled to adjust product formulations and prices. However, when changes affect something which is as basic to a product's character as alcohol is to beer, one would expect them to keep consumers properly informed. In this case, no such effort was made, and the way in which the changes have been made encourages the disagreeable idea that the brewers have something to hide. The ostensible pretext for their decisions is the introduction this month of a new system of levying excise duty on beer. Under the old method, which dated from Victorian times, duty was assessed prior to fermentation. In future, it will be paid on the final product. The switch was prompted by complaints from the industry that the old system was cumbersome and inequitable, and by the need to align UK practice with the rest of the European Community. The new system was developed by Customs &amp; Excise after three years of consultation with the brewers and modelled on their proposals. Customs &amp; Excise says the main elements were communicated to them a year ago, and the duty rate was fixed in early March. Yet the industry has suddenly decided that the new system is discriminatory. Last week, on the day it came into effect, the Brewers' Society complained that had it applied during the previous 12 months, it would have yielded Pounds 64m, or 3 per cent, more in duty than the old system. That, the society claimed, breached government pledges that the change would be fiscally neutral. The industry has yet to explain clearly why it has waited so long to expose this alleged discrepancy. The only reason offered is that it did not have until recently all the information needed to evaluate the new system. That, however, is vigorously denied by Customs &amp; Excise and hardly carries conviction, given the industry's close involvement in the exercise from the outset. It also raises questions about the brewers' ability to do their sums. Wherever the truth lies, the brewers appear determined that the consumer will be made to pay, through higher prices and furtive product changes which they have made no serious effort to communicate to the public - let alone defend. This kind of attitude is associated with old-style monopoly nationalised industries, not with a modern competitive business. If, in these circumstances, beer consumption continues to decline, the brewers have only themselves to blame.</p>

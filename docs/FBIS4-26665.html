			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Shipping Industry to Let in Foreigners"] </F>   [Text] China is opening the shipping industry to foreign  investors as it gets ready to rejoin the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), a senior official said yesterday in  Beijing.    Under the plan, foreign companies will be able to handle  cargo at Chinese ports and operate some inland and coastal  shipping routes.    Huang Zhendong, Minister of Communications, said it will  bring China's marine shipping policies in line with  international norms.    He said overseas shipping firms will be allowed to handle  cargo at Chinese ports open to foreign vessels, and to operate  shipping lines to and from the ports with approval.    "Upon endorsement, they can even run joint ventures to  handle  shipping on coastal routes or inland rivers," he said.    However, the Chinese partner must have a majority stake in  the company and hold senior and legal posts. Vessels must also  be approved by the ministry and fly Chinese flags.    Foreign firms can set up wholly-owned agencies to canvass  cargo, issue documents and negotiate contracts for their ships.    But such agencies will be unable to serve domestic  waterways,  Huang said.    By the end of last year, 190 firms were engaged in  international shipping in China, 56 of which were Sino-foreign  joint ventures with an aggregate capacity of 21.8 million DWTs  (dead weight tons).    Three foreign independent subsidiaries two from the U.S. and  one from Norway, have received the right to handle agent  services for their fleet.    Huang also promised a favourable environment and increased  transparency to entice investment into docks and roads.    "We have drafted provincial rules governing the use of  foreign investment in highway and waterway construction," he  said, but declined to say when they would be released.    He said foreign businesses are being encouraged to start  joint or wholly-owned ventures to build wharves and construct  and operate highway projects.    But Chinese must have a majority share in joint ventures  that  build public docks vital to the national economy.    Huang also said the ministry will present a list in the near  future of infrastructure projects that promise high economic  returns and are in line with State industrial policies.    Foreign investors have built container or chemicals  terminals  in Nanjing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenzhen, while more projects are  under discussion.    Huang praised Guangdong as being the vanguard in the  country's use of foreign investment in highway construction.  The province has entered contracts or letters of intent with a  total foreign pledged input of $3.5 billion.    But at the moment China is attracting the most money in the  form of foreign loans.    Since 1980, the ministry has utilized about $2.5 billion in  loans from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, and 290  billion yen in loans from the Japanese Government.</p>

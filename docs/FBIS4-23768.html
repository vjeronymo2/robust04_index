			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program, hosted by Alice Martin] </F>   [Text] In Guinea-Bissau, it is three weeks until  presidential and parliamentary elections are due to be held.  Following a number of delays and what appeared to be  considerable reluctance on the part of the head of state,  President Nino Vieira, to endorse the electoral process, a  census was finally held last month. An electoral list has been  drawn up and a new date, Sunday July 3, has been fixed. The  election campaign officially opens today, but it seems  campaigning has not got off to a good start. I asked the  British honorary consul in Bissau, John Van Marnan, who is an  observer of the electoral process, if he thought the parties  were ready for electioneering.    [Begin recording] [Van Marnan] Most of them are....[pauses]  The thing is that, apparently, there are already rich parties  and poor parties, and some of the rich parties consider  themselves to be big parties. There is a subsidy of state worth  a total of $400,000 to be divided among the parties, and they  desperately need the funds to actually start the campaign. As  far as I know, the government hasn't paid this money yet, but I  have information that payment will be made on Monday [13 June]  or Tuesday next week. The parties will need vehicles, and  transport, and bicycles, and all that to meet the electorate,  and it is already a small setback on the campaign because of the  lack of funds that the campaign can't really start today.    [Martin] And which parties are asking for more money? When  you refer to rich parties and poor parties, who are the ones you  think are rich and who are the ones who are demanding more  facilities?    [Van Marnan] Well, as far as I know, the PCD [expansion  unknown] party, for example, is supported. The president of the  PCD party is a big businessman in Bissau. So, probably, a lot  of private money is pumped into this party. Also, Guinea-Bissau  Resistance-Bafata Movement has a fairly strong support, as far  as people say, from the Guineans living in Portugal. The PAIGC  [African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape  Verde] doesn't seem to have too many lacks of funds. On the  other hand, the smaller parties that lived off contributions  from their friends, they really have difficulties to get ends  meet as far as money is concerned. [sentence as heard].    [Martin] Who is going to resolve the issue of the money? Is  it up to the National Electoral Commission?    [Van Marnan] Well, I know there is going to be an emergency  meeting on Monday to decide how to divide the $400,000 made  available by the government, and it seems the most logical  division of the money will be that everybody sort of receives  the same amount.    [Martin] You suggested that the PAIGC, the ruling party,  were  in a strong position. Obviously, they have been in government  and they have a certain hold on the administrative structures in  the country. Are there any other reasons why you feel that they  are strong?    [Van Marnan] Well, we just watch television, and we see that  every time there is a public speech by the president, there are  an awful lot of people there, and the whole town is already  covered by big posters of head of the president and Vote for  Nino Vieira, and that also gives the impression that they have  done a lot already, and it gives an impression of being there,  while many of the other parties haven't put any poster up yet.  (?Also) I have seen Bafata posters and I have seen PCD posters,  and there is this other independent candidate for the  presidency, (Carlos Gomez), and he is there with big posters,  but from all the others I haven't seen anything yet.

Statutory Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statutory authority for awards made under the AoA Discretionary Funds Program is contained in Title II and Title IV of the Older Americans Act, (42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.), as amended by the Older American Act Amendments of 1992, Pub.L.102&hyph;375, September 30, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Public Comments on this Announcement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> AoA invites comments on this Discretionary Funds Program Announcement. In addition, because the field of aging is characterized by rapidly unfolding events, new data, findings and interpretations, and a diversity of issues important to older people, the Administration on Aging is considering the publication of two Discretionary Funds Program Announcements in Fiscal Year 1995, in early Winter and late Spring. We invite comments on that possibility as well. Please direct your comments to: Office of Program Development, Administration on Aging, 330 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20201. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part II_Priority Areas <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part II of the Discretionary Funds Program (DFP) Announcement sets forth the priority areas under which applications will be considered for funding by the Administration on Aging. Part II also provides general guidelines concerning eligible applicants as well as project costs and duration. More specific instructions regarding eligibility, the federal share of project costs, project duration, and deadline dates for the submission of applications may be found under the individual priority areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications must be directly and explicitly responsive to the expressed concerns of the particular priority area under which they are submitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Eligible Applicants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a general rule, any public or nonprofit agency, organization, or institution is eligible to apply under this Discretionary Funds Program Announcement. Where there are exceptions to this rule, they are specified in the appropriate priority area description. The Administration on Aging will not consider grant applications from individuals because they are ineligible to receive a grant award under the provisions of Title IV of the Older Americans Act. For-profit organizations are not eligible applicants, but may participate as subgrantees or subcontractors to eligible public or nonprofit agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any nonprofit organization applying under this program announcement that is not now a DHHS grantee should include, with its application, Internal Revenue Service or other legally recognized documentation of its nonprofit status. A nonprofit applicant cannot be funded without proof of its status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Project Costs and Duration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under each priority area, AoA has estimated the number of projects to be funded and offered guidelines regarding both the duration of those projects and the anticipated federal share of project costs. Because applications are reviewed on a competitive basis within priority areas, they are expected to be comparable in terms of cost and duration. Therefore, applicants are strongly urged to adhere to those guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Projects Funded Under Cooperative Agreement Awards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under certain priority areas, AoA has indicated it will use the mechanism of the cooperative agreement in making awards. Under the cooperative agreement mechanism, AoA and each project grantee will share responsibility for managing that project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The grantee organization will have the primary responsibility for developing and implementing the activities of the project. AoA will join with the grantee in deciding the major issues to be addressed by the project; use periodic briefings and ongoing consultation to share with the grantee its knowledge of the issues being addressed by the project as well as information about relevant activities being undertaken by others; provide feedback to the grantee about the usefulness to the field of its written products and information sharing activities; and participate as much as possible in the deliberations of the project advisory committee. The details of this relationship will be set forth in the cooperative agreement to be developed and signed by AoA and the prospective grantee prior to the issuance of the award. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

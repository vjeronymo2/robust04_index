			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Provide protective equipment for all members of the local medical response team. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Train members of the local medical response team in these measures: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Prevention of secondary contamination from chemically exposed patients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Decontamination procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Evaluation of the medical needs of chemically exposed patients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Treatment of large groups of patients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Transportation of victims to a medical facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Chemical protective clothing and respiratory protection enable responders to care for patients exposed to chemicals while protecting themselves from secondary contamination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ensure that such equipment protects the skin, eyes, and respiratory tracts of the emergency responders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Use DA battledress overgarments (BDOs) and portable air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) with an organic vapor cartridge to protect civilians from chemical warfare agents. BDOs can be used for up to 24 hours in an agent-contaminated environment at levels of up to 10 grams of agent per square meter of surface area. Notwithstanding this recommendation, however, civilian emergency responders should use the equipment with which they are most familiar, providing that the equipment used is at least as protective as the above CDC recommendations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Train personnel required to use personal protective equipment when responding to chemical agent-related emergencies in accordance with the guidelines published by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. First Responders <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Ensure that all persons (e.g., medics, paramedics, fire fighters, or medical personnel) designated by the State or local disaster plans as members of the initial medical team that responds to a chemical warfare agent release have the appropriate level of PPE and are trained in its proper use (2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ensure that equipment of first responders is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> adequately maintained <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and available at all times. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Schedule regular drills and training sessions designed to maintain first responders' familiarity with equipment into State and local disaster plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The Public <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CDC does not recommend distributing PPE (e.g., gas masks or protective suits) to the public. In the unlikely event that a chemical agent release threatens the civilian population adjacent to a military facility, CDC recommends the following graded emergency response: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Evacuate the population at risk in accordance with State or local disaster management guidelines. If no local guidelines exist, follow the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and DA joint guidelines for evacuating civilian populations threatened by chemical warfare agents (3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Follow FEMA and DA recommendations for sheltering the population in place (e.g., keep people in their homes, institutions, or places of business and seal windows and doors from an external vapor threat) if it is not practical to evacuate the population (3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Decontamination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Decontamination is the careful and systematic removal of hazardous substances from victims, equipment, and the environment. Transporting contaminated patients exposes emergency response personnel to chemical warfare agents and contaminates rescue vehicles. Proper decontamination prevents secondary contamination and chemical injury to medical and rescue personnel. Acceptable decontamination guidelines for persons who may possibly have been exposed to chemical warfare agents are published by FEMA and DA (3,4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Decontamination of patients can be achieved by mechanically removing, diluting, absorbing, or neutralizing the chemical agent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

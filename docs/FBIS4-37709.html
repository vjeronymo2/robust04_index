			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the Democratic Republic of  Yemen Defense Ministry has stated the following: The forces of  the ruling military regime in Sanaa today continued their  desperate offensive attempts to advance in the direction of the  capital, Aden. At the same time, they continued their rocket,  air, and artillery shelling of residential quarters and economic  and service installations in Aden, while our Armed Forces  confronted them bravely.    Our Armed Forces prevented any advances by the enemy, and  forced him to withdraw and abandon numerous occupied positions.  They also inflicted further human and material losses on him.  The enemy losses were as follows: 20 tanks, 10 crews members  [atqum], five Katyusha rocket launching vehicles, a MiG-21 jet,  and hundreds of killed and wounded.    In Shabwah Governorate, our forces, in close coordination  with the tribes of Shabwah and popular resistance detachments,  continued liquidating scattered remnants and pockets of the  forces of the ruling military regime in Sanaa. Our forces  managed to capture (al-Qat) Camp, two trucks loaded with  ammunition, and supply goods.    In Ma'rib Governorate, popular resistance detachments  destroyed a meeting site for leaders and supporters of the  military regime in Sanaa. In Wadi (Tubah), two troop trucks  were completely destroyed. Battles are still continuing on all  combat fronts between our defending forces and the (?oppressive)  and aggressive forces of the ruling military regime in Sanaa.  Victory is our ally, God willing.</p>

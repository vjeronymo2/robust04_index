			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: City Site moves back into profit Despite poor conditions in the property market, City Site Estates returned to pre-tax profit in the half year ended March 31 1992. But the directors have omitted the interim dividend. Profit came to Pounds 190,000, against a loss of Pounds 1.99m for the corresponding period which rose to Pounds 3.37m by the year-end. After the preference dividends, losses per share came to 2.43p (16.67p). Mr William Syson, chairman, explained that the modest profit and continuing uncertainty in the market prevented the directors from declaring an interim dividend. Last year it was 0.96p.</p>

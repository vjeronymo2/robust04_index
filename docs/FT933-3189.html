			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Arts: Today's Television Are we ready for 'the dark heart of the glory that was Rome'? It is offered by BBC2's history series Timewatch which returns with an account of activities in the Colosseum at the time of Julius Caesar. It seems these included tightrope walking elephants, Christians used as human torches, and women fighting gladiator dwarfs (8.00). The Radio 4 series In Business reports on 'Europe Unchained'. It is a year since the pound left the ERM, and in July the mechanism virtually broke down. The question is: 'Can the rest of Europe imitate Britain and turn monetary disaster into economic recovery?' Is that what we are experiencing? Switch to Radio 3 and you will catch almost the whole of its programme on the semi-finals in the Leeds International Piano Competition. Inside Story (9.30 BBC1) tells how Battersea Park School, is being turned into Battersea Technical College with Pounds 2.5m worth of science and computer labs and a 'technology aptitude test'. Some condemn this but parents respect a school where you have to pass a test to get in and already applications outnumber places.</p>

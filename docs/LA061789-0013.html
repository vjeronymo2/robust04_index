			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOSTER PARENTS IN L.A. COUNTY  </P> <P> Thank you for your very thoughtful and compassionate article regarding foster  parents ("The Stand-Ins: Foster Parents Who Stick With County Program Take  Their Roles Seriously," by Myrna Oliver, Metro May 30).  </P> <P> The article clearly demonstrates the quality of care and genuine concern that  foster parents bring to abused and neglected children in this county. Our  programs for children simply could not function without foster parents -- they  are the heartbeat of the entire program. For those children who cannot be  returned to their natural parents, or who must have a specialized placement in  a group home, foster parents are the only resource.  </P> <P> We have some 3,800 foster parents in Los Angeles County who are constantly  called upon at all hours of the day and night to provide services to children  who often have been in deep trauma. It is a tribute to foster parents that most  of these children are able to have stable and productive lives as a result of  the care given them by foster parents.  </P> <P> It should also be understood that money received by foster parents goes for the  needs of children and does not constitute any form of payment for services to  foster parents.  </P> <P> Thanks again for a terrific article.  </P> <P> ROBERT L. CHAFFEE  </P> <P> Director, Department  </P> <P> of Children's Services  </P> <P> Los Angeles County  </P></p>

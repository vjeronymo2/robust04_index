			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> NEW PRESCHOOL HAS OPENINGS FOR FALL  </P> <P> Several spots are open for the fall term in the new preschool program operated  by the Centralia School District, district officials said.  </P> <P> "We know that there are still a lot of parents looking for preschools," said  Barbara Sanchez, administrator of special programs.  </P> <P> "It is critical, especially at this time of year."  </P> <P> The district began the preschool in February. The full-day program runs from  6:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. and is housed at Buena Terra School, 8299 Holder St.  Parents can enroll their children in either half-day or full-day spots.  </P> <P> Sanchez said there are 14 openings created by children who went on summer  vacations or who are going to kindergarten in September. The program can  accommodate up to 24 youngsters, 3 and 4 years old.  </P> <P> The program is unusual because it is one of the few in Orange County that is  operated by a school district, Sanchez said. Two lead teachers and two  co-instructors have been hired to oversee the children.  </P> <P> Placement in the program is on a first-come, first-served basis. For more  information, call (714) 228-3228.  </P></p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / French growth forecast improves France's official statistics agency yesterday raised to 0.9 per cent its estimate of economic growth in the first half of this year, while the central bank brought its intervention rate down by another 0.1 percentage point to 5.4 per cent. The two moves spell good news for Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. His standing in the opinion polls - a key element in any decision he takes to contest next year's presidential election - recently rallied slightly, after a steady drop in the wake of his controversial and abortive attempts at labour market reform, In making its fifth small interest rate cut in a month and so tracking the monetary easing in Germany, the Bank of France also reduced its higher 'repurchase' rate by 0.35 of a percentage point to 6.40 per cent. Societe Generale and Banque Nationale de Paris yesterday led a move by commercial banks to trim their base rate from 7.95 to 7.7 per cent. Insee, the statistics agency, had in March forecast that growth in the six months of this year would be 0.7 per cent above that of the last half of 1993. Insee economists said yesterday that even in the unlikely event that economic recovery flattened out entirely in the second half of 1994, the 'carry over' effect of first half growth would put year-on-year growth for 1994 at 1.3 per cent, in line with the government's own target. The statistics agency also said it was effectively scrapping its December 1993 forecast that the unemployment rate would rise by a further 0.5 percentage point this year, as the jobless rate has stuck at 12.2 per cent since the start of the year. Several thousand public employees demonstrated yesterday in Paris against possible restructuring moves, even though Mr Balladur has decreed a freeze on public sector redundancies. The three major factors in recovery, according to Insee, have been: Increased demand for consumer goods, led by the 40 per cent rise in car sales between January and April. This was largely due to special government financial incentives for car purchases, but Insee now sees higher foreign demand for French cars. A stabilisation in industrial producer prices, whose fall last year led French companies to get rid of stocks of declining value. But consumer price inflation, which hit an historic annual low of 1.5 per cent in March, is predicted to remain low, an expectation the Bank of France shares. An increase this year in companies' investments which fell by a very sharp 17 per cent last year.</p>

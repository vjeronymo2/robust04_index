			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Letter: Royal Mint crowns history of confusion Sir, Your published illustration of a selection of European bank notes ('Breaking out of the D-Mark's orbit', September 18) highlights an intriguing aspect of British monetary policy. While international markets have been churning sterling in recent weeks, the Royal Mint has been contributing for years to our monetary confusion. Of all the notes illustrated Britain's, denominationally, is the most difficult to identify. The Pounds 5, Pounds 10 (new) and Pounds 20 notes can hardly be distinguished, except in bright daylight. S Matthews, 46 Lower Belgrave Street, London SW1W 0LN</p>

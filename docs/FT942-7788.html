			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right route to employee shares Sir, Vishvas Kanji told only part of the story when he noted that the number of employee share ownership plans (Esops) drawn up in the UK under the 1989 legislation could be counted on the fingers of one hand (Letters, May 18). There are currently well in excess of 60 companies with Esops which make use of case law to achieve tax efficiency. This figure excludes companies which had Esops but have floated or bought out and thus made thousands of pounds for employees. Yorkshire Rider is a good example of the latter case. Workers at the bus company have received an average of Pounds 6,000 for shares they received for free. The success of British Esops can be seen from the fact that a party of Russian business people arrived in Britain at the beginning of last week in order to learn what role Esops can play in the Russian privatisation programme. Furthermore, this year's Finance Act relaxed some key restrictions on setting up an Esop using the 1989 legislation. Although the statutory Esop is still not perfect, these changes mean that this route to employee share ownership can no longer be ignored. The Esop Centre will continue its successful lobbying for changes in Esop law until Britain mirrors the US, where there are more than 10,000 companies with Esops.

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Local government plans misuse resources and worry businesses (2) Sir, You are right ('Local difficulties', December 22) to highlight the concerns that business leaders have about the fragmentation of local government into small, single-tier authorities. It is not just police and fire services, performing strategic functions, that cannot be effectively or economically provided by a multiplicity of units. Trading standards is a strategic service that affects the business community even more directly. Bills currently before Parliament mean that the eight trading standards departments in Wales would nearly treble to 21, and the 12 in Scotland would rise to 28. Such growth in the number of trading standards departments is bound to increase business complaints about lack of uniformity and to reduce the resources and expertise available to enforce and advise on a complex mass of legislation. Bodies such as the Confederation of British Industry or the British Retail Consortium have urged the government to minimise the burdens on business caused by fragmented regulatory enforcement. Trading standards is a strategic service which statute should ensure is provided by large units. Richard Thomas, director, public policy group, Clifford Chance, 200 Aldersgate Street, London EC1A 4JJ</p>

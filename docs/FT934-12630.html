			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Two moves on - one back / Charles Batchelor, who leaves the growing business page today, looks back on the past seven years Six in ten of the businesses which started up in 1987, the year I began writing about small firms, will have shut down by now. By no means all will have 'failed', in the sense of going bust. Many will have been closed down by their owners for a variety of personal and business reasons; others will have merged or been taken over. But only 40 per cent will be trading in a form that would be recognisable to the outsider present at their birth. Life for the individual business owner may be tough and full of uncertainty but the past decade has been one of improvement for the small business sector as a whole. Its contribution to the economy is now much more widely recognised. Small and medium-sized businesses, employing up to 500 people, account for 99 per cent of all businesses in the European Community and 72 per cent of jobs. In the UK, schoolchildren are encouraged to run their own businesses, while graduates spend their long vacations gaining job experience in small firms; in Europe and the US, MBA students flock to optional courses on managing the small business. Television programmes focusing on the activities of small companies have become popular with viewers, while regional development organisations, which once concentrated on attracting inward investment by large multi-national corporations, now regard encouraging local enterprise as an important part of their role. In spite of the greater recognition small firms have won, surprising gaps still remain. The family firm still does not enjoy the same prestige in Britain as it does in continental Europe. The relative sophistication of the public stock market and the corporate finance sector in the UK make it attractive for growing companies to sell out or float. Not that the public stock market is necessarily always welcoming to the new entrant. My first article on the Small Business page appeared in January 1987 and discussed the previous day's launch of the Third Market. This market, intended as a home for dealings in the shares of young unproven companies, has long since disappeared and even the Unlisted Securities Market, whose success prompted the creation of the Third Market, is now under threat. The problems small businesses have in raising capital have remained a constant theme over the past seven years although the public debate goes back at least to the 1930s. It is unlikely that the debate about the 'equity gap' will ever be resolved. Funds will never be available in the quantities demanded by the ambitious entrepreneur. This is not to say that the methods by which banks assess risk and the criteria which venture capitalists set for backing business should not be subject to regular review. Both the banks and the venture capital industry have had their reputations tarnished in the past few years. Even at the height of the venture capital boom, in the late 1980s, concerns were being expressed at the venture capital industry's shift away from backing start-ups and early-stage companies. The banks, too, have had to respond to increasing criticism that in the good times they lend too much and in the bad times too little. It is by no means clear that the banks, large organisations with centralised management structures, will be any more responsive to the needs of small firms during the next boom and bust cycle. Finance is a perennial problem for small businesses, but other issues have come to prominence or faded in significance over the past seven years. In the mid-1980s the shortage of suitable premises was still a constraint on the expansion of small firms. The launch of short-lease 'managed workshops', with shared reception facilities, and the impact of the recession on the commercial property market have changed all that. But other challenges have emerged. Quality, specifically the quality management scheme defined under British Standard 5750, has become an important issue. Some small firms claim the standard is unduly bureaucratic while others have adopted it grudgingly under pressure from their customers. The problems caused by the late payment of debt have become particularly pressing during the recession and its aftermath. The need to reduce red tape has increased as European Community directives have been heaped on domestic legislation and hopes are currently centred on a new deregulation initiative launched with the backing of the prime minister, John Major. In the early stages of small firms' rediscovery they were put in something of a ghetto. Much of the early press coverage portrayed them as quirky, quixotic ventures frequently engaged in homely, non-industrial pursuits. A more realistic view has come to prevail in recent years and they are now seen as part of a broader economic picture. The FT's Management Page reflected this evolving perception by dropping the Small Business title in favour of Growing Business in January 1989. In the 1980s there was also a growing awareness that maybe the problem was not so much in getting small businesses started - Britain had become rather good at this - but in helping them to grow. The independent, medium-sized company, a key element in German, French and Italian economies, is under-represented in the UK. The government came to realise that backing more established companies made sense. They had survived the early, vulnerable stages and were less likely to go bust after public money had been spent on them. But the government's record at helping small businesses can at best be described as mixed. Although an attempt is now being made to rationalise the network of small business support agencies by setting up one-stop advice shops, known as 'business links', small firms remain confused by the plethora of public-sector schemes. The creation of a network of Training and Enterprise Councils has allowed support to be tailored to local needs. But it has also destroyed valuable schemes such as the Small Firms Service, which provided a nationwide service of information and counselling. The government, under pressure to 'to do something' for small firms, has been unable to resist meddling. The Enterprise Initiative, an extremely successful government scheme which was extensively and expensively promoted, is to be modified and handed over to the Tecs. In preparation for this, funding has been reduced. At the European level, the directorate general established to look after small and medium-sized enterprises, DG23, resisted the threat of merger with other directorates earlier this year. DG23 has had only limited success in representing smaller firms but it does have a distinctive voice in the sector. But how important is the small business sector to government? In the UK, small firms ministers have changed with bewildering speed. Lord Strathclyde, appointed last month, is the sixth in seven years. None has had the time or the funding to make much of a mark. Fortunately for the small business community, the present trade and industry secretary, Michael Heseltine, takes a strong interest in small firms issues. But the decisions which really affect small firms are taken in the Treasury, the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, all of which have other priorities. Small business lobbyists believe that it is these departments which have yet to be made fully aware of the impact of their decisions on small firms. My seven years spent covering the small and growing business sector coincided with a government which adopted among its aims the creation of an 'enterprise culture'. The recession carried away many of those hopes and many of the businesses themselves. Ensuring that business legislation, both new and existing, takes account of the needs of small firms, remains an unfinished task for government. Small firms have been the only creators of new jobs in Europe and the US in recent years and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Lib Dems education pledge scores a hit THE LIBERAL Democrats appear to have scored a hit with their pledge to increase the basic rate of income tax by 1p to finance a Pounds 2bn boost in spending on education, Ivor Owen writes. According to the NOP poll published in yesterday's Independent, 78 per cent of all voters approve of the proposal. Mr Paddy Ashdown has good reason to be encouraged, too, by the Gallup finding in yesterday's Daily Telegraph on the campaigning efforts of the three party leaders. That accorded him top rating with 34 per cent. Mr Neil Kinnock secured second place (28 per cent) and Mr John Major trailed with 17 per cent. Labour led in the ratings for the overall party campaigns at 32 per cent - LibDems (24 per cent) and Conservatives (12 per cent). The poll showed that 46 per cent of voters would like to see the first-past-the-post electoral system replaced with proportional representation. Also 56 per cent of voters want to scrap the government's NHS reforms. About 67 per cent back a statutory minimum wage of Pounds 3.40 an hour, as proposed by Labour, and 26 per cent of all voters, 45 per cent of Conservative voters, back privatisation of British Rail.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              WHO LEADS IN FT POLL OF POLLS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Last night's          Last opinion       Betting      Futures FT forecast               poll             odds       trading Conservative 302 seats    39%            11/10         301 Labour       305 seats    42%             4/6          303 Liberal Dem   19 seats    14%           400/1           24                       (NOP/Newsnight/   Ladbrokes     Dealing on the                         Independent  (for most seats) number of seats                    Field date 24-25 March          (IG index mid-prices)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

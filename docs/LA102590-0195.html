			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TUNING IN TO TODAY'S PETER FALK;  </P> <P> FILM: THE MAN BEHIND 'COLUMBO' HAS A LIST OF MOVIE CREDITS THAT SHOW HIS  AMBIVALENCE ABOUT COMMERCIAL SUCCESS. THE LATEST EXAMPLE: HE STARS IN THE  QUIRKY NEW 'TUNE IN TOMORROW.'  </P> <P> "Mainstream world-famous TV Middle America," Peter Falk says slowly, arranging  the words as if on a banner in his mind that might describe an actor identified  with one of the most popular characters ever seen on television. "But he's an  actor who has this kind of schizophrenic existence. A little bit like Charlie  Chaplin. He's a millionaire by day and a drunk by night. He gets involved with  things that. . . ."  </P> <P> The head shakes slightly, the sentence breaks off, and a brief silence fills  the converted Beverly Hills garage. Falk drops a smoldering cigarette butt to  the floor and steps on it while his visitor is left to fill in the blank --  most likely with memories of some of Falk's many feature films or at least with  some of their titles. For, in fact, Peter Falk is talking about himself.  </P> <P> "This disease of mine, it goes way back, back to when I first came to  Hollywood," he says, referring to one of his early movies, 1963's "The  Balcony," based on the absurdist play by Jean Genet. Around Falk are tables and  easels bearing the charcoal figure drawings he does when he is not in front of  a camera. "I did that with Shelley Winters and Lee Grant and the fellow from  the spaceship (Leonard Nimoy). It was directed by Joe Strick. We all worked for  nothin'."  </P> <P> And where audiences were concerned, it came to nothin', which bode a pattern  for his film career. Never mind the Oscar nominations Falk had received for his  first two film roles -- in "Murder, Inc." (1960) and "Pocketful of Miracles"  (1961) -- what followed were such offbeat, commercially lackluster films as  "Robin and the Seven Hoods" (1964), "Penelope" (1966), "Luv" (1967), "Machine  Gun McCain" (1970), "Husbands" (1970), "Mikey and Nicky" (1976) and, more  recently, "Big Trouble," "Wings of Desire," "Happy New Year," "Vibes," "Cookie"  and "In the Spirit."  </P> <P> Falk runs a title check through his mind and observes, "These are not  traditional, mainstream, big-budget action pictures. I don't know how you would  characterize them. I guess you would say they're unusual."  </P> <P> The newest addition to Falk's "unusual" filmography is "Tune in Tomorrow . . .  " (which opens Friday), a radically altered adaptation of Mario Vargas Llosa's  modern Peruvian novel "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter," which has been reset  in 1950 New Orleans and directed by the Englishman Jon Amiel from a script by  the Scot William Boyd.  </P> <P> In this transcultural comedy, Falk plays an eccentric Irish-Mexican writer of  radio dramas, Pedro Carmichael, who is newly relocated to the Deep South, where  he is packing his newest plot with details of a May-December romance between a  20-year-old protege (Keanu Reeves) and the young writer's 35ish aunt (Barbara  Hershey).  </P> <P> "Tune in Tomorrow . . . " is a seriously odd movie that merges the real events  going on in Pedro's New Orleans with lifelike dramatizations of Pedro's soap  operas. It does offer Falk a chance to dress up like a rabbi, a surgeon and a  French maid ("a very specific French maid"), since Pedro is a writer who needs  to put on costumes to fully understand his characters. But is it going to  change his luck on the big screen?  </P> <P> "This guy was like the spiritual godfather of 'Dallas' and 'Dynasty,' " Falk  says, explaining why he said yes to the role after once rejecting it. "David  Lynch, 'Twin Peaks,' they owe a debt to Pedro Carmichael, who as early as 1950,  before television, knew that people had a desire to know about other people's  hidden sexual preferences."  </P> <P> In Llosa's 1982 book, however, Pedro was less of a con man than he has become  in the screen version, which has Falk playing him as a wacky sage who  deliberately fuels the fire between Aunt Julia and the young scriptwriter for  his own purposes.  </P> <P> "It was the Irish, the Blarney, the manipulator, that mischievous sense of  humor, that flamboyant artistic thing," Falk says, citing the things he liked  about Pedro Carmichael. When producer John Fiedler first sent him the script,  he turned it down because "I knew that part was a terrific part, but I had a  problem: I didn't know how to play it."  </P> <P> When Fiedler, who had been working at Columbia, re-submitted the script to Falk  a year later, Amiel was attached as the director and the project was looking  for a studio (eventually landing at Cinecom). Amiel asked Falk to think about  the character's name.  </P> <P> "He said he's half Mexican and half Irish. When I heard he was Irish, that rang  a bell. There were certain lines that I didn't know how to say, that if you  said them with a trace of Irish or an Irish feeling, they worked. Then I said  yes."  </P> <P> Falk, born in New York in 1927, began acting off-Broadway in the 1950s. It was  after the Oscar nominations and "The Balcony" and assorted other Hollywood  ventures that he first put on the moldy raincoat and quizzical smiles of Lt.  Columbo in a 1967 made-for-TV movie. In 1971, "Columbo" became a series, and in  the years since -- including a 10-year layoff between 1978 and 1988 -- the show  has brought him four Emmies and defined him to the world. He insists that he  still enjoys it -- "In terms of playing the character, I still get a kick out  of it. I love it when it works" -- but it has not contained his ambition.  </P> <P> "Even the first year of 'Columbo,' 'Columbo' was Jesus Christ, No. 1, you  know," he says in his raspy Long Island syntax, thrusting his arms skyward as  if signaling a touchdown. "So during the day it was Charlie Chaplin, and at  night I was with (John) Cassavetes and (Ben) Gazzara trying to get the money to  make this picture 'Husbands.' And the second year of 'Columbo,' soon as I get a  hiatus, I went and made 'Woman Under the Influence,' with Cassavetes and Gena  Rowlands. The third year of 'Columbo,' the drunk came out and we made 'Mikey  and Nicky' with Elaine May."  </P> <P> Falk's kinship with Cassavetes, the late maverick director who relied heavily  on improvisation and defied Hollywood conventions, is a clue that his instincts  have never led him to play it safe. In 1963, he became the first American movie  actor to work in the Soviet Union, traveling there against the advice of  friends in Hollywood to make "Italiano Bravo Gente" because, he says, "I wanted  to see Russia!"  </P> <P> Falk acknowledges a debt to Cassavetes, whom he believes set "standards of  immediacy" for acting and actors in his films. "He was concerned with emotional  complexities and ambiguities that you don't find in movies."  </P> <P> It was from seeing him in Cassavetes' pictures, as much as 'Columbo,' that  German director Wim Wenders decided to cast Falk as an ex-angel in "Wings of  Desire," his mostly black-and-white symphony on the unexamined joys of  mortality.  </P> <P> Falk never expected "Wings" to even reach the United States. "I was amazed it  ever showed up here." It did not scratch the surface of Columbo's audience, but  it was an art-house hit and easily the most critically respected movie Falk has  had a sizable role in since 1974's "Woman Under the Influence."  </P> <P> As for his other recent films, Falk has been, well, unlucky. They seem to be  pictures that get held up in release, suffer from lack of promotion, are not  widely seen or not very good. Among them, Elaine May's "In the Spirit," Susan  Seidelman's "Cookie," John Avildsen's "Happy New Year."  </P> <P> Have such misadventures been the result of deliberately sticking to "unusual"  films, or are these the only movie offers that Falk gets?  </P> <P> "I've said no," Falk says, lighting another in a long chain of smokes. "I also  would have said yes if they had asked me for certain things. So we're talking  about both. There are certain very popular pictures that I would die to be in,  yet there were other very popular pictures that I didn't want to be in. And I  don't want to get specific about naming them. But both things apply."  </P> <P> Falk is looking ahead to another unusual project, "My Dog Stupid," based on the  John Fante book and to be directed by France's Claude Berri. He will play the  part of Fante, a late, neglected Hollywood novelist now being rediscovered.  "It's about the relationship between John Fante and his kids during the '60s,"  Falk says, adding, somewhat superfluously, "It's not the same thing as  'Columbo.' "  </P> <P> On a table across the room, mostly covered with stacks of books on Degas,  Matisse and other artists, two of Falk's Emmies can be seen. But only the lower  halves of their golden torsos are visible, because they are currently serving  as hat racks.  </P> <P> "My wife found a use for them," Falk says.  </P></p>

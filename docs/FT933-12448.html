			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: TSB pull A combination of favourable and unfavourable news for banking group TSB led to a two-way pull in the shares which brought volume of 4.2m by the close. The stock was finally unchanged at 196p after tracing an erratic pattern. The bank surprised the market by announcing that talks on setting up a joint venture company with National &amp; Provincial Building Society to manage TSB's estate agents business had been terminated. The company cited differences of opinion between the two parties. Mr Martin Green at Smith New Court said the calling off of talks with National &amp; Provincial was 'a marginal set back in TSB's attempts to refocus its business'. This was, however, countered by reports that TSB was to sell Swan National Leasing, its car leasing and contract hire firm, to Midland Bank. In the drinks sector, the rumoured shareholder rebellion at the Greenalls egm failed to muster the support needed to oppose the purchase of JA Devenish. Dissident investors had complained that the Pounds 214.3m bid, valuing Devenish at 394.5p a share, was too high. However, the bid was duly approved. Greenalls put on 3 at 352p, while Devenish was steady at 360p. Guinness, 4 off at 449p, flinched as Kleinwort Benson downgraded its profits forecasts for the group and renewed its negative stance. The broker cut by Pounds 18m to Pounds 947m for the current year, and Pounds 28m to Pounds 1.032bn for the following year. Analyst Mr David Thompson blamed a combination of weak beer sales in Malaysia, general restructuring costs and the failure of price increases in the UK to hold. He added that the shares were unlikely to begin to outperform for another 18 months. Several stocks in both the engineering and aerospace sectors benefited from a weighty review from Panmure Gordon on the UK defence white paper. The agency broker's buy list included British Aerospace, which shook off recent worries about the funding of its regional jets joint venture with Taiwan to end 8 ahead at 396p after 4.1m traded. GEC was another of the stocks recommended by Panmure and ended 5 up at 334p on volume of 4.9m. Its sell list included Rolls-Royce and Vickers, which closed  1/2 lighter at 137 1/2 p and a penny easier at 148p respectively. Turnover in British Steel rose to 12m and the shares moved up 4 1/2 to 107p, with James Capel said to have been positive on the stock. Engineering group Bullough fell 8 to 111p after announcing a fall in first-half profits to Pounds 500,000, from Pounds 5.89m last time. Profits were hit by Pounds 4.67m in restructuring costs, although the dividend remained at 1.75p. An analysts visit saw hotelier Stakis advance a penny to 57p. Rank Organisation remained friendless following the recent results and dividend policy change. The shares declined 8 to 707p. Food retailers stayed under a cloud following the raft of downgradings on Tuesday. Tesco slipped 3 to 199p and Argyll Group 4 to 291p. Cadbury-Schweppes, over which fears of brand name discounting have hung in recent sessions, rallied 4 1/2 to 437 1/2 p. Unilever, which had been under similar pressure, gained 5 at 952p. A warning that magazine launches would impact on profits knocked 2 off the shares of Emap, which closed at 338p. However, the chairman's statement at the agm was upbeat about future trading. Some recovery was made in the stock of Hartstone, the hosiery and leather goods group, ahead of the posting of accounts and reports to shareholders. There was also market talk of a persistent buyer. The share price moved up 4 to 49p. Electricity utilities saw lively trading as their appeal as defensive stocks held. Eastern firmed 3 to 485p, London 2 to 493p, Northern 2 to 523p and Southern 3 to 492p. Norweb was the top performer with an increase of 9 to 530p, its attraction coming from being the only 'Rec' that remains cum-dividend. A couple of the stocks showed slight declines - most likely as money was switched into Norweb, said one market watcher. National Power shed 5 to 351p and PowerGen gave up 7 to 372p as worries on the review of the pool price continued. Some of the loss was also put down to profit-taking. The fortunes of Regalian Properties improved a little on reports that it had sold its luxury Palace Green flats in central London. The shares went up 2 to 19 1/2 p. A squeeze in Dixons left the stock 10 ahead at 210p. Computer software producer Sage Group rallied after both NatWest Securities and UBS said that the previous session's fall - from 504p to 385p - had been overdone. The shares closed 29 higher at 414p. The company warned on Wednesday that pre-tax profits and earnings per share for the year to September this year would be lower than market expectations, although still ahead of last year's figures. Television issues continued to make headway. Scottish TV moved forward 3 to 519p, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV gained 5 at 203p, Central made the same advance to close at 1963p and Carlton Communications put on 3 at 733p. Anglia TV, which was boosted the previous day by a buy note from NatWest Securities, added 6 at 331p.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Cyanamid accepts Dollars 9.7bn takeover bid American Cyanamid, the US healthcare and agricultural products group, yesterday accepted a Dollars 9.7bn (Pounds 6.3bn) takeover bid from American Home Products after a brief fight to stay independent. The deal is the largest yet in the series of transactions reshaping the US pharmaceuticals and healthcare industry. It will create a new powerhouse with combined annual sales of Dollars 12.5bn and interests ranging from prescription drugs and vaccines to consumer products and chemicals. The battle for control of Cyanamid was short. Its management initially rejected AHP's unsolicited advance on August 2, when the pharmaceuticals and food products group launched an all-cash offer of Dollars 95 a share. When AHP raised its bid to Dollars 100 a share, Cyanamid again stood firm, hoping to attract a rival bidder willing to negotiate a friendly merger at a price above AHP's bid. But no 'white knight' emerged and Cyanamid's resistance crumbled. Its board yesterday accepted a further offer from AHP of Dollars 101 a share after a brief meeting. Cyanamid's management had been under pressure to accept AHP's bid from shareholders who were unhappy that the company had spurned the original offer, which valued Cyanamid's stock at a premium of more than 50 per cent over its pre-bid price. That pressure intensified last week when six lawsuits were filed against Cyanamid by shareholders who claimed the company had acted improperly in rejecting AHP's first bid. Mr Albert Costello, Cyanamid's chairman, who had been steering the company through a restructuring when AHP pounced, said: 'For the past 18 months, we have been pursuing an aggressive strategic programme to build value. The success of this programme can be measured by the significant increase in our share price prior to the AHP offer. 'After a thorough analysis of AHP's increased offer, our board concluded that a combination of the two companies will result in a stronger company, better situated to compete in the rapidly evolving healthcare marketplace.' The rapid conclusion of the Cyanamid takeover justified the hardline approach adopted by Mr John Stafford, AHP chairman, during the bid battle. AHP's initial bid came two weeks ago when it learned that Cyanamid had discussed an asset swap with SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US drugs group. Cyanamid rejected the first offer and, two days ago, AHP raised its bid to Dollars 100 a share on condition that Cyanamid accepted it within 24 hours. That deadline expired on Tuesday night, and by yesterday morning, with no friendly bidder in sight, Cyanamid's management was ready to do a deal. Investors' reaction to AHP's success suggested they shared Mr Stafford's stated view that the deal was good for both company's shareholders. In New York, AHP's shares closed up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 59 1/4. Cyanamid ended Dollars 2 3/8 higher at Dollars 96 1/8. US stocks, Page 29</p>

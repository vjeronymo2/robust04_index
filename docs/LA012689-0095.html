			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THRIVING MARKET FOR STOLEN PARTS BLAMED FOR 22% RISE IN AUTO THEFTS  </P> <P> Auto thefts reported in Glendale increased by 22.7% in 1988, while burglaries  dropped by 11%, according to police statistics released last week.  </P> <P> Glendale police attribute the jump from 1,328 auto thefts in 1987 to 1,630 in  1988 to a burgeoning underground market for stolen car parts and car stereo  equipment. The overall rate of major crimes in Glendale did not change  significantly from the 1987 rate, police said.  </P> <P> Car break-ins also increased, raising the city's overall theft rate by 2% over  the previous year. The increase occurred even as other types of burglaries  dropped by 11%, according to the statistics.  </P> <P> The figures are compiled and released annually by the Glendale Police  Department's crime analyst.  </P> <P> "There is really a market for stolen auto parts, which we believe accounts for  the increased number of thefts," Glendale Police Sgt. Dean Duran said. "There  is also a low risk of being caught."  </P> <P> The rise in auto thefts reported in Glendale has contributed to Assemblyman  Patrick Nolan's introduction this week of a package of bills to strengthen  penalties for stealing cars.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Working With Assemblyman  </P> <P> The head of the department's auto theft detail, Officer Don Meredith, has been  working with Nolan (R-Glendale) to develop the legislation in recent months.  </P> <P> Violent crimes were down 24% in 1988, with reports of aggravated assaults  decreasing by 40.5%, according to the statistics. Aggravated assaults are  generally defined as assaults with deadly weapons and those causing great  bodily injury.  </P> <P> Police handled six murders in 1988, the same number as in 1987.  </P> <P> Rapes and attempted rapes increased by 14.3% from 1987, statistics show, from  28 to 32. Duran said more women reported rapes by their husbands or live-in  boyfriends last year.  </P> <P> Arson decreased from 104 reported cases in 1987 to 44 in 1988, a drop of 57.7%.  Duran said Fire Department officials attributed the change to new reporting  procedures. Officials no longer classify fires set by children under the age of  13 as arson fires.  </P> <P> Overall, crimes against people and property in Glendale were down 0.1% in 1988,  according to the police statistics.  </P></p>

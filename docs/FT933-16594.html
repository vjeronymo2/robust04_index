			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pace hots up for new equity issues THERE HAS been a surge of new equity issues on the London Stock Exchange with the amount raised in the first half of this year already exceeding the total for the whole of last year by 6.6 per cent. According to a survey by IFR Securities Data, a total of Pounds 11.8bn has so far been raised this year, compared with Pounds 11bn in the previous 12 months. This year's first half total of 294 new issues is 72 per cent ahead of the same stage last year. IFR said this represented a remarkable turnaround in both the willingness of companies to seek new capital, and in investor confidence. Rights issues continued to be the preferred method of capital raising, with Pounds 7.48bn of the Pounds 11.8bn raised this year having been through cash calls. Last year they accounted for 34 per cent of the volume underwritten, but the figure now stands at 64 per cent. The Zeneca cash call represented 18 per cent of this total, and 11.5 per cent of the whole domestic new equity issues market. The property sector accounted for 12.8 per cent of rights activity, with large issues from Slough Estates, Hammerson, British Land and MEPC. SG Warburg leads the league table of merchant bankers handling the new equity issues, having raised Pounds 1.96bn so far this year - 16.6 per cent of the total - from 39 issues. IFR said that Warburg's dominance of the market this year already seemed assured. Lazard Brothers is second, with Pounds 1.18bn underwritten in the first half from 11 issues. BZW is third, with a total of Pounds 1.15bn from 20 issues. Morgan Grenfell is fourth, having raised Pounds 1.12bn from eight issues. With established UK houses at the top, the survey said Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were leading a cautious American move into the market.</p>

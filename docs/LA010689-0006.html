			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> YAROSLAVSKY WON'T OPPOSE BRADLEY FOR MAYOR'S OFFICE  </P> <P> In a move that stunned friends and political supporters, Los Angeles City  Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky has decided not to oppose Tom Bradley in this year's  mayoral election, sources close to the councilman said Thursday.  </P> <P> The decision clears the way for the 71-year-old Bradley to run for an  unprecedented fifth term without any known serious opposition at a point three  months before the primary election. No other major candidate has appeared in  opposition to the mayor.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky, who spent Thursday calling a close circle of friends, would not  "confirm or deny anything," a campaign spokeswoman said. He has scheduled a  City Hall press conference for this morning to announce his decision.  </P> <P> But sources told The Times that the Westside councilman had concluded within  the last week that "he can't win," after a poll commissioned by Yaroslavsky  showed voters overwhelmingly favoring Bradley.  </P> <P> "He spent a year and a half trying to make something here," said a former top  Yaroslavsky aide. "In the last few weeks evaluating what you have or don't  have, he's come to the conclusion that he doesn't have it."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky, who turned 40 last month, intends to run again for his 5th  District City Council seat, the sources said. He ran unopposed in 1985 and 1981  and won convincingly in 1977 in his Westside district. He was first elected in  1975.  </P> <P> The decision surprised Yaroslavsky's political supporters and his allies on the  City Council because he had led them to believe over the last several months  that he would challenge Bradley. John Barbieri, a Yaroslavsky supporter and  former president of the San Pedro Chamber of Commerce, said last month that  Yaroslavsky told him that he would declare his candidacy for mayor in early  January.  </P> <P> Si Frumkin, one of Yaroslavsky's closest friends, said, "I'm very surprised and  saddened because I felt he was determined to run, and I felt he had a very good  chance to make it. He worked very hard. . . . I think he would be a hell of a  good mayor."  </P> <P> Councilman Michael Woo also was startled when told that Yaroslavsky had decided  to drop out. "He's been maintaining a steadfast position that it's up or out  for him and he intends to go ahead," Woo said.  </P> <P> For the last year, Yaroslavsky had been positioning himself to run for mayor by  hiring a full-time campaign staff, raising more than $1 million in political  contributions and attacking Bradley for growing stale and sluggish in dealing  with gang violence, traffic and environmental problems. Yaroslavsky also  assembled a campaign steering committee that included several former Bradley  supporters and major figures in the entertainment industry, including Ed  Sanders, a prominent Los Angeles attorney; Barry Diller, chairman of 20th  Century Fox, and Walter Mirisch, former president of the Academy of Motion  Picture Arts and Sciences.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suffers a Setback  </P> <P> But Yaroslavsky suffered a serious setback in August when two controversial  memos that were used to help formulate his campaign strategy were leaked to The  Times. The memos, which were written by political consultants Michael Berman  and Carl D'Agostino and kept in Yaroslavsky's City Hall office, mocked  Bradley's intelligence and implored the councilman to focus his fund-raising  efforts exclusively on "wealthy" Jews who live on the city's Westside.  </P> <P> With Yaroslavsky out of the race, the concern among several community leaders  that a confrontation would develop between blacks and Jews in the coming  election seems moot.  </P> <P> At the time the memos were released, Yaroslavsky said they contained  "offensive, contemptuous and insulting" language and vowed not to hire close  friends Berman and D'Agostino to run his mayoral campaign. But after BAD, the  Berman-D'Agostino firm, successfully ran the anti-oil drilling initiative  campaign in November, Yaroslavsky began hinting in recent weeks that he might  again hire the firm.  </P> <P> This admission hurt Yaroslavsky politically at a time when he had not yet  recovered from the Berman-D'Agostino memo debacle, said one City Council ally  who asked not to be identified. Nevertheless, Yaroslavsky indicated that he was  "extremely determined to make this race and to make it as formidable as  possible" in discussions with a number of friends, the council source said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Began to Fall Apart  </P> <P> The council ally said that the Yaroslavsky campaign for mayor also began to  fall apart in recent weeks.  </P> <P> "I've been hearing a lot of rumors about morale not being good in his campaign  office," the ally said. "There was a problem with disorganization. There was a  perception that the campaign doesn't seem well organized at this point."  </P> <P> Councilman Marvin Braude, who co-sponsored the anti-drilling measure, refused  to speculate on Yaroslavsky's intentions but indicated that he felt that his  colleague would have faced an extremely tough fight.  </P> <P> "I think Bradley always had strengths and I think a lot of other people thought  that Bradley, except for one or two matters, has been a very fine mayor,"  Braude said.  </P> <P> But Yaroslavsky still believed that he could defeat Bradley until last week,  following the results of a poll on various issues affecting the city, said a  source close to the Yaroslavsky campaign. The poll, conducted citywide several  weeks ago, focused on Bradley's popularity and how he may be perceived as  vulnerable on issues such as the environment, growth management and crime.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bradley's Popularity  </P> <P> To Yaroslavsky's surprise, the poll showed that Bradley's personal popularity  transcended all issues, the source said. Yaroslavsky determined that the mayor  was so well liked that any effort to attack him on the issues would backfire.  This was the only poll that Yaroslavsky had taken in preparation of his mayoral  race. He had it commissioned to determine what sort of message he could present  to the voters in the spring campaign.  </P> <P> The source said that although Yaroslavsky told close friends of his decision  during the last week, he waited until today to make a public announcement  because he was still reassessing his chances and the poll data.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky also was confronted with the reality that he would give up his  $58,592-a-year council salary if he ran for mayor. His wife, Barbara  Yaroslavsky, expressed concern during an interview last month that her family  might have trouble paying bills if her husband lost the mayoral election.  </P> <P> So Yaroslavsky, who for the last decade has made no secret of his hopes to run  for mayor, decided to wait at least another four years.  </P> <P> "Zev was very subdued," said one friend who was notified. "It was a  gut-wrenching decision for him."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reassessing Position  </P> <P> One prospective candidate who had hoped to succeed Yaroslavsky on the City  Council was Laura Lake, a slow-growth advocate who has been at odds with  Yaroslavsky on some development issues. She said that if Yaroslavsky indeed  decides to seek reelection, "I'd have to reassess things."  </P> <P> Another possible council candidate, Lisa Specht, could not be reached for  comment, but it is considered unlikely that she would run against Yaroslavsky.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Ted Vollmer, Richard Simon, Alan Miller and Kevin Roderick  contributed to this article.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "News Analysis": "China's Agriculture Facing </F> Challenges"]    [Text] Hefei, May 3 (XINHUA) -- Agriculture has always been  given top attention in national economic construction, and  Chinese leaders have time and again stressed its importance.    However, the sluggish agriculture sector is faced with  challenges in the course of rapid national economic development,  according to economists.    Last year saw the national economy develop at a speed of  13.4  percent compared to the previous year and the gross output value  of agriculture grew by only four percent.    Although the total grain output reached a record of 450  billion kg last year, most provinces in southern China, known as  a "land of plenty", reported reductions in the output of grain,  cotton and cash crops.    "Agriculture is the source of the basic necessities of life,  and the supply of farm products directly affects people's living  standards and the stability of prices," said an economist here.    "Once it fluctuates, people will face food problems and it  will be difficult to construct a market economy," he added.    Analysing the reasons why agriculture is developing too  slowly, Liu Jiang, minister of agriculture, acknowledged the  government's inefficient input into agriculture, the price  scissors between industrial and farm products, and poor  education and imperfect basic management in rural areas.    China has a total population of 1.2 billion, of whom 900  million live in the rural areas.    Chinese leaders have time and again stressed the necessity  for the consolidation of the foundation of agriculture, and  called for ensuring the annual grain output to remain at or  above 450 billion kg and cotton, 4.85 billion kg. Farmers  incomes should increase at a rate of 5.8 percent annually, they  say.    To guarantee farm production, governments at different  levels  have adopted a package of policies.    The government of Fujian Province, in southeast China, has  encouraged industrial enterprises to support agriculture.    Tong Wanheng, deputy governor, said, "The wider we open to  the outside world, the more attention we should pay to grain  production."    To encourage farmers to grow more grain, the Zhejiang  Provincial Government has made it known to increase grain  purchase prices this year.    Central China's Henan Province plans to invest 1.28 billion  yuan in transforming low-yield farmland and building key  irrigation projects this year, an increase of 11 percent over  the previous year.    Southwest China's Sichuan Province has sent some 10,000  agro-technicians to 30 grain production bases to offer technical  consulting services and guide local farmers in scientific  farming.    "It is hard to image Sichuan, China's most populous  province,  lacking grain," Zhang Zhongwei, deputy governor of Sichuan in  charge of agriculture, said.    A survey shows that Chinese farmers so far have grown grain  in 109.3 million ha [hectares], basically fulfilling the annual  farming program.    The rise of state cotton purchase prices has stimulated  farmers' enthusiasm for cotton growing.    In addition, the 500 state-designated marketable grain  counties, 150 cotton-producing counties and a number of areas  piloting in quality and efficient agriculture already have taken  steps to promote scientific farming.</p>

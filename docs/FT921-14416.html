Ordinary shareholders will be entitled to apply for the new shares on a 1-for-2 basis. Preference shareholders will receive 0.3853967 new ordinary shares for each share held. The issue of the new shares at 39p each is dependent on shareholder approval. Dealings are expected to commence on February 10. Mr Stefan Simmonds, chairman, together with his family interests and Chargeurs Textiles, have irrevocably undertaken to take up their entitlements totalling 3.17m new shares (46.37 per cent). Over the past three years the group has invested more than Pounds 9.5m in new machinery and acquisitions, and further capital expenditure is planned. the proceeds of the rights issue will be used initially to reduce borrowings, which stood at about Pounds 5.9m on January 5 1992. The board forecasts that pre-tax profits for the year ending March 31 1992 will exceed Pounds 1.1m, while a final dividend of 0.75p, lifting the total from 1p to 1.5p, is also forecast.</p>

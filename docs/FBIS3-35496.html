			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has issued his  reaction to the incident in Hebron: A murder, an horrendous  crime was committed today at a site in Hebron holy to Jews and  Arabs. The prime minister and defense minister, the government  ministers, and the citizens of the State of Israel strongly  condemn the horrendous murder which struck innocent people and  led to the shedding of blood of blameless human beings who were  offering their prayers on the occasion of the Ramadan fast.    On my and the government's behalf, we express our sorrow and  send our sincere condolences to the families of the victims and  the Palestinian people, and we wish a speedy recovery to the  wounded. We call on everybody, both Arabs and Jews, to evince  restraint and not to get dragged into actions which might worsen  the situation.    The members of the political-security Inner Cabinet have  been  summoned to a meeting at noon today to discuss the situation in  the wake of this evil incident.    The prime minister goes on to say: This is a tough day for  peace-loving people, both Arabs and Jews, but the demented  actions of psychopaths will not prevent reconciliation and the  making of peace between the citizens of the State of Israel and  the Palestinian people. We will do everything necessary -- and  the deliberations on the making of peace may be accelerated --  to prevent misunderstandings, remove obstacles, and together  arrive at the day of peace, the day when extremists on both  sides will lose all hope of harming the peace process from which  we do not want to retreat.    In his statement, the prime minister makes clear that  instructions have been issued to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  and other security forces to do whatever is permitted and  possible within the framework of the law to uphold public order  and to prevent incidents and bloodshed.</p>

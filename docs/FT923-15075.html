			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major backs school inspection reforms MR JOHN MAJOR yester-day defended the government's reform of the schools inspection system, arguing that the use of lay people would be better for producing independent reports reflecting what parents wanted to know. Pressed by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, during prime minister's questions, Mr Major said the government believed independent inspection by 'people not related to the education profession' was 'a better way of ensuring we get reports that are fully independent.' Mr Kinnock, in one of his last appearances as opposition leader, asked whether Mr Major would be satisfied if his children's schools were to be inspected by 'anyone who had nothing more than a few days' training'. He asked when the prime minister would acknowledge that the 'privatisation' of the inspectorate had 'absolutely nothing to do' with solving deep-seated education problems. The two also clashed over class sizes, with Mr Major stating there had been a reduction, while Mr Kinnock claimed the number of primary schoolchildren in classes of more than 30 was more than 1m and rising.</p>

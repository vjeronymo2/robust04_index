			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW RALLIES, STALLS, RALLIES STALLS: GAINS 7.04 TO 2,702  </P> <P> The stock market closed higher today as investors remained focused on the  direction of the economy and interest rates.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.04 points to 2,702.01.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 9 to 7 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 818 issues up, 637 down and 531 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 153.77 million shares, up from 149.39 million in  Monday's session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index rose 0.20 to 191.33.  </P> <P> At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index advanced 1.06 to 375.10.  </P> <P> The market opened weak after Monday's rally, then stalled around midday after  the Dow pierced the psychological resistance level of 2,700.  </P> <P> The blue-chip indicator had not closed higher since the day before the Oct. 13  stock plunge, when it reached 2,759.84.  </P> <P> The market regained its footing in mid-afternoon behind a strengthening bond  market but wasn't able to sustain a strong rally as volume faded.  </P> <P> "It was a sleepy, slow day, not the kind of market that gives people  inspiration," said John Burnett, senior vice president at the investment firm  Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.  </P> <P> Analysts said recent actions by the Federal Reserve confused investors and sent  many scurrying to the sidelines to await fresh signals as to its intentions.  </P> <P> Despite the confusion, analysts said, investors remained generally optimistic  that interest rates are in an overall declining pattern.  </P> <P> "Over the next couple months the perception is that rates have to come down, so  there's no reason to get excited about short-term action by the Fed," said  Dennis Jarrett, technical analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Oil stocks led the blue-chips on the upside, and technology stocks remained  generally weak, equities traders said.  </P> <P> Bond prices were narrowly mixed in early trading today as activity slowed after  Federal Reserve moves Monday that indicated no relaxation in credit policy.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 1/32 point, or under $1 per  $1,000 face amount, around midday. Its yield held at 7.90%.  </P> <P> "Everybody's kind of licking their wounds," said Kathleen Camilli, a money  market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "The market got kind of  whipsawed in the last week."  </P> <P> The Fed drained money from the banking system Monday, driving the key federal  funds rate up to 8 1/2% by the end of the day from 8 1/4% late Friday.  </P> <P> The federal funds, the interest on overnight loans between banks, is a key  indicator of rate trends. Last week, many traders had believed that the Fed  signaled a lower target rate for federal funds by draining reserves, but that  belief was quashed Monday.  </P> <P> The rate was quoted at 8 5/8% by midday today, up from 8 1/2% late Monday.  </P> <P> Economists said the Fed added reserves to the banking system today because of  seasonal needs for more money, but the move was seen as necessary and not a  sign of a looser credit policy.  </P></p>

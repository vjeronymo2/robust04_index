			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1300 GMT on 12 April carries in its  regular 43-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in  the republic. Reception is poor.    The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st Corps Information Service  reports on the situation in Sarajevo that "since the morning the  chetniks have been firing with small arms at the defense lines  and the city itself. From the region of Perivoj they fired  cumulative [kumulativni] grenade launchers at Vis, Dobrinja was  under small arms fire all morning, while a sniper from Azici  wounded a member of our army. Grenade explosions could be heard  today near the FAMOS factory in Hrasnica, grenades that were  fired from the direction of Vojkovici. The same weapons were  used from the temporarily occupied territory of Grbavica and  another of our fighters was wounded on the defense line."    Hajrudin Sermic reports on the situation in Maglaj that "the  general alarm was sounded at about 1215 as the chetniks from the  direction of Teslic fired six 155-mm howitzer shells at the  town. The chetniks have over the last few days been  intensifying their artillery and small arms fire, particularly  at night, at the positions of the 201st Brigade. They have also  been firing antiaircraft machine guns and snipers at the  northern part of the town."    In his report from Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that  "Karadzic's terrorists have intensified their attacks on the  defense positions on the Buzim part of the front and Buzim  itself, including the surrounding villages of (Cava), (Mahmici),  (?Strabanda) and others. The artillery attacks are also  continuing on the free Bosanska Krupa territory. The outskirts  of Bihac have also been shelled, while the defense positions on  Grabez and the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau are under constant  artillery fire and fire from antiaircraft weapons." He says that  "on top of all this, the Kladusa rebel traitors have intensified  their attacks on the free Bihac territory. They have been  cooperating with Karadzic's fascists on the Buzim front, and  this morning launched several major infantry and artillery  attacks in the region of (Pecina) in the Cazin commune."    Reporting from Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that "the Serbian  aggressor is carrying out extensive preparations for the  continuation of the chetnik offensive launched two days ago.  The defense lines of the free Brcko territory are again being  targeted today by enemy artillery. In attacks on our positions  the aggressor is mostly using mortars and recoilless guns, while  heavy fire with antiaircraft guns and machine guns is being  directed at (Djukici) and (Kladje). On several occasions this  morning the aggressor fired a 155-mm howitzer at residential  areas inside the free territory." He says that "the enemy has  not completed the grouping of his forces. The aggressor has  brought in new artillery pieces along the front line."    Mahmet Bulic reports from Lukavac that "yesterday's shelling  of the defense lines seemed to have been only an introduction  for today's fierce aggressor's attacks. Since early morning the  Serbs have fired hundreds of mortar rounds and artillery and  howitzer shells at the area. Karadzic's followers have also  attempted several infantry breakthroughs but they have all  failed, and the enemy has suffered great losses in manpower.  And as always when the army of the so-called Srpska republic  are frustrated on the front, they have turned their artillery at  the civilian targets. Today they fired several howitzer shells  at the town itself."    The studio announcer says that "the general alarm has been  in  force in Travnik since midday as the chetniks from Mt. Vlasic  have been firing with howitzers." The correspondent from the  town, Ahmed Begicevic then reports that "at almost the same time  they started to shell the defense lines in Turbe. This small  town some six kilometers from Travnik is at the moment being  shelled with howitzers from (Komare) and Mt. Vlasic. At the  time of filing this report, and it is now just after 1300,  artillery shells are pounding Travnik and the citizens are being  warned to exercise maximum caution."</p>

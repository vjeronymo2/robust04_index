			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Hong Kong welcomes some political clout HONG KONG welcomed the announcement of the name of its new governor as evidence the colony is finally being raised in the hierarchy of British political affairs, because of Mr Chris Patten's close connections to the UK government leaders. Legislative councillors said the new governor would be in a position to achieve more than his predecessor, because as friend and senior colleague of the prime minister and foreign secretary of Britain, Mr Patten should carry much more political clout. There was concern at Mr Patten's lack of experience in Asia. But it was felt this might be balanced by the fact that his previous position in the government might encourage Beijing to treat him as a direct representative of the sovereign power, rather than just an agent. 'He is clearly someone who is held in high regard by the British government,' said Mr Nigel Rich, managing director of Jardine Matheson. Mr Rich argued that in the period of transition leading up to the hand-over to China in 1997, 'the skills of a politician will be very helpful'. Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, the party which attracted majority support in Hong Kong's first direct elections last year, said he was cautiously optimistic. He said he hoped a politician would be more receptive to the will of the people than a diplomat. Mr Lee has complained that under Lord Wilson, a 'group of yes men and women' was appointed 'to thwart all our attempts to change policies and better the conditions of our people'. He said: 'A politician may see the benefits of working with us, rather than against us. After all, who are the elected members?' Mr Lee was not concerned about Mr Patten's lack of knowledge of Asia. 'Sometimes you have a China expert and you find a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. If he is a good politician, I am sure he will pick things up very quickly,' he said. Mr Patten follows two Sinologists and diplomats to the post of governor, Lord Wilson and his predecessor Sir Edward Youde. There was a strong feeling in the business community that Hong Kong had stood low on the political agenda in Britain, and that the appointment of one of the prime minister's close confidants as governor indicated a change of strategy. Ms Rita Fan, a legislative councillor, argued 'I hope this will mean that Hong Kong will become more important on the political agenda,' while Baroness Dunn, a member of the Executive Council, said Mr Patten was 'highly respected for his political abilities. I am sure that his talents will be particularly useful to Hong Kong during these crucial years of political evolution.' But there will inevitably be voices of discontent. One pro-Beijing legislative councillor was concerned that Mr Patten might give special treatment to British business interests, arguing that the Conservative party has long had close contacts with the local British business community. This is a sensitive subject, following the award of most consultancy contracts for the new port and airport development scheme to local subsidiaries of UK companies, much to the ire of the local press. Some newspapers have mirrored British Labour party accusations that the governorship was being handed to Mr Patten as a consolation prize after he lost his seat in the election. But the news is likely to have no impact on the local stock market, which was more concerned about the outcome of the British election, given the pronounced Tory leanings of the local business community and its obvious desire for stability. 'Mr Patten will need a very good support team,' said Mr Barry Yates, research director of Asia Equity. 'He is coming out to a part of the world with which he is not familiar. And politics out here is very different.' But some hoped that Mr Patten's arrival with little knowledge of local affairs will at least leave him open to new ideas. 'We hope this is the beginning of a change in British policy towards China and Hongkong. So far this has been one of kow-towing to Beijing,' said Mr Lee.</p>

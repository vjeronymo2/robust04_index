			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON THE MIDDLE EAST;  </P> <P> A PALESTINIAN SEASON OF GLOOM;  </P> <P> COMING ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, THE U.S. DECISION TO DROP ITS DIALOGUE WITH  THE PLO JUST ADDS TO FRUSTRATION.  </P> <P> America's decision to suspend talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization  could not have come at a worse time for the Palestinians, particularly the more  than 1 million who have endured 20 years of Israeli occupation.  </P> <P> Their fears, inflamed by the massacre of seven Palestinian workers last month  in the Israeli village of Rishon le Zion, were deepened by the formation of the  most extremist government in Israel's 42-year history. (Indeed, the  announcement of Yitzhak Shamir's new government caused several Palestinian  leaders to cancel a hunger strike they had called to protest the massacre. "No  one was paying attention," they complained.)  </P> <P> The despair of those in the occupied territories is representative of the  general feeling of frustration among Palestinians everywhere. And at least  three sets of reasons have contributed to the accumulation of their fears:  </P> <P>  -- Before the massacre, Israeli-Palestinian relations already were hopelessly  deadlocked over the failure to get the peace process moving. The Bush  Administration was perceived by the Palestinians as having failed to convince  the Shamir government to adopt the American peace plan. While more than 50% of  the Israeli public was expressing approval for direct negotiation with the PLO,  no Israeli government emerged with the capability to translate that popular  will into reality. Israeli leaders were seen as playing for time. If they could  withstand American pressure for another year or so, the attention of the Bush  Administration would turn to the next presidential elections. Or, if enough  Soviet refugees could significantly change the demographic map of Israel, then  followers of Likud and similar political parties would have an added argument  for holding on to the occupied territories.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the intifada no longer stirs the Israeli conscience. The violent  repression of stone-throwing Palestinian youth is accepted as the cost of  living with the uprising.  </P> <P>  -- Palestinians, aware of the diminishing symbolic value of their stones and  occasional Molotov cocktails, looked to the PLO leadership outside the  territories and to the Arab world for a serious mobilization of human and  economic resources to help bring peace to their forsaken land. They found an  Arab world still submerged in factional conflicts. Promises for financial aid  remain largely unfulfilled. It is estimated that actual disbursements to  Palestinians under occupation amounted to less than 20% of the $300 million  annually pledged by Arab leaders at their 1988 Algiers summit, when they  declared their commitment to support the Palestinian uprising with "all  possible means." Last month's meeting of Arab leaders in Baghdad must have  brought further discouragement.  </P> <P>  -- As the Israeli novelist, Amos Oz, recently wrote in the Washington Post,  the twin monsters, fanaticism and indifference, still roam around Israeli  society. Many Palestinians feel that while Israeli leaders promptly condemned  the Rishon le Zion murders, Israelis were largely indifferent. Their suspicions  are confirmed by a report on the massacre published last month in the Israeli  daily Yedioth Abronoth in which Israeli journalist Yigal Sarneh wrote:  </P> <P> "I waited at the Rishon le Zion junction for two hours and did not see signs of  sorrow on the faces of passers-by. An Israeli car blew its horn joyfully, the  driver making a V-sign . . . .  </P> <P> "At 11 o'clock, a tractor belonging to the municipality of Rishon le Zion  arrived and with it an Arab young man carrying a broom. 'Where do I have to  clean?' the tractor driver inquired. His companion, an inhabitant of Gaza,  swept the blood away and bits of brain . . . at 11:15 a.m., an Israeli car, a  red Autobianci, stopped by the murder scene. A happy looking youth got down.  When he saw the blood patch on the red soil, he began to dance on it. 'Why only  seven?' he said, laughing, before going away."  </P> <P> So the Israeli-Palestinian situation is grim. Yet President Bush and Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev all but ignored this burning issue at their  latest summit. The two leaders seemed to leave the ground clear to extremists  of both sides, who must be having a field day.  </P> <P> How long will it be before fanatics succeed in dragging the region into an  all-out Arab-Israeli war? With the lethal and destructive weapons now  available, the outcome can only be catastrophic. Indeed, can even the newly  found and still fragile Soviet-American detente withstand a large-scale  flare-up in such a sensitive and crucially important part of the world?  </P> <P> America is uniquely qualified to contain this explosive situation. Enough  Palestinian, Arab and, I am sure, Israeli leaders believe that Washington is  sincerely searching for a peaceful settlement of this painful problem. But the  composition of the new Israeli cabinet must make the American task even more  difficult. Alas, the Bush Administration could not insist on the exclusion of  known extremists from the new Israeli government the way it asked Yasser Arafat  to dismiss an extremist from the PLO Executive Committee!  </P></p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Southern Water rises 4% SOUTHERN Water, provider of water and sewerage services to much of the English south coast, yesterday reported a slight rise in profits, mainly due to price increases. Pre-tax profits rose 4 per cent from a restated Pounds 115m to Pounds 119m in the year to March 31. At the interim stage, profits declined by Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 60m after the prior year figure was lifted by Pounds 6m upon reclassification of an exceptional profit. Turnover increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 319m (Pounds 291m). But control of operating costs led to a 13 per cent increase in trading profits to Pounds 119m. Mr Ray King, group finance director, said measured sales and trade effluent continued to fall because of recession, and showed 'no signs of an upturn.' Southern's appointed water and sewerage business increased trading profits by 12 per cent to Pounds 111m. Its unregulated arm, which includes waste management and engineering divisions, increased profits from Pounds 7m to Pounds 8.4m on turnover of Pounds 77.7m. However, only 26 per cent of unregulated sales were external to the group. The company produced no breakdown for extra-group profits. There were interest charges of Pounds 200,000 against interest income of Pounds 3m. This mainly reflected lower interest rates on deposits, as the year ended with net cash of Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 1.7m). The company disconnected 3,700 customers during the year, compared to 2,900. The bad debt provision rose Pounds 900,000 to Pounds 7m. Earnings increased by 3 per cent to 66.3p (64.2p) and excluding exceptionals 66.3p (60.5p). The final dividend of 14.2p makes a total of 21.3p (19.5p). The shares fell 4p to 505p. COMMENT By announcing results at the end of a draining water reporting season, on the same day as its more glamorous cousin Severn Trent, Southern did little to cast off its reputation as a rather dull, predictable company. Ahead of the industry's periodic review, when regulatory risk may not bring reward, Southern's image may be no bad thing. Nevertheless, yesterday's figures were slightly flattered by planning and capital spending hold-ups. It is still extremely difficult to see through Southern's non-regulated profits. And Ofwat, as well as the company's customers, will have taken note of the high disconnection levels. Full-year profit forecasts of Pounds 127m put the shares on 7 times, with a yield of 6. As with the rest of the sector, only the brave are buying now.</p>

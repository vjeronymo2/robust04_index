			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Merits of open-outcry challenged - Derivatives The debate over the merits of open-outcry versus screen-based derivatives trading has been revived by a study challenging the widely-held notion that electronic exchanges are inherently less liquid than open-outcry markets. Open-outcry involves dealers in trading pits competing to execute customers' buy and sell orders. They are joined by local traders, individuals who usually trade their own capital and supply liquidity by absorbing order flow imbalances. In an automated trading system, buyers and sellers feed quotes into a centralised computer system which automatically matches trades according to time and price priority rules. Open-outcry trading is practised on many exchanges, including the world's largest futures exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, and Europe's largest, the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe). However, more and more electronic exchanges have been set up in recent years, including Germany's DTB, Switzerland's Soffex and Spain's Meff. While electronic-trading enthusiasts predict that screen-based markets will eventually supplant pit trading, others counter that computer-based exchanges will never be able to replace open-outcry, largely because it offers unparalleled liquidity. This, many say, is largely provided by locals. 'Locals are an extremely important source of liquidity as they provide depth to the market, especially when it gets choppy,' says Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe's chief executive. However, a study for the Chicago-based Catalyst Institute by Mr Craig Pirrong, of the University of Michigan, casts doubt on this conventional wisdom. Based on a one-year examination (July 1992 to June 1993) of the German 10-year government bond futures contract traded on Liffe and DTB, the study rejects the widely-held view that Liffe's contract has greater depth and liquidity than DTB's and cites empirical evidence indicating that the opposite may be true. Moreover, it argues that locals are not necessary to provide liquidity in an automated futures market. As Mr Pirrong defines it, a market is liquid when traders can buy and sell without substantially moving the price against them, and deep if traders can buy and sell in large quantities without substantially moving the price against them. To evaluate the contract's liquidity, Mr Pirrong studied two factors on each exchange: the spread between bid and offer prices, which is widely believed to reflect liquidity (the tighter the spread, the more liquid the market); and the market depth. His analysis of bid-offer spreads concludes that 'for the period (studied), bid-ask spreads on the DTB were no higher, and were possibly lower, than the spreads on Liffe'. Moreover, 'the DTB market was deeper than Liffe; increases in volume on Liffe substantially increased price volatility during this period, whereas increases in volume on DTB had no such effect on volatility'. Further enhancing the DTB market's depth, the study argues, is the fact that the exchange's order book, showing the 10 best bid and offer prices in the market, provides traders with an insight into market depth which Liffe dealers lack. Moreover, it notes that in hectic trading conditions, high volume can lead to 'market fragmentation' in open-outcry pits, where different prices can be quoted at the same time. This is impossible on an electronic exchange. The study also argues that locals, who tend not to participate in computerised exchanges, are not needed to provide liquidity there. 'Virtually all liquidity on the DTB is provided by large institutional traders and market-making firms. These firms can bring substantial capital to the market and this facilitates the operation of a deep and liquid market,' the study says. Some observers complain that locals sometimes engage in practices which can distort market prices, such as stepping in ahead of large customer orders as they are being relayed to brokers in the pit. This often means that by the time the order hits the market, the price has already moved against it. Nevertheless, locals remain a crucial element of a liquid futures market, says a senior dealer. 'They do a very good job moving the market around and keeping things going,' he says. One point worth noting is that the DTB's bund future actually benefits from the liquidity provided by Liffe's locals. 'You can't look at the two contracts separately - they are very much linked by arbitrage trading,' says a dealer. He also points out that the bund future on DTB, which opens half an hour before Liffe, often does not show a clear trend until Liffe begins trading. 'The real price discovery occurs on Liffe,' he says. Liffe's Mr Hodson argues that measuring a market's depth by looking at an order book is not particularly useful. 'The capital on Liffe is there when you need it - you don't have to have a huge order book to demonstrate this,' he says. 'The reason people trade on Liffe is that they know they can get out a reasonable price if the water gets choppy, and the locals play a very important part' in this process, he adds. Besides, 'you only have to take a look at the volumes to see where the liquidity lies', he says, noting that 72 per cent of bund futures turnover is done on Liffe.</p>

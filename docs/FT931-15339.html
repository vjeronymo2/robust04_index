			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Italian economy figues show gross domestic product decline The depth of the slowdown in the Italian economy was underlined yesterday with figures showing that gross domestic product declined 0.6 per cent in the third quarter of 1992, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The quarterly figure means GDP was growing at an annual 0.8 per cent to the end of September. This is the lowest annual growth rate in a decade, although the economy has slowed each year since 1989. The government had projected zero growth in the third quarter and expected GDP to grow by more than 1 per cent over the year. The main cause for the sharper drop in growth was the slowdown in the industrial sector. The only positive note in the third-quarter figures was a 4 per cent increase in exports.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Suspended jail term for Manx bank chief MR ROBERT KILLIN, 61, man-aging director of the collapsed Isle of Man Savings and Investment Bank, received a 12-month suspended jail sentence yesterday for conspiracy to defraud. Judge Robert Hardy said his decision to suspend sentence in the case - which resulted from a Pounds 550,000 fraudulent land deal - was because of the length of the investigation and the trial at Manchester Crown Court. The bank collapsed 10 years ago with Pounds 42m of depositors funds after a series of risky, unsecured loans. Slack supervision by Manx authorities allowed it to trade for 18 months while insolvent. Investigations on the Isle of Man and in Britain took more than six years. Manx court cases against the bank's principals collapsed in 1990 because of delays in bringing charges. Mr Robert Cunningham, general manager of the bank, was given a 12-month suspended sentence last month. Sentencing of Mr Killin had been deferred. Both had denied conspiracy to defraud in a four-month trial. The fraud involved land at Baxenden, Lancashire, which was bought for Pounds 80,000 and sold the same day for Pounds 635,000 to Pennine Commercial Holdings. The bankers were given shares afterwards and Mr Killin sold his for more than Pounds 20,000. The land had an inflated value because of a false valuation by a surveyor. The Savings and Investment Bank provided the Pounds 80,000. Mr David Knott, Pennine's managing director, also benefited from the illicit profit of Pounds 550,000 on the Baxenden deal. He admitted conspiracy in August 1989 and was jailed for six months with the balance of a two-year term suspended.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Jas Fisher warns of downturn JAMES FISHER and Sons, the shipping and port operator, raised operating profits from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 2.26m for the first half of 1992, but warned that with a second half trading loss anticipated, the full year figure would be lower than before. With no sign of any improvement in trading conditions, the company said it was no longer appropriate for the dividend level to be geared to its medium and long term prospects and has cut its interim payment from 2p to 0.5p. Turnover rose to Pounds 17.53m (Pounds 14.89m). Shipping services contributed Pounds 1.92m (Pounds 1.28m) to profits, but the shipping finance side was lower at Pounds 443,210 (Pounds 670,318) and losses from port operations increased to Pounds 108,731 (Pounds 43,563). Earnings per share dropped from 6.4p to 4.95p.</p>

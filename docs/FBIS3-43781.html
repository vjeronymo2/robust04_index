			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Gnassingbe Eyadema in </F> Lome on 13 January -- live or recorded]    [Text] Dear countrymen, our capital has just fallen victim  once more to a terrorist attack masterminded from outside. This  aggression, which was designed to take my life and the lives of  the peace-loving citizenry and to seize power by force, failed  despite its violent and cruel nature. It came at a time when  our country had embarked on the second phase of putting our  democratic institutions in place and when preparations toward  the parliamentary elections are going ahead, involving all the  political forces, in collaboration with French and German  experts of the international monitoring committee and the  National Electoral Commission, as well as with the effective  commitment of our country.    This attempt to topple democracy cannot but arouse the  strongest disapproval and indignation of the Togolese people,  who have already suffered untold hardship and deprivation during  this transitional period. The failure of this aggression  demonstrates once more that no one can swim against the tide of  destiny.    In 1977, at a time when nothing could constitute a rebellion  against the Republic, mercenaries recruited from outside  attempted to overthrow the government with the complicity of a  handful of countrymen. This military coup failed because it was  not aimed at preserving the interests of the people. In 1985,  for the first time Lome was shaken by a series of explosions  which claimed innocent lives and caused considerable damage.  These criminal attacks were the early beginnings of a heavily  armed terrorist commando operation launched from outside on 23  September 1986 to invade our capital, invade the broadcasting  house, eliminate me, and seize power. This attack, which  unfortunately claimed more lives, failed once more with the help  of God, who cannot bless an undertaking inspired by personal  ambition, hatred, and vengeance.    Hardly 10 months ago, on 27 March 1993, with the complicity  of a few officers, some armed groups who also came from outside  managed to penetrate the Togolese Interarms Regiment camp and  shot rockets point blank at my residence, aiming particularly at  my sleeping quarters. They did not hit me, but they succeeded  in murdering in cold blood two of my closest companions in arms.    This new attack, contrary to the interests of the people,  has  failed once again. The painful events that we have just  witnessed on 5 to 6 January follow the same pattern. They did  not give those responsible the expected results, despite the  large deployment of men, arms, ammunition, and logistics.    Dear compatriots, the tragedy which has just befallen our  country should be an opportunity for all of us to reflect on the  destiny of our nation, which God has never wanted to abandon  into the hands of those who only seek its destruction. This  attack came just at the time when the Togolese people, who have  suffered from three years of stormy transition, begin to  entertain some hope again with the resumption of economic  activities and payment of salaries. The aim of the terrorist  action was to prevent free expression of the people at the  legislative elections. Those who launched the attack have  demonstrated, by so doing, their refusal to accept the  democratic principles that they claim to defend. Just as they  tried on the night preceding the presidential elections to  embark on a terrorist action to prevent the elections from  taking place, they are trying to disrupt the legislative  campaign with violent actions. Togo leaves the international  community to judge this behavior.    Our country is involved in an irreversible democratic  process. We are leaving no stone unturned for the legislative  elections to take place in total freedom and transparency.  Nothing will deviate our course from this objective.    Today we must thank God for having saved us from this new  trial and for having, once again, saved the Togolese people from  chaos.    I take this opportunity to warmly congratulate the security  forces and services for the courage, determination, sense of  duty, rapidity, and efficiency that they showed in returning the  fire that resulted in the routing of the attackers.    I would also like to thank the residents of Lome and its  vicinity for remaining cool, calm, and disciplined during this  severe ordeal in accordance with government's instructions  calling on them to stop and resume work for security reasons.    Furthermore, I especially want to commend and thank those  who, in various manners, contributed to restoring social peace,  which is indispensable for our development and welfare.    Finally, on your behalf, on that of the government, and in  my  own name, I would also like to present our most heartfelt  condolences to the innocent victims' families and wish a prompt  recovery to those who were wounded during this aggression.    Dear compatriots, a new year has begun. I hope that it will  be for each of you a year of peace, health, fraternity,  forgiveness, and love. May the democratic process continue to  its end in dialogue, consultation, tolerance, and acceptance of  each other. May our youth steer clear of those trying to divert  them from the right path and earnestly continue their studies  and professional training in order to give their best to our  country. May those possessed by hatred and craving for revenge  get rid of their resentment, abandon the path of violence, and  utilize their intelligence and as their know-how to build our  dear Togo a bit more each day instead of destroying it, as it  remains the only treasure that we will bequeath to future  generations. May this new year further bring us together each  day to serve our country.    Long live Togo! Long live the Republic! Long live democracy!</p>

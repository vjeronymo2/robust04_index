			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / New milk group under attack THE DAIRY industry yesterday accused Milk Marque, successor to the Milk Marketing Board compulsory purchasing scheme, of awarding itself an unfair advantage against competing buyers in the run-up to deregulation next April. Many dairy companies plan to buy their milk direct from producers once the Pounds 3.3bn milk market is liberalised. Mr Jim McMichael-Phillips, president of the Dairy Trade Federation, said the scheme would allow Milk Marque extensive access to confidential commercial information, previously held by the board, about individual farmers' milk production and quotas Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, said producers and purchasers should not feel pressured to sign contracts until they knew where they stood.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / BT holds profits steady at Pounds 3.07bn BRITISH Telecommunications yesterday argued that its prices should be less tightly regulated following the first drop in its profits since privatisation eight years ago. Pre-tax profits for the year to the end of March fell fractionally by Pounds 2m to Pounds 3.073bn, as recession, competition and regulation took their toll on revenues. The profits dip comes as BT is in the final stages of negotiating a new price cap regime with Oftel, its regulator. Mr Iain Vallance, chairman, argued that the lower profits would strengthen his hand in these negotiations. He said the fact that the company's return on capital - Oftel's main measure of profitability - had fallen to just under 18 per cent in the final quarter from 20.6 per cent in the previous year showed it was not making excess profits. But BT was immediately accused of making excess profits by consumer groups, the Labour Party and the unions. The National Consumer Council and Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's industry spokesman, demanded price cuts. Meanwhile, the Union of Communication Workers described the profits as 'callous' given that the company was cutting 24,000 jobs this year. In the City, the 8.3 per cent increase in the dividend to 14.4p, included in the results, was welcomed. More than 2m shareholders who paid 110p as a first instalment in the government's share sale last December saw the partly-paid share price rise 7.5p to 138.5p. The fully-paid price rose 8p to 360p. Mr Laurence Heyworth, an analyst at stockbrokers Robert Fleming Securities, said they were 'a sound set of results'. Mr Vallance revealed that his salary would increase 3.3 per cent to Pounds 465,000 in the year to the end of July and that his profits-related bonus had been cut from Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 90,000. Last year, a 43 per cent salary increase provoked a public outcry and Mr Vallance was forced to reveal that he had paid his bonus to charity - a practice he is continuing this year. Other executive directors' salaries have increased by about 3.5 per cent and their bonuses are lower than last year. Lex, Page 18, Details, Page 20, Technology, Page 14</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Saatchi set deadline on offer to stay as head of subsidiary Mr Maurice Saatchi has been given until January 3 to decide whether to stay at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group he founded 24 years ago. If he remains it will be in the largely honorific position of president of the holding company and chairman of the subsidiary, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide. After the boardroom coup, which on Friday night saw him ousted from the chairmanship of the company and removed from the board following a row over options, his friends said they were sure he would sever all connections with the group. Mr Saatchi was this weekend discussing with his brother Charles whether they should set up a new agency. The chances of the brothers starting again are remote, according to a close colleague, who said: 'After all the money they have made and at their age (on the cusp of 50), I don't think they really have the appetite for it.' Meanwhile, a senior Conservative party adviser suggested Mr Saatchi might be a candidate for the vacant post of head of the prime minister's Policy Unit. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi holds the Conservative party's advertising account and devised the 'Labour Isn't Working' campaign. Mr Charles Scott, Saatchi's chief executive, will this week start the process of finding a new name for the company, after the board's decision to drop 'Saatchi' from the holding company's identity. Mr Scott will also try to stop important clients deserting. The group is particularly worried about three accounts: Mars, the confectionery group, British Airways, and Mirror Group Newspapers, all of which were close to Mr Saatchi. Such is Mr Saatchi's closeness to the Mars brothers, John and Forrest, that on Friday evening, when the board told him he was being removed, he contacted them in a last-ditch attempt to put pressure on Saatchi directors. Mars, British Airways and Mirror Group Newspapers together contribute about 8 per cent of the company's Pounds 800m annual revenue. The company therefore regards their potential loss as serious but not devastating. Mirror Group is thought likely to keep its account with Saatchi unless it becomes unhappy with the agency's work. Mr David Montgomery, MGN chief executive, wrote to Saatchi's board last week to express his gratitude for Mr Saatchi's work. However, Mirror Group sources suggested Mr Saatchi's departure would have little impact on its day-to-day relationship with the agency. British Airways said yesterday it had made no decision on the future of its relationship with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. A senior advertising industry executive said he did not believe all three would desert. 'It is very difficult for them to leave, because it would require them to change their advertising campaigns, which they will be reluctant to do,' he said. Letter, Page 16 Lex, Page 18</p>

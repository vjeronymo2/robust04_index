			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister faces BR pensions row TRUSTEES OF British Rail's pension scheme are to meet Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, on Tuesday to protest about government plans to take over the scheme's assets. The trustees, with trade union representatives, will argue that a government guarantee to pay index-linked pensions in exchange for taking over the assets is of little value. BR pension fund sources cite a 1980 speech by Mr Kenneth Clarke, then a junior transport minister, during a Commons debate, which they say amounted to a government guarantee to fund the pension schemes indefinitely. The government has proposed, as part of its planned privatisation of BR, that the pension scheme be split into two parts, one for current workers and another for current and deferred pensioners. A portion of the scheme's Pounds 8.5bn assets would be turned over to the Treasury in exchange for a government guarantee to increase pensions annually in line with inflation. Union representatives are concerned that this would mean current pensioners receiving no further increase in benefits. Many pensioners are on very low incomes. Blue-collar workers were first allowed to join the scheme in 1967 and those retiring now will receive significantly less than a full pension. In 1991 BR's 150,000 pensioners received an average of Pounds 44 per week, while several thousand got Pounds 10 per week. In recent years the scheme's trustees have targeted benefit improvements at the oldest and least well-off pensioners, and they fear the government's plans will allow no further aid to this category of pensioner. The trustees are to meet Mr MacGregor's staff on Wednesday to explain why they believe the government's plans are unworkable. They have also been asked to give evidence to a wide-ranging pensions inquiry to be undertaken by the Commons social security committee. Mr Frank Field, the committee chairman, has called for evidence on the pension funds of London Regional Transport, British Rail, the Post Office, British Telecom, the Harland and Wolff and Swan Hunter shipyards, Belling, Lucas and Dormobile. The committee said it was interested in 'the consequences for pension funds of privatisation of companies, consultation with fund members about major changes in funds, the use of surpluses, and the level of pension benefits of the most senior officers of privatised companies'. In a speech to the National Association of Pension Funds conference yesterday, Mr Field said employers had played a 'confidence trick' on pension scheme members by encouraging them to think that a final salary pension scheme would enable them to retire on comfortable incomes. He predicted a rise in money purchase schemes, into which both employees and employers make fixed contributions, and urged the government to consider the generosity of company pension schemes when deciding whether companies should be eligible for government contracts. He also called for the repeal of the section of the 1986 Finance Act which taxes pension funds when their surpluses move above a certain level.</p>

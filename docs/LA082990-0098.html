			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIAT TO LAY OFF ALMOST A THIRD OF PLANT WORKERS;  </P> <P> AUTOMOBILES: THE ACTION REFLECTS THE START OF A LONG-EXPECTED WEAKENING IN WEST  EUROPEAN NEW CAR DEMAND AFTER YEARS OF RECORD SALES.  </P> <P> Fiat SPA, the Italian automotive and industrial group, is laying off close to a  third of its Italian car production work force for up to four weeks to cut  production and reduce bloated stocks in the face of falling domestic and  international sales.  </P> <P> The layoffs will affect about 35,000 of the 117,000-strong Fiat Auto work force  at five of the group's nine car assembly plants in Italy.  </P> <P> The move is intended to cut output by 75,000 units by year-end and reduce  excess stocks of more than 10,000 vehicles.  </P> <P> The layoffs are the most dramatic evidence to date of the start of the  long-expected weakening in Western European new car demand after five  consecutive years of record sales.  </P> <P> Fiat is being hardest hit among the big six car makers in Europe. Its share of  the domestic Italian market dropped to 54.4% in the first six months from 58.1%  a year ago.  </P> <P> Fiat, in second place in the European new car market behind the Volkswagen  group of West Germany, has suffered an estimated fall of about 4.2% in its  sales volume across Western Europe in the first seven months of the year,  compared to a decline of only about 0.3% in the overall market.  </P> <P> Fiat's trade unions reacted calmly to the planned layoffs, but called for more  details. Workers' representatives, however, called for urgent meetings of the  unions.  </P> <P> In the first quarter, Fiat said it thought this year's production would exceed  the 2.3 million vehicles manufactured in 1989, but forecasts have been revised  sharply downward after a steep fall in demand in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Sales of Fiat group cars, including Lancia, Alfa Romeo and Ferrari, in the  Italian market had been "well below expectations," said the company, with a  decline in the first six months of this year to 740,000 units from 776,000 in  the same period last year, despite a 1.8% rise in the overall market.  </P></p>

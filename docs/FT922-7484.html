			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / People: Revolutionary idea from Mars Jim O'Neill, head of global capital markets research at Swiss Bank Corporation, has lured S G Warburg's European economist David Mars to beef up the European equity research operation in London. O'Neill, who is less than complimentary about how research is organised at other houses, has had the 'quite revolutionary' idea of integrating bond and equity research in one group, thereby maximising cross-fertilisation of ideas and minimising in-house fights. Mars himself may know something about the latter, as his territory appeared to overlap considerably with Warburg's international economist George Magnus. SBC, while well-respected for its foreign exchange and bond, particularly Ecu, coverage, has some catching up to do on the equity side. But O'Neill at least had the satisfaction of generating surprise at the Warburgs stable with his latest appointment. Mars, 44, joins as a director and head of European equity research in London. Before his five-year stint at Warburgs, he spent some years with the Commission in Brussels, and earlier at the Treasury. ***** Stephen LeBeau, one of the rising stars of the British machine tool industry, has joined 600 Group as product strategy and marketing director for its recently formed lathe division. The appointment is important for 600 Group, which makes and imports machine tools and materials handling equipment. Earlier this year it closed its lathe factory at Colchester and concentrated production at its Harrison plant in West Yorkshire. The move has made it vital for the company to develop a detailed product strategy for the Colchester and Harrison lathes, which will continue to be sold separately. This will be LeBeau's task in a post tailor-made for him, one of the few men in the industry to hold a PhD in machine tool product strategy. Until the end of March, he was UK sales director at Yamazaki Machinery, but parted company from the Japanese group after only 15 months for reasons which were never made clear.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / People: Departures The BOOTS Company has announced that Terry Richardson, managing director of international and marketing of Boots Pharmaceuticals, is to take early retirement. Richardson, 57, was appointed a member of the group board in 1983; he is not being replaced. Boots Pharmaceuticals has been troubled by the withdrawal in July of Manoplax, its treatment for congestive heart failure; this led to a Pounds 35m charge and left a large hole in the division's drug portfolio. Sir James Blyth, chief executive, has said the group was conducting a fundamental reappraisal of its pharmaceuticals business and no options had been ruled out. The drugs division has been widely seen as too small to be viable. Boots Pharmaceuticals had a turnover last year of Pounds 762m and generated operating profits of Pounds 108m. Non-UK turnover was Pounds 425m, with operating profits of Pounds 85m.</p>

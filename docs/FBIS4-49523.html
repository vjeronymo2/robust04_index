			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, may 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that the problems  left over from the 1991 Gulf war should be peacefully solved on  the basis of the total implementation of the resolution of the  United Nations Security Council.    He told Riyadh Sami al-Qaysi, special envoy of the Iraqi  Government, during their meeting that China maintains that the  problems should be settled through dialogue and discussion by  the parties concerned in order to recover peace and stability in  the Middle East region.    Qian said that China was sympathetic to the difficult  situation of the Iraqi people, and advocated that the  international community should objectively comment on Iraq's  implementation of the U.N. resolution.    The sanctions against Iraq should be gradually reduced in  accordance with the changes in the situation, and out of  humanitarian considerations, to ease the sufferings of the Iraqi  people, Qian said.    He also expressed his hope that the Iraqi side would  continue  its co-operation and dialogue with the United Nations in an  effort to properly solve the differences between the two sides  in carrying out the U.N. Security Council resolution.    The Chinese vice-premier said that Iraq's clear recognition  of Kuwait's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity  is very important for resuming their bilateral good-neighborly  ties, and for ending the sanctions against Iraq at an early date.    During the meeting Riyadh, also Iraqi deputy foreign  minister, introduced Iraq's implementation of the U.N. Security  Council resolution, and its stand on issues such as the  long-term weapons supervisory plan and sanctions.</p>

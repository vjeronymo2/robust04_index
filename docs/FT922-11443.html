			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bargain-hunting lifts Nikkei above 17,500 Tokyo INSTITUTIONAL buying and bargain-hunting helped to lift the Nikkei average to its highest close this week, writes Our Markets Staff. The index rose 140.40 to 17,542.45, but lost 2.3 per cent on the week. It reached a day's high of 17,563.03 and a low of 17,120.63. Volume rose to 300m shares from 296m. The Topix index of all first section stocks was down 1.12 to 1,313.91 with advances leading declines by 574 to 426, with 139 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 3.55 to 1,070.03. Arbitrage-linked selling in the early afternoon led the market down but prices then recovered on late buying by pension funds and investment trusts. A rumour that the finance ministry had asked an industry association to subscribe to investment trust funds also contributed to the recovery, some traders noted. Several large investment trust funds are scheduled to be launched next Tuesday. However, many investors remained absent ahead of the public holidays next week and the publication next month of some companies' earnings for the year to end-March. Bank shares were mostly weaker after the finance ministry's announcement on Thursday that 21 large banks had bad loans. Mitsubishi Bank shed Y10 to Y1,840, Sumitomo Bank lost Y50 to Y1,390, and Industrial Bank of Japan dropped Y70 to Y1,810. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank lost Y40 to Y1,350. Canon was up Y20 to Y1,390 after a report that the company will seek a cross-licensing agreement with Honeywell of the US to settle a dispute over alleged infringements by Japanese makers of Honeywell's patents for auto-focus cameras. Elsewhere, Hitachi rose Y9 to Y845, Mitsubishi Electric gained Y6 to Y501 and Fujitsu was up Y5 to Y708. Car stocks were firmer with Toyota rising Y30 to Y1,460 and Nissan gaining Y9 to Y594.

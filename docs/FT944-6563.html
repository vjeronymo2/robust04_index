			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Observer: Plagued Already near the top of the list of those whom everyone loves to hate, Britain's fundholding family doctors and their managers can be forgiven for feeling even more unloved after their annual get-together at Stratford-upon-Avon last week. No politician would come near them. David Blunkett, who had originally been scheduled to deliver the keynote speech, was moved to education in October's shadow cabinet reshuffle, and Margaret Beckett, who took up the health baton, was otherwise engaged. No substitute could be found to detail the party's implacable opposition to the concept of fundholding. And what of the Conservatives? They too were unable to find a substitute for the originally advertised Clive Froggatt, a Cheltenham GP and early proponent of giving doctors their own budgets. He has other things on his mind nowadays, such as talking to the local constabulary about alleged drugs offences.</p>

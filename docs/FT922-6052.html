			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Scotland gains a voice of its own in Brussels SCOTLAND yesterday gained representation in Brussels when Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, launched a body designed to help Scottish organisations and businesses make the most of the European Community. Scotland Europa is a hybrid - neither the embassy of an independent Scotland nor the official representative office of a European region, but a subsidiary of Scottish Enterprise, the official development body. It is a joint venture between the public and private sectors and is expected to pay its way from fees and rent within three years. Although Scotland Europa houses representatives of Scottish Enterprise, the main job of its chief executive - Mr Grant Baird, a canny 49-year-old who was until recently chief economist of the Royal Bank of Scotland - is to act for the members he signs up. They include bodies such as Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, Edinburgh University and the Scottish Trade Union Congress, and companies, of which the first three to sign up are ScottishPower, Scottish Hydro-Electric and Glasgow-based BP Exploration. The organisation is the product of several years of argument about how Scotland should best be represented in the EC without infringing the prerogatives of the Foreign Office and arousing the anxieties of the Treasury about costly duplication of facilities. About 35 European regions already have offices in Brussels to keep abreast of developments in the EC and lobby for their interests. The most influential are said to be those of the German Lander, which report back to the Land governments and legislatures. The UK government decided that Scotland could not have a regional office because of its status as part of the UK, which is a unitary state. Germany, on the other hand, is a federation. The Scottish Office makes its representations in Brussels through the UK's permanent representative office in Brussels, UKREP, which is part of the Foreign Office. Even Mr Bruce Millan, the former Labour Scottish MP who is the EC regional development commissioner, said yesterday that this was the right way for Scotland to deal with the Commission. He admitted, though, that he would personally prefer Scotland to have its own devolved parliament and thus separate representation in Brussels. Some observers of regional activities in Brussels have warned that Scotland Europa, because it lacks the status of an official government body in Brussels, will lack influence when it tries to fulfil its aim of trying to increase the flow of EC funds to Scotland. Yet even before the setting up of Scotland Europa, whose creation follows hard on the heels of Brussels offices for Northern Ireland and Wales, Scots had been effective in obtaining EC funds. Strathclyde Regional Council, Scotland's largest local authority, has had an office in Brussels for several years and is at present coming towards the end of implementing a Pounds 300m programme of regional aid. The Highlands and Islands are dotted with European flags denoting EC-funded projects. The idea is that as Scotland Europa gains more members - it has about 20, with a further 10 being courted - it will become the centre of a network of intelligence on the likely effects for Scotland of what is going on in the Community. Members of Scotland Europa can purchase Mr Baird's time, depending on the level of their subscriptions, to investigate new Commission proposals and make representations about them. He admits that his agenda will largely be dictated by his clients rather than following a predetermined strategy. However, in one sense there is already a network of intelligence-gathering on Scottish interests in Brussels. Scotland Europa is handing out a booklet with the names, positions and telephone numbers of all Scots known to be working in the Commission and the Belgian capital. With cheerful allusions to the Mafia, it calls the network Scotia Nostra.</p>

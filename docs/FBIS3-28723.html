			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] PORT MORESBY, Feb 10 (AFP) -- A prominent Papua New  Guinea leader Thursday spoke out strongly here against any  Australian political involvement in the secession-torn province  of Bougainville. Bernard Narokobi, an influential opposition  MP, gave an emphatic "no" when responding to an agreement  between prime ministers Paias Wingti of PNG and Paul Keating of  Australia that an Australian parliamentary delegation could  visit Bougainville.    The island province has been riven by conflict since a  secessionist uprising there four years ago and each side has  accused the other of atrocities. A delegation would assess  security and investigate allegations of human rights abuses. The  timing and composition of the group is to be discussed between  the two governments.    Narokobi, a former attorney general, was one of two  government negotiators of two failed peace accords -- the  Endeavour Accord and the Honiara Declaration -- made with  Bougainville rebels. Narokobi accused Wingti, currently  visiting Australia, of admitting failure by agreeing to allow  outsiders to attend to PNG's domestic problems. He told  journalists that Australia would be meddling in PNG's internal  affairs if it sent the delegation.    "Australian parliamentarians have no right whatsoever to  walk  into Bougainville," he said.    Narokobi said he would personally refuse to co-operate with  them, and has called on security forces in Bougainville not to  allow the delegation on to the island. He said for any outsider  to come in would be the "highest form of insult."    "Australians would do well to attend to the plight of their  indigenous people," he said. And if an Australian parliamentary  delegation was allowed into PNG, then a similar PNG delegation  should be allowed to go to Australia to look into issues  affecting indigenous Australians, he added.</p>

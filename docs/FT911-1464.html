			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Lib Dem support surgesin first big test for Major MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday sought to shrug off a dismal Conservative performance in the local elections as the results appeared to leave wide open the outcome of the general election due by the middle of next year. In the first widespread test of public opinion since Mr Major became prime minister, a surge in Liberal Democrat support contributed to Tory net losses of more than 850 seats and losses of control in more than 40 councils. Labour demanded an instant general election, claiming that a similar performance would give it a narrow overall majority in the House of Commons. Some independent analyses pointed towards a hung parliament. Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, confirmed that there would be no June election, saying he had been 'pouring buckets of cold water on that particular idea for months now.' The final results saw Liberal Democrats jubilant at net gains of more than 500 seats, as they added 17 new councils to the three on which they kept control. They had particular successes in Tory-dominated areas in the south and south-west. For the first time since the early 1980s Labour made considerable inroads into Conservative strongholds in the south, where their gains included taking control of Plymouth, Luton and Kingswood. They also made gains in key areas of the midlands and the north-west. Ministers regard the autumn as the earliest election date and have not ruled out the long haul to next year. In a brief exchange with reporters Mr Major described the results as 'disappointing but bearable.' He said that Labour had not done enough to win an overall majority, adding: 'We are on an upswing and I think they have peaked.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrats' leader, called his party's results 'a stunning achievement'. The Liberal Democrats were the only party on an upward trend, he said. He, too, claimed that Labour could not win an overall majority, and confirmed that the price for his party's support in the event of a hung parliament would be a clear commitment to legislating for proportional representation within the lifetime of a parliament. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, said his party's advances in the 'battleground' seats showed it was 'the only party that can, and will, beat the Conservative government.' Labour's analysis of the local election results in 87 marginal constituencies indicated a narrow overall majority of five parliamentary seats. It showed Labour with a six-point lead over the Tories, on 43 per cent and 37 per cent respectively. The Liberal Democrats were put at 17 per cent. Tories took comfort from national opinion polls, showing them neck-and-neck with Labour. Their analysis of marginal seats showed them just ahead on 38 per cent to Labour's 37 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats on 20 per cent. Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, was almost alone in claiming a 'dramatic recovery' in Tory fortunes, but his comments also highlighted the line the party will emphasise over the summer. 'We all know inflation is about to come down and interest rates will follow it. If the Labour party have not made the breakthrough now, there isn't any chance of them making it when things get better.' Mr Patten plans to move on to the offensive after this month's Monmouth by-election, which Tories concede they might lose. With the May retail price index set to show a drop of two points in the inflation rate, the Tories believe that improving economic circumstances will allow them to re-gain the political initiative.  -----------------------------------------------------------             SEATS GAINED AND LOST  ----------------------------------------------------------- Party                        Gains    Losses     Net Conservative                   245     1,135    -890 Labour                         672       208    +490 Liberal Democrats              750       230    +520 Plaid Cymru                     36        14     +22 Green                            9         2      +7 Independent                    168       284    -116 Other                           59        92     -33  ----------------------------------------------------------- With all results declared by the 369 authorities Total seats contested: 12,255  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Drivers in capital face road pricing DRIVERS could be charged for driving in London on a pay-as-you-go basis by the end of the decade, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said yesterday. The aim would be to tackle congestion by making people think twice before taking cars on the roads at busy times. The most likely system would require drivers to fit in their cars, at their own expense, electronic meters which would clock up charges by communicating with roadside beacons. Drivers would pay by inserting rechargeable 'smart cards' into their meters at the start of each journey and the meters would deduct payments as journeys progressed. The controversial plans emerged as the Department of Transport published the results of a study of road pricing technology by the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Mr MacGregor said: 'We have to consider new ways of preventing road congestion in London from getting worse as car ownership grows. Charging drivers for using the capital's crowded roads is one possible solution.' No decisions would be taken until a three-year transport department investigation into the options for in London is concluded next year. The report says that although there is not yet a suitable road-pricing system, the technology is moving fast and the political obstacles are likely to prove greater than the technological ones. The Automobile Association said yesterday that motorists were already paying for roads through taxation, and additional charges could not be justified: 'The key to solving London's traffic problems is to invest in public transport.'</p>

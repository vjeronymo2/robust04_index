Pinochet has continued in a  position of influence, as chief of the Chilean army.  </P> <P> Throughout the week, as Bush has traveled from Washington to Brazil, Uruguay,  Argentina and over the Andes on Thursday to Chile, he has drawn attention to  the renewal of democracy throughout the hemisphere and, in particular, the move  toward less government control over debt-ridden economies.  </P> <P> The President, who winds up the tour with an overnight stop tonight in  Venezuela, told the legislators: "Every year under autocratic rule served only  to deepen your devotion to freedom and tolerance and respect for human rights,  to strengthen Chile's collective resolve to make this return to democracy  permanent and to make it irreversible."  </P> <P> On the other hand, he saluted the economic progress Chile has made over the  past five years, as a result of Pinochet's free-market policies and their  acceptance by Aylwin.  </P> <P> Those policies, along with the political stability that the repressive Pinochet  government imposed upon Chile by tightly controlling dissent, figured in the  creation of an economic climate that began attracting foreign investors back to  Chile. In the early 1970s, nationalization of key industries under the  government of Marxist President Salvador Allende resulted in economic and  political turmoil.  </P> <P> "Since 1985, about $2.5 billion in new investment has flowed into Chile," the  President said. "Capital flight, which has sapped the economic strength of so  many Latin nations, has now reversed itself, turned around with returning funds  spurring new investment here."  </P> <P> He spoke at the starkly modern legislative building, still under construction  in the seaside city of Valparaiso, which he reached by a 40-minute ride aboard  his Marine One helicopter.  </P> <P> At a state dinner Thursday night in Santiago, Bush told Chileans: "You deserve  your reputation as an economic model for other countries in the region and the  world. Your economic growth is the pride of Latin America."  </P> <P> The dinner was held at La Moneda, the presidential palace in downtown Santiago  where Allende took his life as tanks and aircraft attacked in the September,  1973, coup.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater described the reception Bush has  been given here and at the three previous stops on his journey as "a love fest"  compared with the unease with which South America has often regarded the United  States -- and with the rocky reception some U.S. politicians have received.  </P> <P> But the reception was not entirely friendly.  </P> <P> A decoy limousine driven just ahead of the President's armored car in a  motorcade was hit by an egg. And at least six bombs exploded in Santiago during  the night Wednesday, before Bush arrived midday Thursday. Police reported that  no one was injured.  </P> <P> Before the visit, the Bush Administration worked to ease some of the sore  points in U.S.-Chilean relations. Last Saturday, Bush lifted a ban on military  aid and sales to Chile that was imposed in 1976 after former Chilean Foreign  Minister Orlando Letelier, a prominent foe of Pinochet, and an American aide,  Ronni Moffit, were killed in a car bombing in Washington.  </P> <P> In another move also intended to patch up differences, in late November Chile  was allowed back into the Generalized System of Preferences, which grants  tariff concessions.  </P> <P> As a result, Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley has said, Chile will be able to  increase exports to the United States by approximately $100 million from the  present $1.45 billion a year. The Reagan Administration had excluded Chile from  the system in 1988 to protest Pinochet's repression of the Chilean labor  movement.  </P></p>

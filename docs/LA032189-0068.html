			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALMAN RUSHDIE CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Carl W. Ernst's placing of the Rushdie affair in a colonial context ("Beyond  Politics of Blasphemy, We Still Need to Understand Islamic World," March 2) is  the best analysis of the matter I have read so far. His comment that Rushdie's  writing is "testimony to the psychological disintegration caused by alienation  from one's culture" strikes me as being right on the mark. But there is  something else.  </P> <P> The "sarcastic and cynical devaluation" which Ernst refers to, and which seems  so offensive to the Muslim faith Rushdie was born to, according to published  reports, reflects the espousal of attitudes and a point of view considered as  superior, sophisticated, that is, modern, by the erstwhile colonial who has, or  believes he has acquired the sensibilities of a bona-fide member of Western  society.  </P> <P> The psychological consequences of the break-up of European colonialism will  continue to be felt by individuals and societies alike for a long time.  </P> <P> GARTH ST.

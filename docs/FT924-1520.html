			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report THE GOLD price moved up sharply in London yesterday, aided by a rise in New York that traders attributed to technical buying. The London bullion market price closed at Dollars 337.05 a troy ounce, up Dollars 2 on the day. 'A couple of people bought some gold and the market is so thin that it moved,' one dealer commented, adding that there was no fundamental news to stir up prices. At the London Metal Exchange attention was focussed on ALUMINIUM prices, which rose to the highest level since September. Traders said the rise, which left the three months delivery position Dollars 16 higher on the day at Dollars 1,240.50 a tonne, was instigated by an early burst of commission house buying, possibly against options. US buyers joined in after lunch they added. The ZINC market took heart from the firmer aluminium price and mixed buying and short covering lifted the three months price by Dollars 11.50 to Dollars 1,078 a tonne. Crude OIL prices moved higher after the president of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries said he thought the recent slide was bottoming out. Compiled from Reuters</p>

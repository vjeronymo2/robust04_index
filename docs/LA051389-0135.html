			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIFTS FOR COLLEGIANS ENTERING REAL LIFE  </P> <P> Looking for something for a college graduate who has just about everything  except money and domestic skills? Take some tips from Susan Kleinman, author of  "Real Life 101: (Almost) Surviving Your First Year Out of College."  </P> <P> For the multitudes who will live on pasta and Chinese takeout: "A dozen boxes  of assorted pasta, a large pot and a colander."  </P> <P> For those who want to create their own fast food: a microwave oven. "For fun,  throw in a few chocolate bars and wooden skewers for fondue."  </P> <P> For those who have more trouble cleaning than cooking: A housekeeper whose  cleaning frequency is limited only by your budget. It could be a one-shot deal  or into perpetuity.  </P> <P> For graduates moving to a new city: Tuition for a continuing-education course  where he or she could meet people with common interests. Membership to a gym or  health club for social as well as physical well-being.  </P> <P> For the culture maven: A museum membership or subscription to a local ballet.  </P> <P> For those entering the business world where campus clothes don't fit: Scarves,  belts and costume jewelry for women; suspenders, belts, ties for men.  Accessories help prevent them from looking like corporate clones.  </P> <P> For the apartment: A gift certificate to a framing store for a favorite poster.  A telephone-answering machine. Many of the graduates interviewed for "Real Life  101" (April, MasterMedia Ltd., $9.95), said an answering machine was the one  thing they couldn't live without, Kleinman said.  </P></p>

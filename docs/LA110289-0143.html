			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MARIN COUNTY  </P> <P> Park rangers are using radar guns, roofing nails have been spread across  roadways and horses startled by speeding bicyclists have bucked their riders.  All are signs of the increasing tensions and interactions between hikers,  bicyclists and equestrians trying to share countryside trails in the Golden  Gate Recreation Area in Marin County. "As far as I'm concerned, it's Russian  roulette out there," said Linda Rubio, an equestrian who rides the trails. "My  only hope is that something is done before someone really gets hurt." Rubio  said she has had several run-ins with bikers, including an incident two years  ago in which she was bucked and knocked unconscious after a mountain biker  spooked her horse.  </P></p>

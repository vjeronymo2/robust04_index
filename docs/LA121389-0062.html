			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: CROSS-COUNTRY SHUFFLE CONSIDERED  </P> <P> A plan that would expand the number of divisions and group the state's high  schools equally among four categories at the state cross-country championships  will be considered at the California Interscholastic Federation's Federated  Council meeting Feb. 2 in Sacramento.  </P> <P> If approved, the new plan would divide the state's high schools into four  divisions of equal size based on enrollment numbers. The realignment would take  effect in the 1990 season.  </P> <P> Under the present format, the state is divided into three divisions (I, II and  III) for cross-country based on school enrollment with an unbalanced number of  eligible schools in each division.  </P> <P> For this year's state championships, Division I, in which there are 352  schools, included schools with a student body of 1,600 or more students.  Division II (700-1,599) had 315 schools and Division III (1-699) had 129.  </P> <P> Under the new alignment, Division 1 (2,021 plus students) and Division 2  (1,519-2,020) will each have 199 schools. Division 3 (939-1,518) and Division 4  (0-938) would include 196 and 203 schools, respectively.  </P> <P> The current setup grants 63 schools (21 in each division) from 10 CIF sections  a berth in the state championships. The four-division plan would allow 64  schools participation in the state meet with 17 qualifying teams in Divisions 1  and 2 and 15 teams in Divisions 3 and 4.  </P> <P> Former Valley College Coach Dave Snow, now at Cal State Long Beach, leads a  group of Southern California baseball coaches who are scheduled to appear at a  coaching clinic Dec. 16-17 at Loyola Marymount.  </P> <P> The clinic is open to all baseball coaches.  </P> <P> Scheduled speakers include former College of the Canyons Coach Mike Gillespie,  now of USC, Chris Smith and Bill Gevitt of Loyola Marymount and Al Ferrer of UC  Santa Barbara. Information: 213-642-3328.  </P> <P> The Junior Elite Training Center gymnastics club of Canoga Park placed two  teams in the California State Team Championship last weekend in San Diego. The  JETC Level 7 junior (ages 12-14) squad placed first in the all-around  competition with a team score of 107.40, and Emily Moyer, 15, of Chatsworth  recorded the highest all-around score of 36.00. Heather Mitchell, 14, of  Northridge placed second with a 35.65.  </P> <P> The JETC Level 6 children (ages 9-11) all-around team finished third with a  173.65, and fourth in the Level 7 senior (ages 15-18) division.  </P> <P> Two weekends ago, JETC had three all-around champions at the California State  Individual Meet at Eagle Rock High.  </P> <P> Kristina Kasper, 10, of Hidden Hills won the Level 6 children all around with a  score of 35.95. Mitchell, 14, scored a 35.60 to win the Level 7 junior  all-around, and Krissy Zgrabik, 16, of Van Nuys won the Level 7 senior (ages  15-18) all-around with a 35.10.  </P></p>

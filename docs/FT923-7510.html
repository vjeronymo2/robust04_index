			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Death toll in Georgia rises to 40: Defence minister vows to crush rebellion THE death toll in the disputed Abkhazia region of west Georgia rose yesterday to at least 40, with Georgian leaders vowing they would crush the rebellion in renewed military action today. Mr Tengiz Kitovani, Georgia's defence minister, yesterday demanded the immediate resignation of Abkhazia's parliamentary leader, Mr Vladislav Ardzinba. 'If he declines, we shall move forces into Sukhumi and disband his illegal parliament,' he told Reuters at the former dacha of Josef Stalin on the Black Sea coast. The Abkhazian leadership said they would not back down and appealed to the leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the United Nations to persuade Georgia to withdraw its forces. Fierce fighting erupted in Sukhumi, Abkhazia's capital, last week as Georgian forces reacted to the kidnapping of several senior officials, including the interior minister. Although the officials were subsequently released, Georgia continued to press for the re-integration of the breakaway Abkhazian region, which declared its independence last month. The centre of Sukhumi has been ravaged by gun battles as Georgian troops have fought Abkhazian irregulars. Looting broke out on Sunday night after the two sides began to disengage in line with a fragile ceasefire. Georgia has put the death toll from the recent fighting at 40. But the independent Interfax newsagency quoted Abkhazian health ministry sources saying that at least 50 people had been killed with more than 200 wounded. Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, is determined to preserve the integrity of the Georgian state both from the rebel region of Abkhazia and the still active forces of Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's ex-president, who was deposed after a violent revolt in January. Mr Shevardnadze told a radio interviewer yesterday: 'I will do all I can to secure the unity of Georgia. I will be first in the ranks of fighters for every handful of Georgian soil.'</p>

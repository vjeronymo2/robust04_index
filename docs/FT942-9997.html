			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities fall in wake of weak bonds Wall Street US stocks fell across the board yesterday in the wake of another big decline in government bond prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 27.37 at 3,629.04. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 retreated 4.52 to 441.49, while the American Stock Exchange composite ended 2.02 off at 433.17 and the Nasdaq composite 8.00 lower at 717.00. Trading volume on the New York SE was 277.4m shares and declines outnumbered rises by 1,535 to 658. After Tuesday's solid gains, the stock market failed to maintain its upward momentum, primarily because the bond market - the main driving force behind share prices this year - suffered early losses. The selling of bonds was mostly due to nervousness ahead of the afternoon auction of Dollars 12bn in 10-year notes. The nerves proved well justified, because the auction subsequently passed off disappointingly, having attracted little demand from retail investors. The poor auction hit bond prices hard, and by late afternoon the 30-year bond was down more than a point, and the yield above 7.6 per cent once more. That rise in long-term interest rates unsettled equity investors, and shares dropped sharply after 1.30pm. Prices also fell because Tuesday's advance was judged to have been little more than a technical rally following earlier weakness. Analysts noted that sentiment in the stock market remained subdued, with most investors bracing themselves for another interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve. Not every Dow stock took a tumble. Caterpillar bucked the trend, rising Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 107 1/8 after the brokerage house Merrill Lynch raised its intermediate-term rating on the stock from 'above average' to 'buy'. Another stock aided by a Merrill buy recommendation was Tenneco, which firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars 47. Two sectors which led the market higher on Tuesday, computer and car shares, ran into concerted selling. Conner Peripherals fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 12 1/4 in volume of almost 3m shares on news that Iomega Corp had filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the company, challenging its new back-up tape drive. Iomega, quoted on the Nasdaq market, eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 2 1/4 . Also on the Nasdaq, Micro Focus soared Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 16 1/2 on reporting improved first-quarter net income and forecasting continued growth in earnings. Canada The Toronto market declined in relatively light trading as North American bond markets turned down in the afternoon. The TSE 300 composite index finished 21.7 off at 4,168.2 and falls outscored advances by 402 to 308 after turnover of 72.7m shares. Today's volume was inflated by three large block trades of PWA Corp 'A' totalling more than 19.7m shares. Mexico Mexican shares closed sharply lower, pressured by falling American Depositary Receipts of Mexican stocks on Wall Street and fears of further increases in US interest rates. The 37-share IPC index fell 33.52 points, or 1.51 per cent, to 2,179.57. This followed an initial improvement as investors were encouraged by a cut in interest rates - the 28-day Cetes, or treasury bill, being trimmed by 47 basis points to 16.02 per cent. Traders said many foreign investors took profits ahead of today's televised debate among candidates for the presidential election, which takes place later this year.</p>

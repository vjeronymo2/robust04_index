			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: EUROPEAN ECONOMIES HAVE SEVERED TIES TO AMERICA'S  </P> <P> I am spending this academic year in Europe and shall be devoting my next  several columns to reports and impressions of economic developments among  European countries.  </P> <P> My initial and most striking impression, after only a month here, is that  European economies are rapidly losing interest in economic developments in the  United States. It used to be that when America sneezed, Europe felt itself  catching pneumonia. Now, with the U.S. economy suffering from bronchitis or  something even worse, Europe seems to be telling us to take two aspirin and  drink plenty of liquids.  </P> <P> These impressions have been sharpened for me by the stark difference between  two conferences, four years apart, I've attended about the European economy.  </P> <P> The first took place in Bonn in the spring of 1986. At that time, many  Europeans spoke admiringly of the U.S. "jobs miracle" -- a sentiment richly  represented at the Bonn conference. High unemployment rates were plaguing many  key European economies while employment had been growing with what seemed like  stunning success in the United States. Many at that conference were wondering  whether the U.S. model, variously described by such terms as "Reaganomics" or  "flexible labor markets," could be usefully applied to help overcome what they  often called "Euro-sclerosis."  </P> <P> The second conference took place in Venice early last month. Its theme was "The  Economics of a New Europe." Participants focused on problems and prospects in  both Western and Eastern Europe (including the Soviet Union). Italian Foreign  Minister Gianni de Michelis closed the discussion with an interesting review of  the challenges facing the European political economy in transition.  </P> <P> At this conference, in sharp contrast with 1986, virtually no one made even  passing reference to the United States.  </P> <P> It is true many assumed that some kind of "free market model" would be pursued,  in various unpredictable ways, in many of the Eastern European economies over  the next decade and that U.S. economists and financial consultants were playing  an important role in helping shape that jolting institutional transformation.  </P> <P> At the same time, however, no one seemed to be impressed with either the  prospects for or the actual institutional examples represented by the U.S.  economy. Europe represented an increasingly potent economic force in its own  right. Many seemed to feel European economies would and could forge their own  distinctive ways of adjusting to and maneuvering within an increasingly  integrated European Common Market, with complete integration anticipated in  1992.  </P> <P> How would the U.S. economy fare during the 1990s? It seemed as if the  conference participants couldn't care less.  </P> <P> To what should we attribute what appears to be a dramatic inversion of European  perspective on the U.S. economy within such a short space of time?  </P> <P> There are two sides to the Atlantic and therefore, at least superficially, two  sides to a provisional answer to that question.  </P> <P> On the American continent, U.S. economic achievements in late fall, 1990,  obviously look much less impressive than they did in spring, 1986. Not only has  the U.S. economy stumbled into a recession of unknown proportions, but it has  become increasingly clear to many here that economic growth during the long  U.S. expansion from 1983 to 1990 was purchased at huge costs to future  generations.  </P> <P> U.S. corporations and consumers have run up massive amounts of debt that will  weigh heavily on their prospects during the 1990s and beyond. And the United  States has become the largest debtor country in the world -- hanging  desperately, against all odds, on the willingness of the Japanese and Europeans  to continue providing prodigious infusions of capital.  </P> <P> The U.S. economy is no longer either a hegemony or a bellwether.  </P> <P> On the European side of the Atlantic, by contrast, three developments strike me  at first blush as most important to helping explain the Europeans' turning  their shoulder on the U.S. economy.  </P> <P> First, many Europeans are surprised and, ultimately, delighted at the rather  sudden acceleration of movement toward European economic integration over the  past four years. Their recent success at steering through the treacherous  straits of economic nationalism seems to have produced a feeling both of  continental pride and of lustful anticipation of the challenging economic  opportunities that lie ahead. (At the same time, however, they do not  unrealistically ignore the immense problems of fitting their national economies  comfortably and effectively into a more integrated European framework.)  </P> <P> Second, the stunning developments in Eastern Europe have obviously turned heads  in that direction. Europeans seem to feel a deep commitment to helping Central  and Eastern European countries through their current and impending problems.  They also drool at the possibility of vast new economic opportunities in those  economies during and after the transition.  </P> <P> They also recognize that Eastern Europe (including what is now the eastern part  of a unified Germany) will require huge capital investments -- which will  (hardly incidentally) place rival claims on much of the money that has been  recently feeding capital accounts in the United States. Inevitably, as well,  the apparent end of the Cold War dramatically reduces Europeans' feeling of  political and military dependence on the United States.  </P> <P> The third provides perhaps the most important piece of the explanation. I get  the impression that the combination of the first two developments has convinced  many in Europe that they can and must build on their own institutional history  and institutional imagination to chart their future economic course. Many no  longer seem to feel the need to emulate models from outside Europe. They feel  that they have their economic future in their own hands. And they seem to feel  confident of their own capacity to take advantage of future economic  opportunities without outside interference or help.  </P> <P> In this regard, I was struck by a comment that Spanish President Felipe  Gonzalez made in a recent interview in the prestigious French newspaper Le  Monde. He was speaking of both the promise provided by an increasingly united  Europe and of the likelihood that European countries could and would fashion an  institutional design based on their own history and ingenuity.  </P> <P> "Among existing institutions," he noted, "it's the European Economic Community  that has achieved the greatest progress. It has been able to refine itself, to  consolidate its unity even while enlarging itself. It exercises a powerful  attraction to all of its neighbors."  </P> <P> "When one speaks of the new European architecture," he continued, "I think of  all these old (European) palaces from the 15th, 16th or 17th centuries. They  have been enlarged and restored several times, often substantially.  Nonetheless, the harmony of the whole has been preserved. And they remain  habitable. Europe is likely to resemble them."  </P></p>

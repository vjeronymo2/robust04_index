			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: News Corp softens preference position Pressure from the International Securities Market Association (Isma), the Eurobond market's trade association, appears to have forced News Corporation to soften its stance in a complicated dispute with holders of its preference shares. Isma said in a statement that 'we understand from Messrs Allen &amp; Overy, London, that anybody who has suffered loss by reason of the notices inserted in the financial press in December 1993 relative to the dividend declared by Pearson of shares in Royal Doulton should write to Allen &amp; Overy, 9 Cheapside, London EC2V 6AD (for the attention of J. Horsfall Turner) specifying the nature of the loss sustained and the basis of the claim, at which point it will be possible for News Corporation to consider the claim in detail'. The statement added that 'News Corporation . . . takes the matter seriously and responsibly and that any claims made will be given full consideration by News Corporation Limited'. News Corp declined to comment. The notices published by News Corp in December said holders of its preference shares, exchangeable for shares which News Corp held in Pearson, would also get Royal Doulton shares when exercising their exchange right. However, News Corp, the media, film and publishing group, issued another notice in February which said they were not entitled to around Pounds 15m (Dollars 21.9m) worth of shares in Royal Doulton, the fine china manufacturer demerged last year from Pearson. News Corp's about-turn prompted Isma to state publicly at the end of February that it was investigating the matter.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAJOR ICE RINK URGED; SOME COOL TO PLAN  </P> <P> A former city official has proposed a plan to build a center for competitive  ice skating on undeveloped city land near the Glendale Freeway, drawing the ire  of some residents who live near the site.  </P> <P> The facility, which would occupy up to five acres in one of the city's four  "freeway parks" in the San Rafael Hills off Fern Lane, was proposed to the  city's Parks, Recreation and Community Services Commission last week by  Marilyne Wiechmann, a former parking commissioner.  </P> <P> Wiechmann, an amateur competitive skater, told commissioners that the proposed  center would include a stadium with as many as 5,000 seats, a child-care center  and a cafeteria.  </P> <P> The commission's recommendation ordinarily is sought, but not required, before  such a proposal goes before the City Council. Commissioners are expected to  consider Wiechmann's idea in January, said Nello Iacono, director of the city  Parks, Recreation and Community Services Department.  </P> <P> Under Wiechmann's plan, the city would lease the undeveloped land for free to a  nonprofit group that would oversee operations at the rink.  </P> <P> Representatives of several regional skating and hockey groups interested in  developing the facility and experienced in organizing competitive events  attended last week's meeting to support Wiechmann's proposal.  </P> <P> The groups, including the California Amateur Hockey Assn. and the Los Angeles  Figure-Skating Club, have not formally organized into a nonprofit organization  that would run the center. But they have consulted with a New York-based  company that builds and designs rinks, Wiechmann said.  </P> <P> Organizers said they hoped that the city would then obtain a low-interest loan  to develop the facility and allow the group to repay it with revenues and  private donations.  </P> <P> Construction could cost between $2 million for a single rink and $15 million  for two rinks and a multiuse stadium, Wiechmann said. She and other organizers  said they believe the facility eventually would be self-sufficient and that its  revenues would exceed its costs.  </P> <P> Wiechmann said the center could host international skating competitions,  provide recreation for children whose Glendale schools begin year-round classes  in 1991 and help curtail the rapid depletion of local ice skating rinks. Of the  dozen rinks in Southern California, only three are large enough for competitive  or team skating, she said.  </P> <P> "If it means just a simple ice rink with one sheet of ice, we're willing to do  that," Wiechmann said. "The city, I think, could greatly benefit."  </P> <P> About 10 residents of Fern Lane, the only street leading in or out of the  proposed site, urged the commission to reject Wiechmann's idea, saying they  feared traffic and noise in their neighborhood would increase substantially.  They also said they doubted that the center would be successful.  </P> <P> Commissioners did not discuss the proposal, but Iacono said he is skeptical  about Wiechmann's financing plan. If the city allowed free, long-term use of  its land, he said, it should not also assume a multimillion-dollar loan debt to  help organizers.  </P> <P> The city already has plans to build two parks, three soccer and two baseball  fields, and picnic and barbecue facilities at its "freeway parks" sites, which  consist of 77 acres of 392 acquired by the city from Caltrans after the freeway  was completed in the late 1970s.  </P> <P> The commission can make recommendations to the City Council on whether a  recreational facility such as Wiechmann's should be built on the parkland. But  final approval rests with the council.  </P></p>

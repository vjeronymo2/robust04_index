The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants' Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Sentry is a stock life insurance company that was organized under the laws of the State of Wisconsin in 1958. SILIC is a stock life insurance company that was originally organized in 1966 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as Patriot General Life Insurance Company. SILIC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sentry. SESI is registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer, is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and serves as the principal underwriter for variable annuity contracts issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the Sentry Account and the SILIC Account (the ``Sentry Contracts'' and the ``SILIC Contracts,'' respectively, and, together, the ``Contracts''). Sentry, SILIC , and SESI are direct or indirect subsidiaries of Sentry Insurance a Mutual Company, a Wisconsin mutual insurer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Sentry established the Sentry Account in 1983 pursuant to the laws of the State of Wisconsin. The Sentry Account is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust, and the Sentry Contracts are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (``1993 Act''). SILIC established the SILIC Account in 1983 to the laws of the Commonwealth of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Massachusetts. The SILIC Account is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust, and the SILIC Contracts are registered under the 1933 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Each Account consists of four subaccounts: a Liquid Asset Subaccount; a Growth Subaccount; a Limited Maturity Bond Subaccount; and a Balanced Subaccount. Each of the subaccounts invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the Neuberger &amp; Berman Advisers Management Trust (``Fund''). The Fund is registered under the 1940 Act as a diversified open-end management investment company, and the shares issued by the Fund are registered under the 1933 Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Sentry Contracts and the SILIC Contracts are identical in all material respects, except for the identity and depositor of the separate account issuing the respective Contract. The Contracts provide for the accumulation of contract values and payment of monthly annuity payments on a variable basis. The Contracts are designed for use by individuals in retirement plans on a qualified or non-qualified basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Sentry has or will shortly enter into an agreement providing for the sale of all outstanding stock of SILIC to an unrelated third party. One of the conditions of the sale will be that Sentry and SILIC enter into an assumption reinsurance arrangement providing for the transfer to Sentry of all assets and liabilities of SILIC, other than the minimum amount of capital necessary to support SILIC's licenses. Sentry will, pursuant to the assumption reinsurance agreement, assume legal ownership of the SILIC Account assets and become responsible for satisfaction of all liabilities and obligations arising under the SILIC Contracts and outstanding at the time of the transaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. In order to avoid the administrative duplication that would result from maintaining two identical unit investment trusts, Sentry has decided to effectively merge the Accounts by transferring the assets of the SILIC Account (consisting of shares of the Fund) to the Sentry Account (the ``Proposed Transaction''). The Sentry Account will continue to exist, and the SILIC Separate Account thereafter will be deregistered as an investment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  company. The effect of the Proposed Transaction will be that, as of its effective date, the Sentry Account will support the Sentry Contracts, the SILIC Contracts ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  those originally issued by the SILIC Account), and any Contracts issued subsequent to the effective date of the Proposed Transaction. The assets supporting the former SILIC Contracts will continue to be invested exclusively in shares of the Fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Proposed Transaction will be effected at the net asset values of the subaccounts involved, and no charges will be imposed or other deductions made in connection therewith. The Proposed Transaction also will not affect the net asset value of any subaccount: the net asset values for the four subaccounts of the Sentry Account in effect immediately after the transaction will be identical to the net asset values for the subaccounts of the SILIC Account in effect immediately prior to the transaction. All costs of the transaction will be borne by Sentry and not by Contractowners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The succession of Sentry to SILIC as the insurance company issuing the Contracts will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the Contractowners. The only change discernible to a Contractowner as a result of the Proposed Transaction will be the identity and depositor of the separate account in which his or her cash value is invested. The fees deducted from assets supporting the former SILIC Contracts after the Proposed Transaction will not differ in amount or type from those currently being deducted from the Sentry Account. After the Proposed Transaction, the guarantees that are not allocated to the Sentry Account ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the minimum death benefit) will be backed by Sentry's pool of assets, which, based on financial information as of December 31, 1993, is more than sixty times larger than SILIC's. Moreover, as of the date hereof, Sentry is rated ``A+'' by A.M. Best, while SILIC is rated ``NA4'' (rating procedure inapplicable).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The Proposed Transaction and the other transactions related to the sale of SILIC will be approved in advance by the respective Boards of Directors of Sentry and SILIC. Prior approval of the transaction will be obtained from the Massachusetts Insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Department and any other applicable regulatory authority. To the extent notification to Contractowners is required pursuant to generally applicable state insurance laws relating to assumption reinsurance, it will be provided. Applicable state insurance law does not require that Contractowners vote on the transaction or be granted any ``opt-out'' rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. In offer to reflect the transfer of assets supporting the SILIC Contracts to the Sentry Account, Sentry will file a new 1933 Act registration statement for the Contracts and will amend the 1940 Act registration statement for the Sentry Account. Once the new 1933 Act registration statement becomes effective, Sentry will distribute copies of the prospectus contained therein to owners of outstanding Contracts. Once the Proposed Transaction is effected, application will be made to the Commission pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Act and Rule 8f&hyph;1 thereunder for an order declaring that the SILIC Account has ceased to be an investment company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

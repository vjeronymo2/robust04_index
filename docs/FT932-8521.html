			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Key dates leading to Steinkuhler's share windfall CHRONOLOGY of Mr Franz Steinkuhler's share purchases. December 1975. Mercedes Holding (MAH) is founded to prevent the Flick family selling the bulk of its 39 per cent shareholding in Daimler-Benz to the Shah of Iran. The holding company acquires just over 25 per cent of Daimler shares. Shares in MAH are quoted but half are owned by companies and financial institutions loyal to Daimler management. Between 1975 and 1992 MAH has no function but to own shares in Daimler, and shareholders receive the same dividend as Daimler shareholders. But Mercedes shares stand at a discount of 20-30 per cent to Daimler. December 18, 1992. MAH annual meeting in Frankfurt. Prof Ekkehard Wenger, the maverick professor of business studies at Wurzburg University and one of Germany's leading shareholder activists, forces shareholders to vote on a motion calling for abolition of MAH. Shareholders vote 99.9 per cent in favour of preserving the status quo. December 22, 1992. A leading article in the Borsenzeitung, Germany's most authoritative financial newspaper, says MAH is no longer justified. But in the absence of concrete plans to get rid of the structure, the huge discount to Daimler shares remains. March - April 1993. Mr Steinkuhler buys 2,100 MAH shares for almost DM1m (Pounds 400,000). March 24. Daimler announces it will seek a share listing in the US by the end of the year. MAH's share price starts to rise, with the discount to Daimler shares dropping from 25.52 per cent on March 22 to 19.79 per cent on the morning of April 2. April 1-2. Daimler supervisory board meets, attended by Mr Steinkuhler, a board member for 15 years. Dissolution of MAH agreed - US investors do not approve of such anti-takeover devices and MAH complicates Daimler's plans to hold a large rights issue. On April 1 Mr Steinkuhler buys half his shares. Friday, April 2. Daimler announces that MAH is to be dissolved. In late trading MAH jumps DM84.50 to close at DM575. Shares climb higher on Monday as the discount disappears: MAH shares are to be exchanged for Daimler shares later this year. April - May. Mr Steinkuhler - with other members of the Daimler supervisory board - is interviewed by officials from the Insider Dealing Commission of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. They are investigating circumstances behind the rise in MAH's share price prior to the April 2 announcement. May 17. Story of Steinkuhler share purchases breaks, based on documents leaked to Stern magazine from the Stuttgart branch of the BfG Bank, the former trade union bank. Compiled by David Waller</p>

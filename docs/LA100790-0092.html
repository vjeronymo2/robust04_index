			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ON SHERIFF GATES CAME AS BREATH OF FRESH AIR  </P> <P> I have trouble identifying with a "tainted" sheriff who has a movie star as a  hero.  </P> <P> I think it's about time he climbed onto his horse and rode off into the sunset.  </P> <P> However, his friends, mentors, developers etc., will help defray his fines, and  it will be business as usual. Too bad! The voters deserve who they vote for.  </P> <P> FRED STEWART, Capistrano Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> ARMS CACHE NOT SECRET, SOLDIER SAYS  </P> <P> A former Green Beret imprisoned for illegally stockpiling millions of dollars  of ammunition in Thailand claims that his superiors approved the illegal cache.  In a letter to the San Francisco Examiner, Edward Gleason, once a top sergeant  for the 80-man Green Beret unit in Thailand, said high-ranking army officers in  the 1st Battalion of the 1st U.S. Special Forces Group gave him permission to  collect a stash of bullets and explosives that filled a bunker 250 feet long.  </P> <P> Officers have denied knowledge of the stockpile. But Gleason said he repeatedly  briefed both his battalion commanders and officers in the U.S. Military  Assistance Group headquarters in Bangkok about the stockpile, the paper  reported. Gleason, a Vietnam War hero now serving seven years for plotting to  kill a Green Beret captain, said he doubts the Army's claim that the illegal  cache was blown up in 1989.  </P></p>

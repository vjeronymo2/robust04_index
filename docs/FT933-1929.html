			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Spotlight on Altus and Phenix bid for FNAC THE FRENCH stock market authorities have asked Altus Finance and Compagnie Immobiliere Phenix to clarify their intentions towards FNAC, the music and books retailer, following an official investigation into their bid for control of the company. The investigation, which began last month after complaints about the circumstances of the Altus and Phenix bid, concluded that a fair value for FNAC, a bastion of French retailing and the dominant force in the music and books market, was between FFr2.4bn (Dollars 427.05m) and FFr2.7bn. Under the terms of their bid Altus, a subsidiary of the Credit Lyonnais banking group, and Phenix, part of the Compagnie Generale des Eaux utilities concern, had an option to buy a controlling 54.78 per cent stake in FNAC for FFr1.2bn, thereby valuing the company for only slightly less than the lowest estimate. Altus and Phenix negotiated the option to buy the controlling holding with Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires (GMF), the French mutual insurance group which needed to raise capital to counter its losses on other activities. Other prospective purchasers have indicated their interest in FNAC, notably Pinault-Printemps, the heavily indebted French retail group, and Bertelsmann of Germany.</p>

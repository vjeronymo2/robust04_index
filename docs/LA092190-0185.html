			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHIP BECK BEATS NICK FALDO IN GOLF SEMIFINALS  </P> <P> Chip Beck survived Nick Faldo's runaway start and beat the defending champion  2-and-1 today to reach the semifinals of the World Match Play golf championship  at Wentworth.  </P> <P> Beck led by as many as five holes at one point after Faldo, the Masters and  British Open champion from Britain, won the first two of 36 holes.  </P> <P> U.S. Open champion Hale Irwin lost to Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe, 6-and-4, while  Welshman Ian Woosnam defeated Northern Ireland's Ronan Rafferty, 5-and-4.  </P> <P> Greg Norman of Australia beat countryman Wayne Grady with a birdie on the  second playoff hole to gain a semifinal berth against McNulty. Beck plays  Woosnam.  </P> <P> Faldo landed a 1-iron within 8 feet of the flag on the first hole for a birdie,  then chipped to 6 feet on No. 2 for a par after Beck bogeyed out of a bunker.  </P> <P> The two-hole lead began to fall apart when Beck sank a 16-foot putt at the  fifth. He then scored par as the usually steady Faldo had bogeys at the seventh  and ninth holes.  </P> <P> Faldo also had bogeys at the 10th, 12th and 13th holes, and he fell five behind  when he hit into a bunker at the 15th.  </P> <P> He made up ground at the start of the second 18 when Beck missed a 4-footer at  the fourth and 3-putted the fifth.  </P> <P> When Faldo birdied the 25th and Beck missed a 2-foot putt, the Englishman had  cut the American's lead to one. And it was even at the 28th when Beck had a  penalty drop from a ditch and posted a double-bogey 5.  </P> <P> Just as Faldo appeared ready to recapture the lead, Beck rallied again. He  holed from 16 feet at the 29th and birdied the next to go two ahead.  </P> <P> Faldo's 24-foot birdie putt at the 31st cut the lead to one, but Beck's  birdie-4 at the next-to-last hole clinched a semifinal place.  </P> <P> After the match, Faldo said he has withdrawn from England's team for the  Dunhill Cup golf tournament at St Andrews, Scotland, Oct. 11-14.  </P> <P> The Englishman said he wanted to give his injured left wrist a five-week rest.  Faldo said he will not play again in Europe this season and his next appearance  will be in Japan.  </P></p>

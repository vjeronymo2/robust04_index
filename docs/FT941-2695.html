			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Banks back Brazil on restructuring Brazil's bank creditors yesterday appeared ready to go ahead with a Dollars 52bn (Pounds 35.60bn) debt restructuring even though the country failed on Wednesday to win a standby loan accord from the International Monetary Fund. Creditors holding at least 66 per cent of the debt need to drop their original requirement for IMF support if the deal is to go ahead. Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank and chairman of the bank advisory committee, said he was 'confident we will get the waivers by the end of next week'. Banks on the advisory committee, which account for about a third of the debt, have already backed the waiver and asked other creditors to agree by March 24. Bankers were rushing to complete various technical details in time for a notification deadline due to expire last night. The restructuring is due to go ahead on April 15 and would make Brazil the last large Latin American country to complete a Brady-type debt deal. Brazil, the developing world's largest debtor nation, is also thought to have made arrangements to secure up to Dollars 2.8bn in US Treasury zero coupon bonds as a guarantee for the first part of the restructuring. The guarantee was originally to have been provided by the US Treasury, but only if the IMF had provided a standby facility. Brazil says it has 'executed arrangements' to have the collateral in place when it is needed.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minera Escondida expects proven ore reserves to double Minera Escondida, owner of the giant Escondida copper mine in Chile, is confident that the mine's proven ore reserves will double in the next year to more than 1.3bn tonnes, according to its president, Mr John Hannah, reports Reuter from Melbourne. Mr Hannah said yesterday he expected drilling near the mine to prove enough reserves to maintain its life at about 52 years in spite of a USDollars 276m programme now under way to lift annual output. Escondida, the world's third largest copper mine, is owned by Broken Hill Proprietary of Australia (57.5 per cent), RTZ Corporation of the UK (30 per cent), JECO, the Japanese smelter consortium, (10 per cent) and the International Finance Corporation (2.5 per cent). Mr Hannah estimated that the production boost would cut the mine's original life of 52 years by about half if no new reserves were found. 'In a general way, our objective is to maintain a mine life of that order,' he said after addressing a conference on South American mining. But he was confident that drilling, which has started on the Colorado Grande mountain near Escondida, would prove more of the 1.8bn tonnes resource, which is graded 1.6 per cent copper. Proven reserves at Escondida were now about 665m tonnes graded at 2.1 per cent copper, he said, and results of the new drillings were expected to be known some time next year. He earlier told the conference that annual output at Escondida would be expanded to 400,000 tonnes of refined copper a year by September this year from 340,000 in the year to May 31, and then to 480,000 tonnes by September 1994. Mr Hannah declined to comment on a study forecasting that Escondida's annual output would rise to 618,000 tonnes by the year 2000. The study was conducted by three officials of Codelco, the state-owned copper corporation.</p>

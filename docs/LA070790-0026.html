			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMOKING BAN IN RESTAURANTS  </P> <P> I'm sitting here reading your editorial wherein proponents of no smoking in Los  Angeles city restaurants feel that the ban should cover a larger area,  countywide, maybe statewide. I quote: ". . . People who smoke cigarettes or  cigars or pipes inflict their dirty addiction on innocents who happen to be  sharing their airspace."  </P> <P> Airspace, well go figure! It's 100 degrees today, the sky is a putrid shade of  gray-brown, the "airspace" smells foul, and all they can worry about is smoking  in restaurants.  </P> <P> I am also a nonsmoker; however, self-righteous and pompous I am not. Get real,  Los Angeles. Stop blaming smokers for the damage Southern California and its  inhabitants caused to the environment decades ago by sheer, self-centered  greed.  </P> <P> LYNNE NIELSEN  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

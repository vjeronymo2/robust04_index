			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO SPEND BILLIONS IN GAS TAX DOLLARS? OFFICIALS PONDER 7-YEAR PLAN FOR  SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> From the widening of California 14 in the Antelope Valley to the construction  of the last link of Interstate 15 in San Diego, millions of dollars in new  highway projects for Southern California are being presented to state officials  this week for inclusion in a master road-building plan.  </P> <P> With billions of dollars in new cash from a gasoline tax increase at their  disposal, members of the California Transportation Commission are expected to  sift through recommendations from regional agencies representing Los Angeles,  San Diego, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside and Ventura counties to map out a  new seven-year plan for easing a congestion crisis in Southern California.  </P> <P> Peter Hathaway, the commission's deputy director for finance, said the regional  agencies have recommended nearly twice as many projects as the state can afford  -- forcing the commission to pick and choose among them when it officially  adopts the State Transportation Improvement Program next month.  </P> <P> Other officials said the commission is expected generally to adhere to  priorities recommended by the regional agencies and to drop only those projects  that local officials deem less pressing.  </P> <P> The projects include proposals for widening highways, extending freeways,  constructing sound walls, adding car-pool lanes and synchronizing traffic  lights.  </P> <P> Neil Peterson, executive director of the Los Angeles County Transportation  Commission, said that in setting priorities his agency recommended projects  that would "improve air quality, reduce accidents and improve the efficiency of  the existing highway network."  </P> <P> Of the $746 million in projects proposed by the regional commission, $206  million would be devoted to the construction of car-pool lanes and $62 million  to synchronize traffic signals at various locations. Car-pool lanes are  expected to improve air quality by decreasing the number of automobiles, and  synchronized traffic signals are designed to make traffic flow more easily.  </P> <P> Under the commission proposals, car-pool lanes would be built along the San  Diego Freeway (Interstate 405) from Normandie Avenue near Torrance to the  Orange County line, on the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10) from Baldwin  Avenue to Puente Avenue, and along the Orange Freeway (California 57) from the  Pomona Freeway (California 60) to the Orange County line.  </P> <P> Other projects given high priority by the LACTC and expected to become part of  the state plan include a proposal for completing the expansion of California 30  in the city of La Verne and constructing a six-lane freeway between Foothill  Boulevard and the San Bernardino County line.  </P> <P> The regional agency has also recommended widening California 14 in the Antelope  Valley from San Fernando Road to Escondido Summit.  </P> <P> Not given high priority by the LACTC is a plan to widen the Pomona Freeway from  the Orange Freeway to the San Bernardino County line. Officials said an  engineering glitch had forced them to give the project a low priority, but they  expected the problem to be resolved by the time it comes up again for  consideration in 1992.  </P> <P> Most of the major projects placed before the state commission for consideration  were promised voters when they were asked June 5 to endorse a gasoline tax  increase. But one project that was not touted by backers of Proposition 111 --  the ballot measure that triggered the gas tax increase -- was the extension of  the Long Beach Freeway (Interstate 710) through South Pasadena. The project is  bitterly opposed by residents of that city.  </P> <P> In its recommendations, the LACTC has asked state officials to endorse two  projects that would begin to acquire right-of-way for the Long Beach Freeway  extension.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in Southern California, local officials also attempted to live up to  promises made to the voters. Projects that received recommendations from San  Diego officials included those that would complete Interstate 15 through City  Heights and widen Interstate 5 and add car-pool lanes.  </P> <P> In San Bernardino County, officials proposed the completion of California 30  from the Los Angeles County line to Interstate 215. Orange County seeks funds  for widening the Santa Ana Freeway (Interstate 5).  </P></p>

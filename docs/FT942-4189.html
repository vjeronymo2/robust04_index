			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (11): Door to recovery unlocked - Michael Holman visits a town that has discovered new hope for the future The group of visitors from Kampala waited for the owner to unlock the doors with the tense anticipation of Egyptologists unsealing the burial chamber of a pyramid. It was only a run-down warehouse, just off the main street of Gulu, in north-west Uganda. But earlier investigation had suggested that what it might contain could assist the recovery of a town battered by past conflict. The warehouse owner unlocked the padlock, the doors creaked open. Amid gasps of astonishment a shaft of sunlight revealed the contents of the gloomy interior: several huge wood crates. A few puffs of breath dispelled the layer of dust, exposed the hieroglyphics below, Georg Sahn, Escwege, West Germany, via Mombasa, and confirmed that the crates, dispatched in 1983, contained hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of weaving equipment. More than 10 years later, they remained as securely sealed as the day they were sent on a 10,000-mile journey to a town in a cotton-growing region of central Africa. Martin Hogg, deputy executive director of the Uganda Investment Authority, whose inquiries led to the find, will help co-ordinate efforts to put the machinery to work. The next stop was a possible beneficiary - the ginnery owned by the members of the West Acholi Co-operative Union, where Mr RA Oneka, the manager, sets the machines running to demonstrate progress in the factory's rehabilitation, a critical step in Gulu's recovery. Like everything else, the cotton sector was destroyed by a war that goes back to 1986, when various rebel factions began a bitter resistance to the incoming National Resistance Movement. Ginneries were ruined, farmers fled, their crops abandoned. The community's cattle were killed or stolen, leaving their owners without draught animals to help plough. And without draught power, the land's potential can barely be tapped, explained Julis Peter Obal, in charge of Gulu district agricultural office. But the first step to recovery has been the peace initiative, spearheaded by Mrs Betty Bigombe, minister of state of the prime minister's office who also has responsibility for implementing the government's northern Uganda rehabilitation programme. Peace has allowed the railway to Gulu to operate after a lengthy break, and at the market that springs up alongside the station on the day the train comes in, sorghum, maize, ground nuts, beans and sugar cane are plentiful, along with what must be some of the world's cheapest and most succulent mangoes. They would cost at least a dollar or more in the supermarkets of Europe. In Gulu, the surplus overwhelms the market, and a bucketful goes for 50 shillings (5 US cents). Phillip Wilson Odong, the deputy central government representative in Gulu, enthusiastically supports a suggestion that the mango flesh could be dried, packed, and exported. Later in the day at Arua, about 100 miles to the west, and a handful of miles from Zaire, a drive around the town shows that there, too, life is slowly recovering, but, unlike Gulu, power comes from a generator and contact with the outside world is by radio. Awongo Ahmed, the central government representative, supports Mr Hogg's proposal that the Investment Agency help establish a bonded warehouse that could cater for traders from across the border. But Arua is uncomfortably close to Sudan, where the civil war in the south seems to get worse by the day, forcing more and more civilians to take refuge in Uganda; and nor is Gulu immune from the fighting. If Ugandans are to be certain that they can live in peace, their neighbours must also settle their internal disputes.</p>

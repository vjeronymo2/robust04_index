			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: GEC well placed to win but outbid by state-aided rivals Sir, Perhaps I could clarify and slightly expand your report, ''Crazy rules on aid and trade . . .' (March 30), on the evidence I gave to the Commons foreign affairs committee on aid and trade. I cited the aid given by the German government to the Shanghai metro and the Guangzhou metro merely as examples of the way other governments use their large aid budgets to support industry, often in a ruthless way. In the case of Shanghai, the UK government offered 23 per cent of the cost, this being, in 1988, the OECD minimum. At a late stage the Germans offered 51 per cent, just 1 per cent above the level required for the offer to be deemed bilateral and therefore not requiring advance notice. In the case of Guangzhou, the UK government offered the then OECD minimum of 35 per cant of the cost of the rolling stock. Just before Chancellor Kohl visited China with a large delegation of ministers and businessmen, the Bonn government offered a 68 per cent grant, again for the rolling stock. The British government did offer to match 68 per cent but the Chinese decided to award the contract for the rolling stock and the rest of the electrical and mechanical work to German industry - presumably partly to ensure the success of the Kohl mission and because the Germans initiated this high offer. In both cases GEC companies were well placed to win the orders. A J Lippitt, director, group exports, General Electric Company, 1 Stanhope Gate, London W1</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THATCHER'S TIME OF GRIM RE-EVALUATION  </P> <P> In those bygone days when the European Parliament was known as the Cave of the  Winds for all the effect-less speeches that stirred it, the conventional wisdom  was that Europewide voting for members had only a tenuous connection with  national politics.  </P> <P> Political analysts argued that last month's European Parliament elections, like  municipal elections in some countries and presidential primaries in the United  States, were based more on whim and temporary feeling than considered judgment  or traditional alliances. Voters, in this analysis, could afford to adopt a  devil-may-care approach because they could be sure the people they selected  would not actually govern them. Certainly in the first two European Parliament  elections, the Green parties and the far right did better than they did in  national voting.  </P> <P> After the debacle for her Conservative Party in the latest round of European  voting, Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher must be hoping fiercely that  this conventional wisdom still holds. While her Labor opponents, who had  finished a sad second every other time they went against Thatcher, crowed that  the end was nigh, the Tories were engaged in a grim re-evaluation of their  European posture.  </P> <P> European Community members with socialist governments, such as France and  Spain, could barely conceal their glee. Variations of the headline "Is the Iron  Lady Rusting?" appeared in a variety of languages.  </P> <P> Britain has 81 of the 518 seats in the European Parliament. With the recent  elections, the situation of the Conservatives and Labor were exactly reversed  from the last balloting five years ago. Whereas the Conservatives had  previously held 45 seats to Labor's 32, the score now is Labor 45,  Conservatives 32. (The rest of the seats are filled by small regional parties.)  </P> <P> Worse than that, the Conservative share of the total votes dropped to 34.2%,  the lowest percentage in a nationwide poll during this century. It was the  first national defeat for the Tories in 14 years. A Harris poll last Sunday in  the Observer, which is no friend of the Thatcher government, gave Labor 48% of  the vote to 34% for the Conservatives if a national election were held now.  </P> <P> But it will be at least two years before Thatcher has to face such a test. She  dismisses the Euroresults as temporary and trendless, a mere blip in her  relentless progress. At last week's European Community summit she showed a  slightly increased inclination to compromise, but no sign of contrition or any  major policy shift.  </P> <P> Analyses of the vote must also take into account the peculiarities of the  British electoral system. The United Kingdom is the only one of 12 European  Community countries to maintain voting by constituency rather than by  proportional representation. That means voters in constituencies certain to go  to one party or another are especially tempted to lodge protest votes for  special-interest parties -- or to stay home.  </P> <P> Britain's turnout of 37% was the lowest among the countries voting, compared  with 47% in the Netherlands, 49% in France and 61% in West Germany. Yet high  turnouts do not necessarily mean high acceptance of the European ideal. In  Belgium, where 93% of those eligible voted, voting is compulsory with a fine  rising to $100 for recalcitrants; in Italy, with an 88% turnout, failure to  vote is entered on a citizen's "Certificate of Good Conduct," needed for some  civil-service jobs.  </P> <P> The British Green Party, making its first nationwide showing, enjoyed  remarkable results, winning 14% of total votes cast.  </P> <P> In some Tory country strongholds of southern England, the Greens actually came  second, ahead of both Labor and what's left of the hapless Liberal-Social  Democrat alliance. But although they won the highest vote percentage in the  European environmental movement, the British Greens did not win a single seat  because of the constituency system. The French Verts got 10.6% of the vote but  won nine seats through proportional representation, while the German Greens  came away with eight seats on 8.4% of the vote.  </P> <P> Thatcher, who began embracing environmental causes last fall after ignoring  them for a decade, has implied that in a Tory-Labor showdown, the bulk of the  Green vote would go to the Tories. It is certainly true that Labor has never  stressed ecology -- directing its appeal instead to urban issues. However, it  seems likely that the biggest cause of the Green surge was the disarray among  the Liberals and Social Democrats, who had previously claimed the ecological  issue as their campaign turf.  </P> <P> In their projections for the next British general election, analysts must also  factor in the lack of discipline among Labor ranks. Ideological splits, with  socialists on the hard left attacking comfortable Social Democrats on the  right, have more than once spoiled any prospect of a Labor victory.  </P> <P> In his public appearances these days, Neil Kinnock, the Labor leader, stresses  the need to adopt electable positions. But favorite Labor ideas, such as  unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from European unity and  renationalization of denationalized industries still keep popping up.  </P> <P> In the end, most commentators pointed to Thatcher's uneasiness with European  integration as the cause of her party's poor showing two weeks ago. The prime  minister, in a series of scornful attacks, had spent much of the winter calling  into question the next steps in the creation of a united Europe. She said the  dropping of remaining trade barriers by the end of 1992 was fine, but that  creation of a European central bank, a common currency and giving up a measure  of national sovereignty for integration were "airy-fairy ideas."  </P> <P> Such sentiments are common among small-scale businessmen fearing the arrival of  hyper-markets, agribusiness and all the other appurtenances of expansion. The  theory, however, is that in the Tories' high-tech party, Thatcher's protests  were not heard by the voters. While party aides correctly observed that Labor's  record has been even more anti-European than Thatcher's, it did seem that some  of the traditional Conservative support was worried by the prime minister's  recalcitrance.  </P> <P> Socialists, including the British Labor Party, will be the largest bloc when  the new European Parliament meets in Strasbourg, France, on July 25.  </P> <P> Under the streamlined system adopted to speed the post-1992 market, the  Parliament has a major voice in amending and approving enabling legislation.  That could pit the parliamentary majority against those nations that have  right-of-center governments, such powerful member countries as West Germany and  Britain. If that turns out to be the case, then Thatcher's problems with Europe  have barely begun.  </P></p>

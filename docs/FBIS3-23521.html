Krotov and Major Yu. Dubchik] </F>   [Text] Foreign navies make wide use of various types of  passive jamming systems and equipment to protect combatant ships  against antiship missiles. Interference in the radio-frequency  bands is created by forming clouds of metallized fibers or foil  strips, and in the infrared band by clouds of heat sources whose  emission intensity exceeds the thermal background of the  defended object.    Packages of metallized fibers (strips) designed for  different  frequency bands and decoy flares are loaded into containers  accommodated in the bodies of free-flight rockets and  projectiles fired in a given direction and to a given range by  multitube launchers. A large number of surface ships of the  United States, NATO countries and a number of other states are  equipped with the U.S. RBOC (Rapid Bloom Off-Board  Countermeasures) and SRBOC (Super RBOC) systems developed in the  1970's with manual or automatic control of four six-tube  launchers of the Mk 35, Mk 135 and Mk 36 types.    Great Britain, the FRG, Denmark and Norway developed a  standard modification (within the NATO framework) of the RBOC  system called Sea Gnat. It has a relatively large response time  (up to 10 seconds), which does not permit creating effective  protection for a ship in the rapidly changing situation of naval  warfare. Means for automatic processing of incoming data and for  ensuring an essentially instantaneous system response are a  mandatory element of modern passive jamming systems. Thus, the  latest modifications of RBOC and SRBOC contain the CAMLAC  (Computer Aided Master Launcher Control) computer control unit,  which permits substantially increasing the effectiveness of ship  protection against antiship missiles. Generalized data on  shipboard passive jamming systems and equipment are given in the  table.

They have up to 12 tubes at various angles in  the vertical plane (sometimes in the horizontal plane), which  ensures necessary altitude and direction of free-flight rocket  or projectile launches for creating decoys. Mk 4, Mk 171, Mk  182, Mk 214, Mk 216, Chaffstar and LOROC with chaff packages and  decoy flares are the types of projectiles and free-flight  rockets used for launchers of the RBOC, SRBOC and Sea Gnat  systems. In addition, there are variants of comprehensive sets  of radar and infrared means of jamming in the GEMINI unified  projectile and special free-flight rockets with expendable  active jamming sources.    Work continues on creating new types of decoys with improved  specifications and performance characteristics. This is one of  the basic directions for upgrading passive jamming systems.    The Mk 171 projectile is a pyrotechnic device containing  packets of chaff made on a glass fiber basis with an aluminum  coating. Foil strips (their length is commensurate with the half  wavelength of antiship missile radar homing head signals) can  cover the frequency bands from 2 to 20 GHz (more precise values  are indicated in technical documentation of each lot of  projectiles). The radar cross-section of a cloud from one  projectile exceeds the radar cross-section of a small combatant  by approximately 1.5-2 times.    The propellant and secondary charges also are within the  projectile body. The secondary charge operates 3-4 seconds after  launch and scatters the chaff packets. The chaff disperses under  the effect of the oncoming air stream and forms an extended  cloud several tens or hundreds of meters from the protected  object.    The Chaffstar projectile creates a cloud with a radar  cross-section approximately two times larger than from the Mk  171.    The supply of chaff of Mk 182 and Mk 214 projectiles is  enough to cover large-displacement ships. The area of a chaff  cloud formed with the help of these projectiles can exceed  20,000 m[.sup]2[/] in certain frequency bands (8-12 GHz).    The Mk 216 free-flight rocket and increased-range LOROC are  used to simulate surface targets. They consist of a  solid-propellant motor providing a maximum velocity of 270 m/sec  and a time delay device (up to 20-25 seconds) for triggering the  secondary charge. The place where a decoy is formed may be  400-4,000 m from the ship.    Use of free-flight rockets and projectiles with decoy flares  is based on a different principle. In addition to a propellant  charge, the HIRAM projectile has a section with a combustible  substance, a parachute and a float. The secondary charge is  triggered and punctures a protective membrane 3.5-4 seconds  after firing. The parachute opens under the effect of the air  stream and the process of ignition of the combustible substance  and formation of a cloud begins simultaneously, with intense  emission in the 3-5 micron waveband. The descent rate of the  projectile, with a chaff dispensing height of 60 m, is 2 m/sec.  It burns around 40 seconds and may continue to burn after  hitting the water because of the float.    The following modifications -- HIRAM-2, -3 and -4--are  distinguished by greater intensity of thermal emission and an  expanded band of coverage (8-12 microns).    The GEMINI combination radar/IR decoy consists of three  sections -- two with chaff and one with the IR decoy. The  combustion process lasts around 45 seconds.    All the above projectiles and free-flight rockets are of  113-mm caliber for the Mk 33 launcher (RBOC) and 130-mm for the  Mk 36 (SRBOC). The designation of the latter contains the prefix  Super: Super LOROC, Super HIRAM and so on.    A computer, control apparatus and auxiliary equipment are  included in the automated passive jamming system in addition to  multitube launchers. Multitube launchers (such as in the RBOC  system) are located on fixed platforms and contain six tubes on  each side with fixed quadrant elevations (one each at 45 and  75 and two each at 55 and 65). Using six launchers,  they are oriented at angles of 30, 60 and 135 in azimuth to  the ship's centerline. A diagram of the structure of a typical  passive jamming system and external appearance of the launchers  are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 ([Fig. 2 not reproduced]).             The system receives all information necessary for  functioning  from shipboard ELINT collection assets, acquisition radars,  navigation devices and meteorological situation monitors.  Launches are prepared and executed using the controlling  processor (Fig. 3 [figure not reproduced]) and data display  device. Information on the ship's current coordinates, wind  direction and velocity, and amount of rolling and pitching  enters the system along with intelligence. Information from the  shipboard radar and ELINT set contains data on target parameters  (bearing, range) and the type, operating frequency and kind of  emission of the radar homing head. It can be transmitted to the  processor both from the automated battle management system  central computer as well as directly from sensors. The  controlling processor figures the optimum variant for employing  decoys with an indication of the specific launcher, tube  numbers, and moment and sequence of launches, and provides  recommendations on executing a maneuver to leave an antiship  missile impact zone.    The SRBOC system uses a standard, widespread 80186 processor  with 64 kilobytes of main memory (its increase to 256 kilobytes  is envisaged) and 16 kilobytes of on-line memory (with the  possibility of expanding to 128 kilobytes) as a controlling  processor.    The following data are needed for the controlling processor  to perform calculations: Current number of detected target (from  1 to 16) and its azimuth (0-360); type of homing head  (radar, IR or combination); operating frequency band of radar  homing head (four subbands); pulse duration (within limits of  50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 500 or more nanoseconds); ship speed  (0-50 knots); own course (0-360); amount of roll (from -60  to +60) and pitch (from -45 to +45); wind direction  and velocity (0-100 knots) and information on the status of the  launcher and other system units. Launch controls and annunciator  panels displaying information on the type of antiship missile,  the direction of its approach and readiness of the launcher are  located on the controlling processor panel.    The control panel on the bridge duplicates the controlling  processor's monitoring panel. The passive jamming system display  equipment, including a screen showing the tactical situation, is  located in the ship's combat information post. After a  free-flight rocket or projectile with decoys is fired, its blip  is shown on the screen relative to the antiship missile's  movement path. Based on this information a decision can be made  about changing the ship's course for more effective protection  against the antiship missile.    There are lockers on deck near each launcher, each  containing  18 projectiles.    As a rule, passive jamming systems provide different methods  of creating the passive jamming and also can function at the  same time as active jammers. Data input to the computer about  basic specifications and performance characteristics and about  the algorithm of operation of homing heads in the inventory of  antiship missiles are taken into account in choosing the method.  In the target search mode the homing head of an antiship missile  in flight emits pulses of maximum duration in which the size of  the strobe reaches several hundred meters. With transition to a  target tracking mode, pulses are narrowed sometimes tens of  times and their repetition frequency sharply increases, as a  result of which the size of the strobe decreases to tens of  meters. This circumstance affects choice of the specific method  of repelling an enemy attack depending on its phase (detection  of the enemy radar emission, preparation of the antiship missile  for launch, target search by the antiship missile homing head,  guidance of the antiship missile to the target).    The first method (confusion) is effective against radars of  enemy ships and aircraft operating in a search and target  designation mode. The defending ship forms 5-7 decoys separated  from each other by from 400 to 4,000 m.    The second method (diversion) is used basically for  protection against a flying antiship missile before its homing  head locks onto the target (Fig. 4). One or two decoys are  formed 100-400 m from the ship in the homing head search sector.  Inasmuch as the algorithm of operation of the missile homing  head provides for lock-on and tracking of a higher-contrast  target (with larger radar cross-section), then with  consideration of the principle of priority, it will select the  decoy as the target for guidance.             The third method (deflection) is used in the case where the  antiship missile homing head has accomplished lock-on of the  target and shifted to the guidance mode (Fig. 5). With this  method, an extended concealing cloud is formed, whose edge  envelops the protected ship (the maneuver of her departure from  the impact zone is executed simultaneously). Inasmuch as the  ship and chaff cloud are within limits of one strobe of the  antiship missile homing head, then by shifting the geometric  center of the cumulative extended target (ship and cloud) by  several tens of meters, the missile path changes away from the  ship.             There are several versions for employing a passive jamming  system together with active means: Simultaneous placement of  passive decoys with several active simulative jammers hindering  the antiship missile's choice of the two targets in its search  stage; placement of passive decoy and active jamming which  deflects in range, ensuring the antiship missile's guidance to  the decoy; placement of passive decoy and active concealment and  deception jamming. This precludes the possibility of the  antiship missile's guidance to an active shipboard jammer.    In the opinion of western specialists, passive jamming  systems are an effective means of repelling antiship missile  attacks and are characterized by a sufficient level of  reliability, simplicity of servicing and control, possibility of  installation on ships of any types, and relatively low cost.  They are a mandatory element of the system of individual  protection of surface combatants. The modular principle of  building passive jamming systems permits constantly upgrading  and modernizing their individual units.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Peace plan for Nagorno-Karabakh NATO and its former adver-saries in the Commonwealth of Independent States and eastern Europe agreed here yesterday on a joint initiative to halt the bloody fighting in the ethnically mixed Caucasus region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Under the plan, adopted by the 35-nation Nato Co-operation Council (NACC), Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the Czechoslovak foreign minister, has been mandated to undertake a mediation mission to the troubled enclave. The mission, proposed by Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, will be prepared by a meeting of senior officials of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Prague today. Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, yesterday warned that fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh could lead to a full-scale war that might engulf others, and said Armenia should drop any claims to the territory. But Iran, another neighbour, is suspicious of Turkey's intentions. A Foreign Ministry statement quoted by Tehran radio reiterated Iran's offer to mediate but said that 'the trend of events indicates the involvement of foreign and seditious elements in the clashes'. This was seen as a reference to Turkey, which Iranian newspapers have criticised for suggesting US mediation. The NACC ministers pleaded with the two feuding Caucasus republics to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. 'We stressed the need for the parties to take concrete actions to step back from the cycle of violence,' Mr James Baker, US secretary of state said. Mr Baker warned that 'there will be no victors' if the violence continued. 'There is no glory in leaving widows and orphans to build the democratic, free-market societies that should be the paramount priority.' Later, the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia - at separate news conferences - made accusations over who was to blame for the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Both ministers nevertheless said they wanted to solve the conflict peacefully and that a ceasefire should be monitored by international peacekeepers. Mr Gusseinaga Sadykhov, Azerbaijan's foreign minister, welcomed the new CSCE attempt to solve the crisis. Mr Dienstbier will be going to Nagorno-Karabakh in his capacity as the current CSCE president. His mission is intended to support efforts already undertaken by Russia to resolve the dispute. The immediate aim is to bring about a ceasefire, an exchange of prisoners and to set up a corridor through which humanitarian aid can be channelled. The agreement by the Council was its first decision following the formal admission yesterday of 10 new members from the CIS, including Armenia and Azerbaijan. Russia, the Baltic states and the new central and eastern European democracies have been members since last year. Mr Baker and Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, made clear that the NACC may be called on to play a more direct peacekeeping role in Nagorno-Karabakh and other areas of conflict in Europe and the territory of the former Soviet Union. Though no decision on the despatch of peacekeeping troops to the enclave was taken yesterday, the possibility of such a move was openly mooted at the council meeting. Mr Baker said the NACC should have 'a mutually reinforcing relationship with the CSCE'. A Dutch proposal that the Council should act as 'an operational complement' to the CSCE, for example by providing infrastructure facilities and troops, was discussed at the meeting. Mr Baker laid particular emphasis in his statement to the Council on the need to forge ahead with further disarmament measures. The Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty should be in force by the time of the CSCE summit in Helsinki in July, he said. Implementation of the treaty has been delayed by the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact alliance and by the break-up of the Soviet Union. Wages alert sounded in Russia, Page 2</p>

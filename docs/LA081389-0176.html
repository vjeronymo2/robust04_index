			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TOP TWO SEEDED PLAYERS BEATEN IN BOYS' 12 SEMIFINALS  </P> <P> Justin Gimelstob figured that sooner or later, it would end. It just had to.  </P> <P> He had taken a 5-0 lead in the first set against top-seeded Blake McMeans in  the semifinals of the Boys' 12 U.S. Tennis Assn. National Championships at  Morely Field. But then Gimelstob helplessly watched as McMeans rocketed shots  by him to pull within 5-4.  </P> <P> "He just started hitting shots I couldn't believe," said Gimelstob, who is  seeded third. "He couldn't keep it up like that. Nobody can keep it up like  that."  </P> <P> McMeans' torrid comeback finally fizzled, and Gimelstob went on to win, 6-4,  6-1, to reach today's 11:30 a.m. final against No. 4 Matthew Wright. Wright  defeated No. 2 Ryan Wolters, 6-4, 7-6.  </P> <P> Gimelstob, from Great Falls, N.J., knocked off McMeans by being patient and  smart. McMeans, a bigger player from Knoxville, Tenn., relied on his power  game.  </P> <P> Gimelstob effectively moved McMeans around the court, not letting him get into  a groove where he could comfortably blast the ball. The strategy worked until  McMeans hit his stride after trailing, 5-0. McMeans allowed Gimelstob just two  points in the next three games and led 40-15 in the fourth before closing it  out to trail, 5-4.  </P> <P> Gimelstob looked tentative during McMeans' run but then regrouped and again  began mixing his shots and moving McMeans around the court to close out the  set, 6-4.  </P> <P> Gimelstob had little trouble in the second set, breaking McMeans four times and  not allowing him a point until the third game. McMeans broke to trail, 3-1, and  looked as if he was going to go on another tear. But Gimelstob held him off by  winning four consecutive points after behind down 15-love in the fifth game.  </P> <P> "At 3-1 he started doing it again," Gimelstob said. "I thought 'I don't want  this to happen again.'  </P> <P> "You just hope it ends before you shake hands."  </P> <P> Gimelstob will see a familiar face in today's finals. Wright defeated him in  the consolation rounds at last year's tournament when both were 11.  </P> <P> Wright, who is from Wichita, Kan., has yet to lose a set of singles in the  tournament. He had not lost more than four games in a match before the  semifinals, although he came close to going three sets against Wolters, who is  from San Jose.  </P> <P> Wright held on to win the first set, 6-4, after taking a 5-1 lead, then rallied  from 3-4 to win the second set on a tiebreaker.  </P> <P> Wright was receiving for match point at 6-5 but missed an easy overhead.  Wolters did not give up a point on his serve in the 12th game and pulled even  at 6-6.  </P> <P> Wright was total control of the tiebreaker, winning the first four points and  coasting to a 7-1 victory.  </P> <P> "I was nervous (going into the tiebreaker)," Wright said. "I thought to myself  'how bad do I really want it?'  </P> <P> "I usually play well in tiebreakers, that's probably the best part of my game  because I want it so bad."  </P> <P> Gimelstob and Wright will be doing double duty today; both reached the doubles  final. Gimelstob and Jan Michael Gambill of Spokane, Wash., seeded third, will  play No. 1 Wright and McMeans an hour after the singles final.  </P></p>

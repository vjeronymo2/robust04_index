			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: SENSE OF HUMOR IS NO MEAN JOKE  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 19-year-old son has a wonderful sense of humor, but he  sometimes uses it to attack his sister and his grandmother. He always claims  he's only teasing, but his barbs hurt. Whenever I try to talk with him  seriously about anything, he turns what I'm saying into a joke. Obviously, this  makes serious conversation difficult. -- B.D.  </P> <P> DEAR B.D.: While it's true that there's usually some hostility in all humor,  people who use humor to attack are like hit-and-run drivers: They escape by  claiming they were only kidding and often end up blaming the victim for not  having a good sense of humor. It's important to put a stop to this pattern and  to point out to your son that what he's doing is cowardly and cruel.  </P> <P> If he's angry with his sister or his grandmother, then he should discuss the  problem directly without masking his aggression in humor. Whatever it is that  disturbs him in these relationships won't be solved until he uses a more  honest, constructive approach.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 5-year-old son has a terrible fear of dogs. My boyfriend  wants to get him a puppy for his birthday because he thinks this will get him  over his fear immediately. I'm not so sure. What's your view? -- R.C.J.  </P> <P> DEAR R.C.J.: The key to overcoming any fear such as this is to do it gradually.  I believe it would be a mistake to bring a pet into your son's life until he  feels more secure. This will take time. It would be fine to take him to visit a  cuddly puppy and see if he'd like to try stroking the dog's fur. If he's  frightened and doesn't wish to do this, his wishes should be respected. No one  should make fun of him or force him. It might even be a good idea to start him  out with a toy puppy, one that's soft and has a coat that feels like fur. This  might be a totally non-threatening way to introduce him to what a real puppy  might be like.  </P> <P> I'm wondering if you know the source of your son's fear of dogs. If he was  attacked or frightened by a dog, encourage him to talk about this experience.  Let him know that fear is normal but that it's possible to conquer our fears so  that they don't cripple us or limit our freedom.  </P> <P> You might also take him to a children's zoo where he can see other children  touching and petting the animals. Again, however, if he doesn't want to join  them, don't force him. Eventually, if this is handled with sensitivity, he may  welcome a new puppy, but wait until he's ready.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On Saturday, President Lech Walesa took part in a  periodic program by the New Television Warsaw station [Nowa  Telewizja Warszawa--NTW] entitled "And Now to Concrete Issues."  The meeting, which took place in the Belweder Palace, was  relayed live via satellite by all 12 regional TV stations  carrying Polonia 1 programs, the NTW editorial office reported  on 26 June. According to NTW, such relay and its scope occurred  for the first time in the history of commercial television in  Poland.    As it transpires from a communique sent to PAP, viewers  across the whole country could ask the president questions  directly thanks to special telephone links. Lech Walesa  answered questions posed before and during the program for about  35 minutes. The questions concerned diverse issues, among other  things, local government elections and plans for the  presidential election campaign, foreign policy, and Poland's  participation in NATO. Questions were also asked about the  president's attitude to the death penalty and the judiciary, in  general.    Asked why such conversation was not carried by public  television, which belongs to both the rulers and the ruled, Lech  Walesa replied that he had never refused participation in public  television programs but that he had never received an  invitation. He also said that it would be ideal to make  available those frequencies currently owned by the military to  all interested broadcasters and let the harsh market rules  decide on selection. He said, however, that the Army needs time  and the necessary equipment to make these frequencies gradually  available.    Asked if, besides the National Radio and TV Broadcasting  Council [KRRiTV], there should be an institution controlling the  press, the president replied that he is an opponent of political  control in a democratic state and that, in any case, the press  carries so many virtually scandalous reports that to deny them  he would have to bring several court cases every day, the NTW  statement reads.    [Warsaw Third Program Radio Network in Polish at 0900 GMT on  26 June adds that NTW "has been broadcasting without a  franchise" and "belongs to Nicola Grauso's Polonia 1 Television  Network"]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebels have sent  troops to Kigali. This morning, Farida Ayari managed to get  through to one RPF official, Emile Roua Massirabo. He is in  Kampala, Uganda. She asked him whether his movement was  considering negotiations with the interim government set up in  Kigali:    [Begin Massirabo recording] We hold this government  responsible for everything that is happening at the moment.  When one sees who is included in this government, one can  easily see that this is the most extremist gang in Rwandan  politics. Let us take the example of the incumbent interior  minister, Faustin Munyazesa. You may have heard of what was  called the death squad. He is a member of this death squad. He  was cited in the international commission for human rights'  report during the Buguesera massacre.    How can you expect us to negotiate with people who are  behind  these killings? How can you negotiate with people who, over the  last two or three days, slaughtered more than 10,000 people? It  is beyond anything you can imagine. What they are doing now is  marching on Kigali as quickly as possible and trying to save  what can be saved. [end recording]</p>

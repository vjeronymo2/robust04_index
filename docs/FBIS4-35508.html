			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Israeli Attacks," TISHRIN  comments on the continued acts of Israeli aggressive against  Lebanon. Discussing international indifference toward Israel's  piratical act of kidnapping Lebanese citizen Mustafa Dayrani  from his home in Lebanon, TISHRIN explains that this  indifference has encouraged Israel to persist in its aggressive  policy against the population of southern Lebanon.    TISHRIN adds: While the Arabs, including Lebanon, call for a  just, honorable peace, Israel insists on lame, phased agreements  that will give it a free hand and consolidate its hegemony in  the region, contrary to UN Security Council resolutions and UN  principles and conventions. The paper adds that Israel is  behaving as if it is above international law, selecting from the  UN Security Council resolutions only what is useful for its  expansionist schemes, usurpation, and settlement.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: Israel's attacks will not weaken  Lebanon's determination to restore its territory. Rather, they  will consolidate the Arab parties' conviction that the Tel Aviv  rulers reject a just, comprehensive peace in the Middle East.  It is the right of Lebanon and the Arabs to escalate resistance  to ensure Israel's compliance with the resolutions and  principles of the international community and put an end to the  aggression it has been continuing for many years.    In a commentary, AL-THAWRAH discusses peace Israeli style.  Practically, the paper says, this peace means taming the region  and ravishing its countries, people, wealth, and ideologies,  turning it into an obedient tool in the hands of Israel.    After reviewing Israel's practices against the peace  process,  up to and including the act of piracy carried out against a  Lebanese citizen and other attacks on southern Lebanon, the  paper says this is another image of the peace that Israel wants.  This is the only peace that it looks for. It is a peace that  gives Israel a free hand in the region, undeterred by any laws.  Therefore, it has been pushing peace on the Syrian track toward  a dead end because the peace Syria understands is the opposite  of this and because Syria rejects any peace that is not just and  comprehensive.    AL-THAWRAH explains that despite its serious and sincere  desire for peace, and despite its great appreciation for the  U.S. role and the Clinton administration's efforts to advance  the peace process, Syria believes that the United States should  explicitly and publicly point to the party that is obstructing  peace and is seeking to impose its own terms, which contradict  the bases of the peace process and international resolutions.    At the end of its commentary, AL-THAWRAH calls on the United  States to develop its stand and role and to act according to its  convictions in light of the stands of the parties to the peace  process. It also calls on the United States to make the side  obstructing peace comply with peace requirements and implement  the relevant UN resolutions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] First Deputy Chairman of the Tajik Supreme Court  Abdulmajid Dostiyev rejected in an INTERFAX interview the  opposition's allegations that the discussion of a constitution  draft was illegal because every fifth resident of the country  had left it.    He said that, according to the UN, there were 27,000 Tajik  refugees in Afghanistan while 110,000 people moved to other CIS  member nations but as few as 5000 of them were ethnic Tajiks  while the others were Russian speakers who had returned to their  old countries.    Dostiyev said that the opposition had every opportunity to  discuss the constitution draft in the country's mass media. He  added that hundreds of copies of the draft had been sent to  Moscow, St. Petersburg and Afghanistan.    He doubted that alternative drafts were in existence. If  they did, their publication would be useful.    Dostiyev said that most responses to the draft were positive  and there were no essential objections to or constructive  criticism of the draft to speak of.    He said he would insist that the Constitution be adopted by  a  referendum. If this does not work for any reason, it could be  adopted in a congress at which all areas, towns and  organizations are represented, he said. He expected the Supreme  Soviet to make a decision on this early in July.</p>

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said  last  night the Government was determined that their trial should take  place either in Scotland or in the United States.    It emerged yesterday that a proposal has been developed by  an  independent intermediary, suggesting that the trial could be  held at the UN International Court of Justice at The Hague.    It would be held under Scottish law and rules of evidence  with a Scottish judge presiding over an international panel of  judges sitting without a jury. The plan is the latest in a  string of compromises put forward with the approval of the  Libyans' lawyers.    It is to be put formally to Lord Rodger, the Lord Advocate,  this week. It will also be raised with Douglas Hurd, the  Foreign Secretary, by the Tory MP, Teddy Taylor, who recently  visited Libya to investigate their complaints about the  Lockerbie case.    'Abd-al-Basit 'Ali Muhammad al-Meqrahi and Al-Amin Khalifah  Fahimah were accused by both the UK and US in late 1991 of  planting the bomb, killing 259 passengers and crew onboard PanAm  Flight 103 and 11 Lockerbie inhabitants on 21 December 1988.    The Government has been informally aware of the plan,  disclosed yesterday in Scoland on Sunday, but has refused to  endorse it.    The FCO spokesman said: "Our position remains the same. We  expect the two suspects to be surrendered for trial in either  Scotland or the United States. This is a UN Security Council  requirement."    The proposal, which has been provisionally accepted by the  Libyan accused, is to be discussed in detail by their legal team  in Geneva this week. Alistair Duff, the Edinburgh-based  solicitor-advocate acting for them in Scotland, is expected to  fly out tomorrow. It was designed to overcome Libyan claims  that pre-trial publicity has destroyed the chances of a fair  jury trial in either Scotland or the US, and the Government's  refusal to countenance Libyan schemes for a trial in a neutral  country.    A Scottish Office spokesman said it would not comment until  it had seen the proposal. But it is understood the Government  believes it is unworkable as there are no legal mechanisms which  allow a Scottish judge to sit abroad, or for Scottish law to be  transferred abroad.    The proposal's supporters claim the Government could make it  possible if it had the will. Mr Taylor, MP for Southend,  believes the scheme has merits. "There are procedural problems,  but these could be worked out in 10 minutes by the House of  Commons."    It is understood it is a refinement of a scheme first  outlined in a letter sent by the Egyptian government to every  member of the UN Security Council, including the UK and USA  governments, five weeks ago. The UN secretary general, Butrus  Butrus-Ghali, also received a copy.    Mr Taylor said the Egyptians had, in consultation with  Libya,  proposed on 8 December to Britain holding the trial under  Scottish law in a neutral country, or at the UN International  Court. No reply has yet been received, he claimed.</p>

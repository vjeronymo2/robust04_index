			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Itskhak Bannai, manager of the YUBEKS </F> Company, by TRUD correspondent Nikita Shevtsov, in Antwerp; date  not given: "Uncut Diamonds--This Is a Way of Life"]    [Text] My interlocutor--Itskhak Bannai--is the  manager of the YUBEKS Company, which is located in the Belgian  city of Antwerp; it is considered one of the fastest developing  and promising firms operating on the uncut and cut diamond  market. It has subsidiary and joint enterprises in many  countries of the world. Not many people know that YUBEKS became  the first foreign firm that started to cut diamonds in Russia  jointly with the Smolensk production association Kristall. The  discussion in our interview mainly centered on the peculiarities  of the diamond business and how it is developing in the world,  particularly in our country.    [Shevtsov] Mr. Bannai, why and how did you decide to work in  the diamond business?    [Bannai] Most of all, because diamonds are not simply a  business, but a way of life. Work on them can even be equated to  art. I see this business as a hobby that, in addition, can bring  in an income. Although, based on economic interests, on my part  it would be more advisable to concentrate my principal attention  on other more profitable forms of activity of our companies.    The cut-uncut diamond business is a closed business in which  in order to win one's own "place under the sun" it is necessary  to pass a very difficult survival exam. He who engages in this  business finds himself under unusual conditions, in which an  especially important role is played by confidential relations  with partners, and the word you give has primary value.    I joined the diamond business immediately after completing  studies at a university in Paris. I started to learn it in  Israel, where I studied and worked in shops and became familiar  with gemology. Further, our company was among the first to  master the "princess" type of cut, which was new at that time.  Given the availability of a certain type of raw material, this  cut makes it possible to obtain a very beautiful diamond with a  quadrilateral form. The losses from the initial weight are  extremely insignificant. Thereby, the coefficient of  effectiveness of its use is greatly increased. Thus, it can be  said that this is what started our penetration into the  uncut-cut diamond business.    [Shevtsov] Are any changes occurring now in world trade in  the uncut and cut diamond business?    [Bannai] It is well known that the uncut-cut diamond  business  is to a large degree conservative. But in recent years it has  undoubtedly been experiencing important changes, especially in  the sphere of the new technology for processing uncut diamonds.  At the same time, the concept of sales is changing and being  improved. Broad prospects for the development of new markets in  the east are emerging--first and foremost in China and Russia,  where one-quarter of the population of the planet lives. It is  precisely there that new diamond buyers should appear.    [Shevtsov] But after all, they are very expensive, and the  incomes of the people in these countries is rather low...    [Bannai] First, there is reason to hope that the incomes of  the population in these countries will increase. And, second, it  should not be thought that all diamonds are very expensive. Of  course, there are diamonds that cost hundreds of thousands and  even millions of dollars. But on the other hand there are the  kind that in principle are accessible to everyone. They can be  acquired for several dozen dollars. Thus, the dream of diamonds  is realizable not only for the rich.    [Shevtsov] How is the activity of your company conducted on  the Russian market?    [Bannai] I visited Russia as a businessman for the first  time  in 1989. During a visit to the Smolensk production association  Kristall we began to hold negotiations on the creation of a  joint enterprise for cutting diamonds. And although they were  quickly concluded with success, a considerable amount of time  passed before it was possible to establish a joint enterprise  between our company and the Smolensk plant that really began for  the first time to engage in diamond cutting. It was given the  name Kristalldiam, and after three years became one of the major  producers of diamonds, among similar joint enterprises existing  in Russia. In addition, its product is distinguished by the high  quality of faceting for which Russian diamonds, particularly  Smolensk diamonds, have long been famous. We were the first to  produce the Princess diamond cut in Russia. Right after our  enterprise, other Russian plants began to do this also. All  told, with the participation of YUBEKS five joint enterprises  engaged in diamond cutting have been established in Russia.    [Shevtsov] What do you think of the condition of the  uncut-cut diamond industry in Russia?    [Bannai] I want to say that, despite the economic crisis  that  has struck practically all branches of the economy of Russia,  this industry is one of very few that has succeeded in  maintaining its position. Although, of course, its development  is being negatively affected by the instability of the political  situation, the developing crime-conducive situation, and also  the fact that some enterprises have ended up outside Russia.    Unfortunately, there is no clear concept of the development  of the uncut diamond processing industry on a countrywide scale.  Moreover, this branch attracts a large number of people who do  not understand it very well. Nevertheless, they try to influence  the course of events. Some of them think that Russia should sell  its raw materials only to De Beers, and others that it should  not sell diamonds at all, inasmuch as this leads to a  "squandering" of the national wealth, etc. A lot of inaccurate  and incorrect articles have appeared in the press. Unjustified  attacks are frequently made on such state structures as  Komdragmet of Russia, Almazyuvelireksport, and Diamonds of  Yakutia-Sakha. But after all, high-class professionals work in  these structures who like and understand their business.    It is clear that it is necessary to sell the main mass of  uncut diamonds and the products received from them. If Russia  does not trade in uncut and cut diamonds, others will start to  do so for it, squeezing it out of the international market. Of  course, reserves of uncut diamonds must exist, but in reasonable  limits. It is no accident that the United States regularly  resorts to the sale of uncut diamonds from the strategic  reserves. In the last two years this tendency has intensified  even more.    Now, for example, the value of technical uncut diamonds has  dropped sharply. Prices for them were reduced by 20-30 percent  in the last year. A situation has developed in which even De  Beers cannot and indeed does not want to control the situation  in the technical uncut diamond market. I, for example, consider  absolutely groundless the De Beers assertion that Russia,  allegedly in circumvention of an agreement reached with this  monopoly, has flooded the international uncut diamond market,  which will lead to a drop in prices for them. How then in such a  case, while announcing the arrival on the world market of an  excess of uncut diamonds from Russia, did De Beers itself  increase deliveries by 30 percent, thereby attaining a record  level of sales for its entire 120-year history of existence.    Of course, if Russia takes the path of development of its  own  diamond-cutting production, this will to some degree weaken the  monopoly position of De Beers. In turn, Russia will feel more  confident on the international cut diamond market. I think that  your country, from the position of an equal, could come to an  agreement with De Beers about your real place in this market. Of  course this is not easy, but it is possible.    For this the state must first decide how many and what kind  of uncut diamonds it wants to cut, and also guarantee the  necessary raw material to diamond-cutting plants for a long  period. In addition, the government has to consider that in  offering raw material to plants according to a price list  coordinated with De Beers, a high profit will be assured from  the production of cut diamonds. This is explained by the fact  that additional well-paid jobs are established, and the treasury  receives stable deductions from the payment of high taxes. The  diamond-cutting plants gain their own capital, and they are not  listed among the state debtors.    I am a supporter of the centralized distribution of diamonds  in Russia among enterprises engaged in their cutting. However,  of course, they should be received only by serious firms that  simultaneously with trade ensure the employment of the  population. In addition, it is necessary to establish a  secondary raw materials market in Russia and also to encourage  Russian firms to establish subsidiary enterprises in other  countries. They should join in partner relations with foreign  companies that have colossal experience in activity on the  international market. It is also necessary to support and  strengthen those Russian structures headed by Komdragmet, which,  speaking for a continuation of cooperation with De Beers, at the  same time do not plan to do the bidding of this monopoly, first  and foremost protecting the interests of Russia and its uncut  diamond industry.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Andras Agoston, president of the Democratic </F> Community of Vojvodina Hungarians, by Zuzana Serences; place and  date not given: "Agoston Discusses Vojvodina Autonomy"]    [Text] Visions of the "Bosnian syndrome" in Vojvodina are  not new. At one time Mr. Nenad Canak said that there was a  danger of the conflict being carried over into Vojvodina if the  DZVM [Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians] persisted  and continued to seek realization of the concept of three-tier  autonomy for Vojvodina Hungarians. This is now being repeated by  the president of the Reform Democratic Party of Vojvodina  [RDSV], says the leader of the DZVM, Andras Agoston, in  commenting on objections to their concept of Hungarian autonomy,  which contend that this represents an extreme danger to the  stability of this region and could result in a conflict such as  we have in Bosnia, as Dr Dragoslav Petrovic warned recently in  BORBA. Agoston responds to his "critics":    "The essence of the mistake both of them make is that the  `Bosnian syndrome' in fact requires that both sides be armed.  The Hungarians in Vojvodina are not armed. Accordingly, there  can be no conflict, but only atrocities, that is, violence  against one collectivity, difficult situations caused by an  irresponsible approach of paramilitary units, or certain other  forces. There can be no question here of the kind of conflicts  that are involved in Bosnia and certain other parts of the  former Yugoslavia. We think that the concept we are examining is  a model acceptable to Europe which makes it possible to achieve  equality of parts of nationalities in a particular region. We  are prepared to fight for that, but in a political struggle and  in a contest of arguments."    [Serences] What do you say in response to the assessments of  the RDSV president that the DZVM is actually "serving" the SPS  [Socialist Party of Serbia] with its neutral position on certain  essential issues, thereby weakening the opposition movement,  waiting for revenge?    [Agoston] We have always said, and it has been borne out  several times, that the opposition is not united and that one  cannot speak of it as a coherent force. Aside from that, the  DZVM has been presenting its demands to the Parliament and  Government of Serbia, seeking three-tier autonomy, and it must  be borne in mind that achievement of that concept is not  possible with the consent of just one party. What is essential  to us -- that is the essence of this democratic demand -- is the  support of forces in Parliament, since only in that way can we  expect the concept to be realized in practice, can we expect a  development in international relations, which will help to make  it clear to all the leading political forces in the country that  the DZVM concept is actually democratic and pulls all of us out  of this crisis. It is with that in mind that we have always  addressed Parliament, the government, and the presidents of the  state, aware that only a certain kind of political consensus can  bring us results. Incidentally, with respect to the democratic  fight to change the entire system, we will always participate on  the side of those who strive for that, consistent with our  political strength. However, we nevertheless think that only the  Serbs can adopt democracy for Serbia and Serbs, that is, those  large political parties which have sufficient prestige and  political legitimacy within that nationality.    [Serences] With respect to the DZVM, what is the situation  inside the organization? On the eve of the recent election  conference in Senta, there was a danger that the DZVM would  split.    [Agoston] The most important thing is that in Senta we  arrived at a democratic decision to support the democratic  course pursued up to now by the DZVM, the essence of which is to  constantly repeat demands for autonomy and at the same time the  desire to enter into dialogue with the bodies of government and  political forces which can take us to that goal. We received  more than two-thirds of the vote, and this political movement  has absolute legitimacy. In addition, and this is at least as  important, we managed to get free of problems of a financial  nature and to defend ourselves against an attempt to exert  political influence on the DZVM from outside, meeting the  challenge when financial resources were offered.    [Serences] Your recent statement in Budapest, in which you  allowed the possibility that perhaps that autonomy might not be  achieved and that could then be grounds for a fairly large-scale  expulsion of the Hungarians here, evoked considerable response.    [Agoston] Our fundamental belief is that autonomy will come,  since this is the only realistic solution based on principle. We  also can see this from positions taken by the highest  representatives in the U.S. Administration. But we are realists,  we can also imagine a situation in which recognition of the  autonomy of Hungarians simply does not happen. Since we consider  autonomy the legal framework for preserving the ethnic identity  of Vojvodina Hungarians, we think -- if that should not occur --  that probably a large number of Hungarians would think that  there is no point in staying here. Of course there always is  that worst-case scenario, the disastrous one: a general  conflict, if war flared up even in these parts, and there would  be atrocities against Hungarians in Vojvodina. We cannot  preclude that possibility, but we are not reckoning on those  dangers, we don't think them realistic, and we are aiming our  political struggle towards democratic achievement of our  objective.    [Serences] Was the recent answer from Mr. Lilic, president  of  the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], to your written  request for the DZVM to be included in preparation of the new  law on minorities the first time any letter of yours received an  answer from the top level of government?    [Agoston] Yes, the first time.    [Serences] And did Mr. Lilic's response result in the actual  inclusion of the DZVM in preparation of the law?    [Agoston] We were not included in the proceedings. But that  does not worry us too much, since the international factor is  not looking to see whether such a law exists or not, but is  looking specifically at the situation and listening to the  legitimate representatives of the minorities. We think that no  one can evade us on this issue since we are legitimate  representatives of the Hungarians in Vojvodina, nor can any law  be adopted without involving us essentially, and that means  politically, in its adoption. We are continuing to seek dialogue  with the authorities in Serbia and in Yugoslavia, and we believe  that only on that basis will there be solutions satisfactory to  both sides.    [Serences] We hear rumors that you are preparing to leave  the  country with your family?    [Agoston] Such rumors have not reached me, but, no matter,  my  answer is this: I am staying, and I believe that we will get our  autonomy in the foreseeable future and that all these political  conflicts will die down, and that we will live beside one  another peacefully, and, I hope, contentedly.</p>

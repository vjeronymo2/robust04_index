An official of the Ministry of Construction announced the  event at a press conference here yesterday. He said that the  country's total investment in housing in its cities and towns  last year topped 150 billion yuan, about 50 percent of which was  used for building commodity housing.    Houses that were built in the urban areas throughout the  country added up to 200 million square meters, he said.    To attract more foreign investors and to further expand  China's real estate market, about 60 mainstay real estate  companies across the country will be selected to take part in  the fair.    The fair will be sponsored jointly by the China Foreign  Trade  Center and a Real Estate Information Co. Ltd of the Ministry of  Construction.</p>

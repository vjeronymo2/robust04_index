			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 1, IRNA -- Majles Speaker Hojjat  ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri on Wednesday strongly criticized  the Saudi Government for its position towards Iran, accusing it  of complicity in various troubles in the region especially in  Yemeni crisis.    The Majles speaker also charged the Riyadh government with  inciting Iran's neighboring countries against Tehran under the  pretext of the three Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf.    The three Iranian islands of Abu Musa, Lesser Tunb and  Greater Tunb are of great importance to the people and  government of the Islamic Republic, he said.    "A nation who has defended its territory by dedicating  thousands of martyrs, will never back down on the issue and such  mischievous acts are undoubtedly not in the interest of Saudi  Arabia and other regional governments," Nateq-Nuri said at the  Majles.    It is not the first time that Saudi Arabia, because of its  wrong and illogical prejudices has taken position against Iran,  he said, adding that already Riyadh had taken the side of Iraq  during its 8 year war against Iran.    Commenting on the civil war and fratricide in Afghanistan,  the speaker said the conflict there had no justification but  incited by hegemonism and carnal desires.    He called on all the warring sides in Afghanistan to quit  hegemonism and try instead to unite and rebuild their war-torn  country.    Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri instructed the Foreign Ministry  to  follow up the issue of Afghanistan and do its best to end the  ongoing war and fratricide in that country.    Elsewhere in his speech, the speaker lashed out at  international circles particularly the U.N. and its secretary  general for their silence on Israel's recent kidnapping of  Mustafa Dirani from his home in Lebanon.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / A dearer year in Provence: For the British, holidays in France will cost a lot more Last September Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, a British businessman, agreed to buy a small property adjoining his holiday home in Provence. Though full payment did not have to be made until the end of this month, he decided to play safe by immediately converting enough money into francs to cover the purchase price. But he was too late. His instructions reached his London bank the day after Black Wednesday. After waiting in vain for sterling to rally, Mr O'Sullivan has finally decided to take out a short-term loan in francs - despite a swingeing 15 per cent interest rate - in the hope that a favourable change in exchange rates will enable him to pay it off some time in the future. Meanwhile, he is facing up to the painful prospect that his next French holiday will be a lot more expensive than his last one. 'Even when the pound was at FFr9.70, when you went to the supermarket you could round out the exchange rate and pretend it was actually worth FFr10,' he says. 'But now that it's at FFr8, you can't kid yourself any longer.' During the boom years of the late 1980s, tens of thousands of Britons decided to consummate a love affair with France by buying a bit of it. Many were attracted by low prices, as little as Pounds 25,000 for a cottage, though Mrs Philip Hawkes, an estate agent in Paris, says that of the 30 chateaux she sold in 1989, a third were to British purchasers. As these expatriate owners watch the pound sink on the foreign exchanges, they may be consoling themselves with the thought that devaluation has, at least, created a substantial capital gain on their investments. But they may be deprived even of that compensation. Mr Vivian Bridge of Northern France Properties estimates that the value of the type of rural property most favoured by British buyers has dropped by about 30 per cent in the past year, mostly since Black Wednesday. The number of sales has fallen by about 40 per cent. Mrs Sarah Francis of Sifex, another London-based agent, says the market has been particularly weak for properties worth between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 100,000. Many agents report a sharp rise in the number of expatriate owners seeking to sell. The problem is the British have come to dominate the market in many remote parts of the country, as the native population has moved to big cities. As a consequence, the best hope of selling is to another Briton. But of those who are still interested in buying, many are said to be holding back in the hope that the market will sink further, or the franc will be devalued. France has traditionally vied with Spain as the most popular foreign destination for British tourists since long before they started buying second homes there. According to the British Tourist Authority, 7.4m of them took holidays there in 1991. Though official figures are not yet available, some in the travel industry believe bookings in December for French holidays this summer were well down on the previous year. However, the picture is patchy. Gites de France, an organisation which rents French holiday cottages, says that though bookings from the UK were weak before Christmas, last month they were 7 per cent up on the previous year. French Country Cruises, which sells canal boat holidays in France, says summer bookings are similar to a year ago, but only because of one large group booking. It has raised prices by 15 per cent since Black Wednesday and is considering a further currency surcharge. P&amp;O European Ferries, the largest cross-Channel carrier, plans no increase in fares to France, though devaluation is forcing it to absorb sizeable cost increases. It hopes the pound's reduced purchasing power will not affect business too badly, arguing that even at the current exchange rate the average cost of food and lodging is lower in France than in Britain. By all accounts, sterling's weakness has not deterred Britons from taking advantage of the big increase since the start of the year in the value of the duty-paid purchases which they may legally bring back from other parts of the EC. At the Mammouth hypermarket in Calais, sales of alcoholic drinks to British customers was up 20 per cent last month. 'There are still a lot of bargains for the day tripper,' says Mr Bill Simpson of Courage, the brewing and retailing group, who visited Calais last weekend to see the competitive threat for himself. Anxieties on this score, along with the depressed state of the British economy, are likely to restrain price rises on French wine and spirits imports. 'I expect prices to move broadly in line with inflation, rather than make up for the devaluation,' says Mr Chris Banks, marketing director of JR Philips, a wine and spirits distributor. Though French wine prices rose by between 5 and 10 per cent after Black Wednesday, they face increasing competition from 'new world' producers in countries such as Australia and South Africa. 'Concern about losing market share is likely to ensure a cautious approach to any further increases,' says a spokeswoman for Oddbins, the UK retail chain. A similar line is being taken by champagne houses such as Bollinger, which has not raised UK prices for two years, and by French cognac producers, which saw their British sales fall 12 per cent last year. Remy Martin, one of the leading marques, says it has no price increases planned. Meanwhile, devaluation has prompted some British companies to capitalise on opportunities for import substitution. Northern Foods, Marks &amp; Spencer's biggest food supplier, is considering producing in the UK popular delicacies such as fromage frais, most of which is currently shipped in from France. Whether or not such plans lead to fewer French products being sold in Britain, stand by for more visits by the French themselves. The BTA's Paris office says inquiries through the Minitel electronic information system about holidays in Britain trebled to 75,000 last year. Mr Pierre Bergasse, deputy director, attributes some of the increase to the cheap pound. But he also concedes that another explanation may be that more people have discovered how to use Minitel.

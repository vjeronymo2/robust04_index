			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): Skinner on brink of huge power Pacific Gas and Electric's carefully laid plans for management succession called for Stanley Skinner, president and chief operating officer, to take over as chief executive a year from now, writes Louise Kehoe. Instead, Skinner will move into the top job at America's biggest power utility next month. By accelerating its plans, PG&amp;E aims to give its new chief executive a head start on what may be one of the most difficult periods in the history of the company as California moves to deregulate its electricity supply industry. Skinner, 56, will succeed Richard Clarke, 64, who will remain chairman of the board. 'The next few years will produce greater change than we have seen in the last 10 or 15 years combined,' says Clarke. A recent proposal by the independent California Public Utilities Commission aims to reduce electricity prices by creating a competitive market. The plan calls for all electricity users in the state, including residential customers, to be allowed to buy electricity from the supplier of their choice by the year 2002. It also establishes a streamlined, performance-based rate-setting system. PG&amp;E, which has long operated its electricity supply operations as a regulated monopoly in many parts of California, is about to go through the same kind of upheaval that has reshaped the US telecommunications industry over the past decade. Skinner will play a pioneering role in managing the transition to deregulation in the US electricity industry. California's plans for deregulation of energy utilities are advanced, and other states are expected to follow its lead.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES markets had one of their most successful sessions for many weeks, writes Terry Byland. The apparent restoration of President Yeltsin's authority brought a swift turnround in sentiment in UK equities and, with few institutions willing to sell either stock or futures, prices were squeezed sharply. With international tensions seemingly easier, traders turned attention to prospects for UK base rate cuts. The December contract on the Footsie opened firmly and soon restored the 39 point premium over cash not seen since the beginning of last week. Since the contract can at present be arbitraged at any premium of around 31 points, there was room yesterday for substantial trading between futures and stocks. Trading gathered pace at mid-session when the December contract broke through the 3,100 mark to reach 3,107 at the official close. With Fair Value premium now around 21, the contract was finally around 40 points premium to cash. However, turnover was less exciting at 11,724 contracts, a respectable figure but well below totals achieved on several days last week. Traded options activity jumped to 26,043 contracts, with the FT-SE contract at 11,137 against 7,207 on Friday. The Euro FT-SE headed the individual contracts list with 3,327 deals, Also active were Rolls-Royce at 1,214, Thames Water (1,110) and Shell (1,099).</p>

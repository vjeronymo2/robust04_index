			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / The tributes Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, paid the following personal tribute to Bob Mauthner yesterday: 'I was sad to hear of Bob Mauthner's death.  He gave shape to that ill-defined role of Diplomatic Editor, I was always impressed by his grasp of foreign policy and his ability to explain the issues clearly and objectively. Good journalism, produced with real knowledge and authority, helps people - policy makers as well as voters - understand and assess problems better. Bob was a highly distinguished journalist, and we shall miss him.' Hella Pick, president, Diplomatic and Commonwealth Writers' Association, associate foreign editor, The Guardian: 'I feel a very deep loss.  He was a loyal friend and good companion. I always envied his writing - I never knew anyone who could put so much into his first paragraphs that made so much sense.' Mr Stephen Somerville, director, Reuter Foundation: 'Reuters remembers Bob as one of the best-informed and most perceptive observers of the European scene, including during the 1960s when he achieved several notable scoops on political developments like Britain's efforts to join the Common Market.'</p>

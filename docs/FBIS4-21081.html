"Regional Operation 1994" was put into effect in the areas  with the greatest prevalence, including Sonora, Chihuahua,  Sinaloa, Durango, Nayarit, Jalisco, Michoacan, Guerrero, and  Oaxaca States. A total of 9,700 members of the armed institution  are participating.    This contingent is equipped with 250 field vehicles, 17  helicopters, and seven small Mexican Air Force planes, as well  as Army regulation weapons.    It also has special facilities for destroying plantations,  including defoliants, trained dogs, flame throwers and, in some  cases, tractors.    Furthermore, as the National Defense Secretariat reported,  the campaign is not limited to those states, but extends  throughout the country, because military personnel will be  conducting it in their zonal and regional jurisdictions.    One of the important features is the surveillance at  airports  and on the network of roads and highways. For this purpose, the  forces are backed by the Federal Judicial Police, whose mission  is to detect the drug traffickers' safe houses and activities in  all parts of the republic, so as to keep the military forces  informed of them.</p>

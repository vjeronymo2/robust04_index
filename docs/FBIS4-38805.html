			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at  1243 GMT on 1 June carries a three-minute telephone link-up with  Almaty correspondent Viktor Glukhovtsev.    Glukhovtsev notes that the Kazakhstan Supreme Council  session  scheduled for today did not take place and continues:    "This was a surprise, of course. Usually, the Supreme  Council has worked to schedule and met its timetable in a more  or less accurate way. And so, going through through the floors  of the massive building and knocking on the doors of the offices  where the deputies have settled, I ask the same question: Why?    "The answers are most abstract, basically a shrugging of the  shoulders and opaque hints about this having been prompted by  the Supreme Council's statement in which deputies voiced no  confidence in the social, economic and legal policy of the  government.    "One can't speak briefly about the origins of this document.  I will note only that there has been a drastic fall in  production in the republic; there is a precipitous fall in the  rate of exchange of the national currency, and, as a result  acute impoverishment of the population. And it is for this  reason that the Supreme Council is giving an unambigously  negative assessment of the present results of the actions of the  Council of Ministers which is presented with the serious  accusation that the government is essentially blocking its  declared course toward a market economy.    "In the view of the Supreme Soviet, this has led to economic  chaos and in such a situation it isn't difficult to understand  this reaction of the legislators. They saw, as the only way of  avoiding a paralysis of power, a dialogue between all its  branches in order to establish a national program of reforms and  to form a government capable of fulfilling it. That's what's  going on.    "It's clear that a response from the president, who is the  legal head of the executive authority and government in the  republic, should follow such a statement. So far there has been  no such response, and I think that it is for this reason that  the plenary session never took place today.    "Incidentally, in the office of one of the deputies I  received, on what we shall call a confidential basis,  confirmation of this conclusion.    "Today, a document has today is being circulated amongst the  deputies on behalf of a number of deputies' groups and factions  which says, I quote: After the adoption of the statement, the  coordinating council at its meeting, in violation of the  provisional statute, postponed the next plenary session,  allegedly on the grounds of its lack of preparation. We  consider this to be an attempt to repudiate the busineslike  spirit of the statement and to turn it into an empty,  non-binding declaration. And it appears that the hope has not  been lost to turn the Supreme Council into an obedient tool of  executive authority and into an administrative and legal  department attached to the cabinet of ministers and the  president. End quote."</p>

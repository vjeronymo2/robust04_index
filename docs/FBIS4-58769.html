			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Riyadh, May 8, SPA--The fifth session of the  joint ministerial council of the Gulf Cooperation Council and  the European Union (EU) started here on Sunday [8 May] under the  co-chairmanship of Prince Al Sa'ud al-Faysal, the Saudi foreign  minister and Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, the head  of the EU Ministerial Council. [passage omitted]    Prince Al Sa'ud told the participants that after three years  of Kuwait's liberation, the Iraqi regime continues to delay  implementation of basic elements of the Security Council  resolutions pertaining to its aggression on Kuwait. And the  Iraqi regime continues to deal selectively with its obligations  towards the resolutions of the international legality which  constitute a unified package.    "At a time when the Iraqi regime concentrates efforts to  show  some cooperation with the U.N. inspectors of weapons of the mass  destruction in an attempt to give an impression of a limited  kind of response to some demands of the Security Council  resolutions as justification for lifting economic sanctions  imposed on it, it is important to recall that the core of the  conflict is the Iraqi regime's non-respect for the sovereignty  and independence of Kuwait, which constitutes the core of the  resolutions of the international legality. Moreover, the Iraqi  regime continues to oppose Resolution 833 on the recognition of  international borders' demarcation," Prince Al Sa'ud said.    Prince Al Sa'ud regretted that the Iraqi regime is still  detaining the Kuwaiti prisoners of war and captives of other  nationals and refraining from paying legal compensations for  damages caused by its aggression.    "The only possible and open way to confront the dangers  posed  by this regime is to bring about full and comprehensive  compliance of the resolutions of the Security Council," the  Saudi foreign minister said.    Prince Al Sa'ud expressed deep anxiety over the sufferings  of  the brotherly Iraqi people triggered by the oppressive practices  of the Iraqi regime and expressed full sympathy with them.    He demanded that the Iraqi regime should comply with the  Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712 dealing with the  humanitarian, food and medicines needs of the Iraqi people and  held the Iraqi regime fully responsible for the humanitarian  plight sustained by the Iraqi people.    Concerning relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran,  Prince Al Sa'ud made it clear that the GCC states have a keen  interest to maintain peace and stability in the Gulf region and  ensure guarantees of navigation in the Gulf. "We are always  working for the realisation of cordial and constructive  relations with Iran based on good neighbourly ties, mutual  respect and non-intervention in the domestic affairs, respect  for the sovereignty and independence of all states and their  territorial integration.    "While, we hear of the statements of the Iranian officials  on  a similar desire for developing cordial relations with us, yet  we hope that such statements would be accompanied with practical  policies to harmonize such a desire into reality. And, in this  context, we notice with grave deploration the continuation of  the conflict between the United Arab Emirates [UAE] and Iran on  the three Emirate islands. And it is hoped that the welfare  initiative offered by the UAE's President Sheykh Zayid  Bin-Sultan Al-Nuhayyan for settling the issue of the three  islands through direct talks would be [word indistinct] to cut  short his visit and return to the kingdom to remain under orders  of custodian of the two holy mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al'Aziz  and Crown Prince 'Abdallah Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, who are engaged in  continuous contacts with their Arab colleagues to save Yemen  from the crisis.    He called on the Yemeni brothers to come together and  resolve  their problems with amicable and peaceful means.</p>

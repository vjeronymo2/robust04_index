No. 36&hyph;03636) located in Cambria County, Pennsylvania. Due to the size of the electric golf carts used in the primary escapeway and the relative size of fire suppression systems, these golf carts would not be able to operate satisfactorily with such a system. The petitioner proposes to construct the golf carts of fire-resistant material, protect the battery/motor circuit by a fuse, perform all battery charging on the surface, and provide all golf carts with a multipurpose dry chemical fire extinguisher. Petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 6.

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Observer: Leave it out Today's celebration of the construction of the Channel tunnel would not be complete without an unseemly squabble about how best to celebrate. Observer hears that the contractors had been given the green light to hire a train to take a party of revellers (including British Rail chairman Sir Bob Reid) non-stop from Victoria to the partying on the French side. All seemed to be going swimmingly at first. BR's InterCity had promised a luxury express and was confident that its driver could find his way through the tunnel. However, when the powers that be at BR heard what was happening, word came back down the line that the revellers would have to make an unscheduled stop at Folkestone and change trains. There are no technical reasons for the disruption. Probably something to do with the wrong sort of publicity, rather than the wrong sort of snow.</p>

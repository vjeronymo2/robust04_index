Convention on the  Law of the Sea goes into effect, a Foreign Ministry official  said Friday.    He said, "After the convention takes effect this coming  November, those countries which have been registered as pioneer  investors at the United Nations hold prior rights to developing  the seabed."    The government held an economic ministers' meeting late last  year to discuss the issue and sent the application to the United  Nations on Jan. 14.    "This application is to secure a mining area in the deep  seabed development system of advanced nations including Japan  and France," he said.    The area, called "the Clarion Clipperton fracture," holds  deposits of about 40 billion tons of manganese, about 50 times  as much as the estimated deposits of the element under the  continents, and various natural resources including cobalt,  copper and nickel.    The area is between longitude 124 and 138 degrees west and  between latitude 9 and 18 degrees north, according to Ministry  officials.    The U.N. technical experts' group will review the South  Korean application and then the U.N. preparation committee is  expected to register South Korea's rights as a pioneer investor  around August.    South Korea has invested about 45 million U.S. dollars in  exploring for promising seabed areas over the last 10 years, the  officials said.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Stora slips into red with SKr1.4bn loss for year STORA, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, has announced a preliminary loss of SKr1.4bn (Dollars 152m) for 1992. It is worse than expected and a turnround from last year's SKr1.1bn profit. Stora blamed excess capacity, lower prices for important products, a slowdown in Europe and the weak dollar. The group said an operating loss of SKr900m was aggravated by SKr800m in extraordinary costs to cover restructuring. Offsetting this were SKr300m in capital gains following the disposal of a power distribution unit and a packaging company in Thailand. Prices fell for most products in the paper and cartonboard sectors during 1992 although deliveries to European markets rose by 2 per cent. The figures indicate the group made an operating loss of more than SKr500m in the final four months, following the SKr380m loss in the first eight months. Analysts believe the group may cut its dividend, which was SKr13 for 1991, when it announces 1992 figures in March. Stora did not give a 1993 profit forecast, but indicated that conditions remained difficult. The group is likely to return to the black following the November devaluation of the Swedish krona. However, overcapacity, depressed prices, and a downturn in Germany will offset much of the benefit. Analysts expect a profit of SKr100m-SKr1bn for 1993.</p>

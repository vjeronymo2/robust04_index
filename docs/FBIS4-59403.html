			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" article by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Syrian Queries </F> About Depth and Scale of Withdrawal From Golan"]    [Text] Damascus -- Although the Israeli proposals which  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher conveyed to President  Hafiz al-Asad did not satisfy Syria, because they do not contain  the basic "magic word," namely agreement to withdraw completely  from the Syrian Golan Heights, the Israelis' announcement of  their willingness to withdraw from a part of the Golan and to  dismantle settlements there is in itself an Israeli  acknowledgment that the land over which the two sides are  negotiating is a Syrian territory, part of which can be  subjected to the security arrangements and most of which can be  returned to Syria. It also means a change in the Israeli  language in general -- a change that is not encountering a  Syrian rejection, but, rather, reservations about applying the  return [al-i'adah] principle to all the land, not just part of  it.    High-level Syrian sources told AL-HAYAH that the Israeli  proposals conveyed to Damascus "did not respond to the basic  principle in the peace process, that is, the complete withdrawal  from the Golan." The proposals contained Israel's willingness  to withdraw from three Syrian villages -- namely Majdal Shams,  Buq'ata, and Sa'dah -- under a three-phase withdrawal plan over  eight years, with "minor changes to the border" between the two  sides, in order to "guarantee Israeli security." This is in  addition to addressing the question of "joint management" of  water in the Golan, which concentrates in the southern part of  the Golan, feeding Lake Tiberias, the source of the River  Jordan. Water in that area is estimated at 320 cubic meters.    The sources told AL-HAYAH that the Israeli proposals include  the proposal for Syria to begin to take confidence-building  measures during the first withdrawal phase under the "Majdal  Shams First" plan, on the basis of which the depth of the  withdrawal and arrangements for the remaining two phases --  which include "dismantling settlements in the Golan," especially  northern settlements, which already have no settlers in them --  would be determined. The sources did not rule out that the  Israelis may have asked to open a tourist office in Damascus in  the first phase to transport tourists between the two sides.  All this -- so the Israelis believe -- would "test Syrian  intentions."    But the Syrian sources stress that the ones whose intentions  should be tested are those occupying others' land, "not the  owners of the rights and land. They (the Israelis) are  requested to prove their good intentions by complying with the  complete withdrawal from the occupied Golan, that is, within the  framework of a comprehensive solution." The sources add that  Syria's view of a comprehensive solution does not mean that all  tracks advance "at the same speed. One track may advance more  than another in terms of time, but the solution must be  comprehensive in the end."    The sources point out that Christopher did not take to Syria  an Israeli "plan or note," but Israeli ideas about "the Israeli  view of peace on the Syrian track." And the Syrian side  submitted "queries and questions" about these proposals, in  addition to "precise ideas about Syria's view of the peaceful  solution." The sources say that the Syrian questions focus on  two basic points: withdrawal and the timetable, saying that the  Israelis must agree to withdraw completely from the Golan in the  framework of a comprehensive settlement, provided the withdrawal  is completed in "a short period," not eight years as announced  in Tel Aviv. It should be conducted in accordance with the  "logistic requirements" for this withdrawal, that is in addition  to the complete dismantling of the settlements.    The sources point out that the Syrian demand regarding the  priority of withdrawal centers on the peace process' essence,  namely the "land for peace" principle and implementation of  Resolutions 242 and 338 stipulating "withdrawal" from the  occupied territory. "Besides, the U.S. initiative did not say  part of the land in return for peace." The sources add that  when the Israelis utter the "magic word" (full withdrawal), the  door would be opened to both sides to discuss "the security  arrangements." The sources stress that these arrangements must  be equal on both sides of the border, including the  establishment of a demilitarized zone and another thinly armed  [mukhaffafat al-taslih] zone, in addition to electronic early  warning systems, not just on the Syrian side of the border as  the Israelis are trying to dictate.    The sources point out that the Israeli side is trying to  "drown the negotiations in a discussion of detailed questions  like normalization, opening of the border, trade relations, and  security arrangements, without even beginning to agree to full  withdrawal" -- which is unacceptable to Syria. This is in the  knowledge that Syria has emphasized its willingness to address  these matters, "but after complete withdrawal."    As for the "Majdal Shams First" plan, the sources say that  Syria "is not (Palestinian President Yasir) 'Arafat, and Majdal  Shams is not Gaza and Jericho." Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'  described this plan as "absurd," as Syria rejects any phased  solution.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Developing eastern Europe's capital markets / A look at EBRD's proposals to assist and advise new borrowers STATE and corporate borrowers in eastern Europe may soon find it easier to raise funds in the international and domestic capital markets. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the London-based international institution set up to help with the economic and political regeneration of eastern Europe, is currently working on plans to develop the eastern European capital markets, both by bringing eastern European state and corporate borrowers to the international markets and by promoting the development of the domestic capital markets in the region. While countries such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia are no strangers to the international financial markets, having launched several public bond issues already, the EBRD hopes to advise other eastern European countries in their use of the capital markets. The main areas where the EBRD sees scope for helping eastern European borrowers are as follows: To guarantee and underwrite international bonds issues so that certain eastern European state and corporate borrowers may tap the international capital markets for the first time. Although Hungary and Czechoslovakia have launched public bonds in the international capital markets in a range of currencies, they are considered high-risk borrowers and therefore have to pay substantial margins in the order of 200 to 300 basis points over the respective benchmark government bonds. In addition, as poor credits they are often confined to borrowing short-term. For example, in November Czechoslovakia launched a Dollars 200m bond in the name of Statni Banka, the Central Bank. The three-year bonds were priced to yield 300 basis points over the comparable US government securities, but are now trading at about 340 basis points over the benchmark. However, other eastern European borrowers are unable to issue bonds in the international capital market at all because they are considered to be poor credit risks by investors. So the EBRD is currently discussing the possibility of guaranteeing and underwriting bond issues by such eastern European borrowers over the next few months. Mr Anders Ljungh, EBRD finance vice-president, points out this would allow eastern European countries to borrow at a lower margin than when Hungary and Czechoslovakia tapped the international bond markets. For those borrowers which have not tapped the international capital markets already, such an arrangement could help to introduce them to the international markets. 'We're there to assist them by bringing them to the international market,' said Mr Ljungh. 'Our role would be an interim one because we want them to develop their own strength and so we would simply be helping them to take their own steps in the market, borrowing for specific projects.' In other words, once investors were familiar with the borrowers, the EBRD would not be required to provide its guarantee. Eastern European borrowers would have to pay the EBRD for carrying the risk, though probably not on purely commercial terms. 'Our charge, or risk premium, for providing the guarantee might differ from what a commercial bank would charge,' said Mr Ljungh, adding that the EBRD has not started to discuss the exact costs yet. At present, eastern European borrowers can only reduce their borrowing costs on short-term credits by using short-term trade insurance. Some dealers at US securities houses believe that even with the EBRD's guarantee, investors might still be reluctant to buy eastern European bonds unless the deal were to be attractively priced. 'It would probably make more sense for the EBRD to borrow in its own name, taking advantage of its triple A rating to raise funds cheaply, and then simply lend the money to the eastern European borrower,' said one dealer. In fact the EBRD already does this, borrowing in its own name in the international bond markets and lending the money for projects in eastern Europe. However, it has not yet had a hand in guaranteeing any of the eastern European bond issues launched so far and feels it could play a useful role by introducing borrowers to the market in this way. To help eastern European countries manage the foreign exchange risk associated with existing debts. The EBRD hopes to help eastern European borrowers swap their debts into a currency matching their income stream. For example, if an eastern European company has borrowed in yen but is selling its products in US dollars, it faces an exchange rate risk. The borrower may not be able to swap the debt into dollars because in the international markets it may be considered an unacceptable credit risk. However, the EBRD believes that with its own triple A rating it can help by taking on the counterparty risk, thereby helping the borrowing company to swap its debt into a suitable currency. 'This kind of debt management will become much more important,' said Mr Ljungh, adding that while the EBRD will help the borrower to avoid currency risk, the bank's charges to the borrower are likely to be on a similar scale to those in the international swaps market. In addition, the EBRD said it is willing to finance projects in a currency which matches the borrowing company's income, as well as offering the possibility of switching between floating rate and fixed rate loans. This might enable eastern European companies to borrow in the same currency as that in which they are paid - something which is not always possible from the export credit agencies. It would also allow the borrowing company to switch from floating rate borrowing to fixed rate borrowing if it believes that interest rates have reached a low. To help with the development of domestic bond markets. The EBRD wants to be able to issue bonds in the domestic markets so that it can fund projects in local currency. At present, only Hungary has a well-developed domestic bond market. McDonald's, the US fast-food chain, has tapped the Hungarian bond market with a Ft400m issue, making it the first foreign or privately owned company to raise money in the Hungarian domestic bond market since the Second World War. The issue was a private placement and was bought by a handful of Hungarian investors. Now, other eastern European countries are studying how to set up domestic bond markets. The EBRD hopes to play an important role in establishing liquid money and bond markets, by offering training for staff, providing technical equipment and advice on how to set up market-makers.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State lists the 10 moderate ozone nonattainment areas where these regulations shall apply. The State has removed several of the exemption provisions and is allowing sources which were previously exempt, 1 year from the rules' effective date (i.e. by April 27, 1994) to achieve compliance with these rules. Examples of these sources would be those that were not covered by the previous rules because the rules did not apply in that area. April 19, 1990 is the date by which other sources must achieve compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> N.

Reflux condensers that are essential to the operation of the resin reactor are not considered to be control equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The total VOCs emitted to the atmosphere from the reactors, thinning tanks, and blending tanks do not exceed 0.5 pounds per 1,000 pounds of completed organic resin produced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notwithstanding the preceding requirement, the State requires the Monsanto Company of Trenton to comply with either of the following provisions for its reactors, thinning tanks, and blending tanks:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) All VOCs emitted from reactors, thinning tanks, and blending tanks shall be vented to control equipment that is designed and operated to reduce the quantity of VOCs by not less than 95 weight percent. Reflux condensers that are essential to the operation of the resin reactor are not considered to be control equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The total VOCs emitted to the atmosphere from the reactors, thinning tanks, and blending tanks do not exceed 2.6 pounds per 1,000 pounds of dry organic resin produced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State has altered the recordkeeping requirement to now be mandatory for all sources subject to this rule. The recordkeeping requirements are effective 3 months after the effective date of this rule. The records which need to be kept will vary depending upon the fashion in which a source chooses to control the VOC emissions and may include any of the following information:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Emissions test data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Material balance calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Process production rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Control equipment specifications and operating parameters.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State has revised one of the provisions to read,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A person may discontinue the operation of a natural gas-fired afterburner, which is used to achieve compliance with the emission limits in this rule, between November 1 and March 31 unless the afterburner is used to achieve compliance with, or is required by, any of the following:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Any other provision of these rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A permit to install.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) A permit to operate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) A voluntary agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) A performance contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) A stipulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) An order of the commission. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If the operation of a natural gas-fired afterburner is discontinued between November 1 and March 31 pursuant to the provisions of the preceding provision, both of the following shall apply during this time period:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) All other provisions of this rule, except the emission limits, shall remain in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) All other measures that are used to comply with the emission limits in this rule between April 1 and October 31 shall continue to be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

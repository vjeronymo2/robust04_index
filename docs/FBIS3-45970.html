Balladur warmly welcomed Qian and said: "We are very glad to  see that the Sino-French relationship has entered a new era.  The relationship is based on mutual respect, equality, mutual  benefit and full confidence.    "We should strengthen our consultations on major  international issues, cooperation in economic trade and  exchanges in culture and education, so as to further enhance  Sino-French relations," he added.    Qian conveyed Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng's sincere  greetings and respect to Balladur and said Li is looking forward  to Balladur's visit to China in the near future.    Qian added that Balladur's visit, a major event in  Sino-French relations, will promote the improvement and  development of mutual beneficial trade relations between the two  countries.    "We hope to see that French enterprises will enhance  competitive ability and take their proper share of China's  market," he added.    Qian noted that this year marks the 30th anniversary of the  establishment of Sino-French diplomatic relations. In 1964, the  two countries set up diplomatic ties under the personal guidance  of the then French President General Charles de Gaulle, Chinese  Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai.    "Under the current international circumstances, as states  assuming important responsibilities in international affairs,  China and France should maintain good relations as a factor to  retain balance and stability in the world," Qian said.    Qian spoke highly about Balladur's efforts to improve  Sino-French relations.    He stressed that China has been consistently treasuring its  relationship with France and agrees to fully improve and enhance  the traditional and friendly cooperative relations between the  two countries. "It is beneficial to both of us and the world,"  he added.    "As long as the both sides are farsighted, Sino-French ties  will surely move forward steadily for a long time," he said.    During the meeting, Balladur said that on the occasion of  the  30th anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-French ties,  the French Government decided to dispatch a major delegation to  visit China with two aims -- to join the celebration activities  and to make preparations for Balladur's visit to China.    "We hope that both sides will make common efforts to push  forward Sino-French relations and contribute to peace, stability  and development of the world," he added.    After the meeting, Balladur asked Qian to convey his sincere  greetings and best wishes to Prime Minister Li Peng.</p>

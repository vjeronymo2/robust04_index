			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Rotar, under the rubric "Opinion": "Russian </F> Neoimperialism--Are the Capital Democrats Planning a `Dash to  the South'?"]    [Text] The position of official Moscow concerning policy in  the near abroad changed sharply almost immediately after the  October events of last year. What before had been done secretly  is now announced openly. Thus, in the new Russian military  doctrine the near abroad is declared a zone of vital interests  of the former mother country.    The change in theoretical declarations goes along with  practical successes. The entry of Georgia into the CIS and its  consent to the stationing of Russian troops in its territory  seems like just the first symptom of Moscow's triumphant march  into the near abroad. Thus, in the opinion of Abdudzhalil  Samadov, prime minister of Tajikistan, at the completion of the  term of the presence of Russian troops in his country (December  1994) they will most likely form the basis for creation of a  Russian military base, and a similar agreement is supposed to be  reached with Armenia in the near future.    As our NG [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] reporter was told in circles  close to the leadership of the Dniester Republic, in talks with  Chisinau Moscow is insisting on conversion of the 14th Russian  Army, which is stationed in this region, into a military base of  the former mother country. Aleksandr Lebed, commanding officer  of the 14th Army and an implacable foe of Tiraspol, agrees with  this point of view: "It is not necessary to resort to blatant  force to convince Chisinau of the need to form a Russian  military base on the basis of our army; economic sanctions are  enough."    The views of Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the RF State  Duma committee on CIS affairs and ties with countrymen and  member of the "Shakhrai party" PRES [Party of Russian Unity and  Accord], are much more radical.    It is instructive that Zatulin, as a member of Shakhrai's  party, belongs more to the democratic camp than to the  national-patriotic bloc. PRES today, with two representatives  who are vice premiers, occupies key positions in the Russian  Government.    These views are also quite close to the RF MID [Ministry of  Foreign Affairs]. Thus, in conversation with an NG reporter  Vadim Kuznetsov, director of the MID Department of CIS Affairs,  said that the goals of the corresponding Duma committee and his  department are identical and they are developing constructive  relations with Zatulin. It is another matter that the RF MID is  sometimes accused of being too soft. For example, in Zatulin's  opinion, Russia should use economic levers to defend the  Russian-speaking population in the near abroad. Although  Kuznetsov generally agrees with this position, he thinks the  Russia should also show flexibility.    The department director said that Russia has its own vital  interests, and naturally they are above all in the countries of  the near abroad. The main task of Russian diplomacy in the near  abroad is defense of the Russian-speaking population. "We are  now saying directly that we will defend our interests on the  basis of the precepts of international law," the Russian  diplomat stressed.    The position of the RF MID in relation to the separatist  regions (the Dniester Republic, Abkhazia, and Nagornyy Karabakh)  is analogous. In Kuznetsov's opinion, Russia is guided in these  regions by two fundamental and equally weighted principles:  "Preservation of the territorial integrity of the corresponding  states and granting of broad rights to ethnic formations within  the framework of these states on the basis of a formula that  should be worked out by political means."    It is true that, unlike the chairman of the Duma committee,  the Russian diplomats uphold this formula only in the  above-mentioned conflict regions: "Application of this principle  in other territories is plainly going too far and could provoke  new conflicts."    It is instructive that the Russian radical democrats too  agree with the idea of restoring something like the Russian  empire. In the opinion of Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the  Council of the Federation, the CIS has demonstrated its  ineffectiveness. As the chairman of the upper house of the  Russian Parliament believes, it would be wise to establish a  closer union of several states of the former Soviet Union to  which the other countries of the near abroad would be joined  after a time.    Although there are many differences among the positions of  the Russian political parties in relation to the near abroad,  they are still fundamentally similar because they proclaim the  near abroad to be a zone of vital Russian interests and view  Moscow as the natural, realistic defender of ethnic minorities  in the new independent states. The "softness" of the positions  of official Moscow can hardly create any illusions--the  imperialist views of the moderates were also preceded by a  period of anticolonial declarations, but an analysis of the  metamorphosis of Russian policy in the near abroad allows us to  assume that a sharp turn to the right is just a matter of time.    It appears that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is right (IZVESTIYA,  27  April 1994): "Two and one-half years ago I ran in the  presidential elections with the slogan, 'I will defend Russians  and small peoples.' I was called a chauvinist then. But now even  Kozyrev is defending (in words for now) the Russians in the  Baltic region. Where are the democratic Russians with their  universal human values now? Where is the Russian democratic  appeal to the regions, 'Take as much sovereignty as you can  carry'? It is unseemly even to recall that."    So it is not impossible that the idea of a "final dash to  the  south" may become the foundation of state policy, even if the  national patriots are unable to achieve the fall of the present  regime.</p>

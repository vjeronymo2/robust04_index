			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US technology bill clears hurdle - House-Senate conference to find compromise after Republican filibuster Controversial US legislation to speed the development of new manufacturing technologies and an 'information superhighway' looked set yesterday to be sent to a House-Senate conference for a compromise to be thrashed out. A week-long Republican filibuster in the Senate forced Democrats to slash funding for the measure from Dollars 2.8bn to Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.3bn). The House passed similar legislation last year; the differences between the two versions are expected to be resolved and a final bill passed by both houses before the end of this year. Democratic Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the Senate commerce committee, said the legislation would help US companies face competition in technology. 'It allows the government, our universities and our industries to work together in a partnership to support research for small and medium-sized manufacturers and technology firms,' he said. The legislation expands a smaller initiative approved during the Bush administration. It would also: raise from seven to 14 the number of manufacturing technology centres where government and universities provide advice to businesses, and add a number of small centres. provide Dollars 451m for the advanced technology programme, a scheme which provides research grants to businesses developing technologies of broad economic value. upgrade the government's high-performance computing and networking programme for the creation of a national information infrastructure. direct government agencies to work with computer companies and users to research advanced applications for education, healthcare, manufacturing and information. authorise a pilot programme to stimulate investment in technology companies. Although US business groups have long sought government financing for generic technologies, many Republicans oppose such measures on the grounds that they constitute an 'industrial policy' giving the power 'to pick winners and losers'. The leading opponent, Senator John Danforth, a Missouri Republican, used the filibuster to demand that the Clinton administration reopen negotiations in the Uruguay Round on a subsidies agreement pact which legitimised but also limited R&amp;D aid. He is proposing instead of subsidies a permanent R&amp;D tax credit. Congressional Democrats said privately that Republicans were trying to deny a victory to President Bill Clinton, who strongly supports such technology development programmes. 'They didn't want the money to get to the Commerce Department for use as a slush fund to buy the 1996 election,' said one Democrat. Particularly they do not want it to go to the energetic Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary and former chairman of the Democratic party, who is gaining many adherents in business. While the legislation increases government aid to industry, it is still less than 2 per cent of the Dollars 70bn the US spends on R&amp;D. About Dollars 40bn of that goes to the military.</p>

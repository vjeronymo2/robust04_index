			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Books: Drama during the Protectorate - As theatre was banned political pamphlets took an expressive turn, Anthony Curtis discovers LITERATURE &amp; REVOLUTION IN ENGLAND, 1640-1660 by Nigel Smith Yale University Press Pounds 30, 425 pages A new book full of fascinating information about that violent period from the beginning of the Long Parliament to the Restoration of the monarchy helps us to see how much truth and how much legend there is in the received wisdom about the English civil war and its effect on ordinary life. Undoubtedly there was irreversible destruction in many areas. The one with which Nigel Smith, Oxford fellow in English at Keble College, is concerned is literature. After the regicide, old rhetorical forms and genres of writing were radically undermined. Smith demonstrates how they then became adapted and reconstituted to meet the changing needs of the times right across the board - in drama, history, fiction, political theory, epic and lyric poetry. The fate of the drama is a striking example of this process: the London theatres were gradually dismantled by the Puritans, as were other places of public entertainment such as the bear-gardens. But plays continued to be published and even to be privately performed in country houses or in exile. While the clamp-down on public theatre remained unrelenting for the whole of the Protectorate, drama re-surfaced in other areas. Its spirit energised related forms such as the political pamphlet whose writers used dramatic scenarios to present highly 'sensitive' political material. In 1648, for instance, there appeared a polemical tract written in the form of a play entitled Craftie Cromwell. The emergent Oliver appears in it as a stage Machiavelli. The King was then a prisoner. The Levellers were aiming to abolish Parliament. In such a confused time the appropriate genre, the pamphlet's authors considered, was low comedy rather than high tragedy. 'Smooth Plautus, Aristophanes his vein/ We now affect, not Sophocles high streine', they explained. One of the authors was Marchmont Nedham, a prolific writer active in the publications that now sprang up to supply information about the progress of the civil war. These Newsbooks were the forerunners of the modern newspaper. They came out daily with a date-line, and contained both news and rudimentary editorial comment. In an age when classical erudition was taken for granted Mercury, winged messenger of the gods, became their emblem, hence Mercurius Aulicus, Mercurius Britanicus, and many more similar titles  -emanating first from the parliamentary side, and then in reprisal from the royalist, each Newsbook heavily slanting the news according to its allegiances. The hard-worked writers combined production of them with other occupations. Nedham and his rival Sir John Berkenhead were both gentlemen; Henry Walker was an ironmonger and church minister; John Dillingham an innkeeper and tailor; towards the end of the period we have in one Samuel Pecke, newswriter, an example of a full-time journalist. The old classical models remained precariously in place and were made to serve as mirrors and metaphors in innumerable ways. When Cromwell returned from Ireland, Andrew Marvell celebrated the event in An Horatian Ode famous for its ambiguities. Who is the real hero - Cromwell or 'the royal actor' who on the day of his execution 'nothing common did or mean/ Upon that memorable scene'? Smith exonerates Marvell from fence-sitting and suggests that the double meanings are 'replications of the tensions which are necessary to the life of republics'. Even a seemingly innocent bucolic text like Izaak Walton's The Compleat Angler does not escape this writer's perceptions of hidden meanings. Walton was an unrepentant royalist whose complete Angler is also a complete Anglican. Angling is analogous to ministry, fishing to preaching - 'the unusual oscillation of genres . . . relocate the national crisis in a natural landscape'. Whether dealing with gallant love-lyrics by Herrick or Lovelace or with a major work of the order of Hobbes's Leviathan or Paradise Lost, Smith shows the same sensitivity to inner tensions and topical resonances. He has done a signal service to all students of this watershed period.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Simon Ladera, head of the Union of Small </F> Transportation Vans and Buses of Venezuela, by "180 Minutes of  News" reporter Maria Acorte at union headquarters in Caracas;  from the "Union Radio News" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Acorte] What is your opinion of the transportation  strike so far? Did the bus lines you called to strike respond?    [Ladera] Up until now, all bus lines affiliated with the  union have complied with the union mandate. One must  acknowledge when the workers are right. We have said that the  government owes us money and that the government has to pay.    [Acorte] What is the amount the national government must pay  for the special student bus rates?    [Ladera] The government owes us 300 million bolivars. It  owes the rest of the nation's transportation sector  approximately 3 billion bolivars. This amount was due by May.  By July the subsidization system should be changed. It is sad  that the deputy transportation and communications ministers say  there is corruption [words indistinct]. One asks: How can there  be corruption on the outside without corruption on the inside?  So, to avoid this problem, and for the students and  transportation workers to be happy, we should change the  subsidization system that expires on 31 July.    [Acorte] Last night, in a news conference, Foreign Relations  Minister Ramon Escovar Salom, national government spokesman,  announced the government already has enough funds to pay the  money owed for the special student bus rate -- the subsidy. Did  you receive any notice to suspend the strike?    [Ladera] We have not received any notice. I also heard the  foreign minister. I also want to say publicly that this strike  is not fostered by any political motive. I know Dr. Caldera  very well. I am a great admirer of Dr. Caldera. Therefore,  there is no political issue here; this is not what is prompting  this action. We are motivated by a desire to avoid problems in  today's Venezuela.    I also want to tell the students that their bus rate will  not  change and that we will not refuse them transportation,  regardless of whether or not the government pays us. Therefore,  the students do not have to protest, because the student bus  rate has not....[pauses] If there are irregularities, if a  driver refuses to transport a student, please report him.  However, we do not want to give the impression that we are  protesting because of the special student bus rate.    [Acorte] In your opinion, what is needed to end the strike?  Would it be the cash payment of the money owed, or would you  accept government vouchers?    [Ladera] We are not going to accept vouchers. If the  government has the money, it should pay the workers, either by  check or in cash, whichever it prefers. We can accept the  payment in installments -- whatever the government wants. No  matter what, we want our payment.</p>

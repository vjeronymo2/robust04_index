(70&hyph;8068)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Penn Fuel Gas, Inc., (``PFG''), 55 South Third Street, Oxford, Pennsylvania, 19363, a Pennsylvania holding company exempt from registration under section 3(a)(1) of the Act pursuant to rule 2, and Carol Ware Gates, Oxford, Pennsylvania, Marilyn Ware Lewis, Strasburg, Pennsylvania, John H. Ware, IV, Oxford, Pennsylvania, and Paul W. Ware, Strasburg, Pennsylvania (collectively, ``Ware siblings'') have filed an application under sections 9(a)(2) and 10 of the Act in connection with acquisitions of common shares of PFG and related transactions, pursuant to certain trust and voting agreements. Applicants also request an order under section 3(a)(1) exempting PFG from all provisions of the Act, except section 9(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PFG, through eight wholly owned Pennsylvania gas utility subsidiary companies, provides gas utility service to approximately 65,725 customers, 99.7% of which are located in Pennsylvania. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  PFG has outstanding 717,583 shares of its common stock, par value $1.00 per share (``PFG Common Stock''), of which John H. Ware, III and his wife Marian S. Ware own 572,847.25 shares. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The utility subsidiaries are Allied Gas Company, Central Penn Gas Company, Counties Gas Company, Interboro Gas Company, Lewistown Gas Company, Union Gas Company, North Penn Gas Company and South Penn Gas Company (``South Penn'') (collectively, ``PFG system companies''). South Penn is the only company that engages in gas operations outside of Pennsylvania. In addition to its customers in that state, South Penn serves 230 customers in Frederick County, Maryland. Its Maryland utility assets represent 4.4% of South Penn's total net utility property, plant and equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the twelve months ended June 30, 1993, South Penn had non-Pennsylvania operating revenues of $433,748, representing 3.3% of its total operating revenues, and net operating income from non-Pennsylvania sales of approximately $40,000. During that period, 0.4% of the total volume of gas sold by PFG system companies was sold to customers outside of Pennsylvania; the system obtained less than 1% of its gas utility gross operating revenues and net gas utility income from sales to customers outside of Pennsylvania; and the system had $544,316 or 0.4%, of its net utility property, plant and equipment located outside of Pennsylvania.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Ware siblings, in their individual capacity, each own less than 5% of the PFG Common Stock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> John and Marian Ware have established sixteen  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter vivos  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> trusts (``Trusts'') for the benefit of their four children and their issue. The Trusts are grouped into four interest groups (``Trust Groups''). Each Trust Group contains four Trusts, each of which benefits one of the four Ware siblings and his or her issue. Each Trust has its situs in Pennsylvania and has two trustees: CoreStates Bank, N.A. (``CoreStates''), a national banking association, as corporate trustee, and the Ware sibling for whose principal benefit the trust has been established, as individual trustee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon the granting of the requested order, applicants state that John and Marian Ware, or their respective estates, will make gifts of PFG Common Stock to at least one of the Trusts in each Trust Group in amounts which will result, initially, in each individual trustee having (in conjunction with CoreStates as corporate trustee) power to vote more than 5%, but less than 10%, of the PFG Common Stock. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Applicants anticipate that John and Marian Ware will ultimately transfer, by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter vivos  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> or testamentary disposition, a sufficient number of shares to each Trust Group so that each individual trustee will have (in conjunction with CoreStates as corporate trustee) power to vote more than 10% of the PFG Common Stock. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the terms of each Trust, the concurrence of the corporate trustee and the individual trustee is necessary to vote the shares of PFG Common Stock held by the Trust. Under the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, however, if the trustees disagree on how to vote the PFG Common Stock and, thereafter, only one of the trustees attends the shareholder meeting at which the vote is to be taken, PFG is generally required to recognize the action of the attending trustee as the action of both trustees. Each trustee thus has the potential power to vote all of the shares of PFG Common Stock held by the Trust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The applicants state that all of the shares of PFG Common Stock that are now held or may hereafter be acquired by the Trusts, the trustees and the Ware siblings in their individual capacities are subject to restrictions on transfer by a Shareholder's Agreement dated November 19, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

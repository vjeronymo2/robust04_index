			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wojciech Zaluska: "You Shall Return; Will </F> 'Solidarity' Support Walesa in Presidential Elections?"]    [Text] "The most important thing is to target the  electorate in the correct manner" -- Lech Walesa keeps saying  before the presidential elections. As for himself, he is  targeting "Solidarity" and he has already made it his first  offer. Professor Zbigniew Religa is the intermediary -- the  chief of the pro- Belvedere Non-Party Bloc in Support of  Reforms, wants to put his parliamentary club at the disposal of  "Solidarity."    But first the trade union and the Belvedere must apologize  to  one another.  <H5>  Separation or Divorce? </H5>   Walesa stopped being interested in "Solidarity" three years  ago, when he became president. It was easier to fight for power  along with the trade union, than to be in power with it. The  issue of file-checking was the ultimate reason behind the  dispute between the two sides. Walesa brought Olszewski's  government down and "Solidarity" did not invite him to its  national congress. The trade union and the Belvedere turned  their backs on each other.    "We are beginning to go separate ways" -- stated  the president a year ago.    But today, he is making gestures aimed at an agreement. He  recalled that "Solidarity" exists in February, after a big,  anti- government rally in Warsaw. That was a message that the  trade union is again gaining strength.  <H5>  Something in Return for Something Else </H5>   Walesa needs the trade union again. The elections will be in  a year and a half, while he continues to be without a "home  front." There is a political vacuum surrounding the Belvedere.  The attempt to create a presidential camp along with the right  wing, backfired. "Solidarity" remains.    What can Walesa offer the trade union in return for its  support? He can offer it what the trade union is missing the  most -- efficiency.  <H5>  Walesa Holds the Pen </H5>   The day 19 September was a day of defeat for the old  anticommunist opposition. The coalition, consisting of the  Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant Party, seemed to  be made of granite.    For six months now, Walesa has been successfully breaking  the  granite into pieces. He signed Borowski's resignation and he  blocked Rosati's nomination. His veto "killed" popiwek [earning  control legislation]. The trade union was not capable of  accomplishing that over four years. The president's pen turned  out a more effective political weapon than protests and strikes  by "Solidarity."    This must impress. And it does. We know from "leaks" that  Walesa's shares are "going up" in the trade union's National  Commission.  <H5>  Everybody or Nobody? </H5>   But the involvement of "Solidarity" in the presidential  campaign cannot be determined through a vote. Either the entire  trade union will support him, or else...it will split.    There is no one "Solidarity" "on the Walesa issue." It  includes both pro-presidential and anti-presidential activists.  They were both in the crowds that burned Walesa in effigy, and  among those who expressed their indignation at the burners.    That is why a decision on whether or not to support Walesa  will not be made soon. It is possible that "Solidarity" will  not be capable of making such a decision at all.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina, June 21 (AFP) -- A  steady stream of convoys have been carrying large amounts of  weapons through Croatia to Bosnia's Moslem-led army, fueling the  latest offensives against Serb forces, UN and other sources  said. In violation of the international arms embargo against  the Bosnian belligerents, trucks loaded with light arms,  anti-tank weapons and ammunition have been leaving the Croatian  coast regularly for Bosnia since a Croat-Moslem federation pact  was agreed in March, the sources said. The agreement to form  the federation ended a year of bloody conflict between the two  ethnic groups.    The sources in Zenica, headquarters of the Moslem-led  Bosnian  army's Third Corps, said most of the weapons were destined for  the Brcko corridor in northern Bosnia -- a strategic lifeline  linking Serb-conquered territory in eastern and western Bosnia  which UN officials fear is the next Bosnian army target.    The federation agreement also freed Moslem troops who had  been deployed against the Croats to launch attacks last week on  Serb positions in northeastern Bosnia. The Serbs have protested  the attacks as a clear violation of a month-long ceasefire which  started on June 10 and they began over the weekend hindering aid  convoys into the Moslem-majority Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, in  retaliation.    "Croats from both Croatia and Bosnia are letting convoys go  through in exchange for part of their cargo," a UN Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) officer told AFP on condition he not be named.  "They only tolerate light arms and anti-tank guns, to shift the  balance of power in the Moslems' favour just a little, but not  more," he said. "There's no question of heavy arms for the  moment -- the distrust (between the Moslems and Croats) is not  about to disappear," he said.    "One thing is certain, money is no object," he said.  "Suitcases full of dollars and deutschmarks enter the country  every day, supplied notably by Islamic countries," the UN  officer said.    A Bosnian Army officer at the Third Corps headquarters here  acknowledged that his forces lacked artillery and air power, but  said the weapons getting through were sufficient. "Give us  modern anti-tank weapons and we will liberate our land," he told  AFP.    The Bosnian Government has long called for an end to the  blanket arms embargo on all former Yugoslav republics, imposed  when fighting first broke out three years ago, saying it would  not need proposed international aid against Serb aggression if  it could defend itself properly.    The Bosnian Army has a large infantry, but is not as well  equipped in heavy weaponry as the Serbs, who had access to the  former Yugoslav army's arsenal. A European military expert in  the region confirmed that Moslem-Croat cooperation in this  field, at least, was working "very well." "Convoys pass through  Croat zones without being looted outrageously, which is what  often happened before," he said.    A reliable source in Zenica said 200 tonnes of Chinese arms  were delivered at the end of May, including Norinco Red Arrow 8  anti-tank missiles. The arms came by air to Ancona in Italy,  continuing by boat to Split on the Croatian coast before being  unloaded onto 34 trucks, he said.    The convoy, fronted by four truckloads of food and escorted  by Croatian police, crossed into Bosnia without difficulty. It  was then handed over to Bosnian police, continuing through  Visoko, Tuzla and Maoca near the Brcko corridor, he said. The  European military expert said another convoy of 50 trucks,  probably carrying arms, was seen at the Croat town of Prozor on  the road linking the Croatian coast with central Bosnia.    An article appearing this weekend in the London-based JANE'S  DEFENCE WEEKLY showed a photograph of the Red Arrow 8 missiles  near the front at Gradacac. The missile has a range of 3,000  metres (yards) and can pierce armour eight centimetres (around  three inches) thick.</p>

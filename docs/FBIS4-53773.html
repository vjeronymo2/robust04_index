			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The United States Should Respond to </F> Peace Negotiations With Us"]    [Text] We recently proposed to the United States that  negotiations be held to establish a new peace guarantee system  to prevent arms buildup and recurrence of war, to stabilize the  situation, and to ensure durable peace and security in a  practical and dependable manner on the Korean peninsula. Our  initiative toward negotiations is generating great international  reaction, which proves that our proposal is right.    A state of acute military confrontation remains on the  Korean  peninsula. This resulted from the wrongful U.S. act of wantonly  violating the Korean Armistice Agreement and paralyzing the  armistice mechanism and from the U.S. policy of crushing the  DPRK.    The United States has been trampling [chitpalpko] upon the  agreements of the Armistice Agreement even more wantonly and  following the road of reckless military confrontation and  adventurism. Raving about countermeasures to check someone's  nuclear development and surprise attack, hardline conservative  forces of the United States have massively brought and deployed  various types of equipment, including new Patriot missiles, in  South Korea, and assembled a large-scale mobile strike armed  forces around South Korea. The United States also says they will  enforce the Team Spirit joint military exercise this November.    By this, the United States itself reveals that it has  completely destroyed the armistice agreement it signed with us  in the name of the United Nations with the world as witness.    The Korean peninsula is presently in a state of armistice.  In order for this state to continue, the signatories of the  armistice agreement should fulfill their obligations stipulated  in the agreement. However, the United States is not doing so.  The United States, in breach of its obligations stipulated in  the Korean Armistice Agreement, has violated and trampled upon  [pagihago yurinhaessumyo] the agreements unilaterally and  systematically for the past 40 years, and their trampling upon  the agreements has become more grave recently. In fact, they do  not admit to the validity of the agreement and ignore the value  of its existence. This is proven by the U.S. deployment of  numerous items of combat equipment, including new-type missiles,  into South Korea openly and in broad daylight, and its open  actions against us, the other signatory party to the agreement.    Because of this wrongful act of the United States, the  armistice Agreement has become a blank sheet of paper, and the  situation on the Korean peninsula is becoming more grave. In  fact, the armistice agreement has now lost its role as a  systematic device to prevent aggravation of tension and danger  of war.    Because of the U.S. maneuvers, the armistice supervisory  mechanism has also been paralyzed. The United States  unilaterally forced a surveillance team--which watches over the  observance of the armistice agreement and investigates and  clarifies violations of the agreement--out of its area in order  to hide its violations of the armistice agreement.    The United States has also disabled the armistice mechanism  from carrying out its function. The United States unilaterally  replaced the senior member of the Military Armistice Commission  [MAC] with a puppet army general of South Korea who is neither a  practical party to the signing of the armistice agreement nor  has any real power, qualification, or legal legitimacy. This  improper act of the United States, depriving the MAC of its  masters, turned the MAC into a nominal [yumyong musirhan] organ  that could no longer carry out its proper role.    We can no longer hold out any expectations for the armistice  agreement and the armistice mechanism--which are in name only  and are used as a camouflage for the U.S. policy of crushing the  DPRK. As long as the present armistice system--which stipulates  us and the United States as the two parties to  hostilities--continues to exist, the acute issues, including the  nuclear issue, cannot be settled on the Korean peninsula.    Facts show that only when the armistice agreement is  replaced  by a peace agreement and a new peace guarantee system is  established replacing the present armistice mechanism can the  hostile relations between the DPRK and the United States be  ended, reconciliation be achieved, and peace and security  ensured on the Korean peninsula.    How the United States treats our new proposal for peace  negotiations will be a touchstone determining whether they want  peace or war. The United States should squarely see the nature  and reality of the situation and respond to peace negotiations  with us as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Markets: Second-hand share-swap - London Markets NEITHER Wellcome Trust nor BZW are turkeys, but for a glorious moment on Thursday the City wondered if they were offering themselves up for stuffing. The Trust, which is selling Pounds 3bn-worth of its Wellcome shares, has decided to invest at least Pounds 500m of the proceeds in an index fund - one designed to track very closely the performance of the FT-Actuaries All-Share index. BZW Investment Management will run the fund. To make setting up the fund smoother, BZW Securities is offering to buy stakes in companies directly from institutions, at the closing price on the day the Wellcome offer closes. Many institutions will, in effect, swap shares they don't want for Wellcome shares they do. So far, so neat. It was the wider possibilities that made the City sit up. Many UK stocks are surprisingly illiquid; it is hard to deal in size in the shares of quite large companies without moving the price against you. The liquidity of some of the companies at the bottom end of the FT-SE 100 index, for example, leaves something to be desired. And by the time you've got down to the 200s, it's quite common to find stocks where the price is easily swayed by a relatively small buy or sell order. Hence the Wellcome Trust/BZW offer, which in principle allows institutions to sell blocks of shares without pushing the price down; and, contrariwise, allows the Trust to buy without pushing prices up. On the face of it, that seems a neat meshing of interests. But look at the possibilities. Suppose you own a chunk of stock in a a company everyone - including you - is worried about. Normally, you couldn't sell without driving the price down. Now the Wellcome Trust index fund is offering to buy  -at next week's closing price. If the shares are indeed illiquid, a little discreet buying of shares over the next week might push the price up healthily. When the time comes to sell to the Trust's fund, you'll have killed two birds with one stone: dumped a line of stock you've been having nightmares about; and made a nice little profit on it into the bargain. No wonder the City was leaping about its dealing rooms with excitement on Thursday, when Wellcome Trust announced its offer. 'Every single market-maker will be trying to find a way to take advantage of this,' said one cheerful cynic. BZW Securities, of course, says it wasn't born yesterday. It has complete discretion over which stocks it will take and which ones it will refuse; and it won't stand for any hanky-panky. That may not stop someone trying it on, however: so the City will be keeping a keen eye out for unexpected moves in dodgy stocks in the days left before the Wellcome Trust tender closes. At least, by indicating that someone is interested in holding equities, the offer helped the market through a difficult patch on Thursday, as everyone waited for the news on German interest rates. When the news came, it was not so bad - but it wasn't so good, either. The rise in Germany's discount rate had no immediate effect on UK interest rates, and hence no Thursday impact on equities. German market rates have been well above the discount rate floor, so on the face of it the official rate was merely moving into line with reality. The not-so-good aspect of the decision had started to seep through to the market's consciousness by Friday. In the past, a rise in the German discount rate has often been the prelude to a more substantial tightening of policy a month or so later on. On top of that thought came one of those almost-imperceptible Bank of England moves in the money market - the reversal of the very slight downward adjustment of interest rates a couple of weeks ago. The Bank of England made it clear then that the downward adjustment was purely technical, and that no desire to ease rates generally should be read into it. That didn't stop some people interpreting it as a way of testing the waters for a cut in base rates. Whatever the motivation, the move has now been reversed. It coincided with the announcement that Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society was raising its mortgage rate by a quarter-point, because of competition for deposits from National Savings. These two developments were accompanied by a poor performance in the Japanese stock market, and a slide in continental bourses. When Wall Street started falling too, the market's unhappiness came to a head. The FT-SE index closed on Friday 51.5 points down on the day, at 24.31.9, a 58.9-point drop on the week. The economic news in the background was also depressing: the decline in manufacturing output, which had been slowing down ever since early 1991, suddenly speeded up again in May, in figures announced on Tuesday. It may just be a blip - but until the economic statistics make it clear that the economy is not heading back towards the trough of recession, equity investors are likely to be jumpy. Indeed, jumpiness is so pervasive that there are almost no bulls left among the equity analysts. One of the last fairly bullish people in the City is Paul Walton, strategist at James Capel, who thinks that the market is now looking cheap, when you compare the yield on shares with that on government bonds. In recent years, he says, whenever the ratio between the two has reached current levels - with bond yields about 1.8 times the dividend on the All-Share - it has bounced back sharply, through a rise in share prices. That's what will happen now, he says. But, it turns out, even he is only fairly bullish: there'll be a rally taking the FT-SE back towards 2,800, he thinks, and after that the market will go sideways for quite some time. And that sort of optimism would have seemed like rank pessimism a year or so ago.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- The Burundian parliament  expressed support to the memorandum of the DPRK Foreign Ministry  dated April 20 which threw light on the main obstacle to the  solution of the nuclear issue and truth behind it.    In its note to the DPRK Embassy in Burundi, it said that the  threat to and pressure on an independent state by big powers are  a crude violation of international law and a big obstacle to  peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the world. It  expressed solidarity and support to the stand and efforts of the  DPRK to resolve the nuclear problem through its peaceful  negotiation with the United States.    It called upon international organisations not to cling to a  double-standard policy, blindly following the big powers, but  act according to their ideas and reaffirmed undisputed support  to the Korean people's struggle for the independent and peaceful  reunification of the country.</p>

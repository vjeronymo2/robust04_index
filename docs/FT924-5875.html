			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Sentrachem agrees Australian purchase SENTRACHEM, one of South Africa's largest chemical groups, has agreed the purchase of Australian chemical group Chemplex, controlled by Mr Kerry Packer. The sale, which will only proceed subject to a strict due-diligence investigation, will be the latest in a series of offshore purchases by South African companies. These include the purchases of Hannover Papier by Sappi, the paper and pulp group; Henry Ansbacher by First National Bank; and the African banking interests of ANZ/Grindlays by the Standard Bank group. No price has been made public for the deal, but Chemplex had sales last year in excess of ADollars 200m (USDollars 136.7m). Mr John Job, Sentrachem's chief executive, said the company needed to diversify internationally rather than merely defend its high market share as South Africa opens up to international competition. The Australian base also provided access to the Pacific Rim market. Chemplex makes styrene, while Sentrachem is South Africa's biggest user of the compound, with a significant portion of its sales styrene-based. If the deal is concluded, less than half of the purchase price will be settled in financial rands - the volatile investment currency which has weakened considerably recently - with the balance being funded by loans.</p>

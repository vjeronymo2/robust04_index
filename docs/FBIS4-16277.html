			<p>BFN     [Text] Negotiations between the chief border  representatives of Ukraine, Valeriy Hubenko, and the Slovak  Republic, (Pavol Nyunyuk), ended in Kiev on 14 April. The  results of the work done in 1993 to protect the state borders of  the two states were summed up and a mechanism to organize  interaction for their protection in 1994 has been worked out.    The sides stated that the number of illegal border crossing  attempts has increased of late. Criminal groupings remain to be  active, there are instances of drug-trafficking and smuggling of  fire arms and other kinds of weapons.    Valeriy Hubenko and his foreign counterpart also discussed  the state of affairs at the border checkpoints as well as  measures for the successful fulfillment of the agreements on the  state border between Ukraine and the Slovak Republic.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER DEBT DECLINES FOR FIRST TIME IN 2 1/2 YEARS  </P> <P> The economic slowdown caught up with American consumers in July as they paid  off $280 million more in credit than they borrowed, the Federal Reserve Board  reported Friday. It was the first reduction in consumer debt in 2 1/2 years.  </P> <P> But analysts predicted that the decline in borrowing was temporary and,  considering other reports indicating continued although slower economic growth,  should pick up in the months ahead.  </P> <P> The Fed said consumer credit in July declined at a seasonally adjusted annual  rate of 0.5%, down from June's 4.7% gain. But even the June advance was revised  downward from 5.1%, falling to $2.72 billion from $2.99 billion.  </P> <P> The July decline was the first since January, 1987, when consumer debt fell  $1.63 billion, or 3.4%.  </P> <P> Auto loans, which fell for the second straight month, contributed most to the  July credit cutback, the Fed reported.  </P></p>

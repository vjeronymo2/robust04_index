Russian UN Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov said today in a  statement, Russia "noted that there had lately been certain  positive elements in the actions of Bagdad."    Addressing a regular 60-day review meeting of the Security  Council over the sanctions against Iraq, the ambassador said  that the position of Iraq should be encouraged.    He added that if a thorough and comprehensive compliance of  Iraq with its obligations is confirmed, Russia would be ready to  consider lifting the oil embargo in accordance with relevant  Security Council resolutions.    "In this connection, we pronounced ourselves in favors of  the  inclusion in the text of the statement by the Security Council  president of a clause mentioning positive shifts in the Iraqi  position," he said.    China, France and Russia advocated a change in a routine  presidential statement, so as to give Iraq some encouragement  for its positive position in arms destruction.    The United States and Britain opposed it, by arguing that  many other issues should be linked to the lifting of the  embargos.</p>

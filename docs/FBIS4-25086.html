			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chao Liang: "Persistent Drought Threatens Harvest"] </F>   [Text] A widespread summer drought will likely affect this  summer's harvest of winter wheat in the North and seriously  affect other crops in the South.    There have been only 10 millimeters of precipitation since  mid- May, or 60 to 90 percent less than the average rainfall in  North China, officials for the State Anti-Drought Office (SADO)  said yesterday.    Rainfall in the South has been 50 to 60 percent less than  the  previous years in many parts of Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou  provinces and some coastal areas of Guangdong Province and the  Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.    Sichuan Province is hit by its worst drought in 25 years,  affecting 115 counties with a population of more than 18.8  million.    In most parts of China, the mercury has been rising higher  and faster than in previous years, according to meteorologists.    As a result, many fields have been parched by the windy and  hot days that have persisted since late April and early May, the  SADO's officials said.    "The long spell of dry weather has already become a major  threat to this year's summer harvest in the North because the  following week is a critical period for the growth of winter  wheat in the north farming areas," they warned.    North China is one of the country's most important areas for  growing winter wheat.    According to the office's latest statistics, the affected  farmland has reached nearly 8 million hectares including more  than 5.8 million hectares of summer crops and over 2 million  hectares of other fields.    At least 5.7 million people and more than 5.1 million heads  of livestock are finding it difficult to obtain enough drinking  water.    The hardest-hit areas of North China include Beijing and  Tianjin cities, and most parts of Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi and  Gansu provinces, as well as eastern Shandong Province.    In Shandong, parts of the Yellow River have repeatedly dried  up, making it impossible for farmers to irrigate a large number  of crops and cotton.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by PRENSA LIBRE special correspondent Henry </F> Hernandez Marroquin]    [Text] Yesterday, Pablo Monsanto, commander of the  Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG), said that  retired Generals Jose Luis Quilo Ayuso, Francisco Ortega  Menaldo, and Roberto Perussina might be responsible for Sunday's  dynamite attack on the San Juan River bridge, located at  kilometer 20 on the Atlantic coast highway.    Monsanto denied that the URNG was responsible for the  explosion, adding that the URNG has no men in the area and  therefore could not participate in that terrorist attack. The  rebel commander said that, in an attack of this type, one cannot  rule out the participation of criminal groups who seek to stop  the peace dialogue, and they might be linked to the retired  military men who do not want to see an end to the 33 years of  warlike conflict in Guatemala.    For a long time now, Monsanto added, the previously  mentioned  military men have caused divisions in the Army, and therefore,  one cannot ignore their interest in the suspension of peace  talks between the URNG and the government. Monsanto referred to  the case of Quilo Ayuso, who during his farewell ceremony at the  Polytechnic Institute pointed out there was division among the  military forces.</p>

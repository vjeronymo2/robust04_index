			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Labour attacks BAe over sell-off British Aerospace came under fire at Westminster yesterday with more than 70 Labour MPs - including several frontbench spokesmen - expressing concern about the company's decision to pay Pounds 3.2m to its retiring chairman. The MPs - headed by Mr Derek Fatchett, a frontbench trade and industry spokesman - used a parliamentary early day motion to claim that the company's handling of the sale of Rover to BMW of Germany raised 'issues of public concern'. The motion said: 'That this House expresses its concern at the business practices of British Aerospace which, having recently sold Rover to BMW, and having made nearly 2,000 aerospace workers redundant in the last few weeks, has now agreed to pay Pounds 3.2m to John Cahill, its retiring chairman and United Kingdom tax exile, for two years' work; feels that these practices raise issues of public concern; and condemns the prime minister for refusing to answer questions about British Aerospace.'</p>

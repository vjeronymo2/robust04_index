			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Werner Adam editorial: "Between Pretension and Reality"] </F>   [Text] For the first time in a long period, his country is  acting like a superpower in a world that no longer threatens  anyone, the Russian president hinted in Bonn. This is a  historically memorable sentence of topical significance. At a  time when nationalist and neoimperial voices are rising in  Russia, it proves Yeltsin to be a courageous man who frankly  admitted that Moscow posed a danger for far too long.    In spite of such reasonable behavior, however, the leader of  the Kremlin and his military officials showed little  understanding for the mistrust that still prevails in the close  and more distant neighborhood. The Russian leadership reacts  more sensitively than ever before to persisting doubts regarding  its assurances that it is fully committed to fruitful  international cooperation.    When the Soviet Union still existed, one of its most  powerful  leaders in foreign policy made it clear that the West's  difficulties in understanding Russia stem from the fact that "we  are a nuclear superpower with an inferiority complex." No  matter how adequate such descriptions may be, such explanations  can easily lead from realpolitik to a wrong psychological path  and cause even more misunderstandings. Moscow contributes to  this in a way that cannot be fully explained with the  after-effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Whereas the  relief over the disappearance of imperial burdens and the  prospects for a democratic Russia based on the rule of law  seemed to outweigh the pain over the fall of the Bolshevik  empire that was reminiscent of the czarist realm, Moscow seems  to fluctuate between the greater Russian desire to regain  international respect as a reawakened superpower as it were and  the need to seek closer relations with the West dictated by its  economic decline.    Thus, the uncertainty that prevails in the world regarding  Russia's future course, caused by Russia's inferiority complex  and its megalomania, makes Western efforts -- which were once  more confirmed by Germany -- to integrate Russia in the European  network of relations understandable. It is generally expected  that this will curb the country's unpredictability, while at the  same time strengthening its self-confidence. However, such  endeavors are limited because, despite the collapse of the  Soviet Union, Russia has continued to be an enormous Eurasian  colossus that can only be incorporated into European structures  while risking an upsetting of the balance. Thus, Russia's  demand for special treatment seems plausible at first sight.  However, if one takes a closer look and analyzes Moscow's  ideas, as expounded by Yeltsin and his Defense Minister Grachev  in Bonn, considerable doubts arise.    Russia is not only trying to ensure that its possible  participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace is rewarded with  the promise for a special role that would be justified to a  certain extent in view of the country's status as a nuclear and  military power and its ability to defend itself if need be.  However, apart from the fears that such preferential treatment  would prompt, particularly among the former satellites of the  Soviet Union in Central and East Europe, Moscow wants much more.  It wants to be consulted prior to all major NATO decisions,  and, via a right of veto resulting therefrom, it strives for  something like the subordination of the Atlantic alliance under  the roof of the CSCE, which would weaken NATO at the expense of  an -- inefficient -- collective security system. Since the  Russian leadership cannot expect the West to comply with its  wishes, the suspicion is not unfounded that, with a deliberate  exaggeration, it wants to ensure that other demands are met more  easily.    These demands include Russia's desire to be recognized by  NATO, the CSCE, and the United Nations as a power within the  boundaries of the former Soviet Union that influences the world  order. In fact, the West is inclined to grant this role to the  Russian armed forces in such unstable regions as the Caucasus  and Central Asia because of its own lack of readiness to become  active there. However, one should not overlook that Russia  contributed essentially to the creation of conflict zones,  including that in Georgia, in Nagorno Karabakh, over which  Armenia and Azerbajan are fighting, and in Tajikistan.  Moreover, Moscow's efforts to establish closer political and  military ties with the successor states to the Soviet Union,  which are now loosely united in the CIS, and to present the  whole territory again as a geopolitical unit dominated by the  key country of the former empire are also questionable.    It does not really suit the West to see Russia as a future  partner of whom nobody need be afraid any more. In fact, the  West should not do anything to strengthen Russia's deep-seated  feeling of offended national pride and of loneliness as a state,  which really exists. However, Russia can only free itself from  this feeling -- by depriving the neighboring countries of the  basis of their mistrust and by conceding priority to inner  reforms and not to external greed.</p>

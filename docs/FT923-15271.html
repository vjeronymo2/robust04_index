			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (7): Good lesson in going public  -Profile / GPA SINCE the GPA Group aborted its Dollars 800m flotation its complex share structure has being cited by investment bankers as an example of what not to do when going public. GPA's planned flotation was billed as a unique offering; a simultaneous listing in New York, London and Dublin by tender offer to give the issue maximum flexibility. There was to be a placement of shares in Japan. In order to increase competition between institutional shareholders around the world the issue was not anchored in any single market. The structure was seen to have an inbuilt guarantee against the possibility of slack demand in any one of the four markets. If institutional shareholders in any one market appeared to be ambivalent about the issue - as they turned out to be - the lead manager in any given market could cite strong demand elsewhere in an effort to drum up support for the issue. There was a normal book-building exercise. Nomura International as global co-ordinator, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers in the US and Schroders and BZW in the UK, gathered indications of the number of shares institutions wanted. The book building exercise took place within a price range of Dollars 10-Dollars 12, following a 1-for-1 scrip issue, but the actual price would not be fixed until the investment bankers had clear figures of demand in each country. According to GPA demand was so strong that 10 days before the new shares were due to start trading it increased the total amount on offer by 5m to 85m. The aircraft leasing company said this was because of a surge in interest from retail investors. But in the early hours of the day the new shares were due to start trading the group was forced to pull the issue. GPA had hoped to sell 80m shares worldwide, with 30m in the UK and Ireland, 20m in the US, 15m internationally and 15m in Japan. Instead, there was only demand for about 50m shares, with 22.93m coming from retail investors in Japan. Dr Tony Ryan, chairman, asked his advisers to look at new options for salvaging the offer. But their recommendation was the same: the offer had to be pulled. So what went wrong? There were considerable uncertainties surrounding an aircraft leasing company trying to raise money in a market unconvinced that the recession in the airline industry had bottomed out. Putting these on one side, the offer structure was a significant contributory factor to the collapse of the flotation. There were fundamental weaknesses with the offer structure. The sale was not anchored in any one single market. So instead of London or New York institutions driving it, they stood back until they were certain that there was demand in other markets. When it became clear that demand was weak in the US the offer lacked a home market to soak up the unwanted shares. The Wellcome share offer, for example, is firmly anchored in the UK. When demand from the US market collapsed it adversely affected sentiment in the rest of the world. So far from increasing competitive pressure the offer became doomed once it became clear that there was no demand for the shares in the US. British institutional shareholders, which had expressed an interest in buying the shares, fell away once they heard that US institutions were not interested. Mr Tim Pettee, vice president of Alliance Capital, which manages about Dollars 60bn of pension and mutual fund assets, said: 'It later became obvious that advisers in one country, where the demand was weak, were talking up demand in another country where demand was equally weak. In reality there was very little demand anywhere.' Although the tender offer was chosen to increase flexibility, the price range and the maximum number of shares to be sold could not be changed once announced. Some commentators believe that had the shares been sold by way of a US style placing in the UK, like the offering of Waste Management International's shares, it would have been easier for the advisers to have either reduced the price or the number of shares on offer since a placing is not subject to the some constraints as a tender offer. GPA is still commited to coming to the market. With Pounds 12bn worth of firm orders for aircraft from manufacturers over the rest of the decade, the company needs new equity. With net assets of less than Dollars 2bn and borrowings of more than twice that level GPA cannot go on increasing its debt without finding new shareholders. Nomura is looking at several options for doing that.</p>

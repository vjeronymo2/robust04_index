			<p>BFN     [Text] In accordance with a decision of the interim  administration in the state of emergency area in North Ossetia  and Ingushetia, Russian Internal Affairs Ministry internal  troops conducted an operation on Saturday to move into the  8-kilometer security corridor. The interior troops task is to  occupy the entire corridor.    All North Ossetian and Ingush law enforcement units were  pulled out of the corridor in advance. The RIA agency reports  that the operation aimed at occupying the security corridor has  proceeded without any major complications. Only near the  village of Ali-Yurt in Ingushetia did a group of local resident  try to prevent the interior troops from carrying out their  operational task. The incident was settled promptly and without  bloodshed.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOMPSON'S WALKOUT DOES NOT GENERATE A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPORT  </P> <P> Though I support the position of John Thompson and others who say that  (college-entrance) tests discriminate against the lower socioeconomic athlete,  I am angry at statements, made by many coaches, that show bias against the  community colleges. For example, some coaches have complained that "Kids will  be forced to go the junior college route."  </P> <P> It is well documented that some of the finest teaching in the country (that's  teaching, not research) is done at the community college level.  </P> <P> JAMES ANTONIOLI  </P> <P> Channel Islands  </P></p>

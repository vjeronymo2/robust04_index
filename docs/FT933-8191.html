			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Continental cuts 2,500 airline jobs CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier, yesterday said it would cut 2,500 full-time jobs, eliminate nine cities from its roster, and get rid of several unprofitable routes after posting disappointing results for the two months following its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Mr Daniel Garton, Continental's chief financial officer, blamed the company's tepid performance on continuing weakness in ticket prices. 'Our results were in line with the rest of the industry but were still not good enough. It is important that we are taking steps to return to profitability and that we are willing to make the hard decisions.' Continental plans to stop services to Australia and New Zealand at the end of October, eliminating several unprofitable routes and closing its stations in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Auckland. It will also close its Vancouver station in October and its Puerto Plata station in the Dominican Republic in September. In the US, it will close its Spokane, Washington station, along with those at Bismarck and Minot, North Dakota. In addition, Continental is reducing services in some markets and withdrawing altogether from its Denver - Milwaukee, Denver - Detroit and Cleveland - Dallas routes. The carrier will, however, continue to serve Milwaukee, Detroit and Dallas through other hubs. Continental, which emerged from Chapter 11 on April 28, posted an operating loss of Dollars 4.2m on revenues of Dollars 975.9m for the two months to June 30. The company had a net loss of Dollars 24.4m, or Dollars 1.45 a share, in the period. From April 1 to April 27, the predecessor company had an operating loss of Dollars 58m on revenues of Dollars 476.9m. Net income for the period was Dollars 2.75bn. For the three months to June 30 1992, Continental made an operating loss of Dollars 58m on revenues of Dollars 1.35bn. Its net loss in the quarter was Dollars 99.2m. When Continental presented its business plan to the bankruptcy court in April, the company predicted operating losses of Dollars 181.2m for the first four months but projected operating profits of Dollars 168.3m for the period from May to December. Continental has not posted annual operating profits since 1986.</p>

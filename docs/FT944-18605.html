			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Observer: Yesterday's man If alarm bells are not ringing in Britain's diplomatic service then they should be. Has anybody noticed that Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, who will be in New York tomorrow to fall out with Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis on the Larry King Live chat show, is going to be just a cab ride away from South Africa's President Mandela? Mandela is on his first state visit to the US and is busy shaking hands with all sorts of business folk. What better way for Adams to project his public image as Ireland's answer to Nelson Mandela than to arrange a meeting with the great man himself. Much better than trying to get President Bill Clinton to invite him to the White House.</p>

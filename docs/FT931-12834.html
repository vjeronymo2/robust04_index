			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Apax sells Sterling stake THE VENTURE capitalist which backed a management buy-out 10 years ago at Sterling Publishing Group, owner of Debrett's Peerage, yesterday sold the final tranche of its original investment, resulting in an overall profit of Pounds 9.7m. Apax Venture Capital Fund said it had sold its holding in Sterling following an approach from stockbroker, Granville Davies. The stake comprised 12.7 per cent of the ordinary , sold at 110p each, and 8 per cent of the convertible cumulative redeemable preference stock at 315p. Proceeds of the disposal amounted to Pounds 6.26m. This is in addition to Pounds 4m received in previous sales and dividends. Granville placed the shares with eight institutions, including Lazards and Legal &amp; General. Mr Ronald Cohen, chairman of Sterling and of Apax Partners, said the firm had initially invested Pounds 500,000 in the company in 1983. 'It has been a tremendous investment for us,' he said. The Apax Fund was originally set up in 1981, with a 10-year life. It has thus had an obligation to dispose of the Sterling stake, its largest investment, for some time.</p>

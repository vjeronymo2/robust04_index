			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Letter: A crucial factor in assessing TV merger Sir, Lex's comments are customarily fully informed. His observations on the Yorkshire/Tyne Tees merger, however, left out a crucial factor. Using his own Treasury figures, the gap between payments to the Treasury by Granada (Pounds 27m) and Yorkshire/Tyne Tees (Pounds 63m) is Pounds 36m. As I understand it, Yorkshire/Tyne Tees between them are currently taking Pounds 30m more than Granada in advertising revenue. Simple mathematics therefore suggests very little difference in the profit and loss position of the companies. And the fact that both Yorkshire and Tyne Tees have substantial cash balances, whereas Granada has a very heavily borrowed position, suggests at least equality in strength between Granada and the 'merged moguls', as Lex would have it. The truth in this case is at odds with Lex's deduction. As chairman of the company which has attended to YTV's corporate identity and objectives in the run-up to the recent licence changes, and as someone with an interest in the changing developments within ITV, I thought it needed pointing out.

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Paris on attack over Gatt - French farmers 'not the one stumbling block' to trade deal FRANCE yesterday launched its diplomatic counter-offensive in the Gatt trade talks to remind its European Community partners of an array of common European demands in the negotiations, outside of agriculture where Paris is most isolated. In a statement to fellow EC leaders on Wednesday Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has brought France out of its defensive agricultural trench and engaged its negotiating opponents - first inside the EC, then among the other Gatt participants - on a wide front. The European Commission issued a cautious initial reaction to the memorandum yesterday, describing it as a 'carefully worded' and 'useful' contribution to the EC's reflections on the Gatt talks. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, will discuss the paper with Mr Balladur and French ministers at meetings in Paris on Monday. Mr Balladur said: 'I want to put an end to this idea that several hundreds of thousands of French farmers are the one stumbling block to the regeneration of world trade that would follow from a Gatt accord.' Many other issues in the 14 non-agricultural sectors of the Gatt negotiations needed to be settled, he added. If they were, he hinted he might be ready to face his farmers down on certain of their demands. There is a strong impression that Paris is preparing to join other EC countries soon in endorsing the draft oilseeds accord with the US, an issue technically outside the Uruguay Round, provided it gets a few more modifications. 'Nothing is worse (in a negotiation) than to get stuck in generalities,' said Mr Balladur, hailing his government's five-page position paper as a 'concrete and complete' review of everything from tariffs, copyright to world labour standards. But it is largely a re-packaging of existing French and EC positions to revive public interest in them. France is also calling for the EC to defend itself commercially against unfair trade, not only with its anti-dumping/subsidy rules but also with its so-called New Commercial Instrument. Approved in 1984, this was designed as Europe's answer to unilateral retaliation provided for in Section 301 of successive US Trade Acts. The EC Twelve have hardly ever been able to agree on its use. However, France does endorse the EC's long-held view that the Uruguay Round should end by replacing Gatt with a stronger World Trade Organisation, which would outlaw unilateral trade retaliation. So, talk of the Community reviving the New Commercial Instrument is largely a negotiating chip with Washington. Mr Gerard Longuet, the trade and industry minister, admitted there was 'a hierarchy' among French demands, conceding effectively that some were just bargaining counters. The clear impression is that France is at last open for business on Gatt - but that negotiating will be tough.</p>

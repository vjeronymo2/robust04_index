			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Silicon Graphics to acquire MIPs SILICON Graphics, a Silicon Valley manufacturer of graphics computer workstations is to acquire MIPs Computer Systems, a closely allied developer of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (Risc) microprocessors in a stock swap valued at about Dollars 406m. The acquisition was seen as a defensive move to ensure the future viability of its key technology partner. Silicon Graphics uses MIPs microprocessors in its graphics workstations. MIPs has been struggling in the face of heavy competition from companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, International Business Machines and Digital Equipment to establish its Risc microprocessors as a broadly used industry standard architecture for computers. Last year, MIPs announced the formation of the Ace Consortium, an industry group also including Compaq Computer, Digital Equipment , Microsoft and Silicon Graphics, that aimed to establish hardware and software standards for a new generation of computers. But, the recent announcement by Digital Equipment of its Risc microprocessor, which outperforms the latest MIPs devices, raised questions about that company's long-term commitment to the MIPs architecture. Announcing the acquisition, Mr Edward R. McCracken, president and chief executive of Silicon Graphics said the combined company aimed to establish MIPs' technology as an alternative to Intel microprocessors in personal computers. A subsidiary company, MIPs Technologies, will be established to develop RISC technology and enhance the strength of the Ace initiative, the companies said. Under the terms of the agreement, MIPs stockholders will receive 0.61 shares of Silicon Graphics' common stock for each share of MIPs' common stock owned. In reaction to the acquisition announcement, MIPs shares rose to Dollars 13 3/8 , while Silicon Graphics declined to Dollars 21 7/8 amid concerns about the impact on short-term earnings. Silicon Graphics said, however, that the merger will not be dilutive in fiscal 1993, beginning in July. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of June 1992. The annual revenue for the combined companies will approach Dollars 1bn, the companies said.</p>

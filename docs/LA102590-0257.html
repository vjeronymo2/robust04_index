			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BARKER CALLS FOR FILM BOYCOTT  </P> <P> Game show host Bob Barker and an animal rights group want people to boycott a  film in which horses jump from a 10-foot platform into an 11-foot-deep tank of  water.  </P> <P> "Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken," which is being filmed here, is about a woman who  jumped into the ocean on horseback from a pier at Atlantic City, N.J., during  the 1930s.  </P> <P> Lou Phillips, production executive for the movie, said producers have followed  and even exceeded American Humane Assn. standards in the care of the horses,  and no injuries have been reported.  </P> <P> The jump "may be acceptable to the producers, may be acceptable to the  association, but if the horses could speak, I'd bet it would not be acceptable  to them," Barker said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Barker, a longtime animal rights activist, works with the Coalition to Protect  Animals in Entertainment.  </P></p>

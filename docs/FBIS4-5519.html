			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Heroic Epical Record of Comrade Kim </F> Il-song" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comes out with a by-lined article titled "Respected Comrade Kim  Il-song Is a Great Leader Who Has Fought His Way Through  Rigorous Storms of Revolution With Iron Will."    In the first part, the article says respected Comrade Kim  Il-song is a great leader of the revolution who has performed  immortal exploits, which will shine through centuries, pushing  his way through raging storms of revolution with his iron will  and rare leadership ability.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying:    "Although manifold grim tests hard to overcome cropped up in  the way of our revolution including the anti-Japanese  revolutionary war, the Fatherland Liberation War and postwar  reconstruction, our leader met them with the iron will that the  sky could fall and he would not care, and led the revolution and  construction to a constant upswing with his extraordinary  leadership ability."    The respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song enjoys undisputed  trust and praise from the revolutionary people of the world as  the most veteran leader of the revolution in our time.    Our leader's high authority and prestige are attributable to  the immortal exploits he has performed for the time and  revolution, victoriously leading the protracted and arduous  Korean revolution.    What is most important in his leadership of the Korean  revolution is that he has valiantly pushed through countless  difficulties and trials standing in the way of revolution with a  matchless iron will.    His will is an iron will which wavers not a bit in any  thunderbolt, an unexcelled offensive spirit of courageously  meeting manifold difficulties and trials and an indomitable  fighting spirit. It is a great mental power unrivalled in  resoluteness, staunchness and principle.    Thanks to his iron will, the Korean people today win victory  after victory in an acute confrontation with the imperialists.    What is also important in his leadership of the Korean  revolution through grim trials of history is that he has  victoriously led the revolution and construction, always full of  confidence in victory and revolutionary optimism.    The just cause of revolution for the independence of the  people is sure to win victory. This is an unshakable will and  optimism which the great leader has maintained since the  beginning of his revolutionary activities.    When some people who had been aspiring after socialism lost  confidence after the collapse of socialism in some countries in  recent years, the great leader instructed that the course of the  change of the present situation must be viewed optimistically,  not pessimistically.    Thanks to this revolutionary position and leadership of the  great leader, the Korean people continue fighting staunchly for  the accomplishment of the socialist cause of chuche, full of  confidence in victory and optimism.    The great leader's leadership is also fully demonstrated in  that he firmly believes in the people under the difficult and  complex situation and unreservedly mobilizes their inexhaustible  strength to push through the difficulties.    When you firmly believe in the people and rely on them at  all  times, you always emerge victorious; if you are forsaken by  them, you always fail. This is the maxim the great leader has  kept in his struggle and life since he embarked on the road of  revolution.    With the noble idea of "believing in the people as in  heaven"  and wise guidance of the great leader who pushes ahead with the  revolution and construction with absolute trust in the people  and in reliance on them at all times, our socialist cause will  constantly advance and emerge victorious, pushing through any  storm and stress, with the great strength of chuche.    In the second part, the article says the proud history of  our  revolution which has emerged victorious through the rigorous  storms of history under the wise guidance of the great leader  teaches the people the precious truth of revolution.    The truth is that when the people fight, deeply trusting a  great leader as their mental support, they can overcome any  adversity and ordeal and win victory in the revolution, and that  the unity of the leader and the people in a harmonious whole is  a decisive guarantee for victory in the revolution.    Our people have been able to win a great victory in the  revolution and construction, through so difficult and arduous  struggles, because they have lived and fought staunchly with the  great leader as their mental support at all times.    In our revolutionary ranks, the leader and the people are  not  merely in relation between the leader and the led, but they form  a solid community, an integral whole of one ideology and will,  breathing the same breath. The might of this integral whole is a  main factor which has produced the singlehearted unity of the  revolutionary ranks, strengthened our party and trained our  revolutionary Armed Forces into an invincible combat unit.    Our people have a firm guarantee for victoriously advancing  and accomplishing our revolutionary cause in any test and  difficulty.    Our people are the most proud and happiest people in that  they are under the wise guidance of the great leader and the  dear leader who are victoriously leading our revolution through  grim trials. We have a solid singlehearted unity, impregnable  party and government, invincible revolutionary Armed Forces and  a powerful independent economy with which we can advance the  revolution and accomplish it with our own strength under  whatever situation.    The history of revolutionary struggle of our party and  people  will shine forever as an ever-victorious history because the  entire people are staunchly fighting in singlehearted unity with  the great pride and honor of making revolution under the great  leader and the dear leader.</p>

It further states that individuals not employed by the licensee (e.g., contractors) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided that the individual, ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into a protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee proposes to implement an alternative unescorted access system which would eliminate the need to issue and retrieve picture badges at the entrance/exit location to the protected area and would allow all individuals, including contractors, to keep their picture badges in their possession when departing the Haddam Neck Plant and the Millstone plants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated September 28, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5). Specifically, the requested exemption would allow individual, including contractors, who have unescorted access to retain possession of their picture badges instead of returning them as they exit the protected area. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Badenhorst looks to long term for ABSA - Philip Gawith on the challenges still facing South Africa's largest banking group MR PIET Badenhorst, straight-talking chief executive of Amalgamated Banks of South Africa - South Africa's largest banking group - is not a man to seek publicity. In the past few months, however, he has had it by the shovel-load. It has been the sort he could have done without. Hardly a week has passed without some piece of ABSA's dirty linen being hung out to air. If it was not the dismissal of a senior executive for alleged fraud, or disputes about contracts entered into before the Bankorp merger, or fraud in the vehicle finance section, it was controversy about ABSA forcing companies into liquidation. Following the merger in January 1992 with Bankorp, nobody doubted that ABSA had inherited a number of problems. The seemingly endless string of litigation, however, sooned raised concern that Mr Badenhorst was pursuing personal vendettas rather than the interests of shareholders. Mr Badenhorst's standard reply to this charge was to growl that critics should await the group's 1992-93 results before passing judgment. That occasion arrived on Monday. The group made attributable profits of R639m (Dollars 200.2m) for the year ended March, with earnings per share rising by 12 per cent and the dividend by 10 per cent. These are modest numbers. Stanbic, First National Bank and Nedcor, ABSA's three main banking rivals, all increased earnings per share by about 20 per cent for last year. Considering ABSA's heavy rationalisation, however, most observers are inclined to agree with Mr Badenhorst that the results are 'satisfactory'. So far the stock market has been lukewarm about ABSA, either doubting whether the benefits of scale will ever be realised, or believing them too distant to warrant any immediate attention to the shares, which have continued to under-perform the banking sector. For his part, Mr Badenhorst is not in any doubt that the merger is on track and that the group has now reached calmer waters. 'I think we can close the book on the contentious items. There is not a bad apple that I'm aware of that hasn't been dealt with, either through write-offs, provisions or management actions,' he says. Plainly, the past year has been one of extraordinary activity. It has involved three main components: Achieving rationalisation benefits of the merger which, most traumatically, has involved the retrenchment of 5,000 staff. Prioritising risk management, which had been very poor in the Bankorp division in particular. This has involved making extensive provisions for existing bad debts, and implementing stricter credit screening controls for future lending. Removing managers tainted with bad practices and replacing them with a team which reflects the banking culture Mr Badenhorst is seeking: strong customer service, high productivity, cost consciousness, and quality lending. The challenge now is to make the new structure work efficiently. Mr Badenhorst stresses that given the low level of the operating efficiencies of some of the divisions he inherited, this is no mean task. He agrees that his main competitors have many years' start over ABSA. 'It's a little like putting the Springboks back into international rugby after years of isolation. It takes time to get up to speed in terms of the rules and the techniques.' Short-term targets involved a return to controlled asset growth - the past year of consolidation saw assets virtually static - and gaining market share in areas where ABSA is under-represented, notably corporate lending and merchant banking. ABSA always set itself a three-year target in which to digest the merger fully. Analysts, in general, are supportive of the actions taken by Mr Badenhorst over the past year and agree that the long-term project - to secure significant cost benefits through economies of scale - is on target. Where there is stock market concern, it focuses on whether Mr Badenhorst has the depth of management to take the task to its conclusion. Mr Badenhorst accepts that the complexion of the group's senior management - overwhelmingly white, Afrikaans male - needs to be changed. 'We're a South African operation and must be South African in every respect.' He says it is policy - endorsed by all senior managers - to increase the number of non-whites on the staff; to achieve language parity among the staff; and to bring more English speakers into the management team. He adds: 'There is not a stone I've personally left unturned to achieve that.'</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Arts: Sackman's 'Hawthorn' - The Proms Nicholas Sackman, the 43-year-old English composer, had this year his first commission for the BBC Proms. The result - a 25-minute piece for large orchestra entitled Hawthorn - was revealed in the Albert Hall last Thursday, in a concert by the BBC Symphony under Andrew Davis, and will surely have proved immensely gratifying to all concerned. Sackman's output is not large (Hawthorn is only his second orchestral encounter); he works out his material with spare, unwasteful concentration; his concerns are not at all those of current fashion (ie minimalist note-spinning of the Holy-Mystic or the Neo-Brutalist persuasions). Hawthorn is an example of Sackman's tautly contained musical argument, yet it manifests an intensity gradually but ineluctably built up, a cumulative power that I have not experienced in his music before. This may have been the 'release' provided by a large orchestra, or by the novel (Glyn Hughes's The Hawthorn Goddess) which supplied the work's initial inspiration. Whatever the cause, the music - in a continuous three-part (fast-slow-fast) structure - states its terms with remarkable confidence in their potential, and a control of their dramatic unfolding that kept me intent on the progress of every note. Those terms, described in wildly oversimplified fashion, might be said to be the central opposition of crabbed, jabbing, harmonically complex chordal chunks, rhythmically charged in their groupings, against lyrical lines growing ever freer and lengthier. In the finale, after the ruminatively spacious slow movement has run its course, the argument snowballs to its expansively lyrical coda with an exhilaratingly unstoppable energy which one senses had been honestly earned. The orchestral colouring is comparably rigorous, with no element of artificial ear-catching, yet similarly strong - punchily athletic brass, airily striding strings, everywhere a 'personal' command of timbre and texture. If (as Sackman suggested in a laconic programme note) Hawthorn is indeed something of a dry run for a possible opera based on the same material, I hope our opera administrators are already battling it out for the honour of realising that possibility. Under Davis, always a sympathetic, precisely commanding interpreter of complex new works, the BBC Symphony gave the impression of relishing Sackman's rugged contrasts - rather more so, indeed, than earlier they had the glitter of Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto. But though the accompaniment may have been bland, the solo part was delivered with a sensational blend of virtuosity, sophistication and purring sweetness: Maxim Vengerov, 19 years old, was making his proms debut, in a way to cap even the most noteworthy of his previous London appearances. Another of Davis's special gifts is 20th-century English music of an older and, on the face of it, less challenging character, to which he brings such sweeping conviction that every ounce of original freshness is recovered. On Sunday, with the BBC Symphony Chorus and Orchestra, he revealed this gift anew. Delius's Sea Drift had Thomas Allen as a mature, affecting baritone soloist; John Ireland's Piano Concerto showed Kathryn Stott in sparkling form; in Elgar's The Music Makers Jean Rigby's rich-hued mezzo was at once powerfully emotional and tenderly reticent. All three works are Proms warhorses, yet Davis allowed no hint of laxity or routine to spoil their latest appearance there.</p>

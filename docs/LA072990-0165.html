			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL;  </P> <P> KANSAS CITY GIVING ACE SABERHAGEN LOTS OF ELBOW ROOM AFTER SURGERY  </P> <P> Credit Bret Saberhagen with wanting to recover quickly enough from arthroscopic  elbow surgery to pitch again this season.  </P> <P> Credit the Kansas City Royals with considering shelving Saberhagen until next  spring.  </P> <P> The competitive fire of the pitcher is rightfully being tempered by the  cautiousness of the club.  </P> <P> "(Saberhagen is) too valuable to fool around with," said Frank Funk, the  Royals' pitching coach. "There is no sense running guys like that out there to  pitch until they are ready. This is a million-dollar arm you're talking about."  </P> <P> Saberhagen, a two-time Cy Young Award winner from Cleveland High, had two rice  grain-sized bone fragments removed Monday from his pitching elbow. Team  officials described the surgery as successful and Saberhagen predicted he could  be throwing again in three to five weeks.  </P> <P> The Royals, however, are mired in last place in the American League West, and,  as of Saturday, trailed the first-place Oakland Athletics by 16 games. Nothing  Saberhagen, 26, can do in a few September starts can change that.  </P> <P> In addition, pitcher Mark Gubicza and outfielders Bo Jackson and Danny  Tartabull are out with injuries.  </P> <P> "We won't rush any of the players on the disabled list back into the lineup  until there is no question about their health," Royals Manager John Wathan  said.  </P> <P> Perseverance personified: His professional career began in frigid Medicine Hat,  Canada, and hung by a thread in sweltering Laredo, Mexico. But in his ninth  minor league season, Dave Walsh, a left-hander from El Camino Real High, is  finally on the verge of a call to the major leagues.  </P> <P> Walsh's numbers suggest the promotion is due: He leads the Albuquerque Dukes  with 12 saves, a 2.65 earned-run average and has a 5-0 record. Also, the Dukes  are the triple-A affiliate of the Dodgers, a team in need of left-handed relief  pitchers.  </P> <P> Walsh has risen from the scrap heap of rag arms to be reborn as a prospect at  age 29. "It would be awesome to be up there before I turn 30," he said of  pitching for the Dodgers. "But I take it one day at a time."  </P> <P> That's the only way he has survived an odyssey that included two knee  operations, tendinitis in his pitching shoulder, banishment to the Mexican  League and what Walsh describes as divine guidance.  </P> <P> Walsh, signed in 1982 out of the UC Santa Barbara by the Toronto Blue Jays,  wore out his welcome after bouncing around the Blue Jays bushes for six years.  </P> <P> "I woke up in the middle of the night this one Saturday and had a strong  feeling I was going to get released," he said. "I laid in bed and prayed over  whether I should quit or keep trying. The next day, sure enough, they called me  into the office and said they were sending me to Mexico.  </P> <P> "I started to laugh. They looked at me like I was crazy. I said, 'Hey, I'll  experience another culture.' "  </P> <P> Walsh flourished with Laredo, leading the league with a 14-1 record and a 1.73  ERA. His success caught the attention of the Dodgers, who thrust him into  Albuquerque's starting rotation last season.  </P> <P> The Dodgers soon had second thoughts: Walsh was 1-2 with a 5.00 ERA after six  starts. Down to his last chance, Walsh was sent to double-A San Antonio and  converted to relief. Although he was 2-6, his ERA was 3.72 and he notched two  saves. And he met a coach who believed in him -- former Dodger pitcher Claude  Osteen.  </P> <P> "Osteen taught me about getting power out of my legs," Walsh said. "I never  threw 90 miles an hour my whole life and now I do sometimes. It's amazing and I  owe it to Claude."  </P> <P> The new-found velocity is apparent; Walsh has struck out 60 and allowed only 45  hits in 54 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Can he do the same against National League hitters?  </P> <P> "I feel I am ready for the first time in my career, as far as control, my  pitches and my health," Walsh said. "I think the Dodgers are getting to know  who I am and what I am made of."  </P> <P> Playing Tags: Be wary, New York-Penn League pitchers and umpires. Gino  Tagliaferri is slowly regaining that swinging, swaggering feeling.  </P> <P> Tagliaferri set City Section records last season at Kennedy High for home runs  in a season and career. He also never hesitated to tell an umpire his opinion  of a call and once drilled a home run that landed on an arbiter's auto.  </P> <P> After signing with the Detroit Tigers for a $55,000 bonus last July, however,  Tagliaferri struggled to a .173 batting average for Niagara Falls of the  Class-A New York-Penn League. He struck out 54 times in 110 at-bats, hit only  three home runs and found that professional umpires don't take kindly to advice  from raw rookies.  </P> <P> Tagliaferri, 19, began this season with Fayetteville of the Class-A South  Atlantic League and hit .212 with four home runs in 58 games. Although he led  the team with 73 strikeouts, he hit a dramatic three-run home run against  Asheville on June 14 to help Fayetteville clinch the first-half Northern  Division championship.  </P> <P> Three days later, he was shipped back to Niagara Falls in what could be  considered a slight demotion. "As young as Gino is, the Tigers don't want him  down on himself," said Dan McD, a Fayetteville official. "They want him  somewhere he can prosper."  </P> <P> Tagliaferri's spirits plummeted, however, when he was told he was leaving  Fayetteville.  </P> <P> "They rushed me a little by sending me to Fayetteville in the first place, but  getting sent to Niagara was very disappointing and hard to cope with," he said.  </P> <P> His depression carried onto the field; he had only one hit in his first 12  games with Niagara Falls. Lately, however, the move has paid off the way the  Tigers envisioned: Tagliaferri has 22 hits in his past 25 games, including  three homers.  </P> <P> "I'm ready to pop," said Tagliaferri, who added that he has ceased popping off  to umpires. "I'm getting my confidence level back to where it was in high  school."  </P> <P> His three-run home run with two out in the eighth lifted Niagara Falls to a 9-6  victory over Utica last week. After primarily playing left field at  Fayetteville, Tagliaferri (5-11, 190) has moved back to third base, the  position he played last season. He was a shortstop in high school.  </P> <P> "I really enjoyed outfield when I was there," he said. "I've always loved  shortstop, but the first thing they did when I was signed was make me a third  baseman. Now I can see why. They want me to be a power hitter and the  shortstops here are little quick guys."  </P></p>

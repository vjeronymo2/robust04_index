			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> MIXED RESULTS IN LONG BEACH VERSION OF 'COWARDY CUSTARD'  </P> <P> "Cowardy Custard," at Long Beach's Studio Theatre, is new to the West Coast.  But it may look familiar to anyone who caught "Oh Coward!" in one of its local  incarnations.  </P> <P> These collections of songs, brief sketches and other reflections from the pen  of Sir Noel Coward are much like each other.  </P> <P> "Cowardly" begins with a rush of truncated solos, none of which has time to  make much of an impression. But the show catches its breath as the first half  goes on. It finally catches some real laughs in a rendition of "Mad About the  Boy," with verses sung consecutively by four disparate women characters, all of  them watching their idol in a movie theater. And certainly you've got to give  credit to any show that precedes intermission with a number titled "Why Must  the Show Go On?"  </P> <P> The second half begins with a rousing selection of music-hall numbers,  suggesting a lower, heartier class than the drawing room habitues we usually  associate with Coward. Some of these songs are sentimental ditties about  London, but the sentiment disappears in the next, strategically placed number,  "There Are Bad Times Just Around the Corner," the lyrics of which belie the  spirit of the melody. It's Coward at his wittiest.  </P> <P> The show was assembled by Gerald Frow, Alan Strachan and Wendy Toye and first  presented in London in 1972.  </P> <P> This cast is best in the group numbers, most of them adroitly directed by Kent  Johnson and choreographed by Roberta Kay. Carole Best's robust voice and  presence are especially memorable, and Alan Wager projects the slightly frantic  focus of a young social climber who hasn't quite made it to his destination.  But a couple of the men look too juvenile for Coward's worldly lyrics, and a  couple of the women sound excessively fluttery on occasion.  </P> <P> Musical director D. Jay Bradley not only provides most of the expert piano  accompaniment but also steps in to play Coward. He doesn't look much like  Coward, but he speaks and carries himself with a debonair bearing that's in the  ballpark.  </P> <P> A glittery strip across the step at the center of the stage looks too  meretricious for Coward. The costumes were coordinated (not designed) by Ryk  del Campo, but a few of them are trite or puzzling. A Nehru jacket and  miniskirt in a song called "Beatnik Love Affair" suggest the wrong decade. And  the cast got carried away with looking quaint in the music-hall medley.  </P> <P> At 5021 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at  2 p.m., through April 28. $12-$14; (213) 494-1616.  </P></p>

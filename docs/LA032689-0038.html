			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PERU'S LAND REFORM PROGRAM IS FAILING TO FEED ITS GROWING POPULATION  </P> <P> Though the ancient Incas thrived on this Andean nation's stingy soil, Peru  today has farming woes that drain its funds and leave it short of food.  </P> <P> Analysts say the major culprit is a land reform program, South America's  largest, that has failed to keep modern Peru's feeble farm production growing  at the same pace as the population.  </P> <P> "Agriculture was mortally wounded by the agrarian program," Peru's leading  newspaper El Comercio said in a recent editorial bemoaning the 20th anniversary  of the event.  </P> <P> Many people think the spreading chaos in Peru -- marked by the flight of  hundreds of thousands of highland peasants to city slums, a deep economic  recession and a leftist guerrilla insurgency -- has been aggravated by the  failure of land reform.  </P> <P> Politicians and agronomists alike are frantically seeking solutions, and they  hope recent legislation will help.  </P> <P> The issue is reflected by "The Castle," an ornate mansion on a former cotton  baron's estate. It sits like a fading symbol on the outskirts of Canete, an  oasis town on the desert coast, 100 miles south of Lima, the capital.  </P> <P> Like hundreds of other large farms, the estate's 1,500 acres were expropriated  and organized into a cooperative for the 100 peasant families who had worked  the land as virtual serfs.  </P> <P> Today The Castle lies abandoned and deteriorating, much like the agrarian  reform instituted by the leftist military ruler at the time, Gen. Juan Velasco.  </P> <P> But its surrounding fertile farmlands have begun to reflect their former glory  since the government allowed the cooperatives to be divided up among their  members.  </P> <P> "Under Velasco we all made good money, but no one wanted to work," said Jubilio  Ensiso, 42, one of The Castle's farmers. "They'd spend just four or six hours  in the fields.  </P> <P> "Now we put in twice that because we are working for ourselves."  </P> <P> Velasco's land reform program sought to break the aristocracy's grip over the  countryside.  </P> <P> About 22 million acres were redistributed, more land than in any reform program  outside of Cuba.  </P> <P> Productivity suffered as peasants with no management experience took control.  Analysts say the program eventually failed in a morass of inefficiency due to  poor planning and execution.  </P> <P> Fewer than 20% of Peru's landless peasants actually received land, according to  the Institute for Peruvian Studies, a private social research center.  </P> <P> Since the program began in 1969, farm output has grown slightly more than 1%  yearly, while the population grew by 2.5% a year.  </P> <P> As a result successive governments have had to increase imports of food  staples. The 1988 foreign grocery bill reached $600 million, one-quarter of  Peru's export earnings.  </P> <P> The problem was aggravated when the debt-strapped government of President Alan  Garcia late last year ran low of foreign currency to pay for the imports.  </P> <P> Sporadic shortages of wheat, dried milk and other staples have plagued Peru  since then, and the government has asked other nations for emergency food.  </P> <P> Modern farming woes contrast sharply with the success of the Incas, who  routinely had a surplus after feeding a population estimated at more than half  of Peru's current 21 million.  </P> <P> Though the Spanish destroyed the Incas' highly organized society, some of their  agricultural expertise, including desert irrigation canals and mountain  terraces, is still widely applied by Peruvian peasants today.  </P> <P> Five years ago the government drastically modified the failing reform program  and began allowing cooperatives to cut their lands into parcels, with equal  sections going to members to reap whatever profits they could.  </P> <P> Farmer Ensiso says output since then at the former cotton estate here has grown  about 20% since then, a figure he says is generally true of other cooperatives  that divided up their lands.  </P></p>

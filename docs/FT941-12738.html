			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Japanese increase helps Unitech A sharply higher contribution from its Japanese subsidiary and positive currency movements helped Unitech, the international electronic components and controls group, lift interim pre-tax profits by 62 per cent. Pre-tax profits jumped to Pounds 7.36m in the six months to November 30, up from Pounds 4.55m, on turnover ahead by 23 per cent to Pounds 144.5m (Pounds 117.2m). Exchange rate movements benefited pre-tax profits by Pounds 1.2m and added Pounds 6.1m to turnover. Earnings per share increased by 18 per cent to 4p (3.4p) and the interim dividend is up from 2.1p to 2.24p. The shares closed up 20p at 314p. Commenting on the results, Mr Peter Curry, chairman, said: 'Notwithstanding generally low demand and poor trading conditions in many of our markets, we are experiencing an improving sales trend in most regions.' Operating profits increased from Pounds 6.54m to Pounds 9.76m, boosted by substantial profit gains in both the power supplies and control products operations - partly offset by losses in the connectors div-ision. The power supplies division, which launched a new series of modular supplies last year, almost doubled its profits to Pounds 7.4m (Pounds 3.8m) with Nemic-Lambda, the 50.6 per cent-owned Japanese subsidiary, contributing Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 1.5m). The expanded control products division,also doubled its profit contribution to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1.3m) on sales of Pounds 26.6m (Pounds 17.6m). In contrast, the connectors division 'had a difficult half-year' and incurred a Pounds 1m loss compared with a Pounds 900,000 profit. COMMENT Despite the setback in connectors, Unitech is starting to benefit from increasing returns on its recent investments in new products, acquisitions and geographic expansion. With its business split roughly equally between Europe, North America and east Asia Unitech would be an early beneficiary of any general world economic upturn. Pre-tax profits this year should reach Pounds 15.5m generating 9.1p in earnings, but the premium rating - the shares are currently trading on a prospective p/e of 34.5 - reflects its valuable holding in a listed Japanese company.</p>

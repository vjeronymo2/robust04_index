			<p>BFN     [Text] Before leaving Moscow for Belgrade, Saturday,  Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told Interfax more  thought should be given to plans to join NATO's Partnership for  Peace [PFP] program.    Kozyrev wished allied aircraft had refrained from bombing  Serb positions near Gorazde pending consultations with Moscow.  He said Russia and NATO had agreed to launch special,  gentlemanly, relations on the basis of a more or less standard  pilot document.    According to Kozyrev, Russia wanted more than the end of  hostile relations with NATO. It wanted NATO to either learn to  promote full-scale cooperation with Russia or set thought on  integration into a mechanism that would be suited to meet new  reality. He wanted NATO to treat Russia as a great power.    And, Kozyrev would want Russia and NATO to promote more  serious and constructive relations in addition to signing a  pilot document of limited importance.</p>

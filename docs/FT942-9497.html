			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Foreign outrage at Japan tax rises European and US companies operating in Japan are receiving swinging increases in their tax bills, following systematic investigations of their profitability by the Japan's National Tax Agency. Tax increases running to hundreds of million dollars have been imposed on Coca-Cola, the US manufacturer of soft drinks, Roche and Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss pharmaceutical groups, and Hoechst, the German drugs group. Other big companies, including US chemicals group DuPont, are currently being assessed by the Japanese tax authority and fear similar increases. The National Tax Agency has alleged that many western companies have been under-reporting profits earned in Japan in order to minimise their tax bills. They accuse western companies of levying excessive royalty payments on their Japanese subsidiaries and associates. It is also alleged that the Japanese offshoots are being charged too much in transfer prices for materials imported from their parent companies in the west, to boost the profits of the central operation at the expense of the Japanese arm. Executives of the affected companies say privately that they believe the tax increases are a reprisal for substantial tax increases imposed on Japanese companies by the US Internal Revenue Service. The IRS alleged that Japanese companies have inflated the transfer prices at which they ship goods to their US subsidiaries. 'This is a really serious problem,' said Roche, which received a bill for Y10bn (Pounds 65.8m) in additional taxes for the three years between 1990 and 1992. Ciba-Geigy, which was charged an additional Y5.7bn in taxes for 1990 to 1993, said: 'This assessment is unjustified and outrageous . . . The company will use all possible avenues to oppose this assessment.' A Swiss official said Swiss tax officials would be visiting Japan in the coming week for talks on the tax increases with the National Tax Agency. Coca-Cola (Japan), which is the single largest taxpayer among foreign affiliated companies in Japan, is appealing against a Y15bn tax penalty recently levied, and also wants bilateral government talks. Hoechst refused to quantify how much increased tax it faced, but said it was appealing to a Japan-Germany intergovernmental tax committee. Mr Terry Symons, a partner of accountancy firm Price Waterhouse specialising in transfer pricing, said: 'The public face of the National Tax Agency is reasonable and co-operative. But at a local level, that co-operation is ignored, international rules are not understood and officials are aggressive.' He also warned: 'Some western companies are so concerned, they are considering not putting new investment into Japan.' Mr Mark Bedhingham, chairman of the European Business Community in Japan, said: 'There is a lot of vagueness and a lot of areas that require interpretation (in Japanese tax rules).' A Japanese Ministry of Finance official insisted the National Tax Agency followed OECD guidelines in deciding whether transfer prices were being set at excessive levels by western companies.</p>

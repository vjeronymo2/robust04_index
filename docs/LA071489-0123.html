			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Richard Beckman is still in graduate school at the University of New Mexico,  but his untitled large-scale sculpture in concrete and steel has a calm  strength and clean, unfussy presence that bodes well for the future. A majestic  spiral of rusted steel contains a graduated set of triangles; another spiral of  neatly riveted plywood looks like a giant Slinky; twin curved triangular pieces  made of concrete and steel rock low to the floor in separate rhythms.  </P> <P> The biggest piece (nearly 5 feet tall) is a large-gauge steel-mesh cube  suspended within a steel-mesh cylindrical enclosure. A sprinkling of small  rocks inside the piece -- sure to set up a racket as they slip from one resting  place to another -- suggest the cylinder has a kinetic function. This piece has  a rough-and-ready look, like a project a guy tinkers with endlessly in the  basement. Particularly after you see how elegant Beckman can be, its  awkwardness is refreshing.  </P> <P> Carl H. Johansen also lives in New Mexico. Paintings from his "Black Mesa"  series have the smart, knowing veneer that comes of slamming together bits and  pieces of art history.  </P> <P> In "Fascist's Dream," a big pretty-boy head lolls on its side as if broken off  from an insipid statue. Tiny glittered hearts rise to an image that could have  been painted by Charles Sheeler: a long red wall scooting back into the  distance under a harsh, raking light. A glimpse of an O'Keeffe-like black cross  set in a yellow glow; a small, busy painting of heads and flowers in harsh  mockery of Picasso's style and an insouciant strip of hot pink spritzed with  glitter complete this dizzy tour through a debauched and deadened brain.  </P> <P> Bits of Navajo rug, Matisse nudes and Van Gogh peasants tromp through this  series, but the overwhelming bogeyman to be exorcised here is late Picasso. His  ghost wanders into a painting called "Love Like This," which is otherwise a  more searching and quietly enigmatic affair. A twig of dried mullein looks like  a sea monster, caged within the chalked yellow walls of a large rectangular  space. Skinny, unravelled bits of carpet wander uncertainly. A painted pod-eyed  monster with a sword does battle. And there's a pretty large untenanted area of  black paint and flaked metal that gives these oddly evocative components room  to breathe.

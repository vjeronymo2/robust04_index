			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Six arrested at M3 route protest SIX people were arrested yesterday when demonstrators chained themselves to a crane being used to build an extension to the M3 motorway in a cutting through wildlife-rich Twyford Down near Winchester. About 300 objectors gathered for a rally close to the route of the proposed extension. The six were later released pending a decision about them by local senior police officers and the Crown Prosecution Service. The European Commission has accused the government of failing to undertake a proper environmental assessment of the route.</p>

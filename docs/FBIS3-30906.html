Ibrahim  Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, recently visited  the United States, where he held talks with top U.S.  personalities -- President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, the  secretary of state, his assistants, and U.S. congressmen. Can  you please inform our viewers about your trip and assess the  talks you held there?    [Rugova] My visit to the United States was very successful.  As you know, we have had continuous contacts with the United  States, the U.S. Congress, the Senate, and the State Department.  We had the honor and special pleasure to meet President Clinton  and Vice President Al Gore and their wives. President Clinton  personally expressed special gratitude to our peaceful movement  and the contribution that we have made to the stability in the  region, as well as continued support of the United States on the  Kosova issue and the Albanian question. Vice President Al Gore,  who was already familiar with the Kosova question, also  expressed his own support to the Kosova issue and a peaceful  solution to this question.    It was a special honor to attend the international prayer,  which has been held for more than 30 years in the United States,  where Mother Teresa was one of the central figures concerning  the Albanian question. Our presence at the morning prayer was  marked as an Albanian day in Washington and an affirmation of  our people. It was these particular moments that made the visit  a very successful and important one, particularly the meeting  with the U.S. President.    [Kelmendi] During the talks you held with high-level U.S.  personalities, you informed them about the grave situation in  Kosova, especially the repression and violence of the Serbian  occupying power, the economic situation, the humanitarian  question, and human rights and freedoms. What do the U.S.  officials think about these problems?    [Rugova] The United States, the U.S. Congress, and the State  Department know the situation in Kosova quite well. As you  know, they publish annual reports on Kosova, particularly the  State Department, on human rights. The last report was published  recently, and we received a copy while we were there. The  attitude is to support and assist Kosova in the future. Several  aid supplies administered by the U.S. Congress two years ago and  last year have arrived in Kosova this year, and they amount to  several million dollars. This was the concrete assistance that  has arrived in Kosova. Of course, I can also mention the  political and diplomatic assistance that will be extended to  Kosova in the future, as well as the good disposition on the  Kosova issue that has existed in U.S. state institutions for  years.    [Kelmendi] President Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher have several times asserted that they will not allow  the war to spread to Kosova, i.e., to the south front. At the  same time, the congressmen with whom you talked declared that  they will draft new resolutions on the question of Kosova and  they will support Kosova. How do you assess these stands, and  what do you expect in the near future in this direction?    [Rugova] The U.S. officials asserted that what President  Clinton and Mr. Christopher have said are serious statements, so  we will continue to wait for all these institutions to move  ahead on the Kosova question.    [Kelmendi] Mr. Chairman, let us go back to the end of last  year. You conducted a long tour of some European countries.  You were received by foreign ministers of those countries and  state ministers as well. This was, undoubtedly, a recognition  of Kosova's subjectivity and your legitimacy as president of the  republic of Kosova. After the talks with European and U.S.  personalities, how do you assess the situation in Kosova? What  do you expect this year? Is this a further acceleration toward  a peaceful solution of the Kosova question?    [Rugova] This is an increasingly great affirmation. As you  know, the tour I conducted at the end of last year in Europe and  this one in the United States is an increasingly great  affirmation of the Kosova issue and an international  subjectiveness or an international element of Kosova and its  further legitimacy. As you know and as we have often said,  these questions make up a process; thus, we should be organized,  have more contacts, and especially arrange a better organization  in Kosova. All these would be a contribution for the solution  of the Kosova question through peaceful and political means. To  tell the truth, everyone is concerned that no conflict or new  tragedy occurs in Kosova. That is why preventive measures  should be taken to avoid the worse, which would be very tragic  for the region and Kosova itself.    [Kelmendi] It is assessed that further sanctions against  Serbia will be one of the elements that will help to solve the  crisis in Kosova, and perhaps to stop the war in Bosnia. Did  you talk about the continuation of the sanctions against Serbia  and Montenegro, and are they in a way connected to the situation  in Kosova?    [Rugova] Concretely, in the United States we asserted that  these sanctions will not be abolished, but may be further  intensified. They are a means to exert pressure on Serbia, with  regard not only to other issues such as Bosnia and Croatia in  former Yugoslavia, but also to Kosova, because Kosova as well is  included in these conditions for the abolishment of sanctions.  For the moment we cannot talk about the abolishment of  sanctions, which certainly will be intensified.    [Kelmendi] Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg have summoned  a conference in Geneva today with the participation of the  neighboring countries of former Yugoslavia; they have called it  a consultative conference. What do you think, will this  conference discuss the question of Kosova? Will this be a  further step forward toward the solution of the Kosova problem,  especially when President Berisha declared that without solving  the Kosova issue there cannot be a solution of the Balkan  problems?    [Rugova] I agree with President Berisha's statement and I  consider this conference or this consultative meeting as a  consultation about the issues in former Yugoslavia which, of  course, the neighboring countries are interested in as well. As  you know, the neighboring countries were present at the London  conference. However, this was more an international meeting  where they had no possibility to tell their viewpoints so  openly, as far as I can remember. For us it is important  because Albania is there and of course, Albania will put forward  the question of Kosova and that of the Albanians living in their  ethnic territories. That is, this is important. It is a bit  early to say that this will be a step forward or a more positive  step. However, as a consultation it should be greeted. Of  course, even a solution to this problem will not be successful  without the neighboring countries and a global approach to all  the problems in former Yugoslavia, because this was one of the  central states of the Balkans.    [Kelmendi] We hope that the affirmation of Kosova in the  international relations will soon bring Kosova to the table for  talks at the required level as you have always demanded, as one  of the ex-units of former Yugoslavia, where a solution will be  found in conformity with the people's will expressed in a  referendum.    [Rugova] We hope and we are working in this direction. As  for a peaceful and political solution, of course we have thought  about it. We have requested international protection, a system  of civil protectorate that is more advanced, so as to normalize  life and institutions and then we can talk about the question of  Kosova. As we have mentioned several times, this is an idea and  question that is transmitted with interest by all institutions,  be they European, U.S., or international ones.    [Kelmendi] Mr. President, your meeting with President  Clinton is the first meeting of a Kosova president or a Kosova  representative with the U.S. President. This occasion reminds  us of the commitment of the former U.S. President Woodrow  Wilson. Can you tell us something for our viewers, how did this  meeting pass and in what atmosphere?    [Rugova] It was the first time that Kosova was accepted at  this level and the contact and talks were recognized. I can  personally say that it was a warm meeting with a great human  empathy on the part of President Clinton, which I had the  occasion to see directly. He had a great understanding on the  question of Kosova. Concerning the relation to President Wilson,  both are Democrats. However, this is not of great importance,  but I can say that the President of that time, President Wilson,  was a great man who managed to put the question of Albania  outside the question of the Adriatic, which meant the partition  of the Albanian question. I can say that his well-known 14  Points, a program for the security of democracy in the world,  were followed by President Bush with the collapse of communism  in the East. And today we find the same vocabulary in President  Clinton's policy, so as to promote a world security or in this  case, a European security, for the development of democracy,  which is very important. As a matter of fact, President Clinton  is a man of peace, understanding, and democracy. I had the  occasion to see this in my personal meeting with him which was,  I can say once again, a special honor to me and the people of  Kosova and the Albanians. I thank you very much, greeting the  viewers of this television satellite program as well.    [Kelmendi] Thank you.</p>

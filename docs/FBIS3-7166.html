			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Yi To-un from Vladivostok] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that 180 North Korean workers,  who escaped from North Korean logging sites in Russia, have  asked for political asylum in ROK missions, including the ROK  Embassy in Moscow. Following this, about 40 North Korean workers  asked for political asylum from the Russian Government.    Of these 40 North Korean loggers, four were officially  granted political asylum by the Russian authorities, and many  others were unofficially granted residence permission.    A relevant official in Vladivostok said on 23 March: About  40 North Korean workers asked for political asylum from the  Moscow authorities through human rights committees, lawyers  associations in Russia, and the Russian Ministries of Justice  and Foreign Affairs. With the help of lawyers and Korean  residents in Russia, they claimed political and economic  hardship, pointing out the situation of human rights being  infringed upon at the logging sites, and asked for political  asylum.    The official revealed that "the North Korean loggers, who  were granted residence permission after asking for political  asylum from the Russian authorities, are four in total,  including a certain Kim and a certain Yun whose permission was  granted in November 1992, and two other Kims, who were granted  permission early this year.    He added that "many North Korean workers were granted  residence permission unofficially, in addition to the number of  those officially announced by the Russian authorities."    Since the situation of human rights being infringed upon at  the North Korean logging sites has become an international  issue, the Russian Government took it as a policy to grant  political asylum to the loggers if there is no specific reason  for rejection. However, since so many workers asked for asylum  recently, the Russian authorities are temporarily withholding  granting it.    On the other hand, the North Korean side claimed that those  who asked for political asylum are all criminals, and strongly  demanded that the Russian Government not grant them asylum.  <H5>  This Issue Will Be Discussed Soon. </H5>   Concerning the situation in which a large number of workers  who escaped from the North Korean logging sites in Russia asked  for political asylum from the Russian authorities, the ROK  Foreign Ministry revealed that "it is aware of such reports but  failed to receive any concrete reports as to how many cases  there were." The ministry added that it will discuss the issue  of dealing with them with the Prime Minister's office, the  National Unification Board, the Agency for National Security  Planning, and other relevant organizations.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by C. Raja Mohan: ``Agni: India Should Stand Up to </F> Pressures'']    [Text] Washington, Feb. 20--With the successful third test  firing of the medium range Agni, an important phase in India's  missile development has come to an end. The scientific community  of the Indian Defence Research and Development Organisation  (DRDO) has delivered in a grand manner. It has proudly propelled  India into the league of great powers. Now it is up to the Prime  Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and the military services to  put the missile technology that has been demonstrated to the  best possible political and strategic use. There has been some  political dithering and vacillation in the past in the face of  external pressures to forego the development of India's missile  technology. Hopefully that phase of hesitation too has come to  an end.    The DRDO has now successfully demonstrated the key aspects  of  long range missile technology, effective integration of  different stages of the medium range missile and re-entry of the  warhead and its terminal guidance have now been proven. The Agni  missile can deliver a payload of one tonne over a distance of  1,500 km or a smaller warhead of 500 kg over a longer range of  2,500 km. The design of such payloads for the missile is well  within the competence of Indian scientists.    The leadership of the Indian military and political  establishment must now take the appropriate organisational,  financial and political decisions in conformity with the  national security needs. The late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi  had approved three test firings of the Agni missile as part of  technology demonstration of India's long range missile  capabilities. Mr. Rao now has the opportunity to transform this  technological demonstration into all important strategic asset.    To be sure, India must expect some negative reaction,  particularly from the U.S. to the successful testing of the Agni  missile. It is certainly likely that Washington may not lift the  sanctions against the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)  that expire in May 1994. If New Delhi can signal that it is  fully prepared to brush aside these pressures and proceed with  the operationalisation of the Agni missile, it will earn  grudging respect from the U.S. The alternative option of giving  up the development and deployment of the Agni can only be  disgraceful.  <H5>  Humiliating MTCR Conditions </H5>   It is possible that the U.S. will dangle the prospect of  lifting the sanctions on ISRO and even a membership of the  Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), if India is ready to  forego its missile development. Any such proposal deserves  nothing but contempt. India should not allow the U.S. or any  other nation to set Indian technological priorities. Besides,  the conditions for entry into the MTCR have been humiliating.  When Argentina was allowed into the MTCR last year, the U.S.  demanded and got rights to verify the complete destruction of  all components of its Condor missile programme. Brazil had last  week applied for the membership of the MTCR. It remains to be  seen what kind of conditions the U.S. will demand before it lets  in Brazil. India can join the MTCR only on one basis: in return  for abiding by the export control regulations of the MTCR, New  Delhi will have full access to the civilian space technologies.  India must make it clear it will accept restrictions on its  missile development and deployment only as part of a larger  global regime of missile disarmament.    There is little reason for India to be frightened by the  current rhetoric on nonproliferation or the immediate threats to  impose more restrictions on technology transfer to India. The  debate on export controls in the U.S. is undergoing a major  transformation. The American business community and the Commerce  Department are pushing for a substantive liberalisation of  export controls, driven as they are by the need to promote  American jobs and exports. The U.S. Defence Department, too,  motivated by the desire to protect the competitiveness of  American aerospace industry and its technological base, has come  round to supporting the loosening of export controls except in  the so-called ``choke-point'' technologies that are critical for  the manufacture of mass destruction weapons. Traditionally, the  Pentagon has been the most vocal opponent of liberal American  technology exports. As India expands its abilities to develop  and export space related technologies including missiles, the  U.S. will find that it is in its own interest to get India  participate in the missile technology control regime, as an  equal partner. In the final analysis, it is only those countries  that can show the determination to stand up to pressures that  will be accepted as great powers.    The Indian Government has two options on the Agni missile.  It  can decide on early deployment of a limited number of medium  range missiles. Or it can authorise more tests of the missile to  improve the overall design and reliability. The improvements in  particular could focus on a better ``aspect ratio,'' by reducing  the height of the missile and increasing its width.    India is said to have appropriate capability in solid  propulsion technology to achieve this. In any event, further  work on the improvement of the missile and an early decision on  its operational deployment need not be mutually exclusive.</p>

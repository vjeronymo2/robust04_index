			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW HOT THE GREENHOUSE?;  </P> <P> A HOT ENOUGH QUESTION TO REQUIRE SOLUTIONS  </P> <P> The industrial nations may be approaching a confrontation in which troops,  bombast or peace negotiations would be of little use. If it comes, the  confrontation would be with their own planet over matters of physics, chemistry  and the atmosphere -- items that are not negotiable.  </P> <P> The showdown involves the so-called greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide that  result from burning fossil fuels to produce energy. Not many scientists any  longer dismiss out of hand the theory that CO2 and other gases rise to the  stratosphere to form an envelope around the Earth that holds in warm air that  otherwise should escape to icy outer space.  </P> <P> One way to deal with the problem is both elementary and the most complicated  task humans have ever faced: Stop burning so much fossil fuel -- from oil to  logs.  </P> <P> But the United States, the largest producer of carbon dioxide, is balking at  rushing into mitigation measures. President Bush was so agitated recently by  demands from environmentalists to move faster that he blasted the Sierra Club  and other mainstream groups as extremists.  </P> <P> More and more, American insistence on irrefutable proof of risk before it takes  the greenhouse problem seriously enough to do something about it is isolating  the country from other, mostly European, countries. Still, the White House  argues that there are too many uncertainties to justify spending money to curb  emissions. It warns that trying to put caps on the gases that any country's  plants could let escape into the atmosphere could disrupt the economy.  </P> <P> The most recent demonstration of the gap occurred in Sweden at a meeting of  scientists from 75 countries. These were not men with long beards wearing  grubby robes and carrying signs that said: "Repent. The End Is Near." They are  students of the Earth's climate and, as Times writer Rudy Abramson reported  this week, this is generally what they said:  </P> <P>  -- An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change thinks the atmosphere will be  on average 5.4 degrees warmer by the end of the next century, an estimate the  panel also thinks probably is low.  </P> <P>  -- If humans take no steps to curb the greenhouse gases, oceans could rise 3  feet by the beginning of the 22nd Century. This could "displace tens of  millions of people, flood productive land and contaminate fresh water  supplies."  </P> <P> Against that background, capping emissions is precisely the direction in which  the United Nations is moving. The U.N. called for the assessment of the risks  of global warming that were discussed in Sweden. The final report is due in a  few months, and the tentative timetable calls for negotiating an international  pact to limit emissions by 1992.  </P> <P> To be sure, the White House has its hands full in the Middle East, but part of  what that crisis is about -- or should be -- is teaching Americans how to live  well on less fuel. That is all that the U.N.'s panel of scientists is talking  about when they urge reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Facing down a  daylight robber like Iraq's Saddam Hussein is one thing. Facing down the planet  itself is quite another matter.  </P></p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Further EC complication for contracting-out plans PUBLIC-SECTOR workers affected by contracting out may be able to refuse transfer to private-sector contractors and claim the substantial payments available under public-sector redundancy schemes, following a recent judgment at the European Court of Justice. Many UK lawyers believe the judgment in Katsikas v Konstantinidis could add another complication to government contracting-out plans dogged by the EC Transfer of Undertakings Regulations (Protection of Employment) - Tupe. The Tupe regulations often require that public-sector workers' pay and jobs are secured when their undertakings are transferred to the private sector. It has been believed, however, that where the regulations apply, the common law right to refuse to transfer to the new employer is superseded, with the effect that redundancy cannot be claimed from the old employer. But Ms Melanie Tether, employment law specialist at solicitors Norton Rose in London, said: 'The Katsikas case raises serious doubts about the legitimacy of this aspect of the regulations.' The case arose in the German courts when a restaurant business was sold. An employee refused to transfer to the new owner and claimed compensation from the old owner. German law, like UK law, allows an employee to object to the transfer but the new owner argued this was incompatible with Tupe. The European Court of Justice disagreed and said each member state could decide if employees should be given the option of resisting transfer. The UK government did not offer that option in the Tupe regulations. But, as it was thereby removing an old common law right, it may have been wrong under European law not to offer the option. Mr John McMullen of solicitors Simpson Curtis in Leeds said: 'The bombshell effect of this for companies is that they may be faced with a group of employees who refuse to transfer and are therefore entitled to claim termination payments.'</p>

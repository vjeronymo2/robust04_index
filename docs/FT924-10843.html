			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Benefits freeze 'considered' PAPERS suggesting that ministers are considering freezing certain social security benefits or uprating them by less than the rate of inflation were published by Labour yesterday, as part of the opposition's pre-emptive strike on the government's public spending plans. The documents, released by Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, discuss the presentational difficulties for the government of being tougher on those who are sick or disabled than on those who are able to work. The cabinet will today have its first opportunity to discuss the spending plans drawn up by the public expenditure committee chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Ministers will be able to discuss the options thoroughly, but are unlikely to make firm decisions until next week's meeting. Social security ministers insist that the Tories' manifesto commitments will be met. In strict terms, these are limited to uprating child benefit and the basic state pension in line with the rate of inflation. Some benefits, such as invalidity benefit, currently have to be uprated in line with inflation, though this link could be broken if the government brought forward legislation to do so. Others merely have to be reviewed each year, though the means-tested ones usually are raised. The documents suggest that in his meetings with Treasury ministers Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, will want to point out the presentational problems 'of benefit freezes affecting the poorest to raise tax allowances for those in work'. Mr Dewar said that the papers, dated around the end of last month, show that the question of benefit freezes had been on the agenda, and called on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to say in advance of the Autumn Statement if the idea of under-indexing had been discarded. 'It would be a political blunder, even by the standards of this chancellor, to hit those on benefit - the sick and the unemployed - in an effort to bail out the Treasury,' Mr Dewar said.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Survey of Factoring (6): Fall-out from a scandal - Italy has had a lively year THE word factoring has entered the Italian vocabulary during the past year as a result of the collapse of the state Federconsorzi agricultural organisation last May, and the subsequent failure of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro's (BNL) Agrifactoring subsidiary. After the scandal involving unauthorised lending to Iraq through its Atlanta branch, Agrifactoring's failure was the last kind of news that BNL needed. Shown in the bank's books as being its third largest factoring subsidiary, with turnover of L2,602bn in 1990, Agrifactoring recorded factoring assets totalling L1,446bn in its balance sheet at year-end 1990 and had liabilities of L1,224bn towards banks and L233bn towards medium term institutions. Through Agrifactoring and more than 20 other companies in the factoring sector, BNL Group enjoyed clear market leadership in 1990, winning a share of more than 43 per cent of total Italian turnover. (The Group continues to maintain this lead position.) Its Ifitalia subsidiary, Italy's biggest single factoring company, with turnover of L9,478bn in 1990's total market of L71,774bn, was the first in the business in Italy when it started operations in 1963. But the prestige of being biggest and first has been tarnished by the Agrifactoring affair. BNL's treatment of the liabilities of the company, shown in its accounts as 50 per cent owned, and generally considered as being under the Italian bank's operational control, has led to ostracism by international banks. Agrifactoring's assets were suddenly eroded when Federconsorzi collapsed, and its creditors, which include big foreign banks, have been left facing significant losses. BNL's refusal to assume the liabilities of its Agrifactoring subsidiary has caused bad-feeling and distrust, and has led to credit lines being cut, particularly to the Italian bank's parabanking subsidiaries. However, while BNL's wriggling and foot-shuffling over Agrifactoring has cut a poor figure, causing a German banker to comment that 'Africa starts south of the Alps', it has had no real effect on factoring business. Alessandro Carretta, general secretary of Italy's Assifact factoring association, says, 'Agrifactoring's problems had nothing to do with factoring. It was a matter of incorrect management.' Indeed Italy's factoring sector continued on its upward trend in 1991, albeit more modestly than in previous years. Depending on measurement criteria, factoring grew last year by between 9 and 15 per cent. 'Though this is much lower than in the 1980s when annual growth of over 30 per cent was recorded, last year's figures show that factoring is still a growing business,' says Mr Carretta. The slowdown is due partly to general economic conditions in Italy, business having been feeling the effects of recession since the end of 1990. But Mr Carretta points to another factor that has been influencing factoring business: legislation introduced at the beginning of last year. 'This offers advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, there are now safeguards toring that were formerly lacking, and the possibility of offering new types of operation and products. But, on the other hand, the establishment of a roll of authorised factoring firms at the Bank of Italy and the designation of the central bank as the supervisory body may represent a brake on development,' explains Mr Carretta. Biagino Vismara, the executive responsible for parabanking at the Italian banking association ABI, considers that the Bank of Italy's role as supervisor is appropriate. The move will bring uniform treatment to factoring companies of banking and non-bank parentage. 'The sector is now waiting for the Bank of Italy to publish its regulatory framework,' notes Mr Vismara. One of the matters on which interest focuses is asset ratios. Indeed, the slowdown in factoring growth may partly be due to companies' reluctance to expand before knowing what ratios they will have to satisfy. Mr Carretta wonders if the introduction of asset ratios will change the character of factoring in Italy. Captive factors, serving large industrial groups, have been a feature of a market in which they hold a share of about 35 per cent. Will this now decline? 'Captive factors have tended to expand away from servicing group subsidiaries to seek business among suppliers and elsewhere in the market, but generally their asset ratios are more fragile than banks' factoring companies,' says Mr Carretta. Mr Vismara describes captive factors as nothing more than administrative departments, providing just a financial service. But this basic service lies at the origins of factoring in Italy, when credit ceilings limited lending by banks and forced business, and the banks themselves, to other sources of finance. Notwithstanding the end of credit ceilings, Italian factoring has continued to concentrate predominantly on financial aspects rather than high added value service. 'This means that factoring customers are often now high risk borrowers', comments a northern banker. But the situation may be changing. Encouraged by crowding, high risk and low profitability in Italy's domestic market, the Italian factoring subsidiary of Barclays Bank has chosen to emphasise its capability of providing full sales ledger management service, particularly for foreign operations. Its global network and expertise has allowed it to take leadership in international factoring in Italy. Others seem likely to emulate Barclays. Both Mr Vismara and Mr Carretta predict increasing emphasis on higher service content in factoring.</p>

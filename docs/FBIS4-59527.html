			<p>BFN     [Text] The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] politburo has  announced a political initiative aimed at ending the fighting in  Yemen. The initiative includes eight [as heard] points: The  question of the immediate cessation of the war is the first  point of the initiative.    The second point provides for the formation of a national  salvation government, which would attempt to eliminate the  effects of the war.    The third point stresses the maintenance of what is left of  the Armed Forces, as well as their reorganization, in addition  to the disengagement of forces currently confronting each other.  The attacking forces must be withdrawn to their former pre-war  positions.    The fourth and fifth points of the initiative refer to the  protection of the lives of the citizens and their possessions,  and to fair compensation for those who have been harmed. The  victims of the war, both civilian and military, should be  regarded as martyrs.    Political and military detainees should be released. The  detention, pursuit, or torture of any political or military  elements should be prevented. Likewise, the looting of  citizens' property should not be allowed. Looted goods should  be restored to the owners, or those owners should be  compensated. Parties' rights to exercise political activitity,  in accordance with the Constitution and the law, should be  recognized.    The seventh point [as heard, no mention of sixth point]  stipulates that there should be no withdrawal from the  implementation of the pledge and accord document.    The eighth point of the political initiative put forward by  the YSP proposes that the national salvation government  investigate those who caused the war and its declaration.</p>

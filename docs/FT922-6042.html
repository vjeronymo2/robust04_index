			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Observer: Backing group 'If you shake my hand on a deal then you had better be absolutely bloody sure you know what you are shaking it for' is the latest Peter de Savary message. Observer hopes the movers and shakers behind BusinessAge also know what they have let themselves in for. Tom Rubython, who has created the new magazine - featuring the said de Savary as its cover story - out of the embers of the late Management Week, is certainly amazed. 'The investors have left it completely to us. It's very odd, isn't it?' Rubython, former editor of Management Week, which folded in December, had the idea of approaching 2,000 subscribers of the ill-fated publication to see if they would invest in the new venture. A total of Pounds 900,000 was raised from 171 backers. One name featured in the Sunday Times list of Britain's 300 richest men sent Pounds 300,000 on condition his identity remained secret. Most reader-investors, who together control 80 per cent of the equity, have invested between Pounds 100 and Pounds 10,000. With such a disparate range of shareholders, Rubython is convinced he will have total editorial freedom. But not everyone will be completely satisfied with the new magazine. In a letter published in the first issue, John Gammon of Hawkshead Consultants said he was disappointed with Management Week because there were too many articles about the likes of Donald Trump and Madonna. And what is on page 66 of BusinessAge? Madonna: America's Smartest Businesswoman.</p>

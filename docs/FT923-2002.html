			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): 'Come back inflation, all is forgiven' - The Fund Managers' View PROFESSIONAL fund managers who saw interest rates and stock prices gyrate wildly this week are still pausing for breath. David Rough, investment director at the UK insurer Legal and General, urged caution before taking a view on stock or bond markets. 'I'd be a lot happier if I knew exactly what the government's policies are,' he said. If the government has decided to allow a decline in real interest rates  - the difference between inflation and bond yields - the overall picture could be good for equities. But, if the decoupling of sterling from the ERM is a temporary affair, and John Major is still aiming for zero-inflation growth, the picture could be very different. 'After the French vote (on whether to ratify the Maastricht Treaty) on Sunday, I think we will have a clearer idea,' Rough said. But with stock prices up 8 per cent in two days, fund managers are queueing to jump on the equities bandwagon. 'The move to deflate sterling is very bullish for equities,' said Hugh Sloane, investment director at GT Management. 'Now that sterling has been floated there is a good chance that the UK can move out of recession.' Already, GT Management has decided to increase its weighting in UK equities from 50 per cent of its total portfolio to something comfortably above that, he said. GT Management wants equities of companies with large overseas earnings which, with a weak sterling, will produce hefty increases in revenues. Shares of companies which are well-placed to benefit from a pick-up in the UK economy look attractive. The banking sector is likely to benefit as lower interest rates ease pressure on hard-pressed borrowers who may be facing repayments difficulties. Simon Walters, investment director of Save &amp; Prosper, says that a watershed occurred on Wednesday when Britain withdrew from the ERM. 'The restrictions of the ERM have vanished. Come back inflation, all is forgiven.' The result is good news for equities, he argues, and cyclical, high-yielding stocks have already started to outperform. However, the market has already risen to reflect one and probably two percentage points off base rates. If that fails to happen the market may be disappointed. Nevertheless, Walters is looking forward to an export-led boom and he also believes there could be a psychological boost to the consumer sector if rates drop back into single figures. Michael Hart, joint manager of Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, says it has benefited this week from its big overseas currency exposure. 'If the French vote Yes, I wouldn't be surprised to see UK rates coming down another notch,' Hart says. 'Given the sharp rally in UK shares, there's no need to race into the stock market at this level; we've been nibbling away at lower prices. But we've always been enthusiasts for equities and some institutions may be having second thoughts about their recent move into bonds.' Julian St Lawrence, a UK fund manager at Framlington, says that 'We'd be more cautious than the markets about the speed of interests rate changes, and thus we could see a correction to the recent rise. 'Nevertheless, equities have offered a pretty low return over the last few years, and are down in real terms from their peaks of 1987. And we are particularly interested in small and medium-sized company shares, which have some catching up to do.' St Lawrence warns that devaluation will lead to higher prices. 'We would be surprised if the previous rule of thumb did not apply this time - that a 10 per cent devaluation leads to 10 per cent in inflation spread over a three to four year period.'</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Citibank proposes limited liability for Lloyd's Names A plan that could bring further sweeping changes to Lloyd's of London by allowing many Names to trade in the insurance market on the basis of limited liability was unveiled yesterday. Citibank, the subsidiary of US group Citicorp, announced proposals that would enable Names to convert from unlimited liability - the long-established system of trading - without breaking Lloyd's rules. The proposals, drawn up with members' agencies which look after Names' interests, could lead to a further reduction in the number of traditional Names, the individuals whose assets have historically supported the Lloyd's insurance market. Names have been hit by heavy losses in recent years and the number actively underwriting has fallen from 32,000 in 1988 to less than 18,000 this year. Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, said yesterday that most Lloyd's Names may convert in the next few years - though higher returns offered by unlimited liability would continue to attract a minority. 'There will be a strong caucus - perhaps 3,500 - who will opt to remain exactly as they are, on unlimited liability,' he said. Citibank's proposals await approval by Lloyd's authorities but have been drawn up in consultation with its officials. The plan will be considered by Lloyd's on November 4. Main features include a 'reinsurance' agreement by which Names would transfer liabilities outstanding on policies they have underwritten previously to an individual company, or 'Name-Co'. This would not isolate them completely from past exposures but offer some protection. Lloyd's has agreed that NameCos should hold a minimum of Pounds 100,000 at the insurance market, compared with the Pounds 1.5m required from companies set up in the past few years to inject corporate capital into the market. To make the scheme more attractive, Citibank has arranged for some of those taking up the scheme to buy a separate reinsurance policy which will have the effect of increasing their funds held at Lloyd's - allowing them to underwrite more business. If substantial numbers of Names transfer to limited liability, the process could become unstoppable. A dwindling number of unlimited liability Names would, in effect, become insurers of last resort. They might therefore want to convert as well. At an Association of Lloyd's Members conference yesterday, Mr Middleton said to avoid that problem the insurance market needed transitional arrangements leading to a strengthening of assets available to Lloyd's.

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Companies warned to protect environment A MALAYSIAN court order suspending production at a joint-venture chemical plant of Mitsubishi Kasei, the leading Japanese chemical maker, prompted the Japanese government to warn yesterday that all factories abroad must do no harm to the environment. The Ipoh High Court decision, including an order to remove radioactive waste from the site, embarrassed Tokyo, which wants to take a lead in environmental issues and has denied claims that Japanese industry is relocating allegedly hazardous factories in poorer countries. Mitsubishi, with a one-third stake in the Asian Rare Earth facility producing materials for the electronics industry, said it was surprised by the finding and was 'studying what action we should take'. Japan's ministry of international trade and industry (Miti) yesterday discussed the case with Mitsubishi Kasei and issued a formal caution to the company. Miti officials said all Japanese companies would be again urged to ensure foreign investments do not create environmental problems; they would study the Malaysian court decision before deciding on further action in this case. The court found that suspending production at the plant was necessary to protect people in a village near Ipoh from the waste. Eight had demanded damages and the suspension of production, though the judge rejected the damages claim. Renewed debate is now expected in Tokyo over legislation scrapped last year that would have demanded Japanese companies abide by strict domestic standards in running their foreign factories.</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / The ERM murders: Fear stalks the world's markets as a serial killer leaves his bloody trademark on the currencies of innnocent countries. Young Poirot interviews the suspects 'OFTEN, a crime requires a fortuitous opportunity as well as a pre-existing motive,' observed Jacques Poirot. FOR POIROT, chief of the internal investigations secretariat at the European Commission, this was the denouement of perhaps his most remarkable case. It was, he mused, one which his more famous uncle, Hercule, would have found truly fascinating. He looked around the room at his distinguished suspects. There was Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission himself, impatiently fingering a large file labelled DANEMARK. Norman Lamont, the British chancellor of the exchequer, was hurriedly putting a Thresher's Christmas drinks price brochure back into his briefcase. George Soros, the celebrated international speculator, seemed preoccupied with a mobile paging device on which numbers were moving across a display. Only Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, seemed fully at ease, in the manner of a man who was content in the knowledge that he had done a good job. 'I must apologise, messieurs, for detaining you so close to Christmas,' Poirot said. 'But I believe it is vital to clear this matter up ahead of the holidays, before the seasonal festivities have a negative effect on the performance of the little grey cells. 'I am referring, of course, to what have become popularly known as the ERM murders. It may be fanciful to talk about currencies as if they were people, but consider the sequence of events. First, the vicious attack on the Finnish markka. So small and so vulnerable, it posed no threat to anybody, and yet it was ruthlessly gunned down by speculators. Then came the demise of the Italian lira. Some argue that the lira deserved all it got. But the circumstances were still disturbing. 'Next, the sterling pound. Perhaps it had behaved. . . how shall I say?. . . somewhat provocatively. But did it merit such a fate? I think not. And so on, with the peseta, the escudo and others, all cut down without mercy. Only this month the Swedish krona succumbed after a long period on life support. 'In other words, an inexplicable series of exchange rate disasters which surely cannot be random but must have a common connection. It may be difficult, however, for many people to understand this here in Brussels, where serial killings are normally associated with abuses of the Common Agricultural Policy.' If his stony-faced listeners understood the pun, they showed no signs of doing so. 'Forgive me,' Poirot continued. 'You are right, this is indeed a matter tres grave. I shall now come to the point.' He walked down the table, and then stopped opposite Delors. 'I am afraid you are not just here as an observer, as you were led to believe, monsieur. It is difficult for me to make accusations against my own boss. But the logic of the evidence is such that I must give voice to my suspicions.' 'Me, a suspect?' rasped Delors. 'This is intolerable. You were supposed to find the guilty people in the markets, not make wild accusations against your seniors. In any case, you must be quite mad. Nobody is more committed than I am to the EMS, to the single market, to EMU and the European ideal. I have proved it again and again, most recently by saving the Community from the dreadful British presidency.' 'Peut-etre, mon President. But the remarkable feature of this case is that the motives of the leading suspects are not at all what they seem] In your own case, there is a conflict. It is no secret that you hope to become the next president of France in 1995, perhaps sooner.' Poirot nervously fingered his moustache. 'How much stronger your chance might be if you could arrange that the franc should be the new core currency of the European monetary system. Now, all rivals have been eliminated except, of course, the D-Mark. Perhaps that will be your next target.' 'However, you are not my chief suspect.' Jacques Poirot shifted his gaze further along the table. 'Herr Schlesinger, you were always a more plausible perpetrator of this crime. You behaved aggressively in raising interest rates, regardless of the position of your ERM partners. There were press reports of interviews in which you apparently sought to undermine the security of certain currencies. Schlesinger snorted. 'Those accusations have all been completely answered,' he snapped. 'I did not say those things, and if I did say them they were not authorised to be printed. The Bundesbank has always been completely committed to the ERM, so long as it is run in the way we require.' 'Exactement, monsieur,' responded Poirot. But I suggest that the signing of the Maastricht treaty a year ago unleashed strong emotions in you. After all, the very future of your beloved Bundesbank was threatened. It would be replaced by a European central bank in the council of which the views of countries such as Italy and Britain would become important. Just think how inflationary that would be] Your anger could lead to a crime passionel]' Poirot paused. 'Perhaps a plan for sabotage came into your mind. A hint of conflict here, a failure to communicate a message there. If carried out with skill and ruthlessness the whole ERM could be destroyed, Maastricht would be discredited and the Bundesbank would survive]' 'You can prove nothing]' Schlesinger cried. 'I am but a public servant. I carry out my duties according to the law. If other countries fail to listen to what I say it is they who must accept the consequences.' Poirot nodded. 'Indeed, I have come to the conclusion that you had the motive but not the daring of the true criminal,' he observed. 'But you, George Soros, have the reputation of being the executioner of the markets. To destroy a currency would give you no pang in the conscience at all.' Soros lifted his eyes briefly from his prices monitor. 'It is true that I am a lifelong student of the financial markets,' he said. 'But as I explained in my book on the theory of reflexivity, a speculator must respond to market movements, not attempt to influence them. My activities may be embarrassing for governments that follow unwise policies, but the money I make is not wasted. Only last week I gave Dollars 50m to help the suffering people of Bosnia.' 'Truly an assassin with a heart of gold]' murmured Poirot. 'But if you were indeed an assassin, who hired you? In the course of my investigations I began to think about the possibility of a conspiracy involving elements here in the Brussels Commission itself. We have all heard the rumours, of activists eager to expand the role of the Community, for instance in the Yugoslav crisis, but baulked by member governments unwilling to cede sovereignty or provide funds. 'No government has been more obstructive than that of Britain. So it would surely have been tempting for the conspirators to arrange a trap for the British government. This would be poetic justice] The British, so keen to restrict their spending, would be lured into a situation in which they would stupidly waste billions in a vain attempt to support sterling.' Norman Lamont, silent until then, rose to his feet in protest. 'I say, that's most unfair,' he protested. 'We had a very clear strategy, and in fact we did not devalue sterling, it was just that it floated downwards.' Poirot twirled his moustaches again. 'Bien sur,' he said. But the fact is that British money is now pouring into Bosnia, and the British government can do absolutely nothing to stop it] But now, if you will kindly sit down, M Lamont, I will turn to your part in this unfortunate affaire.' He paused for effect. 'You, of all people, surely had no motive for finishing off European currencies, least of all your own. And yet there were some curious inconsistencies in your behaviour that puzzled me. During the summer, you repeatedly protested that maintaining the pound at a central rate of DM2.95 was the only possible policy. The alternative, you said, according to my recollection, would be a 'snip and run' policy leading to inflation. For months you protested that you would never devalue. But in the end you pulled out of the ERM almost without a fight. Did you protest a little too much? My suspicions were aroused. 'And then, within the past few weeks, a possible explanation emerged. You were involved in newspaper publicity concerning a tenant in your house, a Miss Whiplash I believe. You evicted her, but it emerged, we know not from where, that Pounds 4,700 of your legal costs were paid for by the Treasury.' 'There's nothing in it,' snapped Lamont. 'It was all officially approved and totally above board. The costs all resulted from my official position as chancellor of the exchequer.' 'Exactly so,' responded Jacques Poirot. 'And yet you knew you were not popular within your party. There have been other criticisms. Permit me to suggest that you received advance notice that this Miss Whiplash leak was likely to occur. You thought it advisable to create a diversion. So the sterling crisis came as an unexpected opportunity. 'Your improvised plan was simplicity itself. You would blame the sacrifice of sterling on the Germans and on speculators. The premier and rest of the party would be forced to support you because of their anti-European policies. Then, when the matter of the legal costs became public, it would seem to be a minor affair, and would present no further threat to your position.' Norman Lamont laughed. 'I came expecting an explanation of the attacks on European currencies,' he said, 'but we have simply been given four ludicrous theories, all totally unproveable.' 'Not quite unproveable,' replied Poirot. He pulled a small piece of paper out of his pocket, with a flourish. 'You really should not have been so careless as to write incriminating instructions on the back of your wine merchants' sales slip. It says: 'Access restricted. 16.09 short. Tell cellars.' 'Allow me to explain. The first two words plainly represent a security classification. Then comes the explicit warning of the date of Black Wednesday. Finally, there is an instruction to your friends in the markets, although unfortunately your spelling is not very good. It confused me until I realised you meant 'sellers'.' Lamont rose and turned towards the exit. 'There is not a scintilla of doubt about my innocence,' he said. 'My character will never be devalued. I am tired of hearing quack solutions to these problems.' Jacques Poirot sighed. It was as he had feared. 'Eh bien, the evidence is clear,' he murmured. 'They are all guilty.'</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Hong Kong plans old-age pension scheme The Hong Kong government, usually noted for being non-interventionist, yesterday proposed an old-age pension scheme requiring compulsory contributions from personal and corporate taxpayers, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. The territory, which has a comparatively low tax regime, has minimal welfare services and no pension scheme for its aged residents. But it has recently debated the establishment of a government-administered scheme similar to Singapore's. Under a consultation paper issued for comment, Hong Kong workers and companies would have to contribute 1.5 per cent of earnings to a pension fund that would be run by a non-government body. The government would inject HKDollars 10bn (USDollars 1.28bn) to kick-start the scheme. It would also have to contribute about HKDollars 1.2bn in 1994 on behalf of its civil servants if the scheme became operative. The government estimated it also would forego around HKDollars 800m in revenue as employers contributed to the pension fund. Hong Kong's personal tax rate is currently 15 per cent and the corporate tax rate 16.5 per cent. Governor Chris Patten said there was a deep-seated view that the community needed to do more for its elderly. 'We've put forward proposals which recognise the debt, the obligation which the whole of our society owes to our elderly citizens who've helped build and create Hong Kong and have made it the great success which it is,' Mr Patten told reporters. No start date has been recommended for the scheme, proposed in a consultation paper that invites public comment by October. A pension payment of HKDollars 2,300 (USDollars 295) a month, to be adjusted with inflation, would be paid to residents aged 65 and above who have lived in the territory for a continuous period of seven years or more. There would be no exemptions for contributors to voluntary retirement schemes. China would be required to continue the scheme after it resumes sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997. Mr Patten said he had written to Mr Lu Ping, China's top official with responsibility for Hong Kong affairs, to inform him of the proposal.</p>

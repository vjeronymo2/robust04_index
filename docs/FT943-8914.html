			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Chambers call for reform of tax rules Tax rules should be reformed to cut the administrative burden on employers, says the British Chambers of Commerce in its technical Budget submission to the chancellor. Businesses are spending too much time calculating whether the Pounds 50 tax threshold on annual employee parties has been breached, or what proportion of travel counts as expenses when an employee goes directly from home to an off-site location, say the chambers. The submission says: 'Current rules on Schedule E (PAYE) benefits and expenses are needlessly complicated in relation to their yield,' It calls for 'a simplified approach more in keeping with modern flexible labour patterns'. It says costs incurred by employers that bring no benefit to employees should be excluded. The submission argues that smaller businesses are disadvantaged by tax rules on staff canteens and creches, especially in London where employees travel long distances to work. The 15p a day tax-free part of luncheon vouchers should be increased, it says, and the upper limit for benefits in kind should be raised to match the higher tax threshold - Pounds 23,700 a year. These recommendations come partly in response to a survey of small companies in which 53 per cent of respondents said the regulatory burden on management cut profitability. Ninety-two per cent complained of the time taken to administer value added tax. Other measures called for by the chambers include: Indexation of capital gains and losses, with capital gains tax-exempt on long-term investment plans; Raising the exemption band for inheritance tax to Pounds 200,000 with a view to abolishing it eventually; Cutting excise duty on beer, wine and spirits to reduce the gap between the UK and the rest of the EU; Exclusion of diesel from the planned 5 per cent increase in fuel duty.</p>

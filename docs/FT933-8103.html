			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / New wealth tax for Pakistan THE PAKISTANI government is this week expected to announce a new wealth tax on landowners, and also a possible income tax on agriculture, according to senior officials. The taxes would be seen as a breakthrough by the government of Mr Moeen Qureshi, the interim prime minister who was appointed last month. Pakistan's influential landowners are exempt from paying income and wealth taxes, and former prime ministers Mr Nawaz Sharif and Ms Benazir Bhutto both failed to widen the tax net to include the landowners, for fear of a political backlash. However, Mr Qureshi, a former vice-president of the World Bank, says that he does not intend to seek political office after the elections which are due in October. The interim government's determined stance is also expected to contain tough new measures in an effort to curb expenditure. These include cutting the number of federal ministries, and a drive to prevent tax evasion and improve the public sector's financial position by raising utility charges and recovering arrears. Meanwhile, Pakistan's central bank this week raised its discount rate from 15 to 17 per cent in an effort to encourage savings. The commercial banks have since followed suit, raising their interest rates by 2 per cent to 22 per cent. The rises have jolted both money and stock markets, with some financial analysts and businesses expressing concern that they could depress rather than stabilise the economy.</p>

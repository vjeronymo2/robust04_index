			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich with </F> unidentified reporters from the Belarusian Television and Radio  Company and Belinform on 12 January; place not given -- live or  recorded; in Russian unless otherwise specified]    [Text] [Reporter] Certain events that occurred in 1993 are  now being widely discussed. I am referring to the unification  of the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems. People are  calling us and asking about the motives behind this step, how  and when this will happen. The main question is: In what way  will the Belarusian economy and the man in the street gain from  this? Please, comment on these government actions.    [Kebich] I want to go back in history. As you know, I have  always been an advocate of a close economic union with all CIS  states. However, some politicians have failed to understand the  advantages of such a union. The conference of Belarusian and  Ukrainian entrepreneurs in which I participated today,  demonstrated that nostalgia for the economic union, and not just  nostalgia, but also new circumstances force entrepreneurs to  unite. Speaking of Russia and the Republic of Belarus, you know  that the two states are so closely integrated that in fact, we  cannot exist without one another. With regard to Belarusian  power resources, we totally depend on Russian supplies. Russia  supplies us with 50 to 60 percent of metals and other raw  materials. Russia in fact, remains the only market for our  products. We have reached some very negative phenomena and this  forced people who are not selfish...perhaps neither Kebich nor  Ivanov nor Petrov need that; our people need a close economic  union. Such a union means equal prices for power resources for  Russian and Belarusian consumers, eliminating all quotas,  duties, and tariffs.... In fact, this will lead to a reduction  of prices. Wholesale prices will decrease following a decrease  in production costs and then, retail prices will go down as well.    Is it not a sad experience seeing people who went on  Christmas vacation, forgive me the word, still not working.  Healthy people who should operate machines and make products  are spending time on the lakes fishing. The people do not  understand what happened. They ask: Where are you, politicians?  What are you preoccupied with? What are you doing? I am  currently doing the will of my legislature that decreed the  unification of monetary systems and the formation of an economic  union with Russia.    My recent meeting with Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin  that lasted some three and a half hours led us to the conclusion  that we are culturally, spiritually, and morally affiliated. We  realized that the two states' economic systems are similar and  that we need each other. Why should Russia build a plant like  our BelAZ when we have difficulties selling our trucks? Huge  prices for power resources make our products uncompetitive not  only in the West, but also on CIS markets. All these factors  brought about the signing of the agreement between the two  states. We decided to sign it in Minsk which is the CIS capital  to demonstrate that we made first steps toward [reforming] our  economies. We are moving on from multilateral to bilateral  relations.    [Reporter] [words indistinct]    [Kebich] As far as I know, I have been told by our  ambassador, that as a result of today's negotiations [between  Shushkevich and Yeltsin], orders were given to prepare for the  signing of the agreements as soon as possible. During my  meetings with the Russian leadership it was precisely envisioned  that this should be done in January.    [Reporter] Could you say what issues have been left  unresolved?    [Kebich] There will be no more declarations. Bilateral  relations between Chernomyrdin and Kebich, the two prime  ministers, will be signed [as heard]. All the agreements but  one have been already ratified by ministers or their deputies.  Thus, the signing of these 12 agreements will denote that our  monetary systems have been unified.    [Reporter] Considering that these agreements are so  advantageous for Belarus, what caused opposition against their  signing?    [Kebich] I liked the interview given by Viktor Chernomyrdin  after signing the agreement in which he said: We have no claims  on anybody's sovereignty. I have always said, and I want to  underline over again that by joining the single ruble zone, by  signing economic agreements, by lifting all barriers that hamper  the free flow of products, people may give us a chance to  survive and save our sovereignty. I think that those  politicians who oppose the economic union care only about  themselves. They do not care about either Belarusian  sovereignty or peoples' lives. They want to make a show. Every  sound politician, even having a negative attitude toward the  union must understand that the latter provides undisputable  advantages.    [Reporter, in Belarusian] Did Russia put forward any  preconditions for [signing the agreement with] Belarus?    [Kebich, in Belarusian] There were no preconditions. In  general, I must say that we agreed that prices for power  resources will be equal and even the Russian side maintained  that the unification of monetary systems should be done on a  parity basis. To avoid misinterpretations I want to point out  that parity does not mean that our hare will equal one ruble.  It means that one hare will equal (?30) rubles.    [Reporter, in Belarusian] Is there a chance that following  the unification of monetary systems Russian enterprises will  repay their debts to Belarusian partners?    [Kebich, in Belarusian] Our enterprises kept their assets in  Russia. Now, they will be returned to Belarus and start working  for the economy of Belarus and not Russia.    [Reporter] Does this mean that the union with Russia is a  real necessity?    [Kebich] I do not see any other way to save the Belarusian  economy. I may be mistaken; I may be condemned, but this is my  way, my policy, and the rest of my life. By saying this, I do  not rule out that we should not form economic unions with any  other state. The agreement does not prohibit bilateral relations  with other states. We should seek contacts with East Europe; we  should have equally good relations with Western states. This  does not contradict our union with Russia. I think that perhaps  this move will push other CIS states to signing bilateral  agreements with us.    [Correspondent] [words indistinct]    [Kebich] I would like to say that I am not as adamant on  this  issue. I can take a step to the left or the right to profit  from this union. And now about my personal appraisal: You  know, I would like to say that, from this perspective, I am very  satisfied. However, from another perspective, I am somewhat  dissatisfied, because the good work that we are currently  conducting is being criticized by other people. You claim that  the industrial complex is against this union, but this is not  true. You know, one should not trust all reports and  statements. I have recently met with Belarusian and Ukrainian  industrialists, and they all, arm in arm, approve this very  union. They are very thankful for what the prime minister has  done for them. I have recently read a newspaper published by  Belarusian Communists, and they also assault the government.  You are probably in the center of this criticism. In all  countries all over the world, people who are not in power always  criticize authorities. However, they criticize the people who  are responsible for concrete matters.    Regarding the current issue, I would like to say that, when  the time for the electoral race comes, all opposition forces  wake up. In this case, I can see rapprochement of extreme  radicalism from the left and right sides. As the saying goes,  one goes left but comes from the right. Due to that, I must  proceed on the path between these lines. I can step neither on  the left path nor on the right one, and therefore I will proceed  on the current path.    [Correspondent] Returning to the issue of our economic union  with Russia, we praise it [words indistinct].    [Kebich] The point is that if prices for energy sources  become equal in Russia and Belarus, our relations will instantly  become based on equal rights. Currently, the price for gas in  Russia amounts to 26,000 rubles [R], in Belarus it reaches  R80,000. The price for oil is also two and a half times higher  in Belarus than in Russia. The unification of monetary systems  cannot be accomplished, if prices for all goods in Russia and  Belarus are not equal. Due to that, we have not even allowed  the possibility that prices would be different. It is possible  that we will finance the expenditures for oil exploration and  drilling works, however, this will be an insignificant cost.  Exploration work has already been conducted for a long time.  This has cost them, too. Therefore, we put it this way: This  does not mean that we should currently pay the same amount for  gas as Russia does. The situation could be different: Our  prices will be decreasing, while Russia's will be increasing  until we reach one level. Moreover, I would like to emphasize  that although the unification of our monetary systems has not  yet been completed, we have already agreed that we will pay $55  instead of $80 for gas. So, can you tell me, isn't this alone a  great achievement? Russia has met us halfway. Not $80 but $55.  This is $25 or almost R30,000. This is the initial result.    [Correspondent] Your meeting with Russian President Boris  Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin lasted almost  three hours. What issues were discussed during this time?    [Kebich] There have been no such lengthy negotiations over  my  entire political life. Due to that, a great number of issues  was discussed, including the circumstances connected with  certain East European countries' willingness to join NATO. We  discussed the attitude toward these countries and the issue of  participation of our countries in the IMF. The scope of the  discussed issues went far beyond relations between Russia and  the Republic of Belarus.    [Correspondent] Suppose the monetary unification is not  accomplished. What does it mean for Belarus and what is your  prognosis?    [Kebich] The most unpleasant prognosis is that our  enterprises will simply collapse. I am not speaking about  agriculture. The agricultural sector is in much better shape  than industry. Due to that, a new government, and I do not know  who it will be, will have a very complex situation. All I can  say is that, over two years in Ukraine, three governments have  been changed. What has rally changed there? There have been  pragmatics, theorists, and professionals, and nothing has  changed. Recently, the president has assumed all powers, and  the situation there is even worse than ours. Thus, I believe  that we have no other way. I always ask politicians: What do  you propose? Yesterday, a NEW YORK TIMES correspondent told me:  You always speak of help for Russia. Do you think that helping  Russia you also help other CIS countries. However, this is not  true. If you analyzed the help granted to Russia by IMF and the  one granted to us, it would become obvious that we have received  more.    [Correspondent] [words indistinct]    [Kebich] It is clear that if Belarus were a nuclear state,  if  we had not refused to keep the nuclear weapons, we would not be  participating in this meeting [with President Clinton]. I am  speaking sincerely. However, we see that the Clinton  administration is paying tribute to Belarus, and this is being  done, first and foremost, by U.S. President Bill Clinton. This  is brought about by the fact that we do not lay claims to  nuclear weapons and we do not make nuclear weapons the subject  of political bargaining. This is the most important thing. I  hope that during our short meeting -- Clinton will stay with us  no more than five hours -- we will discuss issues related solely  to economic relations between Belarusian and U.S. business  circles.</p>

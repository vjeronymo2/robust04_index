The two apprehended groups consist of eight people, two of  whom are women and two of whom are college students.    This information was presented Tuesday [25 January] by  Colonel (Police) Drs. Gunawan, chief of the POLDA METRO JAYA  Detective Service, who was accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel  (Police) A. Latief Rabar, chief of the Regional Police  Information Agency. Gunawan acknowledged that, thanks to  information from the community, the two groups had been under  officer surveillance since November 1993.    The first group, which had a Medan-Jakarta network, was  raided on 2 January at the house of distributor B.A.K., alias  Empek (39), a resident of Engsek Lane, RT [Neighborhood] 001/02,  Tambun Village, Bekasi. B.A.K. confessed that he obtained the  substance from Mrs. Amb. (42), a housewife residing at Pondok  Ungu, RT 001/07, Medan Satria Ward, Bekasi.    Mrs. Amb. confessed that she had been distributing marijuana  for a long time from supplies brought overland by Mrs. Leg.,  alias Inang (42), a housewife residing at Jl. Jemadi, Lane VI,  Pulobayan, Medan.    Besides arresting the three members of this group, officers  seized 30 kilograms of dried marijuana ready for sale. "We are  still looking for two Medan members of the ring," Gunawan  revealed.  <H5>  Two College Students </H5>   Gunawan said that when officers raided the second group,  which had an Aceh-Medan-Jakarta network, on Thursday, 20  January, at its rented headquarters at 10B Percetakan Negara  Street, Rawasari Ward, Central Jakarta, they apprehended four  members and seized 20 kilograms of dried marijuana.    Some group members said that a shipment consisting of a  similar amount was to be delivered by a person the next day.  Upon hearing that, the officers blockaded the site. Therefore,  when A.R. bin A.G. (36), a farmer residing at Ujung Padang,  Labuhanhaji, Aceh, arrived Friday morning, 21 January, carrying  a suitcase containing 10 kilograms of marijuana, he was  immediately apprehended.    The four members arrested on Thursday were Teuku M.A. (30),  a  merchant residing in Dayaklabu Village, Pidi, Aceh; Sdm. (29), a  state college student from Meredu, Pidi, Aceh; Skr. (29), a  driver from Rakyat Street, Kadura Lane, Medan; and Teuku Zul.  (30), a private college student from Mesanak Vilage, Sigli City,  Aceh. "The two members who were students had reached their  eighth semesters," Gunawan disclosed.    According to statements by the members, the marijuana  distributed by the Aceh-Medan-Jakarta group was brought to  Jakarta by parcel truck. Gunawan also revealed that Mrs. Amb.'s  group was in the same group with Mrs. Panj., who was arrested in  Medan some time ago for possession of 113 kilograms of marijuana.</p>

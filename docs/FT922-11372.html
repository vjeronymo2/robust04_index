			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Arts: Slave of the box office TOURING reveals all too clearly the Jekyll and Hyde tendencies of ballet companies. The need, the duty, to take classical dancing to regional audiences is inescapable. The temptation to play horridly safe (an infernal round of Swan Lake and The Nutcracker) is still Mr Hyde's box-office imperative. The voice of conscience urges triple bills, less familiar full-length pieces, and Dr Jekyll faces financial ruin thereby. Current tours by two Russian troupes - Moscow City Ballet with its feeble Sleeping Beauty; Stars of the Bolshoy with gems from the classics - show how familiarity dictates repertory. Northern Ballet Theatre plays solid weeks of Swan Lake; Scottish Ballet offers ceaseless Coppelias; London City Ballet provides Romeo and Juliet and a classical triple bill. English National Ballet soon embarks on a season of Cinderellas. Even the Birmingham Royal Ballet must tour Giselle and a programme of one-act pieces relying on such securities as Les Sylphides and Elite Syncopations Companies have so pandered to audience taste; so failed to generate an interest in the new; so homogenised the repertory and the very idea of 'ballet' (and their own identities), that any break with proven titles will soon become impossible. Rising costs have helped price ballet out of inventiveness and adventure; a vast and valuable repertory lies unexplored. Where once small companies as different and differently exciting as Western Theatre Ballet or Walter Gore's troupes, laboured to give programmes unique and enjoyable; and where once the wild and wonderful repertory and glamorous casts of the de Cuevas troupe were guarantees of excitement, astronomical outlay, inadequate subsidy, have produced the cast-iron titles, the atrophied imagination, and the deadly sameness of touring ballet's current programming. Standards vary wildly, and I hold little brief for most of the performances that pass themselves off under illustrious titles - I can think of no more than a dozen ballerinas fit to dance Aurora or Odette/Odile or Giselle as these roles should be seen, and of even fewer stagings that do honour to the ballets themselves. The Birmingham Royal Ballet Giselle, which I saw on Thursday in Canterbury, remains a careful, well-conceived production - and the Marlowe Theatre offers it a fine stage. The performance was honest - though I thought some of the soloist dancing less than inspiring, and the mime playing looked all-too-predictable - and the evening offered a chance to see a guest with the troupe, Anna Valladolid, born in the Phillipines, now a principal dancer in Munich. Her Giselle was delicate, most effective amid the mists and mystery of the second act, where her compassion was touchingly sincere. But it was yet another Giselle in the deja-vu; phenomenon that is Britain's touring ballet scene.</p>

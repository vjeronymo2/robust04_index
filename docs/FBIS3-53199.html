			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Today's press commentaries focus on the summit  meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton in Geneva  mid-January.    Under the headline "The Madrid Formula is the Basis,"  AL-BA'TH says: Undoubtedly, the entire world is showing great  interest in the summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S.  President Bill Clinton. AL-BA'TH indicates that U.S. political  circles are showing special interest in the summit. Considering  it a major event in the peace process, these circles pin hopes  on it as an effort to achieve real progress toward the aspired  peace. Noting U.S. political circles' statements, the paper  says that these statements affirm that the importance of the  Geneva summit stems from the issues that will be raised for  discussion. The U.S. political circles believe that the summit  will discuss very substantial and meaningful issues, especially  since President Hafiz al-Asad will emphasize the stipulations of  the Madrid peace conference. These stipulations stress a  comprehensive solution through the implementation of the UN  resolutions which call for a full, comprehensive withdrawal from  the occupied Arab territories.    AL-BA'TH says that Syria went to the Madrid conference and  then to the Washington talks with a specific and clear vision of  the nature of peace. A few days from now, Syria will go to the  Geneva summit with the same view because of its absolute faith  in the need to work to establish a just, comprehensive regional  peace which will guarantee Arab rights. The paper says that  despite all that has happened and all that might happen, Syria  will not change its stands concerning the Arab-Israeli conflict.  This is because Syria is fully convinced that without a full,  comprehensive withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, it  is impossible to achieve a just, comprehensive peace.    Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: The prerequisites and  requirements of a genuine peace are known and clear. He who  wants such a peace to prevail will only have to abide by  implementing the contents of the Madrid formula, which will  continue to be the basic pillar of any effort to achieve a just,  comprehensive peace.    TISHRIN also comments on the al-Asad-Clinton summit. It  affirms that the summit will give a very strong boost to the  peace process. This is because, according to U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher, Syria is a main player in the region  and has a very important role with regard to the achievement of  a comprehensive peace in the Middle East.    TISHRIN adds that this U.S. acknowledgement of Syria's  sincere cooperation to render the peace process successful did  not rise from a vacuum. Rather, it is based on the experiences  of two years of talks in Washington, during which Syria provided  an example in the quest for a just, comprehensive peace in the  Middle East. Only a genuine peace can hold fast in the face of  events and changes. The paper says that Syria has never sought  separate deals, nor has it been involved in maneuvers or  bargains. Rather, its main concern is to establish a firm peace  which leads to a Middle East peace and improves the world peace  climate. For over two years, Syria has warned against the  course of separate deals and unequivocally proved that such  deals do not make peace.    TISHRIN adds: Syria's past and present announcements are  shared and approved by all peace advocates. Syria firmly  believes that for peace to hold in the face of events and  developments, it should be just, fair, and comprehensive. A  just, comprehensive peace requires Israel's full withdrawal from  the occupied Arab territories and recognizing the Palestinian  people's basic rights.    TISHRIN indicates that Syria has a genuine interest in  peace, as does the United States and the world. Stability in  the Middle East is vital for world stability. World peace will  remain incomplete without peace in the Middle East. However,  peace does not depend on Syria and the Arab parties alone. It  requires a substantial change in the Israeli position and a  categorical Israeli commitment to the implementation of relevant  UN Security Council resolutions, something which has not  happened so far.    Concluding its comment, the paper says that for its part,  Syria will do all it can in the interest of a just,  comprehensive peace. In this context, the United States is  called upon to employ its influence, which is very great, to  make Israel accept the resolutions of the international  legitimacy as a basis and a framework for peace leading to the  establishment of rights and an end to the occupation and the  acts of repression and terrorism against the Palestinian people.    On the same subject, AL-THAWRAH runs a commentary under the  headline "The Summit of Hope." It says: On the eve of  President Clinton's European tour, which he will conclude with  the summit meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva, U.S.  Secretary of State Christopher emphasized Syria's important role  in the quest for a comprehensive peace in the region. He said  that this pivotal role renders the Geneva summit extremely  important, something that will affect the overall peace process.  He also reiterated his country's commitment to an honest and  sincere full-partner role.    AL-THWARAH believes that what Christopher has said reflects  the unchanging U.S. position on the issue of a comprehensive and  just peace on all fronts of the conflict. It also proves that  Washington is not convinced of the usefulness of partial  solutions and separate deals that are held in secret and away  from the formula and bases of the Madrid conference.    The paper says that although it welcomed the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, the U.S. Administration still believes that any  attempt to impose an incomplete solution that bypasses Syria's  role and that is not in line with its vision and concept of the  nature, bases, and requirements of peace, will have grave  consequences for the region's security and stability.    AL-THAWRAH says that the U.S. Administration is certainly  aware of Syria's credibility in the peace process and the extent  of Syria's seriousness about working to establish the aspired  peace.</p>

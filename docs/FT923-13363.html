			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Pound falls to post-poll low THE POUND fell yesterday to its lowest level against the D-Mark since the day before the general election amid growing expectations that the German Bundesbank would tighten monetary policy this week. International investors ignored a strong statement by Mr John Major, the prime minister, ruling out a devaluation of the pound, selling sterling in large quantities and buying D-Marks. The government insisted it would hold sterling's position against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism even if other European governments forced a realignment. But it could not halt a sharp fall in sterling's value. The foreign exchange markets were unmoved by Mr Major's promise to bring down UK inflation 'to nil if possible'. Instead they bid the D-Mark higher against most leading currencies following reports that this week's meeting of the Bundesbank council was likely to act to curb the strong growth in German money supply. Sterling fell two pfennigs to DM2.8525 in London before dipping in late trading to DM2.8489, a level last seen on April 8 when the market was troubled at the prospect of a Labour victory in the general election. The German currency gained against the dollar, which dropped 1.75 pfennigs to DM1.478, and hit a 15-month high against the Japanese yen. In New York, the pound closed at DM2.84 and Dollars 1.9295. Unmoved by criticism from some Tory backbenchers, Mr Major said: 'It is absolutely imperative that we do not duck the necessity of bringing inflation down to a level below that of our competitors, as low as we can get - to nil if possible - and seek to keep it there.' The ERM, he added, provided the cornerstone of that policy. Further cuts in rates would be linked to holding sterling's parity. 'When it is appropriate we reduce interest rates,' he said. 'It has to be when it's appropriate - when we can sustain the exchange value of sterling and still reduce interest rates.' His remarks were later expanded by Downing Street to emphasise that the prime minister regarded sterling's present central rate of DM2.95 as non-negotiable. Officials made clear that if other governments wanted to devalue against the German currency, Mr Major would insist that the pound was held at DM2.95. Speculation about a general realignment has been fuelled by intervention to support the Italian lira. There are signs that the Bundesbank would regard a realignment as an appropriate move for ERM countries that thought they were suffering from German monetary policy. But with France adamantly opposed to any devaluation of the franc, Britain sees little prospect of a general realignment. In Brussels, Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's new finance minister, said there was 'no consideration' of devaluing the Italian lira. EC economics and finance ministers, in Brussels for one of their regular council meetings, expressed concern about Europe's high interest rates but conceded that the level of rates was effectively in the hands of the Bundesbank. Members of the Bundesbank council will discuss on Thursday whether to raise the German discount rate from 8 per cent or to limit the ability of commercial banks to borrow from the German central bank against collateral at the Lombard rate. Ministers in Brussels appeared to believe the Bundesbank would not raise rates this week. In a letter to The Times today, six leading monetarist economists, including Lady Thatcher's former personal economic adviser, Sir Alan Walters, warn of 'the serious risk that the present slump . . . will be deepened and prolonged well into 1993 and beyond'. They criticise Mr Lamont's defence of the ERM as 'brave but misguided'. The six argue: 'Leaving the ERM for a properly constructed regime of money-supply targets would certainly permit interest rates to drop substantially below German rates. . . The pound would perforce fall, and rightly so.' Page 2 Tough Italian package Page 16 No place for bank to call home Lex Page 18 Currencies Page 27 World stocks Page 32 Markets Page 33</p>

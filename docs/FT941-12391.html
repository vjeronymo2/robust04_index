			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (11): Families torn by want - A poor child in Chicago, in the US, may never meet a successful adult Sixty one children under the age of 15 died violently in Chicago last year, part of an epidemic which plagues all of America's cities. For young survivors in Chicago's poorest neighbourhoods, where childhood is punctuated by the sound of sirens and gunshots and families are torn by want, the world is limited and dangerous. Education, the vehicle most often used to escape poverty, is inaccessible in the city. Affluent and middle-income families long ago left the public school system, enrolling their children in a parallel system of private academies. What remains, and what serves thousands of poor children, has been judged the worst public school system in the nation. One of every two students entering a Chicago public high school this year will not graduate. For boys, the drop-out rate is even higher. 70 per cent of Hispanic males who start high school do not finish, and African American boys in the city also have a dismal graduation rate. Distracted by violence and street life, many children lose interest in school by the third or fourth grade. Chicago, the third-largest city in the US, is also the most segregated. Gaps in economic well-being among racial groups are perpetuated by gaps in educational opportunities. A poor child in the city may never meet a successful adult, has few constructive role models, and may have little incentive to finish school. For Walgreens Corporation, the largest drugstore chain in the US, based in Chicago, the city's educational failures provided the spark for an award-winning private initiative aimed at raising achievement levels of inner city children. Tom Mammoser, director of corporate communications for Walgreens, says the company has a natural and longstanding interest in youth. Walgreens, with Dollars 8.3bn in sales last year, operates in many inner city markets and has 100 stores in Chicago. 'We became concerned that there be enough qualified employees for us out there,' he said. 'We saw all of these kids in our own city who weren't making it, and we decided to do something about it.' That 'something' became an eight-year partnership with the Midtown Educational Foundation (MEF), a not-for-profit agency with a 30-year history of helping mostly minority children in Chicago's west side neighbourhoods. Midtown was already operating several after-school and summer programmes aimed at raising the educational success rates for high-school-aged boys. With a four-year start-up grant of Dollars 190,000 from Walgreens, the MEF initiated a personal tutoring program for younger children, at the ages of nine, 10, and 11. Since its inception in 1989, the One-on-One programme, as it is called, has expanded to help nearly 200 children each year stay on track at school. The key to the programme's success has been a host of volunteer tutors, mostly young professionals drawn from Chicago's business and academic communities, who serve as role models and confidants as well as homework coaches. While there are a host of tutoring programmes in Chicago, the Midtown effort is distinctive because it reinforces what Midtown executive director Jim Palos calls 'the whole child.' 'We're not just trying to improve grades; we blend education, sports, culture to form a complete character, a person of substance,' Mr Palos says. 'We place a huge emphasis on becoming a successful person.' Typically, a child meets with his mentor once a week after school at a Midtown facility for an hour of personalised study, a 15 minute group discussion of values, and 45 minutes of sports. Tutors are encouraged to meet a child's family, and to understand the circumstances of the child's life. Affiliated with the Catholic service organisation Opus Dei, Midtown runs separate One-on-One programmes for boys and girls. Mr Palos does not pretend that his programme reaches the neediest children. 'We are very focused, and we aim for the average child. Our goal is to prepare them for college.' To qualify for One-on-One, a child must demonstrate that he or she has a supportive parent, who must come in for an entrance interview at Midtown. Joan Costello, an education consultant who evaluated the One-on-One programme for Walgreens, praises Midtown for its preparation of tutors, the support it provides to both children and volunteers, and for measurable achievement. 95 per cent of the children in Midtown programmes, including One-on-One, graduate from high school, and 60 per cent of those attend college. 'The One-on-One programme at Midtown Center exudes vitality,' Ms Costello said in her report, 'It gives one a hopeful sense of what can be done when a capable organisation helps one adult and one child become friends and grow stronger together.' The One-on-One model has been applied in other US cities, including Boston, the South Bronx district of New York, Dallas, and Washington DC. Meanwhile, Walgreens has increased its support of the programme, recently donating an additional Dollars 450,000 to fund One-on-One through 1996.</p>

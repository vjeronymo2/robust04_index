			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, June 25 (AFP) -- Israel and  the PLO still have 26 disputed points to hammer out in May's  Cairo self-rule accord, PLO chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said  on Saturday [25 June].    "There are about 26 questions that have been postponed at  the  Cairo agreement," Sha'th told reporters here, blaming Israel for  delays in negotiations.    The disputed points in the Israeli-PLO accord mainly centre  on the borders of the self-rule enclaves of Jericho and the Gaza  Strip, "which Yasir 'Arafat amended on the map on the day of the  signing," Sha'th said.    He said Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation  would resume talks on the extension of self-rule in the  Israeli-occupied West Bank on Tuesday, "probably in the occupied  territories."    He accused Israel of delaying the talks since May 18. "Now  we are late in starting to talk about the second phase by two  months," he said.    "We are ready to start talks, at the head of which is the  question of a timetable for the release of prisoners."    He added: "The date of the Israeli withdrawal from all West  Bank towns and villages is not tied to the Gaza-Jericho  (self-rule) experiment but to the agreement, to nine months from  the signing of the agreement.    "We cannot wait five years to see if Gaza-Jericho is  successful or not."    Certain issues such as the exact size of the self-rule  enclave of Jericho were put to one side before the May 4  autonomy accord so the signing ceremony could go ahead in Cairo,  launching autonomy in the West Bank town and the Gaza Strip.</p>

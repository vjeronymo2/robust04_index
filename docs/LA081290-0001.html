			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TONY SERRA  </P> <P> I am enraged at Tony Serra's statement that people killed by drug overdoses and  infants born addicted to drugs are expendable.  </P> <P> Has this man no concern for human life?  </P> <P> I am also appalled that such a self-righteous crusader for justice flouts the  laws against drugs, deliberately does not pay parking tickets and for many  years did not file a tax return.  </P> <P> There are two words for people like Serra, and those words are criminal and  hypocrite. Serra is just as bad as the people he rails against who hunted down  and killed Indians like coyotes.  </P> <P> ROBERT E. PARK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

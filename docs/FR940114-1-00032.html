Transportation Alternatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States should promote alternative transportation programs that enable impaired drinkers to reach their destinations without driving. Alternative transportation programs include: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Designated drivers; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safe rides. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Deterrence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should have a deterrence program to reduce impaired driving through activities to create the maximum possible perception of detection, arrest and punishment among persons who might be tempted to drive under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, including CMV drivers. Close coordination with law enforcement agencies on the municipal, county, and State levels is needed to create and sustain the perceived risk of being detected and arrested. Specialized traffic enforcement efforts, such as MCSAP, also serve as a core element in the detection of impaired drivers. Equally close coordination with courts and the motor vehicle licensing and registration agency is needed to enhance the fear of punishment. Effective use of all available media is essential to create and maintain a strong public awareness of impaired driving enforcement and sanctions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each State should implement a system of activities to deter impaired driving. The deterrence system should include legislation, public information and education, enforcement, prosecution, adjudication, criminal sanctions, driver licensing, and vehicle registration activities. The goal should be to increase the perception and probability of arrest for violators and the imposition of swift and sure sanctions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

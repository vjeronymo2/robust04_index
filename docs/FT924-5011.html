			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Contracting out of Serps I WORK for a company which until recently operated a non-contributory pensions scheme which was additional to Serps, the state earnings-related pension scheme. This was replaced by a money purchase scheme - 'Nexus', from Scottish Equitable, also non-contributory. I find that I have been contracted out of Serps without my prior knowledge or permission. Can my company do this? I am told that this is because the company is putting so much into my pension that I would be over-funded. However, the brochure informs me that this can be varied at a whim. I have no contract on this pension scheme, and on asking for more information - projected figures, etc - I was accused of ingratitude and told that I can be opted back into Serps at the press of a button. I produced news articles about age, transfer values and so on. It transpired that my company director and broker had never heard of the '40 plus' rule. Bearing in mind that I am a woman of 44 and am unlikely to remain in this employment until the retirement age of 60, what would you advise? Can I get back into Serps without incurring a loss in transfer fees? Can they legally put me in / out of Serps at 'the press of a button'? In a company pension scheme, it is the employer who makes the decision to contract-out of Serps, or not, for the scheme as a whole. He is meeting the cost of providing you with benefits that are as good as, or better, than Serps and so you have no reason to complain that you are contracted-out. Arguments about picking and choosing the ages below which contracting-out has the greatest advantage are relevant to a personal scheme. An employer cannot pick and choose on an individual basis and will therefore often be guided by an average age formula for his staff as a whole. Employers must also bear in mind the political risk with Serps. The government has cut Serps entitlement once and is likely to do so again, because it constitutes a rapidly escalating unfunded drain on National Insurance finance, whereas future rights under your own funded scheme are based on real money invested for the future. If your employer is aiming to provide a reasonable level of retirement income for its staff as a whole it will tend to favour greater reliance on a funded scheme than on Serps. If Serps is cut back in the future this would leave more for it to top up. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

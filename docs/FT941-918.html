			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Management: S Africa's black managers Political change in South Africa has accelerated the need to develop more black managers in public and private sectors alike. But blacks are still poorly represented - particularly at senior levels in organisations - and the challenge is formidable. One attempt to redress the balance is today's conference in Oxford run by the Southern African Advanced Education Project, an independent charity which provides advance training and work experience to help South Africans build leadership and management skills. The event brings together about 160 black South African graduates and representatives of big employers including Total South Africa, South African Breweries, South African Post-Office, Unilever, Standard Bank and the power company Eskom. The idea is part recruitment drive, part seminar. According to Patrick Wintour of SAAEP, roughly half of those who attended the last two conferences either directly or indirectly landed their first job as a result. 'The sense of urgency among employers to recruit good black graduates is now much greater,' says Wintour, though he adds that SAAEP has been 'less than successful' in tapping the interest of UK companies with South African subsidiaries. Wintour says affirmative action remains a hot issue in the private sector, but believes the focus of debate may shift as the new government attempts to change the complexion of the public sector without unduly increasing its size. He identifies three main lessons learnt so far. First, companies should give black recruits real jobs: 'Tokenism has been exposed for the fraud that it is.' Second, employers should be prepared to take risks 'even if they are not 100 per cent sure that someone is right for the next move'. Third, they should 'tell other employees what they are doing and why they are doing it, so that everyone does not get confused'. SAAEP, tel: 0865 200686.</p>

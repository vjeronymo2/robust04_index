			<p>BFN     [Text] Madrid, 11 May (EFE) -- Mario Conde, former  president of the Spanish Credit Bank (Banesto), today denied  having collected multimillionaire commissions from the sale of  two companies. Conde made the denial in reply to a report given  by Luis Roldan, former director general of the Civil Guard, to  the daily EL MUNDO.    According to that report, Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra  ordered Roldan, who has been a fugitive of justice for the last  two weeks and against whom there are serious accusations of  corruption, to spy on Mario Conde and his alleged plans to  engage in politics and to try to use Banesto as a "springboard"  for reaching power.    The central bank intervened in Banesto on 28 December after  it detected that some $4 billion was missing. It also dismissed  Mario Conde, the top bank official.    EL MUNDO went on to say that Roldan entrusted the espionage  tasks to Kroll Associates, a U.S. company, which determined that  Conde had established a personal association with the Union of  Swiss Banks (USB) for the joint collection of Banesto  operations. In this manner, the newspaper added, the Swiss  corporation shared with the former president of the Spanish bank  group some 2.9 billion pesetas (nearly $21 million) from the  sale of Petromed [expansion unknown] to British Petroleum and  1.6 billion pesetas ($11.5 million) from the sale of La Union  and El Fenix, of the Banesto group, to the French AGF.    In a press release, Mario Conde denies all of this  information and charges that representatives from the Kroll  company met last year with officials from the U.S. company J.P.  Morgan to give them false information about him. Concerning the  alleged surveillance carried out by Kroll against him, Conde  showed "consternation in view of the fact that our private lives  and our family's intimacies have been under investigation by a  foreign company at the request of the Spanish Government."  Likewise, he warns that if the existence of this report is  confirmed, he will undertake proper action.    The daily EL MUNDO explained that the "original" report that  contains all of this information was shown by the former  director general of the Civil Guard and that the contents of the  document were only known by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez,  Deputy Prime Minister Serra, and Carlos Sochaga, who was  minister of economics and finance at that time.</p>

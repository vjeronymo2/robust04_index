			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] The second meeting of PECA -- Cuban-American  Professionals and Entrepreneurs -- ended today. The businessmen  had been meeting in Havana since Monday. PECA's final  communique stressed the need for the U.S. Government to lift the  blockade against Cuba.    In a communique released to the press at the end of the  meeting and read by PECA Coordinator Roberto Solis, it was  reported that during the past three days the entrepreneurs  continued to explore investment possibilities in Cuba that will  be possible when the blockade comes to an end. The document  added that the conference scheduled by the Cuban Government for  April must contribute to normalizing relations between the  country and Cuban emigrees, which for more than three decades  have been negligible and intermittent.    The Cuban-American professionals and entrepreneurs praised  the fraternal and respectful atmosphere that prevailed during  all of their discussions -- discussions in which specific  proposals were made.    Upon closing the seminar, Sergio Corrieri, the president of  ICAP -- the Cuban Friendship with the Peoples Institute --  stressed that although there were differences of opinion, all  statements by the Cuban-American professionals and entrepreneurs  will be analyzed because they were made within a framework of  understanding that must exist between Cubans here and those  Cubans in the United States who have adopted a constructive  attitude toward the Cuban revolutionary process.</p>

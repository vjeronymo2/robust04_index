			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Warsaw up 8% in strong trade PRICES OF the 16 stocks quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, which trades three times a week, rose by an average 8.1 per cent yesterday, near to the 10 per cent ceiling permitted per session as the two years' old exchange's unprecedented rally continued, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The dramatic rise in share prices has lifted pre-Easter price/earnings ratios by nearly a quarter, from an average 3.8 to yesterday's average 4.7, on an exchange whose total capitalisation is 5,979.8bn zloty (Dollars 359m). Yesterday's turnover was 48.3bn zloty. Falling interest rates have brought stocks into favour with domestic investors, Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, the exchange chairman, noted yesterday, adding that foreign confidence in the present government had helped to draw in foreign investors.</p>

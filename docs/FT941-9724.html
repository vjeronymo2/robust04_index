			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Sport: Quick, quick, quick . . . slow - Cricket With Wednesday's one-day international in Barbados marking the start of international cricket action between England and the West Indies, there are some unusual concerns in the home camp. Most particularly, with the first Test starting on Saturday in Bridgetown, there is uncertainty about the most effective weapon over the past two decades - fast bowling. The four-pronged pace attack that has served the West Indies so well appears blunter than usual. And this could lead to a fundamental change in strategy, to be tried first against Mike Atherton's team. Led by Curtly Ambrose, who has established himself as one of the best fast bowlers in the game, the West Indies selectors will turn to the consistent Courtney Walsh and a revived Winston Benjamin for support. But they will be hard put to make a choice from others. Andy Cummins, Kenneth Benjamin, Linden Joseph, Barrington Browne, Franklyn Rose and Cameron Cuffy, to name a few, are all good pacemen. But following such aces as Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, Colin Croft, Joel Garner and Malcolm Marshall is tough. The dilemma is forcing some new thinking. Holding says the West Indies can still have a feared four-pronged attack, even if one prong is a slow bowler. 'If there is a spinner who is good enough, he should play,' he insists. The problem is that none of the specialist slow men appears ready to fill the breach. Those who may have aspired to emulate Lance Gibbs, the last of the great Caribbean spinners, have not been encouraged by the belief of selectors and spectators that the other test nations are vulnerable only to the West Indian quicks. Amid all these anxieties about the bowling against England, skipper Richie Richardson remains unmoved. 'I am not worried about our attack,' he says. 'We have the best combination in the world.' He believes that this, plus England's relative inexperience, will undo the visitors. 'Although they have a good, all-round team, most of them have not played in the Caribbean before. 'We will win the series. We have the players who can produce the goods and we will be doing the same thing we have been doing over the years.' Richardson's confidence could founder on two factors, however. Except for the Kensington Oval in Barbados, none of the region's Test grounds has a pitch which helps fast bowlers. The Bourda Oval in Guyana and the Antigua recreation ground traditionally are placid. Jamaica's once truculent and inconsistent Sabina Park is now astonishingly well-behaved. The Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad will take turn. But, except for part-time spinner Carl Hooper, the West Indies do not have anyone to take real advantage. Secondly, Richardson's charges are in danger of being overtaken by tiredness brought on by too much cricket. Most of them spent last year playing not only in the West Indies but also in Australia, South Africa, England, Sharjah, India and Sri Lanka, from which they returned a fortnight before the start of the domestic season. Richardson suggested that Ambrose and Walsh should get some rest before the England tour began - and then was forced to take a month off himself after his doctor said he had a low blood count and needed to rest. That was hardly surprising since, over the past year, he had played seven tests and 28 one-day internationals in 23 different towns and cities, in addition to his first class and one-day matches for Yorkshire, his English county. Meanwhile, as Atherton, leads his team against Barbados this weekend in the final preparation for next week's international games, he will have noticed that the leading West Indian bowlers have given little indication of being tired since the domestic season began last month. And the established batsmen have been making runs, too. So have several Test aspirants, who are telling the selectors that they, too, deserve a place. England beware.</p>

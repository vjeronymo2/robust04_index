			<p>BFN     [Text] Four Romanian citizens who had been condemned in  Iraq for entering that country illegally were released this  morning from a prison near the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. The  pardon decree was signed last night by Iraqi President Saddam  Husayn, following a request by Romanian President Ion Iliescu.    A press release received from the Romanian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs notes that the message addressed in this respect  by the head of the Romanian state to his Iraqi counterpart was  handed over yesterday to Iraqi Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn  Khudayyir by Marcel Dinu, secretary of state with the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs and special envoy of Romania's president.    The names of the four citizens are Danila Dumitru, Nicolae  Aghachi, Florin Boiga, and Gabriel Encea. The formalities for  bringing the four of them back to Romania with the assistance of  the TAROM company are being completed by the Romanian Foreign  Ministry through Romania's embassies in Baghdad and Amman. Their  arrival in Bucharest is scheduled for 13 April at 1400 on a  TAROM flight from Amman.</p>

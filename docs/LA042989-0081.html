			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OJAI TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> ONLY SITE'S APPROACH IS GENTEEL  </P> <P> For the 90th year here in the Ojai Valley, once the home of the Chumash Indians  who lived beneath the 7,000-foot peak Topa Topa, not far from what is now the  Los Padres National Forest, a tennis tournament is being played.  </P> <P> As usual in tennis, a good serve is important. Here, in the morning, they serve  orange juice and in the afternoon, they serve tea, all for no charge. Not even  for being genteel.  </P> <P> Surely, the Ojai Valley college tournament is a kinder, gentler kind of tennis  tournament, with the possible exception of the play itself, in which, perhaps  not so surprisingly, players want to clobber one another.  </P> <P> Take Pat Crow of Long Beach.  </P> <P> Crow defeated Roberto Di Givlio of San Jose State Friday, 3-6, 6-2, 6-3, to  stay on course for a possible Big West showdown with Mark Kaplan of UC Irvine.  But he was thinking instead about the people he beat from the Pacific 10.  </P> <P> "I haven't had any trouble with any of them I've played," he said. "Our Big  West teams are just as strong as they are."  </P> <P> That brought a rebuttal from Eric Amend of USC. Amend, who defeated top-seeded  Stanford's Jeff Tarango in the tournament's biggest upset, reached the  semifinals with a three-set victory Friday over Billy Barber of UCLA.  </P> <P> "They've got players in that conference, but only players, because the Pac-10  has history and tradition," he said. "They are as representative in players,  but not with teams. We are deeper. It's as simple as that."  </P> <P> Playing on the oak-shaded courts is something of a tradition for Amend, who has  done it since he was 14.  </P> <P> "If I could die and go to heaven, this is it," he said. "This is tennis  heaven."  </P> <P> Patrick Galbraith of UCLA defeated Byron Black of USC, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), and  will play Amend in one of today's Pac-10 semifinal matches. Martin Blackman of  Stanford, who defeated Jason Netter of UCLA, 7-5, 5-7, 6-3, will play Buff  Farrow of UCLA in the other semifinal. Farrow defeated Jeff Cathrall of  Stanford, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3.  </P></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: The pound above the parapet FT-SE Index: 2,555.9 (+14.9) At least one thing is going Mr Norman Lamont's way. For the first time since last November sterling yesterday closed just within its theoretical narrow band against the D-Mark. That is bound to fuel hopes of an interest rate cut before the election, possibly even before the budget. Yet sterling is still vulnerable in spite of its new-found strength, and not just because its present level appears based in part on assumptions of a Tory victory. The UK currency has also risen on the back of a remarkable upsurge in the dollar. That reflects the belief that US recovery will set in sooner than previously expected, while the German economy is heading for a harder landing. Yesterday the dollar broke through the technical barrier of DM1.6350, which might suggest further upward scope. But the move was prompted by a sharp burst of speculative Middle Eastern buying. Interest differentials between Germany and the US are unlikely to narrow much, if at all, in coming months. As long as the US recovery is not firmly established, disenchantment with the D-Mark could prove premature. A recovery would force sterling back down. Admittedly, the market is in a mood to accommodate a pre-election UK rate cut on the grounds it could make a Tory victory more likely. The mistake would be to assume that sterling's present level leaves room for systematic rate cuts after the election. A victorious Mr Neil Kinnock would have to prove himself to the exchange market. A victorious Mr John Major would presumably want to put the economy back in tandem with the political cycle. That would call for the discipline of narrow ERM bands to take priority over interest cuts. Doing neither, however, would allow sterling to rise above its narrow band range. That could be the best course for a government bent on offsetting today's fiscal laxity with monetary tightness later on, when other European countries are cutting rates.</p>

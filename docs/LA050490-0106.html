			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> INGLEWOOD TRYING TO CURB APARTMENTS  </P> <P> Inglewood officials have unveiled proposals aimed at restricting the  proliferation of apartments and condominiums and discouraging the construction  of small motels.  </P> <P> The measures stem from concerns among residents and council members that  multiunit structures are causing congestion in residential neighborhoods and  that motels have become a haven for prostitutes and drug dealers.  </P> <P> The proposed zoning and building standards would increase the required front,  back and side yard space for apartment buildings and encourage developers to  build on two or more lots instead of crowding apartments on one lot.  </P> <P> The proposals also recommend that the city identify certain neighborhoods that  currently allow multiunit dwellings and zone them to allow only single-family  homes.  </P> <P> "This will help to slow down the building," said Councilman Anthony Scardenzan,  whose district has the highest concentration of apartments and condominiums.  "It's better than what we had before."  </P> <P> To discourage small motels -- such as those that line Century Boulevard,  Imperial Highway and La Brea Avenue -- city officials proposed setting a  50-room minimum on all future motels and increasing the required size of rooms  and lobbies.  </P> <P> The City Council referred both sets of recommendations to the Planning  Commission, which will hold public hearings and develop specific guidelines for  the proposals before returning them to the council for final approval.  </P> <P> Last year, the council approved two moratoriums that froze construction of  apartments, condominiums and small motels in most of the city, giving the staff  time to develop the recommendations. The moratoriums are still in effect.  </P> <P> The recommendations for apartments and condominiums would also establish  minimum sizes for patios and balconies, require all bedrooms to be a minimum of  100 square feet and require subterranean parking spaces to be at least half a  story below grade.  </P> <P> City officials said the measures would increase the quality of future multiunit  structures and help prevent developers from replacing single-family units with  apartments and condominiums.  </P> <P> The city also recommended that all new motels have landscaped areas such as  patios, playgrounds or swimming pools, and that they include a unit for the  manager.  </P></p>

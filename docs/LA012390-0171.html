			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ASK DR. RUTH: SENILE FATHER CAN BUMP SEX FROM WIFE'S PRIORITY LIST  </P> <P> Q. My wife has been ducking sex with me for about half a year, beginning when  we had to put her father in a home for the aged, to which he never consented  and has never made any adjustment. He is demented and makes a very difficult  resident. Among his misbehaviors is asking all the female staff for sexual  favors and going into the unlocked bedrooms of the women residents when they  have been tucked in at night. This upsets my wife and I think it has turned her  against all male sexuality.  </P> <P> A. I doubt that. I don't know everything about the situation, but it would be  typical of your wife to become obsessed with this to the point of losing sexual  interest. Women become so engrossed in the many things that they are expected  to be in charge of and on top of all the time that they always have in their  heads a shopping list or check-off list. This is great for getting lots of  things done -- and so many women get almost everything done, don't they? But  they are worried about what they have forgotten.  </P> <P> Now, this preoccupation with everything all at the same time can be kept up  while cooking, while doing the work at the office, while driving in rush-hour  traffic, while giving the bathroom a last-minute scouring just before the  dinner guests arrive, while all kinds of things. But it is sheer destruction to  having a sexy, self-arousing image in the head. So it happens that thousands of  women who would like to be getting close to orgasm are instead going over that  list of items.  </P> <P> Your wife has a difficult thing to get used to. She has to accept that she has  reached a point with her father where nothing much can be done. He will not  respond to her daughterly attentions and efforts.  </P> <P> No sign comes from this old man that he has any regard for her. For being  unable to reach him she feels guilty.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, you are not a monster for wanting things to be as they used to be  between you and her, but I think you have to put sex-sharing on the back  burner. What your wife needs now is support and affection.  </P> <P> And the affection should not seem like a sexual approach.  </P> <P> Maybe she doesn't want sex, but she would like lots of what went with it like a  nice dinner out and you maybe wearing something other than that old Popeye  sweat shirt. This is a time to be reminded that a man can also be sweet and  protective, not just clamoring for intercourse.  </P></p>

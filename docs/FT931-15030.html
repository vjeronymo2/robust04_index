			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Irish punt battle enters key phase THE Irish government's four-month battle to defend the punt within the European exchange rate mechanism enters a critical phase this weekend, as renewed selling of the currency yesterday frustrated efforts by the central bank to bring wholesale money market rates down sharply. Last weekend, the central bank raised its overnight lending rate to 100 per cent in response to heavy selling of the punt, which drove it below its ERM floor against the Dutch guilder and Belgian franc. In the past three days, the bank has progressively reduced its money market rates in an attempt to avert a threatened rise in commercial base rates which would further hurt the Irish economy. But this week's attempt to cut money market rates has already put pressure on the Irish currency, which was again trading near to its ERM floor. The government reaffirmed yesterday that it will not devalue or realign the punt and added that it is 'concerned that the European authorities have so far been unable to re-establish the previous stability after so many months and to convince the market of their determination to resist further re-alignments or devaluations'. The central bank announced yesterday that it was again dropping its overnight lending rate back to 15 per cent, having dropped it to 30 per cent by Wednesday. This permitted the one-month rate to fall from 60 per cent at the beginning of the week, to around 25 per cent yesterday. Renewed selling pressure yesterday drove the one-month rate back up to around 35 per cent. The first cabinet meeting yesterday of the new coalition government discussed outline proposals for the introduction of an exchange rate guarantee scheme to enable companies to borrow funds more cheaply abroad. Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, is to hold a crucial meeting today with the heads of the main building societies to consider means of keeping down mortgage rates, or alternatively to cushion mortgage holders from the impact of a likely 3 percentage-point rise in mortgage rates early next week. Details of the schemes are expected to be finalised over the weekend and released early next week.</p>

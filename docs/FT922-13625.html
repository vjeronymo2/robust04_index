			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: ICO delegates at odds over negotiating group THE SIZE of the negotiating group for a new International Coffee Agreement was proving to be the first obstacle on the road to renewed efforts to support coffee prices, delegates at the International Coffee Organisation's London council meeting said yesterday, reports Reuters. On Tuesday, after a working group had reported on the prospects for agreeing a new marketing pact, the council gave the go-ahead for negotiations to be held on an agreement with economic clauses, probably based on a universal export quota system. Delegates had differing ideas, however, on the form the negotiations should take. Consuming country members were seeking open discussions, while most producers were in favour of a '10 plus 10' consumer/producer group with observers. 'The doubt is whether they should go immediately to a negotiation group or leave it open to all members,' said Mr Nestor Osorio of Colombia. 'I feel, however, that most of the ground to be discussed initially has already been covered by the working group.' Another delegate said: 'Small producers want a big negotiating group, while larger producers want a small negotiating group.' Consumers, meanwhile, were keen that talks on a new economic pact should be open to everyone, including non-members. 'I think transparency is an important concept,' commented Mr Myles Frechette, head of the US delegation. The question of when negotiations could begin was also at issue. Producers wanted talks to start as soon as possible, while consumers felt a date in mid-June was the earliest feasible. Delegates were hoping to reach agreement on these issues last night, although the present council meeting is scheduled to continue today.</p>

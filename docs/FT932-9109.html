			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / UK lending figures down in first quarter THE subdued state of lending by British banks to UK residents was highlighted yesterday by Bank of England figures showing that total lending rose just Pounds 2.2bn to Pounds 395.8bn in the four months to the end of March, Peter Norman writes. The Bank said lending to individuals rose Pounds 2.3bn. Borrowing by financial institutions - mainly securities dealers and building societies - rose Pounds 2.5bn while lending to industry and commerce fell Pounds 3.6bn. The increase in borrowing by individuals was more than accounted for by Pounds 2.6bn-worth of lending for house-buying. Bridging loans and other advances to individuals declined during the four months. A Pounds 1.2bn drop in borrowing by manufacturers accounted for a third of the fall in lending to industry and commerce. Lending to property companies fell Pounds 1bn in the four months bringing the drop in their borrowings to Pounds 3.1bn since the end of 1991. Lending to construction companies fell Pounds 500m, the eighth such drop in succession, to produce a total fall of Pounds 3.3bn or 21 per cent in lending to this sector since February 1991. The Bank's figures are neither seasonally adjusted nor comparable with earlier quarterly data. They cover a four-month period to bring future statistics into line with the calendar quarter.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Telefonica rises 4.7% to Pta52bn at halfway stage Telefonica, the state-controlled Spanish telecommunications group and the biggest company on the Madrid stock exchange, lifted first-half consolidated net profits by 4.7 per cent to Pta52bn (Dollars 397m) on the back of increased demand, lower financial charges and increasing international business. The increased group profits reflected in particular the performance of Telefonica Internacional (Tisa) which has invested strongly in acquiring Latin American telecommunications companies. Talks are taking place that aim to bring both GTE and Unisource into Tisa as large shareholders. Results at the Telefonica parent company were up by just 1.7 per cent to Pta44.8bn, in spite of a 6.5 per cent rise in operating income and a 7 per cent fall in financial charges. Analysts believe the parent company could be keeping its net profits low to prod government regulators into raising tariff charges. Improved first-half results, reflecting the incipient domestic recovery, were also posted by Iberdrola, the private sector electrical utility, and by Tabacalera, the government-controlled tobacco manufacturer and distributor. Iberdrola reported a 96 per cent jump in its net profits over the first six months of the year to Pta49.7bn but this sharp increase included extraordinary income of Pta25.2bn realised through the disposal of its Barcelona-based subsidiary, Hidroelectrica de Cataluna, to the state-controlled utility Endesa. Iberdrola's net profits, without this extraordinary item, rose by 11.7 per cent due to energy demand, lower expenditure and an 18 per cent fall in financial charges brought about by falling interest rates and reduced borrowing. Tabacalera, which is 52 per cent state-owned, raised its net first half group profits by 32.5 per cent to Pta5.7bn. The increase was due to extraordinary income of Pta2.5bn realised through the disposal of its food division Royal Brands to Nabisco of the US, to a 54 per cent drop in financial charges and a 23 per cent rise in tobacco sales. The sharp jump in sales was largely due to government action in curbing cigarette smuggling.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Liana Minasyan report under the "Settlement" rubric: </F> "South Ossetian Issue: Russia Is the Sole Mediator.  Quadrilateral Talks Loom Ahead"]    [Text] A Georgian-Ossetian meeting (including both South  Ossetia and North Ossetia) devoted to the problems of refugees  and those subjected to forcible resettlement has been held in  Vladikavkaz at the initiative of the CSCE mission. The meeting  was attended by Aleksandr Tsvetkov, chief of the CSCE mission  (Ukraine); Vazha Khachapuridze, plenipotentiary representative  of the Georgian head of state; Znaur Gassiyev, first deputy  chairman of the South Ossetia Supreme Soviet; and Yuriy Sedakov,  chairman of the North Ossetia parliamentary committee for  national policy and foreign affairs.    The sides concluded that the return of refugees has been  complicated by the absence of a political settlement to the  Ossetian-Georgian conflict, and agreed on the need immediately  to set up expert groups to prepare quadrilateral talks between  Georgia, South and North Ossetia, and Russia.    One of the most complex matters in the upcoming talks will  be  the state and legal status of South Ossetia. By the time the  negotiations begin, a protocol of intentions will be signed,  modeled on the Dagomys agreement on South Ossetia, and a range  of matters to be discussed will be determined. North Ossetia  took an active part in the preparation of the current meeting  because, according to Yuriy Sedakov, the practice where  hostilities have ended, but talks have not yet started, may lead  to yet another round of tensions.    The second contentious matter -- the status of peacekeeping  forces -- has also yet to be resolved. It is known that members  of the CSCE mission question the legality of the current  trilateral status of these forces because they include former  combatants.    However, Vakhtang Rcheulishvili, deputy speaker of the  Georgian parliament, thinks otherwise: he is even ready to  admit that the Tskhinvali procedure for deploying peacekeeping  forces may be repeated in Abkhazia. He said: "Similar problems  -- separatism and status -- require similar solutions. But they  cannot be absolutely identical. The same problems will be  discussed in both Georgian- Abkhazian and Georgian-Ossetian  negotiations, the only difference being our approach -- we  oppose the internationalization of the Ossetian problem and  raising it to the level of the CSCE or the United Nations.  Russia will be the sole mediator in the settlement of this  problem."</p>

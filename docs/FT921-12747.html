			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government to move against defaulters - Poll Tax non-payment THE government is trying to bring a quick end to its embarrassment over poll tax non-payment. The embarrassment has been caused by confusion in magistrates' courts about whether computer records are admissible evidence. Mr John Major's close interest in the issue is reinforcing pressure on Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, to produce proposals over the next day or so to ensure computer evidence can be admitted. Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, announced yesterday that councils would be given more time to take enforcement action against poll tax defaulters. 'There will be no amnesty for non-payers,' he said. The two years at present available to councils will be raised to six years under regulations to be made shortly. Mr Heseltine's extension of the deadline for taking action blocks the loophole that would otherwise have meant people who had not paid from 1990 could have escaped action. The threat of poll tax enforcement descending into chaos has pushed the issue high up the political agenda, to the government's discomfort, although ministers make what they can of the involvement of opposition politicians in non-payment campaigns. The latest pressure comes from the decision on Wednesday by the Clerkenwell stipendiary magistrate in London that Camden council could not rely on computer records as evidence of non-payment in default actions against 12 Camden residents. That followed a similar decision by magistrates at Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk three weeks ago, which prompted some other magistrates to halt all their poll tax cases until the matter had been cleared up. At Westminster, Labour has signalled willingness to co-operate in enabling the regulations to be enforced urgently, although Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said yesterday that 'Labour councils have been warning for months of the dangers that computer-generated evidence might not be valid, and the government should have moved months ago'. There have been suggestions that if default cases heard so far are declared invalid because of the loophole, the government might face claims for wrongful imprisonment. More than 1.8m summonses have been issued for non-payment in London since the tax was introduced, according to the Association of London Authorities. Letters, Page 15</p>

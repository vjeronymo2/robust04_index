Director of the State Council's Development Research Centre  Professor Sun Shangqing said the annual rate of economic growth  this year might go beyond 10 percent following double-digit  growth in the past two years. Last year's economic growth was  13.4 percent but Premier Li set a target of a nine percent  growth rate for 1994.    Professor Sun, seen as a close adviser to Vice-Premier Zhu  Rongji, stressed that the growth rate of nine to 10 percent was  appropriate, adding that this was already a "very fast" pace.  "If we fail to control the growth of fixed-assets in vestment  the economy will over heat again, causing inflation," he said.  "This is detrimental to the investment environment and the  livelihood of the people."    In addition to capital investment the head of the top think  tank indicated that price reforms this year would further push  up prices. But he stressed that inflation was inevitable in the  transitional period from a planned economy to a market economy.  "Inflation is acceptable as long as it is within the limits  that the public can bear. I'm always against inflation. But  inflation at a transitional period is inevitable. That does not  mean I support it," said the professor.    Professor Sun said the central Government's huge deficit  would also make an impact on inflation. "That's why our major  task this year is to strictly control expenditure while boosting  revenue. "Of course, there will be dissenting views. But  [everybody] has to put the general good above his own  interests," he said. Although some regions wanted a faster pace  of growth, Professor Sun said any moves to pursue an  unrealistically fast growth rate that was not suited to the  regions' capabilities would be prohibited under the macro-  control and adjustment drive. "We hope that delegates can come  to a consensus and make collective efforts to keep total  fixed-assets investment this year to 1,300 billion yuan  (HK$1,154.4 billion)," said the director.    Professor Sun also defended the need to stress the vital  significance of maintaining stability this year, saying that  this was the "pre condition" for development. "We did not talk  a lot about stability last year because the situation was  different. We already had a 13.4 percent rate of growth last  year. Maintaining social stability is in the interest of all  the people," he said.    Professor Sun denied suggestions that the country was  already  in danger of stagnation despite a surge of prices in the first  two months of this year. "The most important thing is that  people from all walks of life are aware of the fact that our  pace of growth has already been too high. We should now pay  greater attention to improving efficiency," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] now controls the  entire Rwanda borders with Tanzania and Uganda and a big part of  the Rwanda border with Burundi. The RPF controls the Rwandan  side of Rusumo bridge between Rwanda and Tanzania. The fears  that Rusumo bridge may be destroyed are not founded. The bridge  is not contested. It is under the total control of the RPF.  The RPF does not expect any invasion from Tanzania. The  youthwingers who fled to Tanzania, most of them dumped their  weapons to the Rwandan side of the border and those who crossed  with their arms have been disarmed by Tanzanian authorities.  Some known killers have even been arrested by Tanzanian  authorities. It is in the interest of the RPF that the Rusumo  bridge remains safe.</p>

The U.S.  officials' departure may cause a delay in nuclear inspections of  North Korean facilities.    The American officials, led by Deputy Assistant Secretary of  State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Tom Hubbard, were to  meet with North Korean officials, headed by Deputy Chief of the  North Korean mission to the United Nations Ho Chong, Thursday  for the third consecutive day. The two sides were to discuss  follow-up measures after Pyongyang permits nuclear inspections  on March 1.    A spokesman for the State Department said the U.S.  officials,  who waited all day at the negotiating table, were back in  Washington and the U.S. side currently has no plans to meet  again with North Korea. Upon returning to Washington, the U.S.  negotiators expressed disappointment that North Korea is not  ready to accept nuclear inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency next week, the spokesman said.    Diplomatic sources here said the North Korean officials  failed to show up because they had not received instructions  from Pyongyang, adding that if the North Koreans want to hold  another meeting, even on Friday, it will likely take place. The  issue of the Koreas' exchanging special envoys is reportedly  hampering negotiations between the United States and North  Korea. Under a prior agreement with Seoul, the U.S. side has  said that in order to hold a third round of high-level talks  between Washington and Pyongyang, the North should accept an  exchange of special envoys with the South, a condition that  North Korean officials have strongly rejected.</p>

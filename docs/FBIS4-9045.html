			<p>BFN     [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia, April 15 (CTK) -- The Slovak  government wants to maintain the social acceptability of the  economic transformation, through continued tight fiscal policies  and by keeping the budget deficit at a level acceptable to  international financial institutions, Premier Jozef Moravcik  told journalists today.    Moravcik and Deputy Premier Roman Kovac today began a  two-day  working visit to east Slovakia.    Kovac said that the Slovak National Bank, given the growth  of  its hard currency reserves, would probably be able to re-finance  loans for commercial banks. He indicated that the establishment  of financial discipline in the economy was also important, as  money in circulation had gradually been transferred into a  "shadow economy".    Kovac said that the Finance Ministry last year had exempted  more than 4.8 billion Slovak crowns (about $158 million) in  taxes, and that the losses of the state ensuing from unpaid  customs duties are estimated at about 10 billion crowns.    Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik went on to say that the case  involving the Manager company and Prumyslova Banka in Kosice was  merely the "tip of the iceberg", beyond which exists a network  of manipulations with state funds.    Manager, which was founded by members of the VSZ steel works  in Kosice, was awarded 9.5 percent of VSZ's stock with a nominal  value of 1.5 billion Slovak crowns for 300 million crowns by the  Meciar government. A loan for the purchase was immediately  provided by Prumyslova Banka, in which VSZ owns a considerable  share. Former government minister Julius Toth, immediately  after his recall, became the head of both VSZ and the bank.    Moravcik said that the case was related to the distortion of  privatization through the channeling of public funds into  private financial institutions.</p>

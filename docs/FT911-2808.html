			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Food: A refuge of good cooking - Nicholas Lander with the first article of an occasional series by Weekend FT writers on eating out in France EVEN FOR those who know France well the city of Albi in the south-west seems to hold a certain fascination. Its macabre history during the 12th and 13th centuries, brought home every time you look at the imposing cathedral, the extraordinary museum with so many rooms devoted to Albi's most famous son, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and its position above the River Tarn, all leave a lasting impression. Places to stay in Albi include the Hostellerie St Aubine (Tel: 63.54.04.04) and the Hotel Altea (63.47.66.66). Just behind the museum there are two good restaurants, the Bateau Ivre (63.38.08.06)for fish and, virtually next door, L'Esprit du Vin (63.54.60.44) where a thoughtful proprietor offers a suitable wine to be served by the glass with each of his dishes. But, for culinary gems, one has to travel outside the city. Fifteen kilometres south is the small town of Relmont where a chicken and garlic market is held every Wednesday. Close to the colonnaded centre is the Hotel Noel (63.55.52.80) which has been in the same family for the past five generations - although recently a son-in-law took over at the kitchen stoves. There are eight bedrooms and a delightful terrace; the dining room is charming. With an open log fire, and lovingly polished panelling, the room proudly displays the accoutrements assembled from having served good food for so long. The cooking does not disappoint. Foie gras sauteed with capers and apples, a delicious line-caught sea-bass fresh from the Mediterranean with a lovely bearnaise sauce and an excellent rendition of the classic veal kidneys in a seed mustard sauce were served under the beady eye of a very attentive maitress d'. Fixed price menus range from FFr120 to FFr220. Some 25 km north west of Albi is the almost dizzily placed town of Cordes. Named after the Spanish city of Cordoba, the hilltop stronghold was a Cathar refuge during the early 13th century. So impregnable is its natural position, the story goes, that French troops sent from Paris to put down the heretics took one look at Cordes and turned back. Even today, in spite of the advantage of a car, the summit of the town with its narrow cobbled streets can be difficult to navigate. Since 1980, however, when Yves Thuries bought the Hotel du Grand Ecuyer and began to build his personal empire, Cordes has undergone a culinary invasion. Over the past decade Thuries has also acquired the Hostellerie du Vieux Cordes (63.56.00.12) close by, has his own patisserie and set up a publishing house for his cookery books. In the process he has become a town councillor and the biggest employer in Cordes. Born in nearby Gaillac, Thuries began his apprenticeship as a patissier at the age of 14 and for the next 20 years worked his way around France under the auspices of the Compagnons du Tour de France which encourages such apprentices. Now a Compagnon himself he wears its badge, an earring in his left ear, with pride as well as other fashion pointers such as trousers rolled to the calf, white stockings, and a chef's jacket with the tricolore around the neck. In 1976 - the same year as Michel Roux, who runs the Waterside Inn at Bray in Berkshire - Thuries became a Meilleur Ouvrier de France. This competition, established in 1924, is held every three or four years (it has been introduced into Great Britain) to find the best culinary craftsmen in the country. Thuries distinguished himself by becoming the only French chef to achieve the necessary standards in more than one discipline - as traiteur/patissier and confiseur/glacier. Once qualified Thuries turned his attention to Cordes. From March 1 to November 1 every year he runs his hotels; from November to March he writes. He will shortly be producing his tenth book, a culinary encyclopedia. He has spent a great deal of time and money on the Grand Ecuyer filling it with suits of armour and 18th century carriages and fitting out the bedrooms in great comfort overlooking the lush countryside. He has acquired a wide-ranging and reasonably-priced wine cellar and, with the advantage of being the largest employer in town, a thoughtful staff with a particularly knowledgeable sommelier. Thuries's food bears the stamp of a man who has been at the stoves a long time. There are five fixed price menus ranging from FFr180 to FFr360 and we chose what was billed as a four-course dinner with four desserts at FFr320. What we had not counted on was Thuries's passion for, and skill with, patisserie. Before the first course there were three deliveries of amuses-gueules, including a small portion of a fish terrine, then a lobster bisque served in a minute copper pot. One main course, two slices of foie gras served hot inside very delicate pancakes with a port sauce, was stunning. But it was really only after the cheese that the meal began. In my innocence I had imagined that the dessert would comprise one large plate with a small portion of each. Instead four desserts followed in sequence and each was better than its predecessor: a black and white ice cream with a mango puree and chocolate sticks, a roulade of chocolate with a wonderful pea green pistachio sauce, a hot orange souffle with a caramel sauce and finally three different sorbets. If their aim was to clean the palate the intention was undone by the arrival of two lots of petits fours', fruit-based with the desserts and chocolate-based with the coffee. On the bed at night a chocolate truffle waited for us in vain. Hotel du Grand Ecuyer, Cordes, 81170 France. Tel: 63.56.01.03. Fax: 63.56.16.99. 12 bedrooms from FFr 600.</p>

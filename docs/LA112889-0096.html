			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT OF COMORO ISLANDS KILLED BY MUTINOUS SOLDIERS  </P> <P> Mutineers led by a former army commander attacked the presidential palace in  the Comoro Republic and killed President Ahmed Abdallah, longtime ruler of the  Indian Ocean island nation, officials said Monday.  </P> <P> The rebel leader, former commandant Ahmed Mohamed, resigned recently in a  dispute with the 70-year-old president, an official at the Comoro Embassy in  Paris said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> He said the assassination was not a coup attempt and that Mohamed was under  arrest. The number of attackers was not divulged, and the official said he did  not know if anyone else was arrested.  </P> <P> Abdallah was killed in a fire fight between rebel soldiers of the regular army  and his 300-member presidential guard, state Radio Comoro said. It said a guard  officer also was killed.  </P> <P> The head of the Supreme Court, Mohamed Djohar, took over as leader of an  interim government, as dictated by the constitution, the official said.  </P> <P> Abdallah had survived coup attempts in 1983, 1985 and 1987.  </P> <P> The attack took place in the capital of Moroni, on the main island of Grand  Camore, home to half of the nation's predominantly Muslim population of  500,000. The Comoros, which lie between Mozambique and Madagascar, were  governed by Abdallah for all but three years since 1972.  </P> <P> Abdallah will be buried today on his native island of Anjouan, said Radio  Comoro, monitored on the French-administered island of Mayotte.  </P> <P> The fighting apparently did not spill into the streets. Bruce Thompson, manager  of the Galewa Sun Hotel, told the South African Press Assn. by telephone that  everything was normal -- "The town is very quiet."  </P></p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Oslo to boost industry: NKr600m package hangs on election outcome NORWAY'S minority Labour government is planning to introduce a package of measures, valued at an estimated NKr600m (Pounds 55m), in an attempt to create jobs, boost the competitiveness of the country's industry and increase non-oil exports. The extra funds will be included in the 1994 budget, which is due to be presented on October 13 if the present government retains power after the general election on September 13. Mr Finn Kristensen, the industry and energy minister, made the announcement during a campaign speech in Molde on the west coast of Norway, an area which has been particularly hard hit in recent years by unemployment and company bankruptcies. Norway's unemployment rate is currently running at a record 8 per cent, including those on government job training schemes. Along with proposed membership of the European Community, unemployment is the single biggest issue in the election campaign. Key measures in the package include: Abolition of corporate electricity taxes, saving industry an estimated NKr265m annually. Last December the government abolished the tax for energy-intensive industries and the pulp and paper sector, whose competitiveness had been eroded after Sweden and Finland had in effect devalued their currencies. NKr176m for measures to help industry increase exports and enter rapidly expanding Asian markets. NKr100m to finance development projects in third world countries in which Norwegian companies will participate. Of this total, about NKr40m will be in export credits to sell domestic goods and services. Other funds will be allocated to research and development contracts in the private and public sectors and education. A project called 'Invest in Norway' will promote the benefits of establishing operations in Norway.</p>

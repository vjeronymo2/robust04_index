			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AVERAGE SOVIET CITIZEN EARNS $8,850, CIA SAYS  </P> <P> The CIA says the average Soviet citizen earned the equivalent of $8,850 last  year, less than half the average American's earnings of $19,970.  </P> <P> The CIA's "Handbook of Economic Statistics 1989" shows that the U.S. figure was  higher than that of other major non-communist countries, with the average  Japanese shown as earning $14,340 and the average West German $14,260.  </P> <P> Earnings of the average American grew by 2.9% in 1988; the average Soviet  citizen had an increase of only 0.5%.  </P> <P> The handbook's 1988 edition did not include a figure for the Soviet Union,  although other statistics indicate that the average citizen's earnings there  were $8,363 in 1987, compared to $18,200 for the average American.  </P> <P> The CIA makes these comparisons on a "purchasing power" basis. That means it  does not translate foreign earnings into dollars at prevailing exchange rates  but at theoretical rates that would equalize the cost of a basket of goods and  services in the two countries being compared. The document did not say what  those theoretical rates were.  </P> <P> A few other comparisons were given for 1988: Life expectancy was 69 years in  the Soviet Union, 75 years in the United States and 78 years in Japan. The  average American used energy equal to burning 56 barrels of oil, and the  average Soviet consumed only 35 barrels worth.  </P> <P> There were a few more cars than one for every two Americans -- 572 per thousand  -- and only one for every 24 Soviets -- 42 per thousand, according to the CIA.  The Soviet figure came from 1986 and may have grown by 1988.  </P> <P> Soviet international trade was closer to balance than America's: The United  States imported $128 billion worth of goods more than it exported, and the  Soviets had a surplus equal to $3.4 billion.  </P> <P> Total production of goods and services in the Soviet Union was valued at $2.5  trillion, compared to $4.9 trillion in the United States. The Soviet population  was larger at mid-year, 296.4 million compared to 246 million for the United  States. Both populations were growing at the same rate: 0.9% a year.  </P></p>

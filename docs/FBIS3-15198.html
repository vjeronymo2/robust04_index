Journalists were not permitted to cover the meeting. The  President's staff told TURAN that, "Russia has brought a new  version of a settlement plan for the Armenian-Azerbaijani  conflict which contradicts the interests of Azerbaijan.  Moreover, this version does not coincide with the programme of  the settlement of the conflict that was proposed by the CSCE".  The same source reports that "President Aliyev expressed his  opinions and suggested that Kondratyev and Kazimirov perfect the  Russian version". Kazimirov and Kondratyev are expected to  return to Baku with a final version for a settlement plan.</p>

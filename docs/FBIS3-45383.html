Li, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC  Central Committee, State Councillor and minister in charge of  the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, made the  call during his four-day inspection tour of Guizhou Province  which ended Saturday [15 January].    During his stay in Guizhou Province, Li visited factories,  villages, granaries and development zones in the cities of  Zunyi, Anshun and Guiyang. He appreciated the achievements the  province has made since 1978, noting that the province's total  industrial and agricultural output value had been doubled by  1987 and is expected to be quadrupled by 1996.    He pointed out that although inland provinces are different  from coastal areas in geographical conditions, natural  conditions and the speed of economic development, they should  not lag behind in emancipating the mind. Once the people's  minds are emancipated, they will be able to shake off yokes,  incorporate and use experience of developed regions, and  fundamentally reform the old system that bound productive  forces, in order to promote local economic development.    He called on inland provinces to seize the current  opportunity, bring their advantages into full play, deepen the  reform, open themselves wider to the outside world, and  accelerate their economic development.    On reform of the administrative system for grain, Li  stressed  that it is necessary both to pay close attention to and be  cautious in the reform of the system. At present, he added, it  is important to make all efforts to stabilize grain prices and  to make concerted efforts to ensure a bumper harvest in 1994.</p>

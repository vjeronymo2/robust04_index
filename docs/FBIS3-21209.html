			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Research Development Corporation of Japan (JRDC)  has developed a technology to mass-produce the high-purity `C60'  carbon molecule at low cost. The technology calls for separation  and purification by filling the inside of a doughnut-shape  molecular structured aromatic organic compound ring with C60  molecules. Ninety-nine point 8 percent high-purity C60 can be  produced at 1/20 the cost of the conventional method. Since low  cost mass-production of the C60 is possible, application efforts  for semiconductors and catalysts are expected to accelerate.  Research will be further conducted to facilitate  commercialization as early as possible.    The new technology was developed by the Shinkai  Chemirecognics Project (Director, Professor Seiji Shinkai of  Faculty of Engineering, Kyushu University) team of the  Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology Operation Project,  JRDC. Prof. Shinkai and his team discovered the precipitated  substance in a solution while conducting research on compounds  (``karikkusu)/arene'' derived from a circle of 8 benzene rings  which are useful as solvent for the C60. Observation by nuclear  magnetic resonance device of the precipitated substance showed  the C60 being placed completely inside the compound ring.    In order to obtain high purity C60, first low purity C60  containing soot was dissolved in toluene. Then karikkusu/arene  was added. Soon C60 entered the inside of the ring and a light  green substance precipitated. The precipitated substance was  taken out and dissolved by chloroform.    The chloroform pushed the C60 out of the ring. The C60 which  was pushed out of the ring precipitated into a black substance,  which completes the separation. The purification experiment  achieved 99.8% high purity C60 at a yield rate of  approximately  70% by using about 60% low purity C60 as a starter.</p>

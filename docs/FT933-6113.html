			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Ministers soften BR line to head off rebels TRANSPORT MINISTERS are examining whether British Rail's role in the process of bidding for franchises could be 'formalised' to avoid a confrontation with rebel Tories at Westminster. Mr Steven Norris, the junior transport minister, yesterday emphasised the government's determination not to delay or abandon its rail privatisation plans. He insisted that ministers would not let a House of Lords amendment allowing BR to bid for franchises stand in their way. He dismissed speculation that the government might defer the proposals in order to avoid defeat. In July the Lords insisted - against the government's advice - that BR should be allowed to bid. Ministers described it then as a 'wrecking' amendment which attacked the heart of the plans. Mr Norris made it clear, however, that if there was a way the government could maintain the basis of its proposals while avoiding the need to fight the cross-party alliance among opposition and Tory peers and MPs, then ministers would welcome it. The more conciliatory tone now is based on the government's argument that BR is already involved in the bidding process: unless potential franchisees from the private sector can show they would run services on lower subsidies than BR, then BR will continue to operate them. 'BR is bidding - it is there constantly as the benchmark against which we should gauge other people's performance,' Mr Norris said yesterday. His comments suggest that the government will urge outright rejection of the Lords amendment only if it is told that devising a way of assessing BR's costs for the bidding process is too complex. He added: 'Ministers don't want any more difficulties with the process than they already have. If we can live with it, we will.' Mr Norris's comments come after renewed warnings of dissent from Tory MPs who rebelled against the privatisation plans when the bill was being discussed earlier this year. Last week a leaked paper from within BR suggesting that there could be fare increases of up to 16 per cent intensified the calls from some Conservative MPs in the south-east for further concessions from the government to safeguard fare levels after privatisation. The limited time available to conclude debate before the end of the session will add to the pressure on ministers to find a way to avoid a full-scale clash with the Lords. The legislation must go through parliament in the month or so from mid-October when peers resume their discussion of the bill.</p>

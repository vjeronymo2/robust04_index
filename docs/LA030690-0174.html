			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> EINSTEIN VIDEO IS RELATIVELY LOST  </P> <P> Nearly 4,000 feet of film on Albert Einstein that was part of the University of  South Carolina's Movietonews collection fell out of a delivery truck and has  been missing for a week, officials say.  </P> <P> "From a historical standpoint, it is absolutely irreplaceable," said Don  McCallister, assistant archivist for the university's News Film Library.  </P> <P> "I can't really put a dollar value on it. How do you put a dollar value on  something that cannot be replaced?"  </P> <P> The film, which has historical value to researchers, shows Einstein appearing  at various events during the 1930s.  </P> <P> The university was sending the film, which was packed in a 1-foot-square  fiberboard carton, to Audio Plus Video International in Northvale, N.J., so it  could be copied onto videotape for a French filmmaker, McCallister said.  </P> <P> On Feb. 27, a delivery truck carrying the film left the Federal Express office  in Columbia. A few blocks down the road, the driver realized the back door had  opened.  </P> <P> Federal Express workers searched the route but did not find the package.  </P> <P> "We are doing everything we can to try to find this package," Sandra Munoz, a  spokeswoman for Federal Express in Memphis, said today.  </P></p>

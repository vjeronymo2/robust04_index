			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / N Korea retreats on N-checks North Korea yesterday agreed to allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to check its seven acknowledged nuclear plants, Reuter reports from Vienna. IAEA officials said they expected the inspections to take place before the agency's governing body meets in Vienna next week. North Korean diplomats yesterday resumed talks with the IAEA over inspection of the nuclear sites, breaking three weeks of deadlock. North Korea's envoy to the IAEA, Yun Ho-Jin, met officials of the agency's division for the first time since negotiations broke down on January 25. North Korea has refused to allow inspections of the seven sites for the past year. Talks with the IAEA, the UN agency charged with enforcing international safeguards against the spread of nuclear weapons, stalled after the two sides were unable to agree terms. The IAEA board of governors was expected to declare Pyongyang in breach of its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty next week unless North Korea agreed to inspections. South Korea said the North had proposed a working-level meeting with the US before the February 21 deadline. The US has said it would bring the issue to the UN Security Council and seek sanctions if the IAEA could no longer guarantee Pyongyang was not making nuclear weapons. George Graham in Washington adds: Although North Korea agreed to some of the measures it has been arguing about, such as allowing IAEA inspectors to reload permanent surveillance cameras and change seals, yesterday's announcement made no reference to two undeclared sites which the IAEA also wants to inspect. The two sites are suspected of holding nuclear wastes which the IAEA believes would help it to determine whether North Korea has been producing more plutonium than declared. The US yesterday welcomed the agreement as 'a necessary step for the agency to be able to reassure the international community there has been no diversion of nuclear material.' A State Department official said satisfactory completion of the inspections would, together with the resumption of discussions between North and South Korea on the de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, pave the way for a new round of formal US-North Korean talks. An informal meeting was likely to take place soon in New York.</p>

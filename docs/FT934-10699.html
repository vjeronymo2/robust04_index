			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Plymouth docks facelift launched THE REGENERATION of Plymouth's historic Royal William Yard, which includes a range of Grade 1 listed stone buildings, was launched yesterday with a London conference aimed at attracting private-sector investment. The 19-acre yard at the mouth of the Tamar was built in the early 19th century to supply the Royal Navy fleet. Now surplus to Ministry of Defence requirements, the buildings have been neglected in recent years. The yard has been handed over to the newly created Plymouth Development Corporation, which has a Pounds 45m budget over five years to regenerate the yard and two other waterfront sites. The project is one of 14 announced this week by the Department of the Environment under its initiative to encourage private-sector involvement in regeneration. The corporation is seeking to create a mixed usage development which may include restaurants, speciality shops and business and leisure space.</p>

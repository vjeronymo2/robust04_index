			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong demand for Gas British Gas was by far the most actively traded FT-SE 100 constituent as the market delivered a positive verdict to the joint Department of Trade/Ofgas report on competition and pricing in domestic gas supply. The report was published on Monday afternoon, after which Gas closed marginally higher. But yesterday saw a surge in Gas shares, which jumped 11 1/2 to 296 1/2 p in exceptionally heavy turnover of 24m. Hoare Govett, Gas's broker, described the report as 'encouraging', while Mr Stephen Turner at Nomura was much more forthright, issuing his first buy recommendation on Gas for more than two years. 'The lack of detail in the DTI/Ofgas paper suggests that the government is losing its enthusiasm for competition in the domestic gas market,' he said. The Nomura analyst also pointed out that Gas's earnings are conservatively stated and that under generally accepted accounting policies net income would be 20 per cent higher, putting the shares on a 20 per cent discount to the market multiple in 1995.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Sport: Green machine - Golf CHARLIE, Chris, Margot and I played the 18th at Pebble Beach recently. Unhappily, we were not in California but in Birmingham, England. It was not quite the same. The real Pebble Beach 18th tee is high above the Pacific ocean, and the fairway curves like a scimitar around the clifftops to a green a par-five away. We, by contrast, were standing on an artificial surface inside a booth 20 ft by ten ft by 14 ft. We were aiming at a screen which showed a simulated picture of the hole. It was not like the real thing. Nothing can reproduce the feeling of being out in the fresh air on a sunny day with a clear sky and a following wind. That said, I must add that this device came nearer than I imagined was possible. Golf simulators have been around for more than a decade. They flash a series of pictures of a hole on a screen at which you aim. But they bear no more resemblance to playing on a golf course than a pitch and putt course does to a full 18 holes. This new machine is much more realistic, even if it is unable to make you forget you are standing on an artificial surface in a booth. Where it exceeds all its rivals is the feeling it gives you of actually playing the hole in question. If you slice, the ball goes right; if you hook, it goes left. If you hit into the water, there is a splash. Hit into a bunker and you have to play your next shot from a sand bunker in the booth. For putts there is a putting surface and a hole. The machine tells you the precise distance your shot has travelled, keeps score for all the players and provides full sound effects. These US-made machines have found a ready market in Japan, while four have been installed at the David Lloyd leisure centre in Finchley, London. They range in cost from Pounds 35,000 to Pounds 40,000. So far the courses you can play on it are famous US ones. As for Britain, filming has been done of the Belfry and you will be able to play simulated golf on this course quite soon. Other courses are in the works. The UK importer is Ingolf of Birkdale, Lancashire, tel: 0704-540861.</p>

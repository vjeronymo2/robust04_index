			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Bank of Spain ex-chief under fire Mr Mariano Rubio, the man whose signature stands next to the King of Spain's head on the Pta10,000 (Pounds 50) banknote, yesterday sat facing a committee of MPs on live television accused of speculating on the stock market, holding a secret account, evading tax and using privileged information. In an atmosphere of growing nervousness in the Socialist administration about the potential fallout from the affair, Mr Rubio, former governor of the Bank of Spain, told deputies he was 'not aware' of having held a clandestine account or having cheated the taxman. Presented with allegations from the conservative Popular party that he had bought shares in Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) shortly before a hostile takeover bid for the bank in 1987, he told the congress's economy and finance committee: 'I have no idea how these purchases could have happened.' The bid by Banco de Bilbao subsequently failed. Ms Luisa Fernanda Rudi, Popular party spokeswoman on the committee, told Mr Rubio his replies had 'clarified little or nothing'. Mr Rubio's business affairs returned to the forefront of Spanish political debate last week when the daily El Mundo alleged he salted away profits from stock investments in a Pta130m account hidden from the tax authorities. Mr Rubio was governor of the central bank under the Socialist government from 1984 to mid-1992, when he was linked to a controversy surrounding a failed banking venture, Ibercorp. The bank was run by a close friend, Mr Manuel de la Concha, who controlled Mr Rubio's equity portfolio. Questioned about Ibercorp's affairs yesterday, Mr Rubio said the bank had been closely supervised and that 'things are discovered always too late'. The former bank governor, smoking and stumbling over his replies, appeared extremely tense and uncomfortable. The affair is all the more embarrassing for the government since it coincides with a separate parliamentary investigation into alleged illicit enrichment by the former head of the paramilitary Civil Guard, Mr Lus Roldan, who resigned last year. The opposition has seized on these controversies to accuse the government of widespread Italian-style corruption. The Rubio affair has brought into question the future of Mr Carlos Solchaga, Socialist parliamentary leader and former economy minister during Mr Rubio's governorship.</p>

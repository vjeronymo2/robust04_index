			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 16 Nov (MENA)--The Environment Committee,  which is a subcommittee of the multilateral negotiations of the  conference on peace in the Middle East, concluded its meetings  in Cairo this evening.    The final session went three hours over the time set for it  to provide opportunity for further discussions, especially with  regard to a number of disputed issues, such as contamination  resulting from nuclear wastes and the prominence the U.S.  delegation gave to the issue of pollution in the Gulf of Aqaba.    During the final session, the conferees followed up on  issues  relating to preserving the environment, particularly marine  pollution and other sources of pollution, such as chemical  wastes, as well as exploiting the potential of each state in the  region.    During the discussions, they agreed on some standards and  measures to organize international and regional efforts to  preserve the environment, which is the project Japan presented  to the conference. They also agreed to carry out further  studies to help combat pollution, prevent environmental  catastrophes, and resolve the issue of oil spillage into the  Gulf of Aqaba, which is bordered by four countries: Saudi  Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Israel. This is a project that the  [words indistinct] refused to address now.    The statement issued by the conference, the meetings of  which  continued for four days with the participation of more than 44  countries and numerous international bodies concerned about  environmental issues, noted that the United States and Russia,  the cosponsors of the multilateral talks, [words indistinct] the  EC, and Japan, showed their willingness to fund projects they  want to carry out in the region.    [Words indistinct] stated that Egypt asked that the issue of  nuclear wastes be listed on the talks' agenda, but Russia,  Israel, and the United States objected to it. They demanded  that this subject be referred to the Arms Limitation Committee.  This upset Egypt and the Arab delegations.    Saudi Arabia, the Gulf countries, and the Palestinians  supported Egypt's stand in this regard and decided to refer the  whole issue to the Steering Committee [words indistinct] the  five committees of the conference.    On the other hand, conference circles denied reports about  reaching an agreement on setting up an [word indistinct] center  in Jordan, from which Israel could benefit.    The head of the Economic Department of the Foreign Ministry  chaired Egypt's delegation to these meetings.</p>

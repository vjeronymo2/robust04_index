			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sheraton to lease hotels from rival SHERATON, the hotels subsidiary of US conglomerate ITT, is to buy or lease eight hotels from Marriott Corporation, a rival American lodging chain, in a deal worth about Dollars 160m which will give Sheraton a presence in Paris. Sheraton is purchasing the Prince de Galles, a 170-room hotel in central Paris, as well as buying five and leasing two all-suite hotels in the US. The US acquisitions will triple its presence in the growing suites market. The deal is a further significant expansion for Sheraton, which, backed by ITT's strong balance sheet, has spent some Dollars 1bn over the past few years on renovating and acquiring properties in the US. Mr Robert Bowman, executive vice-president of the chain, hinted yesterday that the deal could be the forerunner of other international acquisitions. 'Current market conditions,' he said, 'will allow the company to pursue further expansion possibilities throughout our worldwide network.' For highly-indebted Marriott, the deal represents an opportunity to reduce its borrowings. Last December, Marriott said it planned to raise about Dollars 220m within 60 days through a variety of trans actions. Caesars World, the US gaming and hotels group, attributed improved second-quarter results to increased casino revenue from all three of the company's casino/hotels, AP-DJ reports . Net income in the quarter jumped to Dollars 23.1m from Dollars 4m last time on revenues which rose to Dollars 253.5m from Dollars 208m last time.</p>

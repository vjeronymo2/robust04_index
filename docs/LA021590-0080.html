			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 200 VENTURA UNIFIED TEACHERS PROTEST LENGTHY CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS  </P> <P> More than 200 Ventura Unified School District teachers crowded into the  district boardroom Tuesday night to protest unresolved contract negotiations  that are now in their 10th month.  </P> <P> Bearing signs reading "We Want a Fair Contract" and "We Can't Go On Meeting  Like This," the teachers stood quietly while union representative Jerry  Mittelholtz accused the district of turning a "cold shoulder" to the district's  650 teachers.  </P> <P> "We just don't feel important," said Barbara Schmidt, a reading specialist at  Montalvo Elementary School. "I think that the trust between teachers and the  school board is not strong . . . Our teachers are excellent, but the morale is  low."  </P> <P> District teachers have been working without a contract since June, unable to  reach agreement on items ranging from salary to retirement benefits.  </P> <P> Last month the state Public Employees Relations Board appointed a mediator in  hopes of concluding an agreement.  </P> <P> Under the expired contract, Ventura Unified teachers earn between $22,902 and  $44,772.  </P> <P> One district official told The Times on Wednesday that the entire union salary  and benefits package represents a 14.8% pay and benefits increase. A union  official said the district's latest pay offer is a 1.5% salary increase, but  would not say what the union is demanding.  </P> <P> Tuesday's protest came less than 24 hours after an informal meeting, an  eight-hour meeting district negotiator Richard Averett described as "very  productive."  </P> <P> Both district officials and teacher representatives declined to discuss the  specifics of the meeting. However, they indicated that little has changed since  contract meetings began in April of last year.  </P> <P> "The main issues are still a fair contract monetarily, fair fringe benefits and  fair treatment and equality for all our teachers," said Mittelholtz, president  of the Ventura Unified Education Assn., which is representing the teachers.  </P> <P> Mittelholtz, who attended Monday's informal meeting, was guardedly optimistic.  Negotiations were scheduled to continue today.  </P> <P> While teacher contracts remain unresolved, efforts to convert two Ventura  elementary schools to year-round education appear close to completion.  </P> <P> Citing parent surveys that appear to indicate overwhelming support, parents and  educators from E.P. Foster and Sheridan Way elementary schools urged board  members Tuesday to approve a year-round schedule for the two Ventura  Avenue-area schools. Under the plan, the two elementary schools would move to a  year-round schedule by July. The board is expected to make a final decision  Feb. 27.  </P></p>

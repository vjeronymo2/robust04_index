			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Walker defendant 'scarcely involved' Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former finance director of Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, had little involvement in the alleged fraudulent boosting of the company's profits, his counsel told the Old Bailey yesterday. Mr Roy Amlot QC, in a closing speech on behalf of Mr Aquilina, also criticised the prosecution for being 'obsessive and oppressive' in the way it brought its case against Mr Aquilina and Mr George Walker, the former Brent Walker chairman. Mr Walker and Mr Aquilina are both accused of falsely inflating the company's profits by more than Pounds 19m between 1984 and 1989. They both deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify the Brent Walker accounts. The prosecution claims the profit-boosting took place through the Brent Walker film division. It alleges that bogus film rights sales were booked to the accounts of both the film subsidiary and Brent Walker, that the transactions were funded by Brent Walker itself and that they were concealed by money-laundering through overseas companies and trusts. Mr Aquilina played only a small part in the events the prosecution claimed amounted to a fraud, said Mr Amlot. He could not authorise payments of more than Pounds 50,000 and his name featured only to a limited extent in the movements of money. 'Mr Aquilina is scarcely involved in the transfers,' he said. He had also received no financial benefit from the alleged fraud, Mr Amlot continued. The trial continues on Thursday when the judge begins his summing up. The jury is due to retire on Monday October 17.</p>

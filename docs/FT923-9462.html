			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Christiania Bank reduces losses CHRISTIANIA BANK, Norway's second-biggest commercial bank, said yesterday that first-half net losses narrowed sharply to NKr162m (Dollars 27.8m) from NKr1.637bn in the same period last year. The bank also reduced the amount its wants as emergency state funding from NKr750m to NKr685m to enable it to meet stricter capital adequacy requirements to be implemented by the end of the year. Last year, Christiania received state funds of NKr7.864bn. Christiania was acquired by the state last year after its share capital was wiped out by large losses. The bank was de-listed from the bourse and shareholders were given an option to acquire up to 25 per cent of the state's shares. Some 2.3 per cent of Christiania's share capital has been taken up by private investors. A decision to relist the bank in Oslo could be made by the end of next month. Christiania lifted first-half net interest income to NKr1.555bn from NKr1.413bn last year. Profits from foreign exchange and securities' trading dipped to NKr260m from NKr283m, as non-interest expenses were cut to NKr1.447bn from NKr1.769bn in last year's comparative period. Christiania reduced staff by 20 per cent during the last 18 months as part of a state instruction to reduce costs by 15 per cent. Costs were reduced by 21 per cent by the end of the second quarter. First-half credit losses fell to NKr1bn from NKr1.9bn, but Mr Borger A. Lenth, chief executive, said credit losses were still at an unacceptable level. He pointed out that the value of collateral for loans was still declining. He expressed concern over the development of the domestic economy and over a reduction in the volume of the bank's loans and said that if the bank saw a further, strong reduction in loan volume, it would be necessary to evaluate the bank's branch network. Should the bank be forced to consolidate further, additional redundancies could be necessary, he warned. He said that it would need NKr685m to meet capital adequacy requirements by the end of the year, compared with its first-quarter estimate of NKr750m.</p>

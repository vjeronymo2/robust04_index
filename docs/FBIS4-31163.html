			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "J.T.P.": "Coalition Leads; CBOS on Local </F> Elections"]    [Text] It can be concluded from a May poll conducted  by the Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS] that about 41  percent of eligible voters will take part in the upcoming local  elections. This would mean that this year's turnout will not be  different from that of four years ago when 42 percent of the  voters decided to vote. But because the poll was conducted a  month before the elections, the situation may still change.    According to responses given by respondents in the first  half  of May, the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] leads among the parties  running in the elections, with 16 percent, followed by the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] (15 percent), the Freedom Union  [UW] (12 percent), and the Union of Labor [UP] (10 percent). In  the second half of May, 21 percent of those polled wanted to  vote PSL, 12 percent for SLD, and 15 percent for UW. The  remaining parties would gain fewer than 3 percent of the votes.  But the largest group of respondents could not make up their  minds regarding any party. When one compares that with results  from the previous elections, one can conclude that UW and SLD  have the most faithful electorates, with the Union for Real  Politics and the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms having  gained the greatest number of new supporters; from among the big  parties, the highest number of new supporters was gained by UP,  while the smallest number -- by UW. These results must however  be approached with great caution since a big part will be played  in the local elections by local election committees, with  political parties being behind some of them. After taking into  account the participation in the elections of local committees  (for which many voters would prefer to vote instead of the  parties), one can state that PSL should gain at least 10 percent  in the elections, SLD -- 9 percent, UW -- 7 percent, UP -- 5  percent, while the coalition with the participation of the  Christian-National Union -- 4 percent.    So these results are different from some data on election  preferences in parliamentary elections that were published in  Tuesday's RZECZPOSPOLITA and that were collected by the  Sopot-based Social Research Institute [Pracownia Badan  Spolecznych]. If parliamentary elections were to take place  today, they would be won by SLD, followed by UW, and PSL (which  has the biggest chances for the local elections) coming third.  It is obvious that both polls were conducted on different kinds  of voters and they apply to different situations, and that is  most probably how the differences came about.    Forty-five percent of those polled evaluated the performance  of the outgoing gmina councils very well or just well (during  the May poll), while 29 percent said their assessment was  "rather bad" or "very bad." Local authorities have for a long  time been the authorities institutions gaining the best public  assessments of all. In an April poll, their performance was  positively evaluated by 57 percent of those polled. Despite  that, the biggest group of the polled will tend to vote in favor  of changes rather than in favor of a continuation when it comes  to personnel composition of gmina councils. They do not have  high praise for the importance of local elections, either.    The poll was conducted during 7-10 and 19-23 May, using a  representative random sample of adult residents of Poland.</p>

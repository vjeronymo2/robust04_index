			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (8): Drive for local sourcing - Nigerian investors are steering clear of manufacturing NIGERIAN businessmen, complains a senior government official, 'are not yet ready to invest in manufacturing - they prefer fast-moving, high-return activities.' This is hardly surprising. The incentive system has long favoured trade over industry, and imported components for assembly rather than local sourcing. Structural adjustment and naira devaluation were meant to change all that, but progress has been disappointing. In a recent report, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) notes gloomily that the extent of local sourcing still falls 'far short of expectations'. In the first half of 1991, MAN estimates, 47 per cent of raw materials were sourced within Nigeria - primarily non-metallic minerals such as cement, food, textiles and wood. These four sectors had local sourcing ratios in excess of 70 per cent, while the remaining six averaged 33 per cent. This year, the search for backward integration is being stepped up by the Raw Materials Research and Development Council (RMRDC), launched by the government in 1987. It is setting up five small model plants to process cocoa, kaolin, talc, phosphate rock and soda ash. The council says it is following Japan in establishing 'catalytic' plants, designed to demonstrate that the use of local raw materials is both feasible and profitable. The plants, financed by the council at a cost of Dollars 5.5m (the RMRDC draws its financing from a 1 per cent government levy on imports) will come on stream in the latter half of the year. Once markets are established and the projects are seen to be working, the council will sell them to private investors. Already, a large Nigerian investor, the Leventis group, has shown interest in the soda ash plant, which is a potential source of supply for its Coca-Cola bottling operations. The catalytic plant project is one of three council initiatives designed to boost local processing and exports. It has also set up 26 investor groups, to investigate a broad range of projects utilising local materials. The RMRDC funds the feasibility studies, providing details to investors who sign a letter of intent to proceed with the scheme. The third prong is an export drive for non-traditional products such as gum arabic and ginger, in which Nigeria has a competitive advantage. The council plans to launch a marketing drive in the UK later in the year. There is more to local sourcing than economic nationalism. In metals, one industrialist says it is simply not profitable to operate with an import component that far exceeds 50 per cent of the final retail price. In foods and in beer, the switch from imported to local cereals has worked to the advantage of the multinationals such as Nestle, Cadbury Nigeria and Guinness. The combination of the active search for local inputs, promoted by the RMRDC, and further steep depreciation of the naira will enhance the viability of backward integration on the one hand and non-traditional exports on the other. Lever Brothers is one of the most active multinationals in the field of local sourcing, tackling the problem on several fronts. It has invested N150m (Dollars 14.8m) in a 90-hectare tea plantation on the Mambilla plateau in the north-east, and has plans to expand the project to cover 500ha. Although it was keen to buy one of the privatised palm plantations, this was not possible, and so a trade investment strategy has been used. The country's largest user of palm oil, Lever has a 20 per cent stake in one of the plantations and has put some of its management into the scheme, with the result that output has doubled in the last 18 months. Another strategy is to provide technical assistance to small and medium-sized businesses producing essential inputs such as chemicals or packaging materials, in return for buy-back agreements under which Lever purchases its input requirements locally rather than relying on imports. A member of the board is responsible for searching out local sourcing prospects and developing backward integration opportunities, especially in agriculture. Devaluation has certainly boosted industrial exports, which rose from Dollars 8m in 1985, before the naira was floated, to more than Dollars 80m last year. But exactly how much is being exported is not known, with estimates ranging from 10 per cent to as much as 30 per cent of total turnover in an industry such as textiles. Industrialists say that the renewed weakness of the naira has boosted unrecorded exports, especially into neighbouring CFA franc zone countries where Nigerian goods are highly competitive. There is substantial unrecorded two-way cross-border trade in manufactures, with smuggled imports undercutting local manufactures and legal imports. 'Unofficial' exports are, in fact, directly competitive with legal exports of Nigerian manufactures. 'We are undersold by our own products smuggled into neighbouring markets,' says one manufacturer. But there is little doubt that manufacturing industry has underperformed in recent years. Its share of gross domestic product fell from a high of 11 per cent in 1981-82 to an estimated 8.3 per cent last year. Manufacturing value-added (MVA), at constant prices, declined almost 30 per cent between 1982 and 1986. It has since recovered almost all the lost ground, but the fact is that real industrial output last year was no higher than 10 years ago. While official figures suggest that capacity utilisation is no more than 30 per cent of installed capacity, industrialists emphasise that the effective capacity has declined substantially in recent years. Actual capacity utilisation figures are believed to be closer to 70 per cent in most activities, according to one industrialist, though there are sectors, such as vehicle assembly, where utilisation is 20 per cent. Official estimates by the Central Bank of Nigeria put cumulative foreign private investment in manufacturing between 1970 and 1988 at N3.6bn, or one third of the total. Nigerian manufacturing desperately needs injections of foreign capital and technology if it is to break out of its existing straitjacket of import-dependence. But with new investors required to submit more than 180 pieces of paper and deal with umpteen different government agencies in Abuja, Lagos and the state where the investment is located, manufacturing is unlikely to attract many new entrants. Asian businessmen, especially from India, are showing more interest than their EC or US counterparts, though in recent years three multinationals have taken the plunge. They are: Coca-Cola; General Motors (a 30 per cent stake in a joint venture with UAC, a Unilever associate, to assemble commercial vehicles); and, still in the pipeline, Rothmans. Other multinationals reportedly taking a fresh look at Nigeria include Procter and Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, though they, and others, are likely to await the outcome of the political transition before committing themselves.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Matsushita joins drive to ease US tensions MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, the Japanese consumer electronics group and one of the country's biggest exporters, will import American-made sportswear and outdoor equipment as part of an effort to ease trade tensions with the US. Matsushita said the move was part of the 'Business Global Partnership' import-boosting programme devised by the Japanese Ministry of Trade and Industry (Miti) to defuse US criticism of Japan's trade surplus. However, Matsushita's move could provoke anger in the US, which is concerned not only about the volume of exports to Japan but also their composition. It would like to see high-technology groups such as Matsushita import more US-made high-tech equipment. Matsushita said the company's global partnership programme did not necessarily target electronic goods. 'We already import whisky and cruiser yachts. We're starting off with smaller things,' it said. Matsushita, which imported Y420bn (Pounds 1.9bn) of goods this year, intends to expand imports to Y600bn in the year to March 1995. Matsushita said it would team up with Seiyu, a leading retailer, in setting up a joint venture, which will import and market products by LL Bean, the US maker of outdoor-wear, starting in April. The electronics group is one of the 23 top manufacturers pledging to increase imports, including imports of parts and capital equipment, boost local procurement in foreign countries and expand commercial ties with non-Japanese groups. The venture will lead to the first foreign outlet for LL Bean, which had sales of Dollars 600m (Pounds 331.4m) last year. The company already markets an estimated Y2bn (Pounds 9m)-worth of goods in Japan through mail order.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (25): On to the operating table - The health service is ripe for financial surgery BY the year 2,000, one person in two in German hospitals is expected to be aged 60 or older. Today, 42 per cent of hospital patients are near or past retirement. To finance health care for its ageing population, the German labour force will continue to face increasing social security payments. Payroll contributions to health insurance funds have steadily grown in the last 10 years, and equal nearly 7 per cent of gross earnings. Shared equally between employees and employers, these surcharges are among the ancillary costs burdening German businesses and undermining their competitiveness. Keeping health costs under control is a key priority for the Bonn government as it attempts to safeguard Germany's manufacturing base. Mr Horst Seehofer, the federal health minister, can claim considerable success in reducing spending since his new health care law took effect on January 1, 1993. By squeezing budgets for doctors and hospitals, the reforms have curbed the amount of drugs and treatment being prescribed. For the first six months of the year, per capita health spending decreased by 2.7 per cent, after a 9 per cent increase last year. But politicians and medical personnel now agree that further reforms are needed to solve the health service's structural weaknesses. A group of experts in the health ministry is studying how to improve efficiency. Without more reforms, it is claimed, financial cuts could lower the standard of treatment. In a rare show of harmony, *something in here (HP) * German political parties agreed to support the new law which took effect at the beginning of the year. Its reforms were directed mainly at the medical profession - the law limits their ability to prescribe drugs and treatments above the spending levels of 1992. A series of penalties have also been introduced making doctors financially responsible for over-prescribing. Doctors' associations must pay the cost of excess prescriptions up to a total of DM280m, which is said to equal 1 per cent of their combined annual fees. Moreover, hospitals which over-run their 1992 budgets will not receive subsidies and must incur debts at the banks. The new bugetary limits had an immediate effect on spending. Per capita health spending has fallen 2.7 per cent in the first six months of the year. The sharpest drop affected drugs, with retail sales plunging by 21 per cent for the period. As a result, the state-subsidised health insurance scheme is back in the black. Last year, the scheme, which offers nearly full coverage to 90 per cent of the population, recorded a DM9bn loss. For the first six months of 1993, it achieved a healthy surplus of DM2.6bn. Mr Seehofer was also trying to influence the public's behaviour. Germans spend more on drugs and treatment than any other European people except the French. 'A patient never wanted to leave a surgery without a prescription. Doctors took advantage of this to over-prescribe. This has now changed,' says Mr Frank Montgomery, from the independent Marburger association of doctors. 'We have succeeded in changing the behaviour of everyone involved in the health care system,' claims Mr Seehofer. However, the reforms have horrified health workers. According to the federal association of pharmacists, 20,000 jobs are threatened by the new law. Doctors complain that their earnings have been hit by the ceiling on their fees. The biggest impact has arguably been on the established drug houses whose sales fell by 11 per cent in the first six months of the year. By contrast, sales of cheap generic drugs rose 12 per cent for the period. Both health workers and the pharmaceutical industry say such developments will harm their ability to prescribe state-of-the-art medicine. Doctors, who face a moratorium on the opening of new medical practices (except in understaffed areas), claim the law is too restrictive. The moratorium was introduced to slow the rapid growth in the number of Germany's doctors - over the last 12 years it doubled to the present 260,000. The pharmaceutical industry, meanwhile, warns that lower earnings will hit research budgets. Mr Michael Hansen, of the Boston Consulting group, says that 'reforms cannot work in the long-term if they are against the medical profession. There is growing awareness that better management must be introduced in the system. And doctors have to see benefits in the package,' he says. However, the present system of care is riddled with duplication and red tape. Waste stems primarily from the system of payment, under which each medical provider is paid for the service provided to the purchaser. In practice, this means that doctors and hospitals have a a financial interest in duplicating services. Independent medical bodies have suggested that physicians should be allowed to oversee the entire cost of a patient's treatment. Fees could also be charged not on a service basis but for the treatment accorded to each patient. An average fee per member of the national health care system would be established, so that patients requiring little treatment would indirectly subsidise those needing expensive care. There is also a need for a better flow of information within the service, to ensure the avoidance of duplication in examinations and diagnosis of patients' ailments. This implies closer links between hospitals and health services in the community. In some regions, local doctors associations have introduced a patient card, which gives doctors private access to patients' medical history. In order to win parliamentary approval - the opposition Social Democrats control the Bundesrat (the upper chamber) - the government's reforms will need the support of all German parties. Germany will also have to tackle the looming problem of an ageing population. Recent efforts by the Bonn government to introduce new social security payment to finance residential care for the elderly and chronically ill have run into difficulties. Social Democrats oppose the idea that employers should meet some of the cost of additional surcharges out of employees' pay. Employers' associations for their part oppose a move which would further increase their costs. The new residential care plan would save money for hospitals. Ms Ingrid Hasselblatt-Diedrich, of the Hartmann doctors' association, the largest professional body of its kind, says that a quarter of elderly patients whose care in hospital is covered by their insurance contributions, would not have to be in hospital at all if alternative care was available for them in their own homes. But conflicting economic and political interests have so far blocked the new residential care plan. It remains to be seen if there is still enough political will to break the logjam.</p>

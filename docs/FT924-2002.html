			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Arnotts' shares rise as report claims bid is undervalued ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit company, yesterday released a report valuing its stock at up to ADollars 2.50 a share more than the ADollars 8.80 offered by Campbell Soup, the US food group. Grant Samuel, the merchant bank which prepared the report, said the bid 'substantially undervalues Arnotts and is not fair and reasonable'. It said the shares were worth ADollars 10.78 to ADollars 11.32. Arnotts' shares rose nine cents to ADollars 9.20 on the Australian Stock Exchange after the report was released, recovering ground lost after the government allowed the bid to proceed last week. Campbell said the valuation was unrealistic. 'No sound financial analysis can support such a high value for Arnotts. The range is completely out of line with market expectations and analyst valuations.' The report provides support for the Arnotts board, which has called for a 'significant' improvement on the Campbell offer. Schroders, the merchant bank which is advising Arnotts, earlier suggested ADollars 12 would be a fair price. Campbell, which owns just under 33 per cent of Arnotts, is seeking a further 17.2 per cent for a majority stake of 50.1 per cent, but has offered to acquire up to 100 per cent of the stock. The offer values Arnotts at ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 857m).</p>

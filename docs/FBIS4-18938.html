			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Untitled commentary by Philippe Marcovici] </F>   [Text] For the first time since the beginning of the war,  NATO planes struck Serbian positions yesterday. Even  considering that the attacks on Goradze, according to the  information available yesterday evening, are merely a warning --  only two U.S. planes took part in the operation -- the conflict  in Bosnia has just undergone a major change.    Last February, to get Serbian artillery to pull back from  Sarajevo, the allies issued an ultimatum to [Bosnian Serb  leader] Radovan Karadzic's troops, threatening them with  selective air strikes. Nothing like that was seen in Goradze:  no ultimatum, and probably no selective strikes, but what the  military calls close air support; in other words support for  endangered ground troops. Now, since UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Force in former Yugoslavia], has no blue helmets in Goradze  other than one or two observers, we can only conclude that the  air support was carried out for the sole benefit of the Muslim  troops. That is where the change lies, and it is a major change  since it implies that the Atlantic alliance has chosen sides in  Bosnian conflict which has been raging for the past two years.    It is known that NATO and the majority of its member states  have been eager to dampen Serbian ardor -- to put it mildly --  and it is now also clear that, after vascillating for so long,  they are ready to use force to achieve that end. This is  especially true of the Americans, since it was two of their  planes which intervened and they were the first to announce the  raid.    Over and above the circumstances which lend legitimacy to  yesterday's actions -- the inhabitants were in mortal danger and  there is a UN resolution which designated Gorazde and five other  towns as protected areas back in spring 1993 -- the U.S.  attitude raises a few questions. Washington has always pleaded  the Muslim cause in Bosnia, but hitherto that pleading has  always been of a completely platonic nature. Only last week the  secretary of defense and the Army chief of staff [as published]  stated unambiguously that they had ruled out any strikes over  Gorazde. So what on earth could have caused the Clintom  administration to change its mind? Could it be the pressure  exerted by public opinion? Or could it be the pressure exerted  by certain European countries, like France? It is interesting  that yesterday afternoon, shortly before the air strike, the  Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] stated that it was prepared to  shoulder its full responsibilities.    Yesterday, the war in Bosnia took on a new dimension. It  made a huge step toward the internationalization of the conflict.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mr. Mas'ud Barzani has issued a press statement  clarifying the ambiguities in his recent statements calling for  placing Iraqi Kurdistan under UN trusteeship, or making it a  protectorate under the canopy of international peacekeeping  forces. The following is the text of the press statement:    On 6 June 1994, the BBC, British papers, and AFP carried my  statement in which I call for placing Iraqi Kurdistan under UN  trusteeship or making it a protectorate under the canopy of  international peacekeeping forces. It is important for us to  explain the following to the Iraqi people, the national  opposition forces, and the governments involved:    1. The statement was interpreted by some people as a call to  partition and divide Iraq. We deny this in part and parcel.  The statement came as an attempt to find a description for the  anomalous situation of Iraqi Kurdistan. Though the Western  countries alliance provide protection and there is a local  Kurdish administration, this administration suffers from the  weak support of the foreign humanitarian organizations operating  in the region and from the countries which are offering  humanitarian aid, and also from the weak cooperation between it  and these organizations and countries. This makes it less  capable of tackling economic and security issues.    2. We are grateful for and highly value the protection the  alliance countries afford through Provide Comfort and the  efforts that UN agencies and foreign nongovernmental  organizations exert. Had it not been for this protection and  assistance, another humanitarian tragedy would have befallen the  besieged and isolated Kurdish people.    3. Thanks to the peace efforts that were exerted by all good  people, particularly the practical steps made by the Unified  Iraqi National Congress [UINC] center of operations, the Kurdish  crisis was contained by the Kurdish leadership itself and the  help of the UINC, and the cease-fire was entrenched. The  process of normalizing the state of affairs continues. The  dialogue and reconciliation between the Democratic Party of  Kurdistan, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and the other  parties are in full swing to achieve comprehensive peace and to  seek practical formulas for joint cooperation between the two  sides in the future.    4. We support Iraq's unity, and our policy is constant in  this respect and has not changed. We also carry out activities  as part of the Iraqi opposition, represented by the UINC, and  abide by its program and objectives of establishing a democratic  and multiparty replacement that would achieve federalism within  the framework of a unified Iraq. We firmly believe that the  Kurdish problem should be solved within the context of the  broader Iraqi problem.    To avoid any ambiguities and obscurity we deemed it  necessary  to issue this press statement.    Signed: Mas'ud Barzani, 9 June 1994</p>

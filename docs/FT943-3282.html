			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Brussels switches tack on industrial policy The European Commission yesterday unveiled a new-look industrial policy which abandons once-cherished notions such as national champions and sectoral protection in favour of life-long vocational training, global strategic alliances, and an aggressive competition policy. The recommendations are spelt out in a report on industrial competitiveness which offers evidence of new thinking in Europe in response to mounting competition from the US and East Asia. Mr Martin Bangemann, the EU industry commissioner, added spice to the report with a call for a shake-up in EU and national bureaucracies to end excessive bureaucracy and unnecessary delays for businesses seeking licences for new products. 'Some of the delays are unbelievable. Take biotechnology. Two years to wait for administrative procedures is too long. Even if you get the right decision, you miss the market opportunity,' he told a news conference in Brussels. The Commission report is striking for its advocacy of a tough competition and regulatory policy to complement its call for greater liberalisation and deregulation in Europe. Mr Bangemann cited the Commission's recent approval of the BT-MCI alliance to provide global telecom services to multinational companies as an example. While the deal could be interpreted as restricting competition in a narrow sense, it was vital to view the deal in the context of the global market, he said. Other officials said the Commission was pressing for an agreement with the US and Japan on how to vet the unfolding strategic alliances in telecommunications and ensure a level playing field. The hope is that a common position can be reached within the World Trade Organisation. The Commission report also calls for a fresh look at state aid criteria. One idea is to apply general rather than sectoral rules, but Mr Bangemann conceded yesterday that this idea was too radical for most fellow commissioners and member states. The report calls for a more 'rigorous and neutral' approach to state aid, with tougher application of the rules in richer member states. However, the recent approval of a Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2.38bn) restructuring plan for Air France, the ailing national flag carrier, underlines that this is easier said than done. In the area of international trade, the paper said the EU should establish an 'industrial assessment mechanism' to analyse why the EU is performing badly in markets where it should be strong.

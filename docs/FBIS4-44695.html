No Need for Radio Frequencies in  Future Satellites"]    [Text] Noordwijk--In 1997, for the first time in history,  two satellites will transmit using light. It will only be a  test, but data transfer using infrared lasers instead of radio  waves ultimately promises great advantages.    In an artist's impression or on a photograph of a hovering  man-made moon, two significant components are instantly  noticeable: the solar panels and the dish antenna. Such a view  could drastically change if satellites start using optics for  communication. The dish would disappear altogether and the  solar panels would become smaller. Volume and weight savings  are within reach, and those are powerful criteria in competitive  space exploration. The European Space Agency (ESA) will  therefore start experimenting with lasers and optical receivers  within the next three years.  <H5>  Optical Data Transfer </H5>   ESA is taking the first step with the launching of the  French  earth observation satellite, Spot-4, at the end of 1996.  Shortly after that, at the beginning of 1997, Artemis will be  launched into space. Artemis is an advanced geostationary  satellite by which various new telecommunications systems will  be tested. These two will be the first to make use of optical  data transfer. In addition to the usual dish antennas, with a  diameter of almost three meters, each satellite will be  specially equipped with a telescope 25 centimeters in diameter.    An optical receiver with this diameter would at the moment  be  no lighter than the dish antennas. But when lasers with a  higher capacity are used in the future, the mass of the optical  modules could well decrease. "There are as yet no advantages  with these first attempts. But by the second or third  generation we make a profit," said Gotthard Oppenhauser, payload  manager Data Relay Technology Mission (DRTM) at ESTEC in  Noordwijk. Spot-4 will send remote sensing data back to the  earth via Artemis. The Spot observation satellite orbits at a  high speed only 700 to 800 kilometers above the earth's surface  and can as a result remain in contact with an individual ground  station for no longer than 10 minutes. The Silex optical  modules on board Artemis and Spot-4 will, however, enable a  direct connection between the observation satellite and the  control room in Toulouse (France). Contact is possible as long  as Spot-4 is within view of Artemis, which will hover 36,000  kilometers above the earth. Every 50 minutes, Spot will  disappear behind the earth's sphere and will in practice be in  direct contact with Artemis for only about half of its orbit.  <H5>  Greatest Challenge </H5>   This also means that the satellites will continually have to  search for each other. They will send out strong signals with  19 high capacity lasers, each of 500 milliwatt. This  "searchlight" cannot be relied upon for communication, but only  for identification. For the actual transmission, a  100-milliwatt semiconductor laser will be installed. Both kinds  are (aluminum gallium arsenide) semiconductor lasers with a wave  length of about 800 nanometers. This wave length was chosen  because it is suitable for the most sensitive receivers. There  will be two reserve 100-milliwatt lasers on board.    The greatest challenge in the ESA project is the development  of a very accurate tracking system. For communication purposes,  a continuous connection is necessary between the stationary  Artemis and the Spot-4, which will be moving at a speed of  30,000 kilometers an hour. The Silex modules on board Artemis  and Spot-4 must be able to track each other at an accuracy level  of 0.50 millidegrees. This means that at a distance of 36,000  kilometers, a deviation of a maximum of 100 meters would be  allowed. Sensors and electronics must constantly read,  calculate, and correct the deviation. The laser signals from  Artemis will also be received at an optical ground station on  Tenerife. At an altitude of 2,500 meters, and thus almost free  of diffused light, a telescope one meter across will be erected  during the second half of 1995. The optical antenna has already  been made by Carl Zeiss Jena, with support from the German space  institute DARA, and was completed in November 1993. At the  moment it is undergoing extensive testing.  <H5>  A Promising Future </H5>   The Silex terminals of which the lasers will form a part  were  developed by ESA in collaboration with the French space  laboratory CNES [National Center for Space Studies]. The  transmission speed is 50 megabits per second. With these  optical modules, communication is also possible in principle  over a distance of 40,000 kilometers at a speed of 100 megabits  per second, but the electronics on the Spot-4 are still a  limiting factor. Radio waves for satellite communications (with  a wave length of 15 and one centimeters) generally also reach a  transmission speed of 100 megabits per second.    In principle, however, lasers can be modulated with a much  higher data speed. For satellite applications, however, a  higher capacity is also necessary. "We are doing it with a  simple but robust method," said Oppenhauser. "We are merely  switching the lasers on and off 50 million times a second."    In the future the question to consider will be: greater data  speed with more capacity, or a smaller telescope. In any case,  Oppenhauser expects a ten-fold improvement in the sensitivity of  the optical detection by use of more sensitive modulation  methods very soon.    Not much energy is required for the laser transmission. The  present lasers work at 100 milliwatt, while satellites for radio  transmission need to be able to produce 30 Watt very quickly.  It will therefore be possible to have smaller solar panels in  the future.    A consortium of some 20 companies under the leadership of  Matra Marconi Space will handle the production of the Silex  terminals. The first commercial optical modules will be  installed on the DRS1 and DRS2 (data relay satellites) which  will probably be launched in 1998 and 2003 respectively.</p>

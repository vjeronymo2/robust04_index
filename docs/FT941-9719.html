			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Skiing in the deep freeze: Arnie Wilson finds the going tough The FT Round the World Skiing Expedition has crossed the ice curtain: temperatures in Montana suddenly plunged and as the weatherman said: 'Nice weather today if you're a husky.' The Arctic conditions coincided with our faithful car - nicknamed Spud because of its Idaho plates - giving up the ghost. The frozen Montana wastelands are no place for a car with a flat battery. 'She's dead as a rock,' pronounced the mechanic hurriedly despatched from Bozeman airport to Big Sky ski resort, where our own batteries had been topped up with some exhilarating skiing. A blue replica of Spud arrived on a low-loader, but my companion Lucy Dicker, in the grip of a severe migraine, was scarcely aware that we had changed cars. This delay meant we arrived at Bridger Bowl just in time for me to ski its famous ridge. This involves a steep, 25-minute climb, skis strapped to your back, before trudging along a narrow ridge to tackle one of dozens of challenging ungroomed chutes and gullies. The migraine spared Lucy the ordeal of traversing into the apron - one section is so steep, narrow and undulating that skiers are advised to grab a tree known as 'Desperation Pine' if they slip. But like me, Lucy is determined to ski every day of 1994 and so she struggled from the car to ski Bridger's lower slopes in freezing conditions. The following night we began a nightmarish nine-hour drive more than half way across Wyoming in such freezing conditions that every time a huge truck hurtled past it enveloped us in a cloud of carbon monoxide vapour. You could win a skiing holiday for two in Courchevel or Verbier, or runner-up prizes of malt whisky, by entering the competition which appeared in last week's Weekend FT (copies available from the FT shop, tel: 071-873 3324). The expedition's principal sponsors are: Avis; American Airlines; Air New Zealand; Champagne Mercier; Clarins; Dynamic Skis; Fogg Travel Insurance; Hewlett-Packard; Luhta; Salomon; Ski The Summit, Colorado; Snow + Rock.</p>

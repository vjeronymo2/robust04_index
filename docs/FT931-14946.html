			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Technology: A new player on the tennis court - At the Australian Open, beginning Monday, a computer will be calling the shots Perhaps when John McEnroe retired from full-time professional tennis last December, he stopped too soon. Next Monday, the Australian Open tennis championships begin at Flinders Park in Melbourne, using a computerised system derived from a weapons tracking machine to call the lines. No more linespeople. No more disputed calls. No more arguments with the umpire. The technology to be used on the three main show courts at Flinders Park has taken five years to develop. It requires costly alterations to the existing courts, but should save frazzled umpires working in heats of up to 100 deg F from disputes. In tennis, a ball that touches any part of the line - however narrowly  - is in; but deciding that with a ball travelling at up to 100 mph exhausts the human eye. Also, two people in different places can see two results, leading to the sort of arguments that McEnroe became so notorious for in his time. The new system was developed by John Baxter and Bruce Candy at an Adelaide-based company called Tel (for Tennis Electronic Lines), where they applied their knowledge of weapons detection and radio systems to tennis. The entire court on which the system is to be used must first be relaid. Flat cables 60 centimetres wide are set about one cm underneath the positions where the lines (about five cm wide) will be. Then the new court (of rubberised concrete in the case of Flinders Park) is poured on and the lines painted down the centres of the cables. The cost of doing that on the three show courts at Flinders Park came to more than Pounds 130,000. The rubber cores of the tennis balls to be used incorporate a tiny quantity of iron particles - not enough to alter their playing characteristics, but sufficient to disturb a magnetic field (generated by an electric current) around the lines. An on-court computer monitors these variations and decides where, over 30 cm either side of the line, the ball hit the court. The result is fed to a monitor at the umpire's chair. Tel says it is accurate to within three millimetres; only the best linespeople are consistently accurate to within a centimetre. The system was used at last September's US Open which, like the Australian Open and Wimbledon, is one of the four main 'Grand Slam' tournaments in the tennis calendar. Although the Australian authorities intend this year to use it only in the over-35s event, Geoff Pollard, chief executive of Tennis Australia, which runs the tournament, says: 'It's years ahead of anything else, and we would not be bothering to experiment with it if in a couple of years we did not intend to use it.' Pollard acknowledges that the system 'has the potential to eradicate disputes over line calls forever' but also that it 'raises questions about the future culture of professional tennis'. Brian Williams, managing director of Tel, is seeking an agreement from the Association of Tennis Professionals, which runs the men's professional game. 'I'm waiting for their approval of it for international play,' he says. 'That has been the hardest part - not the development, but the politics. The ATP is afraid that players will demand it on all courts, which would put quite a financial burden on tournaments.' But it would cut the number of linespeople needed on a court significantly - from the usual complement of the umpire and 10 people to the umpire, net-cord judge and foot-fault judge (on the baseline). And for Tel, equipping the 81 men's events and 60 women's events would be a financial bonanza. However, because Tel presently cannot function on the portable courts commonly used during the indoor season of the men's game, that prospect may be a little way off. Williams reckons it will cost another year and ADollars 500,000 (Pounds 225,000) to develop such a system; after the ADollars 4.5m that has gone into development so far, that will not seem much. And he also expects soon to be installing the system on clay courts in Monte Carlo, and possibly later underneath grass courts. The signs are that the professionals at least will quickly adapt to a system without human frailty. They have long since grown used to the 'Cyclops' machine, which is used to call the service line - which the ball crosses at up to 130mph - at most major tournaments. This uses four laser beams crossing the court on and near the line; depending which order the ball breaks them, the system deduces whether the ball was in or not. Cyclops first came into use in 1980, and most players accepted it as an accurate arbiter - even McEnroe. But some people are never satisfied. Once, he complained during a match that it was giving wrong calls: 'I don't want to sound paranoid,' he said later, 'but that machine knows who I am.'</p>

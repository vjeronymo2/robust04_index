			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kvaerner profit up 36% despite weak oil unit Kvaerner, Norway's second largest stock market listed company, has increased pre-tax profits by 36 per cent to NKr590m (Dollars 84.2m) in the first four months of 1994 against the same period a year earlier. The performance was aided by an upturn in unrealised foreign exchange gains which almost doubled to NKr133m. Operating revenue rose by 11 per cent to NKr8.7bn while operating profit increased by 10 per cent to NKr399m. But the results fell short of analysts' expectations of NKr500m. Mr Erik Toenseth, president, predicted that profits for this year as a whole, before unrealised currency items, would be on a par with last year's NKr1.5bn. The shipbuilding division lifted pre-tax profits to NKr406m from NKr246m on turnover of NKr3.63bn, against NKr2.56bn. The oil and gas division saw pre-tax profits more than halved to NKr57m from NKr135 on revenues up to NKr2.47bn from NKr2.33bn. The oil and gas division made an operating loss of NKr3m after a profit of NKr116m last time, and is expected to post a weak overall result. Kvaerner warned that the division was suffering losses on the Norwegian North Sea Troll oil project. The mechanical engineering division turned in a pre-tax profit of NKr16m, against a loss of NKr33m, on sales which rose to Nkr1.62bn from NKr1.5bn. Pre-tax profits of the pulping division tumbled to NKr25m from NKr53. The shipping side lifted pre-tax profits to NKr95m from NKr21m on revenues which increased to NKr395m from NKr337m.</p>

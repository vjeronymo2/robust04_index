			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO PARADISE OR APPEAL  </P> <P> I disagree with the advice given in an article on Washington, D.C. ("A Visit to  Adams Morgan Neighborhood Area of Washington, D.C., Shows Good Taste," Dec. 2).  </P> <P> Adams Morgan is no paradise and has no appeal. It is a city district that is  dirty and crime-ridden. The restaurants are second-rate, the browsing is  minimal and tacky, the entertainment, with the exception of tap dancer Johne  Forge of Cafe Lautrec, is limited to the clubs mentioned by the author. Too bad  she didn't warn your readers about the open drug dealing, ethnic gangs, high  cover charges and pervasively lousy music.  </P> <P> G. A. Johnson  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

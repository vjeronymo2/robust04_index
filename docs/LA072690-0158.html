			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FLICKS FILM AND VIDEO NOTES;  </P> <P> THE LAST STAND;  </P> <P> TWO VIDEOS ON GEN. GEORGE CUSTER'S FINAL BATTLE ARE SCHEDULED TO BE SCREENED IN  PORT HUENEME.  </P> <P> Gen. George Custer will make his last stand, twice, Wednesday at the Ray D.  Prueter Library in Port Hueneme.  </P> <P> Lifelong Custer buff Arthur Epstein, whose memorabilia collection is on  display, is lending the library two video copies of films depicting the famous,  or infamous, final battle. One video, "Custer's Last Fight," is a 15-minute  black-and-white re-enactment of the battle. Produced in 1912 for $30,000 by  Hollywood filmmaker Thomas Ince, it was among the most costly films made up to  that time. The original had no soundtrack, which has been added in the modern  version. The role of Custer is played by Francis Ford, older brother of John  Ford. And, said Senior Librarian Mary Lynch, "promotional material claims that  some of the Indians in the movie were also in the battle itself."  </P> <P> A second video to be shown, "Red Sunday," was made by the Montana and North  Dakota historical societies. It's an overview of the battle, with a look at  battlefield sites.  </P> <P> Showings begin at 7 p.m. and will last about one hour. There is no charge.  </P> <P> More library goings-on: On Wednesday, the Camarillo Library will show three  films in the next to the last in its series of films for children. The films  are "A Boy and a Boa," "How to Raise a Puppy" and "Whistle for Willie." The  free series has drawn impressive crowds, between 35 and 50 children each week,  Supervising Librarian Sandy Kaplan said. "Some of the children have been  surprised," Kaplan said. "They've never seen 16 millimeter before. They've  grown up with video." The first film will be shown beginning at 2 p.m.  </P> <P> It must be a real zoo out there . . . what with all the animal titles in movies  these days.  </P> <P> Anyone notice that Ventura County theaters are showing "Teenage Mutant Ninja  Turtles," "Bird on a Wire," "Fire Birds," "The Bear," "Roller Coaster Rabbit"  and "Navy Seals" (showing in three theaters, including two in the Mann  Buenaventura Complex).  </P> <P> And that's not to mention the new release, "Arachnophobia."  </P> <P> Speaking of bugs, we thought we'd find out what a pet store operator thought  about the spider-infested film:  </P> <P> "I don't think I'll see it," said Terry Miller, manager of Dr. Roe's Pet  Headquarters in Santa Paula. "The best spider is a dead spider, I say as I sit  here looking at my tarantulas." LEO SMITH  </P></p>

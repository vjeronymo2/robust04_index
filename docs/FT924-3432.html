			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Letter: BT price structure aims to stimulate use of under-utilised network Sir, BT's latest price freeze is part of our regular, normal review of prices and not a response to actions by competitors (Letters, December 4). Unfortunately, BT's network is greatly under-used, with customers, on average, making only four minutes of calls a day. Whether the network is being used or not, BT still has the costs of providing and maintaining all the equipment in the exchanges and the lines to customers' homes; offering a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week, fault-reporting service with guaranteed repair times; operating telephone exchanges; running a free customer inquiry service, manned from 8am to 6pm, Monday to Saturday; and providing free phone books. All of these are included in the price of the line rental, equivalent to just over 25p a day. For historical reasons, the line rental charge has, for many years, been kept below the true cost of providing these services by being cross-subsidised from income from calls. This has meant that prices for calls have been higher than necessary. For the past few years, BT has been trying to change this imbalance by increasing the line rental and making calls cheaper. BT is also using its price structure to encourage greater use of its under-utilised network by offering discounts on volume use and innovative schemes such as the Sunday special offer. This offer, where calls made within the UK on Sundays between 3pm and midnight are charged at the local, cheap rate, runs until the end of December. For the whole of January next year BT will be running a Europe special offer. Simply on the basis of economies of scale, the more calls that are made, the cheaper the cost of providing them becomes, allowing BT to reduce its charges still further. It is true that customers who use the network less will benefit less from our recent price changes. But for the very low user, BT offers its Supportline giving half-price line rental and 30 free call units a quarter. Of course, those who use the network more will still pay more overall than people making little use of it. But high users can benefit from either the automatic or optional discounts that BT offers. It is sound and common commercial sense, practiced by many companies in all fields of business, to offer discounts to those customers who purchase a higher volume of the goods or services offered.

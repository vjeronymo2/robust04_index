			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague April 19 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic [CR] is  prepared to enter negotiations on better access of Czech goods  to the U.S. market and U.S. goods to the Czech market, Czech  Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said today.    Dlouhy was speaking to journalists after his meeting with  U.S. presidential envoy and deputy chairman of a political  guiding group for Central and Eastern Europe, Richard Schifter.    The United States is also to conduct negotiations with the  other members of the Visegrad Four -- Slovakia, Poland and  Hungary -- and Schifter will visit these countries within the  next few days, Dlouhy said.    Dlouhy pointed out that the countries of the European Union  account for between 55 and 60 percent of exports from the Czech  Republic, while the United States represents only about one or  two percent. Therefore it was a long-term priority of the Czech  Republic to gain admission to the European Union, he explained.    Dlouhy announced there will be a White House sponsored  conference of leading American and Central European companies in  the summer.</p>

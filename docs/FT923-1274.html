			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Permanent UN seat sought by Germany GERMANY will seek a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, if a change in the council's composition is considered by the member states, Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said here yesterday. However, he made it clear in a speech to the UN General Assembly that Germany would not take the initiative on this matter, but that it would wait until it came up in the context of future discussions on reform of the Security Council. Reform of the council, whose permanent membership - the US, Russia, China, the UK and France - reflects the immediate post-second world war situation and does not take account of more recent international developments, has become a subject of growing public interest with the rise of major new powers such as Germany and Japan. Britain and France are opposed to any change in the council's composition for the moment because it would make it more unwieldy and less effective. They have been particularly dismissive of the suggestion that they should give up their own seats in favour of a single EC seat.</p>

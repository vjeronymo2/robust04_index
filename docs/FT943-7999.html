			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Pinault wins Fnac control with go-ahead to buy Altus holding Mr Francois Pinault, the ambitious French businessman behind the Pinault-Printemps retail concern, yesterday won his battle to secure control of Fnac, the music and books chain, by getting the go-ahead to buy a majority stake from the Credit Lyonnais banking group. Artemis, the holding company that controls the Pinault family's interests, last month agreed a deal with the Altus Finances subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais to buy its 66.4 per cent holding in Fnac, one of the most famous names in French retailing, for around FFr2bn (Dollars 374m). However, the deal was subject to the approval of Generale des Eaux, the utility and media company which owns another 33.4 per cent of Fnac and has pre-emptive rights over the Altus stake. Generale des Eaux last week fuelled speculation that it might exercise its pre-emptive rights by announcing that it was delaying taking a final decision for an extra week after the original deadline. The new deadline expired on Wednesday. Generale des Eaux yesterday confirmed that it had decided not to buy the Altus holding. However, it will play a significant role in the management of Fnac as it is empowered to appoint the chairman of a strategic committee, which will scrutinise all the main strategic issues facing the company. Fnac, which has for decades dominated the market for music and books, or cultural retailing, as the French call it, is a high profile addition to Mr Pinault's existing retail interests that include the Au Printemps department store group, La Redoute mail order business and Conforama furniture chain. The deal comes at a time when French retailers are preparing to emerge from recession after a tough two years of virtually static consumer spending. However, Fnac's dominant position in the 'cultural' sector is under attack from the dynamic Virgin Megastores chain owned by Mr Richard Branson, the British entrepreneur.</p>

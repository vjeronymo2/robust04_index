			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: All-German Schubert - Recital It is surprising that the vast Schubert song edition that Graham Johnson is undertaking on record has not spawned more live performances. If time and money were available, it would be an added attraction to follow each of the singers presenting their programmes at the Wigmore Hall. So far the list of those taking part has embraced British and international singers, but that could be about to change. Apparently, the volumes featuring English-speaking singers have not been achieving good sales. Faced with consumer pressure, Johnson may be asked to increase the ratio of native German speakers. As the leading German recitalists (Fassbaender and Schreier) have already taken part, that means looking further afield. Hence the programme at the Wigmore Hall on Thursday. Under the title of 'International Songmakers' came an all-Schubert recital with two young German singers - the soprano Juliane Banse and the baritone Roman Trekel. It was wise to pair them, as they display complementary virtues. Banse has a bright personality, but the voice loses its focus when she sings quietly, sounding breathy and impure; Trekel commands a fine lyric baritone, but is phlegmatic. The first half was pure Graham Johnson territory, a collection of rarely-heard songs to the texts of Friedrich von Schlegel. The philosopher poet looked for God in nature and his work is immersed in the typical imagery of early 19th-century romanticism, invoking moon and stars, flowers and bushes, birds and butterflies. Banse brought some spirit to 'Die Berge', Trekel a quiet eloquence to 'Der Schiffer', but it was Johnson's piano accompaniments, played with the lid up and plenty of colour, that had most to say about the music. The second half featured Schubert favourites, more of them than the didactic Johnson ever usually allows in one evening. (Was he worried that the hall might not be full?) Here both singers struggled to leave an imprint on paths so often traversed by the great Schubertians, most nearly succeeding with Banse's tender 'Schlaflied' and a lively 'Der Musensohn' from Trekel. During the dullest 'Erlkonig' that I have heard there was time to admire Johnson's slaying of the killer triplets in the piano part. Ten years of Schubert show no sign of sapping his enthusiasm.</p>

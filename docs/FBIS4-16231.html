			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Nikitinskiy report: "Constitutional Court's Stock </F> Falls As Result of Political Trading"]    [Text] The uproar and dogfighting in the State Duma which  marked the close of the past political week obscured an event  which was actually of far greater significance: Parliament was  unable to muster a qualified majority for the adoption of the  Law on the Constitutional Court at its first reading. The  dogfighting both in individual branches of power and between  neighboring branches will continue without any rules and in the  absence of an arbiter.    The Duma was making effectively its first attempt at  legislative activity, its first encounter with the  weightlifters' barbell which it has promised to lift, without  which there is no sense in deputies even mounting the stage.  And the fact that the first attempt was a total flop, or  rather, did not get off the ground at all, unfortunately arouses  serious apprehension regarding the legislative possibilities of  the first post-Soviet parliament as a whole.    The draft law was prepared mainly by the judges of the  Constitutional Court themselves, and since the judges have had  not only positive experiences, but also negative ones (if not  more of the latter), they endeavored to safeguard themselves  against future political interference in the legal process. The  corresponding provisions of the draft law were aimed not at  depriving the Constitutional Court of all political competence,  but at curbing the political games and intrigues around it.  Alas, these games and intrigues have already resumed around the  draft law itself, even at a distant remove from parliament  itself.    The President's State-Legal Administration attempted to  contest the Constitutional Court's right to initiate legislation  on its own account. The president himself, according to Acting  Constitutional Court Chairman Nikolay Vitruk, was extremely  surprised at this, and instructed Aleksandr Yakovlev, his  representative in parliament, to support the draft law. As a  result some presidential structures officially defended the  draft, but others scuppered it in the lobbies. It is hard to  explain this by anything other than the battle for power and  influence inside presidential structures.    Following the Duma Council's session on Thursday it became  clear that it was highly unlikely that the hurdle of two-thirds  of the votes necessary for the adoption of federal  constitutional laws -- quantifiable as 300 votes -- would be  cleared. Finally the display board flashed up the figures: 247  votes for, 51 against, 87 abstentions. Those who voted against  were mainly members of the communist faction, and the backbone  of abstainers is formed by the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia.    The day before at the Duma Council Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  who  despises all diplomatic contortions, stated perfectly frankly  that he was ready to exchange the votes of his faction for an  agreement on an imperative mandate. The imperative mandate was  also in its own way one of last week's issues in the State Duma  -- and, perhaps, will also be an issue this week too. According  to the laws of the "standard [operativnyy] mandate," a deputy  elected to parliament on a party roll cannot vote contrary to  the opinion of the majority of his faction, on pain of being  expelled not only from his faction, but also from deputies'  ranks altogether. Obviously, for Vladimir Zhirinovskiy the  desire to bind the breakaway members of his faction by  imperative mandate (which does not meet with the support of the  majority in parliament) is so overriding that it is impossible  to understand in what relation he stands to the draft law on the  Constitutional Court.    Overt political horse-trading is being conducted around this  draft law. The communist faction and Zhirinovskiy's supporters  are demanding some kind of State Duma quota in the appointment  of judges, and also their own quota within this "Duma" quota.  The Communists are also demanding that the Constitutional Court  be restored its right to accept cases for examination on its own  initiative, which was withdrawn from the draft, and without  which it is not so effective in the capacity of a weapon in  political brawling and blackmail.    Of course, it was easy to object from the Duma rostrum  during  the discussion of the draft law that all these amendments are  anticonstitutional and require at the very least amendments to  the Constitution that was approved in the referendum. On the  other hand the Constititution does not forbid any deputy to push  the voting button as he sees fit. As long as strictly legal  questions are the issue, however complicated they may be, it is  always possible to reach compromise -- this, in point of fact,  is the task of the law. It is far more difficult to reach real  accord in politics.    From the point of view of understanding of political  factors,  the draft law on the Constitutional Court was prepared and  road-tested especially thoroughly. All factions pay at least  lip service to the need for the Constitutional Court to resume  its activity as soon as possibile. Questions are accumulating  which no one has a right to answer except a Constitutional  Court. Nevertheless, the draft law was defeated. Just as it  will be in the event of its radical revision as demanded by  "leftists," only this time by the factions of the opposite wing.    The inability to muster two-thirds of the votes on the most  fundamental questions threatens the familiar paralysis in  legislative development in the foreseeable future. Russia  remains without a Constitutional Court, without a general  prosecutor, without a "qualified majority" in its legislative  organs, and, as a consequence, without Law. And once again it  is political ambitions that are thwarting the normal legislative  process.</p>

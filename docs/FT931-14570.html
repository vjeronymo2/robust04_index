			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Consumer optimism 'very low' CONSUMER OPTIMISM about the economy was at a lower level in the last quarter of last year than at any time since the start two years earlier of a quarterly survey published jointly by Business Strategies, an economics consultancy, and Gallup, a market research group. There were particular concerns late last year about rising unemployment and inflation according to the survey, which is published today. Northern regions showed a big slip in consumer confidence. The survey coincided with Britain's withdrawal last September from the European exchange rate mechanism, which was a big setback for the government's economic policy. Even though the report suggests that confidence in December showed a rise from the extremely low levels for October and November, the survey will be bad news for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. He has been hoping that his package of growth measures in the November 1992 Autumn Statement, with recent cuts in interest rates, will have lifted sentiment among consumers and businesses as a prelude to economic recovery. Consumer spending in the last quarter of last year fell 0.3 per cent compared with the previous quarter after a 0.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter fall in the July to September period, estimates from the survey suggest. Mrs Bridget Rosewell, joint managing director of Business Strategies, said the survey, based on interviews with 6,000 people, indicated that consumers were 'shell shocked' by economic events. She said, however, that confidence could gradually recover as the effects of the 3 percentage point fall in base rates to 10 per cent since September start to bring down the cost of mortgages. The survey said Scotland, the Yorkshire and Humberside region and north-west England saw the biggest falls in confidence in the fourth quarter compared with the third. Previously people in these regions had been relatively cheerful about the economic outlook.</p>

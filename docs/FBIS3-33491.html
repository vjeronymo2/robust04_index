			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Minister of Government German Quiroga expressed his  doubts about depositions made by two notorious drug traffickers  involving former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora in alleged  meetings with "Thatched Roof" [drug lord Jorge Roca Suarez].  Quiroga said: "These depositions have been made by convicts  linked to drug trafficking."    Quiroga said: "It is important not to hurt the dignity of  citizens, especially those citizens who have occupied our  nation's highest posts." He noted: "We must not forget the  status of the people who made these depositions."    Quiroga recalled that the depositions were made by criminals  who had been convicted by the courts of justice for being linked  to drug-trafficking rings.    Quiroga nevertheless reported that the depositions, videos,  and photographs linked to drug-trafficking crimes are part of  the case portfolio sent to the courts of justice yesterday.    Minister Quiroga described the evidence as open to the  public. He said: "It is therefore open to review by national  public opinion."    Quiroga noted: "It is not fair to comment on issues that may  have been brought up without carrying out an assessment, a  review, and a complete investigation into these depositions."    In response to questions posed by journalists accredited to  Government Palace, Quiroga pointed out: "There are serious  contradictions between the depositions of the two drug  traffickers." He noted: "The courts will make the actual  assessment and conduct the appropriate investigations."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Zvornik, June 6 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems on  Monday continued their armed operations against the Bosnian Serb  Republic, in what the Serb Army sees as an obvious attempt to  jeopardize the convention and outcome of Geneva peace talks.    There are no armed Serbs within the 3-km exclusion zone  around Gorazde, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, which the  U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has also confirmed, Bosnian  Serb Army sources inform. The Moslems are continuing also to  violate the ceasefire in the Sarajevo area, attacking from small  arms the Serb localities of Ilijas, Vogosca, Ilidza, Nedjarici  and Kasindol Street.    On the Ozren front, the Moslems mounted a combined artillery  and infantry attack on the Serb defence positions on the  southern slopes of Mt Ozren and in the Srbobran and Komar areas  in the northeast, TANJUG learns.    The Bosnian Croat Army and the army of neighbouring Croatia  are engaged in provocations along most of the lines of  separation with Bosnia's Serbs on the Orasje front in the north.    Moslem operations against the Serbs are still going strong  in  the areas of Doboj, Teslic, Treabava and Vlasic in central  Bosnia, and the Bihac and Krupa areas in the west. Moslems are  provoking the Serbs also in the Sava River valley, especially  around Brcko, which is situated in the neck of a vital corridor  which links the east and west of the Bosnian Serb Republic, Serb  Army sources say.</p>

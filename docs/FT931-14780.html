			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Danish SDP invited to form new coalition THE political crisis caused by Danish Prime Minister Poul Schluter's resignation seems likely to lead to the formation of a minority Social Democratic Party government. Yesterday Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the SDP leader, was asked by Queen Margrethe to lead negotiations among the Folketing's eight parties on forming a new government. Mr Rasmussen was recommended by the SDP, the left-wing Socialist People's Party and the centrist Radical Liberal Party, which have a narrow majority in the Folketing. The financial markets reacted positively to the prospect of a change of regime after 10 years of non-socialist governments led by Mr Schluter. The krone strengthened and bond prices firmed. Miss Anne Jensen, chief economist at Unibank, said the reaction reflected market expectations that an SDP government would be better able to mobilise a majority for a Yes vote on the Maastricht treaty in the second referendum which Denmark will hold later this year, probably in May. Mr Schluter, who was severely criticised for misleading the Folketing over the Tamil visa scandal by a judicial inquiry on Thursday, formally handed his resignation to Queen Margrethe yesterday. He remains in office until a new government is formed. Mr Rasmussen will be asked by the Queen to form a government when he can show he has sufficient support in parliament. If the inter-party negotiations reach an impasse, an election would have to be held. The 49-year-old SDP leader, who was once chief economist to the Confederation of Danish Trade Unions, faces tough negotiations, which may take several days. The Radical Liberals, whose seven members of the Folketing hold the balance of power between the socialist and non-socialist parties, have said they will support an SDP government provided it promises to carry out labour market and tax reforms. Since 1982 the Radicals have supported Mr Schluter, but for several months have flirted with the idea of a change of government. The Radicals want changes to the country's exceptionally generous unemployment benefits and other reforms to make the labour market more flexible in order to help bring down the 11 per cent unemployment rate. They also want lower marginal income taxes. Neither the labour market reforms, strongly opposed by trade unions, nor the tax reform proposals are liked by the SDP. Mr Ivar Noergaard, chairman of the Folketing's influential European market affairs committee, yesterday dismissed as exaggerated the concern expressed abroad that the Danish presidency of the European Council would be seriously affected by the political crisis. Denmark's European policies are thrashed out in detail in the all-party market affairs committee. For this reason 'it does not signify very much which party is actually the government party,' he said, although new ministers would naturally need time to master the details of their brief. A change of government, he added, would not mean any changes in the senior civil service personnel who handle European questions.</p>

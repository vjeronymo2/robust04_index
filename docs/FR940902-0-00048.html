			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter correctly pointed out that the first sentence of &sect;627.422(b) was missing a reference to recipients and subrecipients. The final rule is amended accordingly. A small number of commenters wondered why the regulations call for the Governor to establish guidelines on the selection of service providers, when the Act calls for the Secretary to establish guidelines. The Secretary has established minimum guidelines through these regulations. The Governor is given the authority to expand on these guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 627.422(c) establishes the requirement that when a State, SDA, SSG, or administrative entity determines that it will provide services, it must first make a determination, in writing, under the standards of &sect;627.422(d), of the demonstrated performance of its staff. A number of commenters expressed concern that this section went beyond the intent of the Congress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters argued that the ``self-determination'' requirement is inappropriate because it infringes on the rights of PIC's or SDA's to make their own decisions on the mix of services according to local considerations. The self-determination requirement implements the requirements of sections 107 (a) and (e) and 164(a)(3)(A) of the Act for competitive selection of service providers. These requirements do reduce local discretion to the extent that they prevent any SDA/SSG from selecting its service providers without adherence to the rules of a competitive selection process. An SDA/SSG may not select an ``independent'' service provider without adhering to the competitive procurement rules which is as much an intrusion on its discretion as is the requirement that it justify its selection of an in-house service provider.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the Act's new emphasis on competition in the procurement process is to ensure that the JTPA program provides the best available services at the most advantageous price. This rationale is equally applicable no matter what the identity of the service provider. Obtaining services through a competitive selection process enables decisionmakers to periodically review the quality of, necessity for, and cost of the services that are being used. It would defeat the purpose of the competitive selection process if one kind of service or one kind of service provider were exempted from this periodic review. Thus, it is critical to the integrity of the competitive selection process that the selection of all service providers, including in-house providers, be subject to periodic review and to regular redetermination of the quality and cost effectiveness of the services provided as well as their responsiveness to the needs of the participants. For this reason, the Department has decided to retain the self-determination requirement in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters thought that this requirement was not needed since the sanctions that occur for failure to meet performance standards provide all the protection needed against arbitrary decisions to perform services in-house. It is true that these available sanctions will help lead to a better program, but the earliest that they will lead to the increased full and open competition required by the Amendments is after two or three years when performance standards are not met and the sanctions are imposed. Since it is the Department's intent to increase competition immediately, it is appropriate to impose the self-determination requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments revealed some confusion over the types of services that would be covered by the requirement of paragraph (c). Several commenters indicated that intake and assessment should not be included as services that should be competitively procured. Covered services, in the final regulations, are defined to exclude intake and eligibility determination, which are services that are the basic responsibility of SDA's/SSG's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another concern expressed was that a vote by a PIC to provide an activity in-house will require the PIC to vote on a matter that will directly benefit the JTPA agency. Since the enactment of JTPA and the formation of PIC's, PIC's have had to make decisions and vote on the provision of services internally. This may well be an apparent conflict of interest, but the conflict is inherent in the role of the PIC, and it is a conflict whether or not the SDA is required to justify the decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, if the requirement for self-determination had not been established in the regulations, States, SDA's, SSG's, and administrative entities for SDA's and SSG's would be required to compete all of the services. It is not the Department's intent to require recipients and subrecipients to go through a full fledged competitive process or to impose onerous procedural requirements, but merely to assure that they periodically consider whether the methods by which the services are provided meet the Act's standards for cost and quality. For States, SDA's and SSG's that have already been running programs in-house, the determination to keep services in-house will be relatively easy. The determination will be more involved for SDA's and SSG's that propose to conduct services and activities which have traditionally been contracted out and should have a rationale for so doing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters provided reasons why they provided services in-house. These reasons included avoiding brokerage fees for OJT development and providing backup capacity if contractors fail. Both these reasons for performing these services in-house are legitimate ones, which should suffice as part of the justification required by this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Dirk </F> Hoeren; place and date not given: "We Are in Troubled Waters"]    [Text] [Hoeren] The European Union (EU) did not manage to  agree on a new president for the EU commission at the Corfu  summit. Is the EU torn by strife?    [Kinkel] The summit was no battle. There were different  opinions on the next president of the EU Commission. Eleven  states backed Belgian Prime Minister Dehaene, while Britain was  against him. Now we have to settle this conflict. There is a  bit of troubled water. This must be calmed.    [Hoeren] The British complain that the atmosphere has been  poisoned, and the Dutch accuse Chancellor Kohl of having fought  for Dehaene like a bulldozer.    [Kinkel] These accusations are completely unjustified. I  categorically reject them. Some of the tones that were heard  there are inappropriate and do not serve the cause. Some people  forget that the issue was not a decision for or against a  particular person but the best solution for the most important  European office. I hope very much that the noise on the fringes  will soon abate.    [Hoeren] The British have announced that they will never  vote for Dehaene....    [Kinkel] It is true that the decision on Jacques Delors'  successor must be made unanimously. This makes it difficult if  one country refuses. It will be the first task of the German  Government in its presidency of the EU council as of 1 July to  bring the cow off the ice. Chancellor Kohl and I will talk to  all countries so as to find a solution by the special summit on  15 July.    [Hoeren] What do you think of the compromise suggestion to  extend Delors' term of office?    [Kinkel] Given a ratio of 11:1, it must be possible to find  a successor. There is no reason to put up a compromise  candidate. We cannot afford an undignified struggle about  filling the most important office in Europe.    [Hoeren] What are the things that speak for Belgium's  Dehaene?    [Kinkel] He has shown that he is a dedicated European and a  doer. At this difficult time, the EU needs a doer.</p>

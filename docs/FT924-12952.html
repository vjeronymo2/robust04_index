			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Motoring: Best that devalued pounds can buy WILL the effective devaluation of the pound change Britain's national habit of buying more than 50 per cent of its new cars from abroad? The answer seems to be: not necessarily, but it might. Even if it did, would Britain's car buyers be denied a reasonable choice and perhaps have to put up with second best? The answer to that is: emphatically not. To deal with the first point: There has always been an element of 'charging what the traffic will bear' when pricing cars for various markets. Take Denmark, for example. List prices of cars there are lower than anywhere else in Europe. Taxes are so high that manufacturers have to slash margins to vanishing point if they are to sell any cars there at all. In Britain, more than 50 per cent of all cars are bought with company money for business use. Fleets are purchased at fat discounts. This has done nothing to lower the makers' official showroom prices, though how many cars have been sold retail at list price in the last couple of years? It is clear that if EC and Far Eastern makers want to keep their market share in Britain - which you can bet your life they do - they will have to temper the financial wind for the shorn lamb. Mercedes-Benz UK spoke for many others when it said this week: 'We must remain competitive if we are to preserve our highly efficient dealer network. 'There won't be any instant price increases as a result of the pound's depreciation against the D-mark though eventually some adjustment is inevitable.' What will probably happen is that the model mix of up-market marques such as Mercedes, BMW and Audi will change slightly. Models like Mercedes 190, BMW 3-Series and Audi 80 will gain sales at the expense of the larger, dearer cars. But the shift will not be dramatic, initially at any rate. 'We have noticed that our up-market customers are less price-sensitive than those for our cheaper cars,' said Mercedes-Benz UK. It expects some sales could be pulled forward as people decide to buy their Mercedes now rather than wait for the price to rise. The big French manufacturers - PSA (Peugeot-Citroen) and Renault - which between them account for one in eight of all cars sold in Britain, may have to cut margins if their market share is to keep expanding. Italy's currency is as stricken as the pound. So Fiat (which includes Lancia and Alfa Romeo) sees a great opportunity to lift its sagging sales and regain market penetration in Britain. Its product range is the best for years and it has been busy burnishing its image and improving its marketing. But what if the pound should continue to slide and German and French cars become costlier than they are today? The good news is that many long-term buyers of imported cars might be agreeably surprised by the range of British-made cars on offer. Few motorists seem to be aware that in the near future, about 25 per cent of the cars produced in Britain will be Hondas, Nissans and Toyotas. The Honda Concerto sold in Britain is already made by Rover, whose 200 and 400 models are closely based upon it though nearly all have Rover's own excellent K-series engines or a Peugeot-Citroen diesel. Production of the new Honda Accord saloon has just started at Swindon. By 1993 this 2-litre model will be selling against the Ford Sierra (no longer made in Britain) and the British-built Vauxhall Cavalier as well as the BMW 3-Series and Audi 80. Other comparable British-made cars include the Nissan Primera and Peugeot 405. This French car has been assembled with many British components in Coventry for some years. Micra will be an alternative to the British-made Rover Metro (transformed by a heart and brain transplant nearly two years ago) and Ford Fiesta. Other family-type cars which can be expected to benefit from the fall in the pound and lira are the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra (most are made in Britain) ; and Fiat's new Cinquecento baby car, Panda, Uno, Tipo and Tempra.</p>

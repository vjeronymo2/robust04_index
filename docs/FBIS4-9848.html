			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 2 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Constitutionality  Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez was killed this morning by  a group of unidentified gunmen who shot him as he entered his  home, a local radio station reported today.    Sources close to the Gonzalez family said the magistrate was  attacked this morning in the downtown Zona Dos neighborhood of  the capital a few blocks from the National Palace as he entered  his home. He died early this morning. Gonzalez sustained a  fatal gunshot wound to the left side of his chest, according to  Radio Sonora.    Last week the Constitutionality Court had declared the  electoral law reforms being debated by the congressional  deputies unconstitutional because "the reforms totally change  the law." The reforms were agreed upon by the deputies and  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio as part of a package of reforms  to the Constitution which was approved in the January referendum.</p>

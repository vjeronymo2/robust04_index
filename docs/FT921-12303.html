			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Arts: The London Vertigo - Andrew's Lane Theatre, Dublin What, I wondered anxiously, is Ireland's leading dramatist up to, adapting an obscure 18th century farce? Do we really need wigs and coxcombs and cuckolds at a time like this? It took only a few minutes - up to the moment when John Hurt enters in a preposterous wig as the outrageously-affected coxcomb - to dispel all doubts. Brian Friel has cut a bad three-act play down to a very good one-act play lasting 50 minutes. But why? At first the answer seems to be quite simply that he is having fun. And why not? The actors enjoyed themselves, too, and so did the audience, many reduced to tears of laughter. The London Vertigo is based on a play by the Irish actor and playwright, Cathal MacLochlainn, alias Charles Macklin, which was warmly received by Dublin audiences but closed after one disastrous night in London. Born in the 1690s in a remote part of Donegal as an Irish-speaking Catholic peasant, MacLochlainn learnt to speak English with an English accent, changed religion and invented a wealthy, landed background. They loved him in London, where he was a friend of Garrick and Fielding and his Shylock was praised by Pope. The play concerns a less successful effort at changing identity. Murrough O'Doherty's wife is inflicted with London vertigo on returning from a visit to that city, has re-named herself Mrs Diggerty, affects an English accent, covets an English title and is about to cuckold O'Doherty with an English coxcomb, Count Mushroom. The plot concerns O'Doherty's efforts to cure his wife and humiliate the coxcomb, a highly-successful endeavour in which he is helped by his brother-in-law and a maidservant. The production, by the Gate Theatre, is playing twice nightly in the 220-seater Andrew's Lane while the Gate is being refurbished. The classical set, by Monica Frawley, makes good use of the tiny stage and the director, Judy Friel, expands it further by judicious use of 'voices off'. We hear John Hurt before he enters in an amazing beehive wig which meets its match only in Mrs Diggerty's monstrous confection. Gemma Craven's fluting voice is wonderfully suited to the contortions of Mrs B's more-English-than-the-English accent and slides effortlessly into the vernacular on demand. Hurt and Craven are an inspired comic duo. The sight of Count Mushroom, disguised as a laundry-woman attempting to seduce Mrs B, is funnier, I am sure, than anything in the panto across the road. They are ably supported by John Kavanagh as the scheming husband, Eamon Morrissey as his bovine brother-in-law, and Antoine Byrne as the comely serving-wench. But, in the end, the star of the evening is Friel's adaptation. His convoluted use of asides adds another dimension to the proceedings and recalls an earlier success, Philadelphia, Here I Come. And, inevitably, once the laughing has stopped, one realises that Friel is not simply having fun but is making another contribution to the age-old, unresolved debate about the difference between English and Irish identity. Here it is the Irish who triumph and perhaps that is why the original was such a flop in London. This version will, I am sure, travel better.</p>

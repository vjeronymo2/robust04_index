			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISTIANI'S PLEA FOR CONTINUED MILITARY AID  </P> <P> It was a shock to see the commentary by President Cristiani. The numbers killed  by the military totally ignored, no recognition of the concrete changes vitally  needed, no mention of the tremendous support of the population for an end to  military impunity and petitions for meaningful negotiations, no statement of  wages frozen since 1980, no comment about the bombing of crops and civilian  communities in rural areas when combat with guerrillas are miles away, no plans  for education, no program for medical care regardless of political perspective,  no realization of land issues, no plan for freedom to move within the country  or of association.  </P> <P> LYNNE HALPIN, Chair, Central America/Caribbean Committee, United Methodist  Board of Church &amp; Society, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: New worries about sterling STERLING tumbled by more than two pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday after an extremely gloomy set of indicators raised concern that the UK economy may be continuing to stagnate, writes James Blitz. Since the middle of December, currency dealers had believed that the pound was well underpinned against the German currency and that a return to the DM2.40 exchange rate seen in October was unlikely. Anecdotal evidence of a pick-up in shopping over the Christmas period was among the factors underlining that view. Yesterday's unemployment figure, which showed a rise of 60,800 in the number of people out of work in December, and the 0.5 per cent fall in manufacturing output in November have changed some minds. Several dealers said yesterday that, in the first quarter of this year, sterling could revisit the 1992 low of DM2.3690, against the prospect of more cuts in UK interest rates. 'The currency may enjoy some consolidation in the next couple of weeks because it has had such a huge fall since the start of the year,' commented Mr Mark Brett, a currency analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. 'But there must be a risk that, in the run-up to the Budget, it will break due south again.' Mr Ian Harnett, chief economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull in London, said: 'We are entering a period of great fragility for the pound. There is now a feeling in the market that UK rates will come down faster than Germany's, even if the Bundesbank eases policy next month.' The impact of yesterday's indicators was seen in sterling's fall to substantially below DM2.50, which some technical analysts see as a significant support level. The currency finished at DM2.4525, exactly 2 1/4 pfennigs weaker on the day and 5 pfennigs down on the week to date. Against the dollar, the pound closed at Dollars 1.5180, some 2 1/4 cents lower. It picked up to end at Dollars 1.5225 in New York. Sterling has seen sharp falls against the D-Mark several times in the last few months, only to back up above DM2.50 very promptly. But, according to Mr Brett, the worrying factor about yesterday's UK indicators was that they showed that 3 percentage points off interest rates and a significant devaluation had still failed to boost the economy. He also believes that investors will seek very low levels for the sterling/D-Mark rate if they are to invest in the estimated Pounds 50bn of gilts which will meet the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for 1993/94. By contrast, the dollar enjoyed some strength against the D-Mark after a business survey from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed an acceleration in manufacturing growth in January. The US currency ended nearly a pfennig higher at DM1.6150. Against the yen it firmed to Y125. In New York the dollar closed at DM1.6140.</p>

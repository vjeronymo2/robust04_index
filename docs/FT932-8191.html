			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Land prices fall in Japan's biggest cities LAND PRICES in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan's two largest cities, continued to fall in the first quarter this year, putting added pressure on financial institutions exposed to the property market. The National Land Agency said the greater Tokyo residential price index fell an annualised 5 per cent during the period, compared to 8.2 per cent in the previous quarter, while commercial prices fell 5.9 per cent, against 9.2 per cent. Officials at the agency said the slowing of the fall suggested that the market was close to touching bottom, but most Japanese banks and other property-related lenders had hoped the downward trend would be reversed in the first quarter. The falls are undermining the value of property collateral held by financial institutions, which fuelled speculative investment in the market during the late 1980s, when it was predicted that Japanese land prices would never fall. Commercial prices in Osaka fell 5.2 per cent during the quarter, while the residential index fell 4.2 per cent in that city. It was a particularly popular location for building 'investment apartments', many of which remain empty. The 'bubble era's' most famous stock speculator, Mr Mitsuhiro Kotani, was yesterday given an 18-month suspended jail sentence for what the Tokyo District Court described as the 'naked manipulation' of stock prices. Mr Kotani, 56, had pleaded guilty to manipulating the stock price of Fujita Kanko, a tourism company, but the court also condemned banks and brokers which assisted his speculator group during its reign over Japanese markets in the late 1980s. The group, Koshin, bought shares in companies ranging from Janome, a leading maker of sewing machines, to Kokusai Kogyo, an aerial survey company, which it first attempted to greenmail and then took over when the management was unwilling to buy back the Koshin stake. Mr Kotani admits that his group earned about Y31bn (Pounds 181m) through manipulating Fujita Kanko's price, which rose 40 per cent during one week in April 1990. The money was needed to complete the purchase of Kokusai Kogyo. While Mr Kotani admitted the charge, he suggested that he did not intend to deceive other investors into buying the stock, while his lawyers argued that Fujita itself and Tobishima, a formerly conservative construction company, had played an important role in the manipulation. In the late 1980s Mr Kotani, became one of the brightest stars of the 'bubble era'. His downfall, which came with the collapse of stock prices, has left a range of politicians and bankers open to criticism.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 08, BNS -- Lithuanian Prime Minister  goes to Kuwait April 9 for a two-day visit.    At a press conference in Vilnius Thursday [7 April],  Slezevicius said he intends to sign a bilateral agreement on  investment protection and to hold talks on credits for Lithuania.    Slezevicius said a Kuwaiti foundation supporting economic  development in some countries has already offered a preferential  50-million-dollar loan to Lithuania. The premier said the money  would be used for various energy projects, including  construction of new gas pipelines and renewal of gas networks in  several Lithuanian towns. Slezevicius said part of the loan may  be used to finance the Lithuanian oil terminal project.    The Lithuanian premier said Kuwait is one of the biggest  financial donors of the World Bank. Hence, he said, if the  first credit is used properly, further financial support can be  expected.</p>

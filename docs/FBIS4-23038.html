			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article under the rubric ``Portrait of a Problem'': </F> ``The Experts Seek a Formula''--first paragraph is POISK  introduction]    [Text] An international seminar devoted to the problem of  the ``brain drain'' from Russia was held in Moscow on 21-23  February. The Russian Federation Ministry of Science and  Technical Policy, the Committee for the Problem ``The Brain  Drain'' under the Russian Federation Commission for UNESCO  Affairs, and the Regional Office of Science and Technologies for  Europe (UNESCO-ROSTE) organized it. The Russian and foreign  experts discussed the draft of a report, which was prepared for  this meeting. It will be submitted in the form, which has been  worked out following evaluation by the experts, to the  Government of the Russian Federation for decision making. Let us  acquaint the readers of POISK with excepts from this document.  <H5>  Introduction: Science of Russia During the Transition Period </H5>   During the late 1980's and early 1990's a significant abrupt  increase of emigration from the country was observed. This wave,  which was due, on the one hand, to the intensifying  socio-economic crisis of society and, on the other, to the  liberalization of the policy of the regulation of departure,  encompassed practically all social groups of the population of  Russia, including intellectuals. It should be acknowledged that  precisely the latter suffered to the greatest degree from the  social consequences of the crisis, while the dire straits of  science and the higher school of Russia under the conditions of  the sharp decrease of budget allocations in 1992-1993 will  undoubtedly provoke the intensification of the ``brain drain''  in the immediate future.    If the absolute figures of the departure of personnel from  science remain at the 1991-1992 level, by 1990-2000 it will  cease its existence in Russia. If the relative magnitude of  departure remains, by 2000 in science the number of employees  will come to about 700,000, that is, 25 percent of the 1992  level. Russian experts regard this version in case of the  maintenance of the present course of reform in the country as  most realistic.    The decrease of employment will be most significant in  1993-1995, then its pace will slow, and a certain personnel  stabilization will occur. Thus, it is anticipated that the share  of science by 2000 will decrease in the structure of employed  people from 3.4 percent to 1 percent.  <H5>  The Scale of the Migration of Scientific Personnel </H5>   The geography of external migration is rather broad, it  encompasses practically all continents. However, an overwhelming  portion of the emigrants are heading for four basic countries.  Of the total number of people who left Russia before 1993, 45  percent of the emigrants went to Israel, 37 percent went to  Germany, 12 percent went to the United States, and 2 percent  went to Greece.    The flow of emigrants to the United States is characterized  by the greatest ``science-intensiveness.'' According to the 1992  data, among those who left 33 percent are people with a higher  education and 44 percent are white collar workers. In three  years (1990-1993) 4,500 scientists emigrated to the United  States.    Along with this the emigration of Russian scientists to  Third  World countries, which in contrast to, for example, the United  States and Germany are making a demand for scientific personnel  of intermediate skill, increased appreciably. A big demand for  Russian scientists, first of all for professors and instructors,  exists in China. The arrival of about 1,000 Russian scientists  in South Korea is anticipated. Iran and Iraq, which are  interested first of all in importing specialists in the field of  nuclear technologies and are prepared to pay them significantly  more than the average annual salaries of nuclear physicists in  the United States, are not concealing their interest in  scientists from the CIS.    The process of the adaptation of Russian scientists to work  in the West is not uniform. The scientific elite primarily gets  jobs at universities and other scientific organizations,  combining teaching activity with scientific pursuits. The  results of a survey among mathematicians and theoretical  physicists (96 doctors and 54 candidates of sciences, who work  at scientific centers of the United States, Canada, Western  Europe, and Australia) show that more than 70 percent of the  surveyed scientists adapted easily to the new situation. The  overwhelming majority of them (90 percent) believe that work  abroad as a whole justified their expectations.    At the same time a large portion of the scientific  personnel,  who left Russia through the channels of ethnic emigration, were  forced to leave the sphere of research and development, and this  switch is of an irreversible nature. The share of ``unlucky  people,'' according to the data of the survey, came to 3-5  percent, but for emigre Russian scientists as a whole it is  significantly higher.    In the opinion of 50 surveyed executives of leading foreign  scientific centers, the problems of the adaptation of emigre  Russian scientists are due to a poor knowledge of foreign  languages (75 percent of the respondents), difficulties in  dealings with colleagues (21 percent) and with students (67  percent), and the ignorance of foreign scientific literature (17  percent).    According to the data of a sample survey of the movement of  personnel at 10 scientific research institutes of the capital  (the total number of scientists is 3,746), which was conducted  in 1992, in 10 months 1 percent of the scientific personnel (6.7  percent of all people who got their discharge) got their  discharge from the surveyed institutes and went abroad, 60  percent of those who left are scientists up to the age of 40, 41  percent of those who left had degrees, including 12 percent who  had doctoral degrees. It is possible to regard an estimate of 1  percent as the maximum value of the indicator of scientific  emigration from Russia during 1992. Here the share of foreign  emigration in 1992 does not exceed 2 percent of the total  departure of personnel from the sphere of research and  development for other spheres of activity within Russia and  migration about the territory of the former USSR. The share of  those leaving, who worked in the sector ``science and scientific  education,'' as a whole for Russia during 1987-1992 came to 6  percent.    During a sociological survey that was conducted among 18  scientific institutes, 42 percent of the respondents indicated  that they were pondering in earnest leaving for work abroad,  although the opportunities for this for the present do not  exist, 8 percent of the respondents intend to leave in the  immediate future, and 5 percent of the respondents are  considering the question of their going abroad because an  opportunity for work abroad has personally appeared for them.  Only 23 percent of the respondents are not considering the  possibility of their going abroad.    Analyzing the prospects of the solution of this problem, 31  percent of those who responded to the question about the ``brain  drain'' indicated that the factors, which are responsible for  the departure of scientists from the country, are of a  deep-seated nature and cannot be eliminated in the immediate  future. The respondents assigned ``the present state of  society'' to the overall cause of the difficulties that are  being experienced by academic science.    As the second set of factors, which are responsible for the  departure of scientists abroad, the respondents indicate the  formed low level of prestige of science in society, the  atmosphere of vulnerability and lack of protection, in which  science has found itself, and the uncertainty for scientists of  their future. Having a depressing effect on scientists is the  lack of demand for their creativity abilities. Forty-six percent  of the scientists believe that they are realizing their  scientific potential fully, 31 percent believe that they are  using only half of it, 13 percent believe that they are using it  to a small degree.    The theme of the remuneration of the labor of scientific  associates as one of the decisive factors, which is responsible  for the ``brain drain,'' is touched upon during the sociological  surveys by nearly all the respondents. The absolute majority of  scientists believe that it is necessary to raise the level of  remuneration of scientific labor to international standards,  having increased it by 10- to 30-fold. The changeover to a  contract system in the conducting of research is suggested as  the most important step in this direction.    In second place in importance is the underestimation by  society of the social importance of intellectual labor (53  percent noted this as a reason for departure). Fifty percent  rate nearly as highly the inadequate opportunities to realize  oneself as a scientist in Russia. Forty percent of the  scientists, professors, and instructors of Moscow higher  educational institutions noted the instability of the political  situation and the threat of social disorders as a reason for  leaving. Thirty-five percent of the respondents name as a reason  for leaving anxiety over the fate of their children. Just as  many respondents named as a reason for the emigration of  scientists the overall deterioration of the economic situation  and the threat of unemployment. Another 19 percent of the  respondents noted as a reason for emigration the low level of  protection of scientists and of the legal registration of the  results of scientific activity.    The evaluations of the respondents, which were given during  this survey, of the social and psychological factors that affect  the decision of a scientist to go abroad, are also interesting.  Eighty-four percent of the respondents named as such a factor  the dissatisfaction with living conditions; 28 percent--the  desire to conduct research in a stronger scientific collective;  26 percent--a young age; 22 percent--talent, a high intellectual  potential; 13 percent--the existence of scientific contacts with  foreign partners and scientific centers.    Among the fields of science, which have been particularly  affected by emigration, one should name first of all mathematics  and computer technology. In recent years the demand for  programmers from Russia, first of all young people, has  increased on the international labor market. The number of  mathematicians leaving for the West today constitutes a  significant share (25 percent) of the annual graduation of these  specialists by elite faculties. The losses among physicists are  also substantial.    Of course, the states, which are accepting our scientists,  are interested in obtaining not ``ballast,'' but the most  talented, promising scientists who have created a name for  themselves in science by great achievements.    As a result the most actively working, talented young people  and middle-aged scientists, who have already achieved  significant scientific results and are known through  publications abroad, are leaving the country. A large portion of  the scientists from the RAS, who have left for permanent  residence abroad, have the degree of candidate (55.9 percent)  and doctor (16.2 percent) of sciences. Nearly half (48.5  percent) of those who have left the country have not reached the  age of 40.    As was noted, during 1990-1992 a significant decrease of the  number of scientific personnel occurred. In 1993 this process  continued, and in five months the number of scientific  specialists of scientific and technical organizations (NTOs)  decreased, according to the estimates of experts, by 7 percent,  which makes it possible to predict an overall decrease during  1993 in the amount of 13-15 percent. This departure is  objectively due to the redundancy of the market of scientific  and technical labor, which finds its expression in the low level  of the wage in science, periodic organized reductions of  personnel, the narrowing of the possibilities for the conducting  of work that interests the scientist and the specialist, and the  stressful psychological atmosphere in scientific collectives.    Until recently inadequate attention was devoted to the  analysis of this ``internal migration,'' although in scale it is  more significant than emigration beyond the country. According  to the data of sample surveys of 1992 and 1993, there are 10-15  scientists, who left NTOs in search of better work, for each  scientist who has emigrated.    What socio-economic consequences can such a pace and scale  of  migration have for Russia?    Under the influence of external and internal  (intersectorial)  migration the scientific and technical potential is weakening  substantially, particularly with allowance made for the  long-term consequences for the training of new generations of  scientists and specialists. On a broader plane the country may  lose the stratum of people, which is necessary for the  maintenance in society of a balanced social strategy in the  context of the chosen scientific and technical policy.    The country is undoubtedly incurring considerable material  losses, which it spent on the training of specialists and  scientific personnel. The calculations, which were made by the  United Nations method (the subtraction from the gross national  product of the direct and indirect outlays on the training of  the personnel who leave and the lost gain from the activity of  emigrants in this country) as of the beginning of 1991, show  that in case of the departure of one specialist the country  loses about $300,000. If the forecast of the annual migration of  the Ministry of the Economy of Russia--200,000-250,000 people  annually--is confirmed, the country will annually lose $60-75  billion.  <H5>  The Problems of State Regulation of Intellectual Migration </H5>   Under present conditions the state cannot pose the task of  not only the complete halt of the departure of scientists  abroad, but also its significant reduction in the next few  years. Attempts to complicate departure from the country by the  creation of administrative barriers would be at variance with  the legislation of Russia and with international obligations in  the area of human rights.    The formulated draft of the Federal Program of the  Regulation  of Intellectual Migration is called upon to unite the efforts of  state bodies and alternative structures, international  organizations and foundations, and the scientific community in  the interests of protecting the domestic intellectual potential.    The goals of the program are: the development of the  principles and mechanisms of the long-term national policy of  Russia in the area of the migration of scientists and  specialists and the formation of a set of specific steps on the  implementation of this policy; the reduction to a minimum of the  harm from the departure abroad of the scientific and technical  and the creative intelligentsia by the creation of adequate  organizational legal and socio-economic working and living  conditions of scientists and specialists in Russia and their  effective participation in the international division of labor.    The development of a rational mechanism of the management of  the process of intellectual migration and the creation of the  conditions for its efficient operation are a most important task  of the program.    The basic measures of the program can be implemented in  three  stage. At the first stage the task of preserving the scientific  elite of Russia and of not allowing the leading scientific  schools of the country to perish is advanced. At the same time  it is necessary to place the process of the ``brain drain'' in a  civilized framework. For these purposes it is planned to make  efforts for the change of the form of migration from emigration  without return (which still predominates) to temporary contract  migration.    At the second (intermediate-term) stage a substantial change  in connection with the changeover to a market of the structure  of science, the forms and sources of its financing, and so on is  proposed. Along with the state, the role of which will gradually  decrease, independent structures, joint-stock companies, and  various structures will become the clients of developments of  scientists. The transformation of science in these directions  creates favorable conditions for mutually advantageous  cooperation with foreign scientific centers and firms, which  produce science-intensive products. All this will make it  possible to stabilize scientific research and development and  then will ensure their development and growth, which will affect  fundamentally the migration of intellectuals.    The third, long-range, stage of the regulation of  intellectual migration can begin when Russia, having overcome  the difficulties of the transition period, has formed a dynamic  market economy and an efficiently functioning civilian society  that makes a great demand for scientific ideas. This stage will  afford real opportunities for the extensive return of emigre  scientists to the homeland, as well as for the attraction of  foreign scientists for work at Russian science centers.    The program is a state and long-term one and is approved by  a  decree of the government. The overall coordination of the work  under the program is being carried out by the Russian Federation  Ministry of Science and Technical Policy.    State participation in the financing of the program  presumes:     -  the allocation of budgetary funds for the development of  science, culture, and higher education with allowance for  potential aggravations of the problem of intellectual migration;    -  the establishment of preferential conditions of taxation for  enterprises and firms in case of the making by them of  investments or the implementation of other projects that  contribute to the achievement of the goals of the program;    -  the mobilization of the assets being received from domestic  and  foreign nongovernmental organizations.       There should become the basic forces of the implementation  of  the program: first, government bodies, whose activity the  Ministry of Science and Technical Policy of Russia coordinates;  second, the scientific community, the public, and  representatives of commercial structures and the mass media;  third, international organizations and foundations, as well as  the corresponding structures of the countries which are giving  aid to Russian science; fourth, the appropriate subdivisions of  the Federal Migration Service of Russia.    After the approval of the program at the state level a  special subdivision (an administration or an agency for  questions of intellectual migration), which performs the  functions of the general management of the program, as well as  an interdepartmental scientific council with the attraction of  representatives of the scientific community, experts of  international organizations, and so forth, which is responsible  for the scientific, including research, support of the program  are established within the Ministry of Science and Technical  Policy .    The All-Russian Scientific Labor Exchange, which deals on a  commercial basis with the entire set of questions connected with  the support of the entire set of questions connected with the  assurance of civilized conditions of the transfer of scientists  and specialists.    The exchange in cooperation with the mass media (at the  first  stage the newspaper POISK) and other structures are publishing  in Russian and English a special bulletin (the working name is  SCIENCE EXCHANGE) with information on all questions that are  important for the participants in the process of intellectual  migration and for donor countries and recipient countries.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / San Fermin bull-running festival opens in Pamplona Thousands of people celebrating the official opening of the San Fermin bull-running festival in the centre of the northern Spanish town of Pamplona yesterday. The main attractions of the nine-day festival are the daily encierros (bull runs), starting today, when hundreds of Spaniards and foreigners wind up all-night bouts of drinking and eating with a test of bravery, charging ahead of bulls which are let loose to run through the streets to the bull ring. Dozens of people are gored each year.</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MACAL LEADS PACIFIC SYMPHONY  </P> <P> With each guest conductor leading the Pacific Symphony while the search for a  new music director goes on, the orchestra has responded with alertness and  security.  </P> <P> Milwaukee Symphony music director Zdenek Macal took his turn Saturday with a  New Year's Eve pops program at the Orange County Performing Arts Center.  </P> <P> Macal is an interesting conductor to watch. He feints, he jabs, he flirts, he  pouts, he argues, he suffers. He plucks notes out of the air. He directs  finger-shimmies at the musicians. He crouches to half his height for the right  pianissimo, rises to bring the music to a climax and finishes with little,  happy jumping hops. He is capable of singing along with the players at the most  expressive moments.  </P> <P> For all that, the Pacific rarely gave him expressiveness to match, and it may  not have been entirely the orchestra's fault.  </P> <P> While always enforcing clarity, balance, proportion, exactness and discipline,  Macal eschewed flights of lyricism or poetry. He could be fussy in detail, yet  cool in overall aim and phrasing.  </P> <P> The overtures to Strauss' "Die Fledermaus" and Offenbach's "Orpheus in the  Underworld" were vigorous and clean, but not sweet or sparkling. Even  Offenbach's famous cancan lacked a sense of fun.  </P> <P> The conductor and pianist Jeffrey Siegel pretty much missed the style boat in  Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue." Macal took a Teutonic, declamatory approach to  the work, while Siegel viewed it as if he were playing Tchaikovsky's virtuosic  First Concerto or perhaps one of Prokofiev's keen-edged works.  </P> <P> Siegel stabbed at the sustaining pedal with his right foot, kept time by  tapping with his left, thundered at the keyboard with steely facility and  occasionally veered into honky-tonk style as if an inner voice suddenly nagged,  "Jazz score . . . Jazz score. . . ." But it was a sometime thing.  </P> <P> Macal enforced such rigid rhythms that when the big tune arrived, it sounded  fatigued and oddly accented. Clarinetist Emily Bernstein, who in other works  offered fine playing, proved tentative and inexpressive in the famous opening  solo.  </P> <P> Everyone came off best in the Suite from Strauss' "Der Rosenkavalier." The  orchestra sounded strong and secure, and Macal conveyed sweep and power but  only a little of the poignancy and intoxication of this magical score.  </P></p>

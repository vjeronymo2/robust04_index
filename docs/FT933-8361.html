			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Denmark deal highlights progress of Switzerland THE LAUNCH last week of a SFr1bn Eurobond issue by the Kingdom of Denmark has highlighted the steady progression of Switzerland from a bond market dominated by retail investors into one which can satisfy the requirements of large borrowers and institutional investors. Denmark's six-year offering, which rivalled the record for a single Swiss bond transaction set by the Republic of Austria at the end of June, came as a surprise to the market. The kingdom, which has been borrowing heavily to replenish foreign exchange reserves depleted by the heavy currency intervention to restore stability to the European exchange rate mechanism, had been expected to opt for the more liquid French franc sector. The two big sovereign deals have encouraged syndicate managers at the Swiss banks, especially since they have been making a concerted effort to convince international borrowers that the Swiss bond market is capable of accommodating large bond issues. Another feather in their cap is the SFr600m, 10-year offering from the Inter-American Development Bank which was launched in July. The syndicate managers are confident that it will only be a matter of time before 'the right issuer at the right price' can push the record for a single transaction in the Swiss bond market up to SFr1.25bn. 'The Swiss bond market is receptive to excellent names,' says one manager. The market anticipates that several more sovereign and supranational borrowers will tap the market in the coming weeks. Certainly, the Swiss banks' marketing campaign has been helped by a series of measures by the government and the Swiss National Bank in the last year to liberalise capital markets, ranging from cutting turnover tax to relaxing syndication regulations. The impact of the measures has been to reduce dramatically the cost to both the issuer and investor. This in turn has made the foreign sector much cheaper than the domestic market, hence increasing volume and liquidity. Total new issue volume in the Swiss bond market in 1993 to date has been SFr23.3bn, compared with a total of SFr26.1bn for the whole of 1992. The turbulence in the European exchange rate mechanism has also worked in the favour of the Swiss bond market, as investors took refuge in the relative safety of the Swiss franc. Although the foreign money did not necessarily go into the bond market, bankers said the inflow had a positive impact on the market's liquidity. The currency's consequent appreciation has increased expectations of lower interest rates in Switzerland, which in turn has resulted in a significant drop in bond yields. Some economists expect Swiss short-term rates to fall to 4 per cent by the end of the year from their current level of around 4.55 per cent. UBS, which arranged Denmark's offering, is particularly positive on interest rates and its stance is reflected in the pricing of the bonds. They carry a coupon of 4.25 per cent, which compares with a coupon of 4.5 per cent on Austria's bonds which have a 6 1/2 year maturity. Inevitably, this has prompted some criticism in the market, especially among those who believe that Swiss interest rates have reached a plateau and that the Danish offering was unrealistically priced. 'The pricing is anticipating a fall in interest rates well in advance of the event,' one banker said. Officials at UBS reject this criticism and say they are confident that the entire issue will be placed by the payment date on September 30, and that by then its yield will look more attractive. Irrespective of when the next interest rate cut will occur, investors are increasingly taking the view that Swiss interest rates are close to their floor. Therefore most of the recent issues do not have a maturity of more than seven years. 'Investors believe that interest rates will be higher in four or five years,' one banker said. In spite of their recent achievements, however, Swiss syndicate managers are careful not to get too carried away. They note that the recent spate of offerings, and the prospect of some more large deals in the pipeline, has prompted some concern of over-supply in the primary market. Furthermore, the syndicate managers report that investors have been switching out of the Swiss bond market and into other higher-yielding markets elsewhere in Europe.</p>

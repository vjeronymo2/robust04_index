			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: The 'Hoover' prepares to clean up O&amp;Y - Nikki Tait profiles the new head of the troubled property developer Mr Gerald (Jerry) Greenwald - who was last night named by Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property group, as its president and deputy chief executive - was once nicknamed 'the Hoover' because of his ability to absorb vast quantities of information. At the rate Mr Greenwald has been travelling recently, this can only be an asset. Until mid-1990, Mr Greenwald seemed to have a clear, and fairly well-defined, future. The Princeton economics graduate, who had spent the first 22 years of his business career with Ford, was widely accepted to be Mr Lee Iacocca's successor as chairman of Chrysler. He already held the position of vice-chairman, and had been working at Chrysler, the smalls, since the early 1980s. But in June 1990, Mr Greenwald, then 54, switched course. He opted instead to head a union-led buyout attempt at UAL, the parent company of United Airlines. Had the deal ever come to fruition, Mr Greenwald would have run the large but somewhat unsettled airline, replacing its chairman, Mr Stephen Wolf. It was a move which caused comment at the time, and observers were quick to suggest motives. For a start, the financial terms of the deal must have looked attractive. Mr Greenwald received a Dollars 5m bonus when he left Chrysler, and was guaranteed another Dollars 4m if the UAL deal collapsed. That is exactly what happened only months later, largely because of mounting difficulties in securing bank financing for leveraged transactions. The deal's demise left former colleagues at Chrysler to talk about 'Jerry's Dollars 9m summer job'. But kinder commentators also suggested that the uncertainties over Chrysler's own future as an independent company may have influenced Mr Greenwald's decision to depart. And they noted that the vice-chairman, although credited with negotiating Chrysler's bailout plan, had stood in Mr Lee Iacocca's formidable shadow for many years, and may have found the limelight attractive. 'One doesn't last long with Iacocca, taking a different position from his,' one Chrysler employee commented later. At any rate, Mr Greenwald's next move was to Dillon Read, the Wall Street investment bank, as a managing director. There, he oversaw the bank's buyout funds and, appropriately enough, 'was involved in the firm's efforts to provide financial assistance and advice to troubled companies.' He resigned last week. According to Lee Iacocca, who wrote glowingly of Mr Greenwald in his autobiography, he is also 'an entrepreneur who can analyse a problem and then move on to solve it'. That is a quality which will be much-tested in the months ahead.</p>

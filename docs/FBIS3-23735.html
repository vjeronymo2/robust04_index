Malevanyy, editor in chief  of SLOVO KYRGYZSTANA; place and date not given: "Zhumagul  Saadanbekov: `I Belong to That Generation of Politicians Who Are  Returning From the Market'"]    [Text]  <H5>  Instead of a Preface </H5>   I worked with Zhumagul Saadanbekov for many years. I  have seen him in various situations. And I can testify: You  cannot conduct his level of politics on such (excuse me) trash  as tribalism. It is too simple and absurd.    But what, nonetheless, happened? Why has his name been  cropping up in the press in recent weeks in connection  specifically with tribalism, against which, it will be recalled,  he spoke violently and furiously, obeying his conscience and  convictions? Zh. Saadanbekov himself answers these and other  questions today. I am confident that the inquisitive reader,  scrutinizing his answers, will judge intelligently and soberly  and will understand what is what. [Signed] A. Malevanyy, editor  in chief of SLOVO KYRGYZSTANA.    [Malevanyy] Zhumagul Saadanbekovich, how did it happen that  one day you suddenly became the personification of tribalism?    [Saadanbekov] Everyone knows the traditional methods of any  opposition. There is populism here, and the fight against  privileges, and the accusations of corruption and of tribalism,  and other innumerable "isms." The people, thank God, are already  developing a certain immunity to this kind of manifestation of  opposition combat.    But why did my generally inoffensive declaration to the  deputies of my oblast to stay behind in the hall for  consultations during the break evoke furious anger and  indignation in the opposition camp, while at the same time very  few reacted when the Supreme Council under the "flexible"  leadership of the speaker encroached on the Constitution of the  republic and rudely smashed it?    The fact is that long before the session, while speaking on  television, I predicted, and it turns out now very correctly,  impending battles at the Supreme Council session. In particular,  I said that it would become an arena of political fights of the  two branches of authority--the representative and the  executive--and the arena of a crudely selfish fight for  portfolios in the government. I said this not because I have any  kind of biased attitude toward the Supreme Council and its  leadership. But because in all of the republics of the former  USSR, the mutual relations of the legislative and executive  branches of authority up to now developed or are developing  sharply, and by means of conflict. And this is not accidental.  Our society and our people were brought up under conditions of  the monolithic authority of the CPSU. Even Zyuganov, the leader  of the communists of Russia, today recognizes that the CPSU was  not a party, but a monolithic hierarchical state structure. We  did not know what the division of power was. We knew only one  authority--the authority of the rayon political committees, the  oblast political committees, and the Central Committee.    After the August putsch of 1991, the CPSU left the political  arena. All of the republics, based, of course, on good  intentions, implemented the separation of three branches of  authority. But it soon turned out that everywhere, with the  exception, perhaps, of the Baltic republics, conditions did not  mature for their civilized interaction. From Moldova and Ukraine  to the very ends of Russia and Central Asia, a struggle for  power evolved between the soviets and the executive structures.  Everyone knows how it all ended. Parliament was dissolved in  Russia with salvos from tank guns, and in Azerbaijan, just the  opposite, the defeat of the executive structure was crowned with  the flight of Elchibey. In Kazakhstan, this fight ended with the  self-dissolution of the entire vertical of soviets, etc., and  the like.    Today, various politicians are talking profusely in the  Supreme Council: They say that Kyrgyzstan is an exception in  this process, that we have calm and plenty, that our "legendary"  parliament does not think about power, etc. But then what kind  of evil forces (having in mind Saadanbekov most of all) think  and act otherwise. Indeed, a lot of them!    The very first day of the Supreme Council session fully  confirmed my assumptions. Unexpectedly for many, it began with  the report of the speaker and demands for his resignation. But  this kind of outcome was prevented. And at this point, an  unheard-of tragicomedy unfolded, an inevitable fight for the  chair of the prime minister and ministerial portfolios.  Everything was put into motion--from violations of procedure and  the Constitution to threats by individual deputies. His majesty  "Interest" united everyone--leftist extremists and social  democrats, liberals and orthodox communists, political plebeians  and the political elite. The decisive force was a vector  consisting of three components:    1. The offended, or the so-called "BU" [previously  discharged];    2. Contenders for portfolios;    3. Individual very contradictory, but powerful, regional  forces.    And what is most important, all of them concurred with the  desires and interests of the higher leadership of the Supreme  Council.    This "Afanasyev majority" was opposed by 104 deputies from  all regions of the republic. Among them is national poet Zhalil  Sadykov, the well-known entrepreneur Yu. Dunlarov, the prominent  public and political figure Zh. Akimaliyev, the heads of rayon  administrations B. Silayev, Zh. Zhamankulov, and others.    [Malevanyy] And nevertheless, what have you to do with it,  and where did this label of tribalism come from?    [Saadanbekov] As I already said, it was I who, even before  the session, disclosed both the global and the specific reasons  for the impending fight for power; I sharply criticized the  Presidium of the Supreme Council and many parties and movements  that directly or indirectly are exaggerating the notorious  question of gold for unseemly purposes. Could they excuse me for  all of this? No. They waited for an opportune moment in order to  deliver a blow. And they found it. They charged that my  statement to the deputies of Issyk-Kul Oblast was the sin of  tribalism. Almost a half million multiethnic and multifaced  people live in our oblast, and it is absurd to attribute some  kind of one-dimensional mentality to its deputy staff. The  deputation of the oblast represents very opposite positions. For  example, Deputies Idinov, Kalashnikov, Novikov, and many others  not only did not support, but even fought against the position  of the 104 deputies. Incidentally, among the 104 deputies, a  little more than 30 are from Issyk-Kul Oblast.    But if we are talking substance, then, of course, tribalism  is regional egoism--it is an evil, and it is our misfortune,  about which I speak continuously and consistently. And I not  only talk, but I also act. In the last year and a half to two  years, we were the first in the oblast to begin the rotation of  the chief of the rayon administrations. The now-deceased Madiyev  Eshimkan, the chief of administration of Issyk-Kulskiy Rayon,  was from Talass Oblast, and the present head of this same rayon,  Mukhtarov Erkin, is a native of Osh Oblast. The chief of the  oblast UVD [administration of internal affairs]--People's Deputy  M. Abdyldayev--is a native Bishkekian, and several chiefs of  oblast administrations come from Narynsk and Chu Oblasts, and so  on. Almost half of the personnel and the managerial staff of the  power structures are also from other oblasts of the republic.    [Malevanyy] You are being blamed for protecting former Prime  Minister T. Chyngyshev and that for the sake of keeping him in  his post you almost used forceful means to compel the deputies  of Issyk-Kul Oblast to vote collectively for confidence in  Chyngyshev's government. Is he really from the same place that  you are? And what kind of letter is it that was signed by 104  deputies in defense of the prime minister, which, as is  asserted, was organized by you?    [Saadanbekov] Yes, Chyngyshev is from the same place I am.  But if someone else were in his place, for example, Eshmatov  from Osh Oblast, I would just as fiercely defend him as I would  Chyngyshev in the same situation. Deputy Sh. Mambetov is also  from the same place I am. I think that he did a lot of damage to  the Kumtor contract. And if a person from another region were in  his place, I would fight against him exactly as against Mambetov.    Chyngyshev left. A new government was formed. It was headed  by Apas Dzhumagulov, an experienced administrator, and a loyal  and moderate politician. I believe that he will become a  consolidating figure, uniting all forces.    When I am accused of tribalism, I recall the plenum of the  Central Committee on the eve of the first session of the Supreme  Council of this convocation. At that time, the party apparatus,  the KGB, and other repressive organs were omnipotent and mighty.  But at that time, I came out against all of them and put forth  the candidacy of Apas Dzhumagulovich for the post of chairman of  the Supreme Council as an alternative to A. Masaliyev.  Persecution, shadowing, and prosecution started. A little later  I established and headed the "deputy group of 114." The Supreme  Council approached the presidential elections through our  efforts. There were three contenders in the first stage: A.  Masaliyev, Dzh. Amanbayev, and A. Dzhumagulov. It was precisely  at my initiative as the manager of the group that our faction  fought for Dzhumagulov, and not for Amanbayev, who comes from my  area. Where in those difficult times were today's ardent  fighters for democracy and enemies of tribalism?    As for those 104 deputies about whom you are asking, they  united in behalf of the defense of the Constitution, but not for  the defense of Chyngyshev or other persons. All it takes is to  violate the Constitution one time, when the destructive process  will begin to reshape it thoroughly. That is why when the  Supreme Council, after violating the Constitution, knocked  Chyngyshev out of his post, the president was compelled to  request the resignation of the entire government. In this way,  he saved the face not so much of Chyngyshev as of the Supreme  Council, and he saved the Constitution.    [Malevanyy] Do you yourself belong to any kind of a party?    [Saadanbekov] No.    [Malevanyy] How did you interpret the statement of the  leaders of political parties and movements, in which they insist  on removing you from the position of oblast chief of  administration?    [Saadanbekov] Most of all, it is amazing and amusing. I long  ago thought that we were living under a democratic system, and  that the Bolshevist method of selection had vanished in the  summer. It seems that the danger of a return of 1937 has not  passed. It appears that I am threatening the state integrity of  the republic, and that it is necessary therefore to dismiss me  from the post of the chief of administration immediately. And  people are writing this who consider themselves democrats.  Incidentally, among them are E. Aliyev and Zh. Zheksheyev, who  come from the same area that I do. Not knowing this themselves,  the signers drove themselves into an ideological swamp. There is  a new century outside and fresh winds of democracy, but they are  arming themselves with the Bolshevist club of violence. In  essence, both the extreme right and the extreme left radicals  are Bolsheviks, only with a different symbol.    [Malevanyy] In your time, you were one of the creators in  the  Supreme Council of the opposition platform of the "group of  114"; that is, you rendered definite services to democracy and  the "silk revolution" that took place in the country. And  suddenly everything is forgotten and discarded, and a wave force  of nine of rejection both from the side of part of the deputy  corps as well as of political parties is being raised around  your name. What has caused this, the change of direction of your  positions to the right, an evolution of views, or do you see  something else here, and what specifically, then?    [Saadanbekov] It is necessary to look into the peculiarities  of mass psychology. You recall when, at the last session of the  Supreme Council of the previous convocation, I was one of the  first to raise the question about national state sovereignty and  about a state language, literally an explosion occurred in the  social conscience, and here, there, and everywhere they  applauded, standing. You remember the story with Khrustalov's  notorious article "Duplicity," when I, risking everything,  defended the right of the existence of national traditions and  customs, and society applauded warmly at that time. Society  accepted and applauded when we completed, as they say, the "silk  revolution."    But apparently the social nature of the mass psychology is  such that a lot is forgotten quickly. I saw with my own eyes how  people calmly gazed at the swastika that adorned the walls, they  read fascist leaflets, laughing while walking along and,  shrugging their shoulders, went past a mob that declared: "We  are the black hundred." To what extent have people forgotten  everything! They have forgotten the known and unknown soldiers  who believed that they were fighting against fascism, and they  betrayed them. They betrayed relatives and friends, the millions  who perished on the GULAG islands and indifferently looked at  the rallies of Anpilov and Barkashov. Only in a society that is  stricken with a lack of memory and an absence of disgust can be  like this. But Kyrgyzstan's umbilical cord is still firmly tied  to that society where for the time being the Zhirinovskiys are  winning victories.    You talk of my rejection by a part of the deputy corps. And  here the psychological effect begins to work--the effect of  delayed vengeance. Perhaps they can really forgive one of the  authors of the "silk revolution"; that is, those who still yearn  for the "golden age" of stagnation, those who lost their party  chairs and privileges. Perhaps the new aggrieved and the new  "previously discharged persons" can forgive me when I still find  myself in the epicenter of democratic reforms, which are moving  slowly, with difficulty, and that frequently run into rejection  by the broad masses.    And more. I am one of those who frequently dares to say  unpopular and painful things in the interests of the psychic  health of society. Social conscience cannot base itself on  stereotypes and fraud. Individual political parties, for  example, are betting on national prejudices and antipathies. I  cannot reconcile myself with such a statement of the question,  and I criticize them openly. I also criticize for primitive  populism, for neo-Bolshevist ways, for the lack of clear  political positions and a social base. And it is understandable  why they undertook a reprisal against the obstinate Saadanbekov  in an organized way.    As for my positions and views, of course, they are changing  and are corrected in the channel of the dialectics of real life.  But the core of my position was and remains common sense  everywhere and pragmatism in everything.    [Malevanyy] I happened to hear that your trip to Canada this  year allegedly was financed by Kameko and that henceforth you  are obligated to this firm. Is this so?    [Saadanbekov] The trip to Canada was official. For nine days  I visited mines, pits, enterprises, and projects of institutes,  banks, and funds of the Kameko firm. We were shown in detail the  conditions of life and labor of the workers, we were shown the  newest technologies, dwellings, and the infrastructure that it  is planned to introduce in Kumtor. We discussed future variants  of accommodating manpower, food, transport, building, and  material technical support for implementing the Kumtor project.    The Kameko Corporation is one of the world's largest  producers of uranium working at low costs. Moreover, it is  engaged in prospecting for and extracting copper, zinc, and  diamonds.    Kameko's property on 1 January 1993 was valued at $1.3  billion. According to the results of nine months of this year,  the net income of the company totaled $197.8 million, as  compared with $184.3 million for the corresponding period in  1992. According to the data of expert organizations, Kameko is  easily able to invest up to $100 million per year.    And this investor, recognized in the whole world, has been  subjected to insults in our country for more than half a year,  and it is slanderously suspected of all kinds of thinkable and  unthinkable sins. Do the enemies of this project realize what  immeasurable damage and what kind of unjustified offense they  are committing against their own people and their future, if  this corporation leaves us due to their pressure?    [Malevanyy] What is your estimate of the political situation  in the republic? Do you think that the change in government will  play a stabilizing role? Your prognosis for the near future?    [Saadanbekov] The political situation, if it is examined in  a  global context, is normal. A quite normal democratic struggle  for power is going on in a normal democratic society. Only in  this struggle, a neo-Bolshevist propensity for reprisal against  dissidents is not permissible. I think that the change in  government and an especially successful outcome of the  forthcoming referendum will stabilize the situation more  profoundly.    Regarding the prognosis, this is a thankless and very tricky  undertaking. It is better to live with hope and faith. This is  simply necessary for a person in our difficult time.    [Malevanyy] You are frequently reproached for political  ambition: It is said that you see yourself at one moment in the  speaker's position, then in the chair of the prime minister, and  even in the chair of the president. And that you are  subordinating today's tactics to the achievement of one of these  aims, and that you are even conducting some kind of  behind-the-scenes game. What do you say in this regard?    [Saadanbekov] There is a Russian proverb that says: "People  are coming from the market, but Nazar is going to the market." I  already belong to that generation of politicians that are  returning from the market. It is necessary to clear the way for  the young. We have talented and very promising youth. It is  necessary to foster and continuously cultivate them. Not to  interfere, and not to trip them up, as our individual Nazars are  doing today. Thus, I assure you that I have no pretensions to  the aforementioned posts.    At the session of the Supreme Soviet, when a president was  being elected, I was the only one who removed his candidacy out  of moral considerations, and I advised the leaders of the  Central Committee at that time to follow my example. They did  not heed me, and they suffered defeat. It is my profound  conviction that politics should be built on principles of  morality. I do not acknowledge the position that politics is  really dirty work, but we, they say, are clean. It is this kind  of approach that makes politics dirty. But it should be the  opposite, work that is very clean and a service to the citizens.  We must not leave this sphere of work to people who are  dishonorable; this will cause damage, it is a betrayal of the  intellect itself, and the abandonment of responsibility for the  world around us. Politics should be engaged in by people who are  the most selfless and the most sagacious, the kind who better  than others see the common connection in various phenomena.    As for my political ambition and my kind of  behind-the-scenes  games, this is being written about by two or three inveterate  yellow-press newspapers. I do not read the hogwash with which  they regale a narrow circle of readers, holding them to be  loonies. I am a normal person who has his work, thoughts,  family, hopes, and faith, and, therefore, I am not interested in  the ideological prostitution of aggressive ignoramuses who  thirst, as the classic often used to say, "to play a role" at  any price.    [Malevanyy] Zhumagul Saadanbekovich, in light of the recent  elections in Russia, what will be the fate of democracy in our  country, and will it not collapse under the weight of economic  conditions and political reprisals?    [Saadanbekov] Some kind of cave-in has occurred with these  elections in Russia. It is very difficult to rethink and realize  all of this, but one thing is clear. Democracy suffered a  serious defeat. And it serves the democrats of Russia right. As  it is here, they have not had unity for a long time, and they  literally fought among themselves. Many democrats stood on the  sidelines in a struggle that was going on not for life, but to  the death between the representative and executive branches of  power.    But the same thing, if not worse, is going on in our  republic  in the democratic camp. Few of the democrats remain, as they  say, of the first callup, the first wave, with genuine  democratic convictions. Some slammed the door loudly and made  for the near abroad, and others head the opposition to the  government. Still others, working in the executive structure,  show themselves to be in no way better than the former  officials. The democratic movement today abounds in selfish,  arrogant, and foolish people.    The people are tired of their dilettantism, from the complex  of failures who on a wave of criticism became deputies and  entered the government structure, but who cannot work. They  replace genuine activity with the appearance of activity.  Because these people, from one side and the other, do not know  how to work. Some of them absolutely do not fit the position  they occupy; therefore, they put everything they have into a  fight with someone. But if you are fighting with somebody, you  do not have to work, and then it is sufficient to devise  scathing arguments against one's opponent. All of them joined  the democrats, when this was safe and even prestigious, and it  also promised dividends. After all, there is nothing more  gratifying than to join the victor, and to stand under  victorious banners. This turn left a mark on both the character  of the movement and on its individual activists.    I think that today's leaders of the democratic movement are  capable of realizing the situation and that they will draw the  appropriate conclusions, that they will achieve unity and  agreement within their ranks, and that they will shift its  activity onto constructive and creative tracks.    Today, no matter who we are according to party convictions,  we should have one aim--to lead the country out of the economic  crisis. To throw all our forces into a revival of the economy.  Because the economy contains in itself the greatest capability  for organizing society. When people are engaged in work, they do  not have the time to be involved with nonsense.</p>

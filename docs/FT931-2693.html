			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Turkey is offered ceasefire by Kurds TURKEY'S Kurdish rebels declared a unilateral ceasefire yesterday, promising to end hostilities for 25 days if Turkish government forces agreed to hold to their positions. The offer was greeted by Kurdish deputies in Turkey's parliament as an opportunity for a breakthrough in the eight-year insurgency which has claimed more than 5,000 lives. However, the proposal delivered by Mr Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the rebel Kurdish Workers party (PKK), is likely to be met with considerable official scepticism after recent government successes against PKK bases in Turkey's Kurdish-speaking south-east. State television made no mention of the offer. Mr Ocalan, known as Apo, made the offer from his headquarters in Lebanon, undertaking to suspend actions from March 20 to April 15, as a goodwill gesture to coincide with the Nevrouz or Kurdish new year celebrations on March 21. This week Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkey's prime minister, called for nationwide vigilance to avoid last year's 'nightmare', when more than 90 people were killed as the government used armoured vehicles to reassert control in towns along the border with Iraqi and Syria. The government blamed the PKK for exploiting the festivities to provoke a separatist insurrection. Since then, the PKK has been under intense diplomatic and military pressure, with reports that Syria has withdrawn its support. Iran, too, is distancing itself from the rebels. The move follows a concerted diplomatic initiative from Ankara. Turkey has also won tacit backing from the Kurds of Iraq, underlined last October during a sweep by Turkish commandos when PKK units were forced from the border where they had attacked Turkish posts.</p>

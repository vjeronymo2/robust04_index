			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By John Soderlund] </F>   [Text] Get chlorine pills, ensure you have enough firewood,  give each member of the family a well-stocked backpack and a  healthy supply of non-perishable food.    This is not the checklist for a family hike. It's a sample  of the AWB's [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] list of precautions  to ensure that members will be able to deal with the pandemonium  it predicts will erupt around the time of the election. The  full list, which includes ensuring that there are sufficient  weapons and ammunition for all family members and enough food  for all pets, was distributed at schools in the Pretoria area  this week.    Its more extreme entries are enough to inspire  bunker-building activities among rightwingers, frantic shopping  for canned food among DP [Democratic Party] supporters and a lot  of gun-cleaning in the northern suburbs.    "In the time which is approaching it will be wise to be  prepared at all times. Herewith the guidelines which will  ensure you will not be caught off-guard," begins the four-page  document.    First up is to ensure you have enough water. That means  protecting all water sources and getting plenty of chlorine  pills.    Food supplies should be canned or preserved and not require  water for preparation, it says.    Pick 'n Pay group marketing director Martin Rosen says sales  of non-perishable foods soared countrywide this week. "People  are certainly stocking up, especially on things like tinned  foods, long-life milk and milk powder.    "Each of our stores is several million rands up on budget --  up to 50 percent -- for March as a result," he says.    The frantic buying is fairly evenly spread around the  country. Rosen says supply problems have been compounded by  strikes which have affected some of the grocery chain's  suppliers.    If the pamphlet's medical hints are anything to go by, do  not  expect to be able to get on to any first-aid courses in the next  three weeks. Antibiotics, pain killers and stomach medication  could also be in short supply.    Its communications suggestions will likely result in a lot  of  neighbourly visits and improved cellular phone sales.    Despite intimations that the list is not "the alpha and  omega", its author says only those who are prepared will survive.    An AWB head office spokesman said the phamphlet was probably  compiled by one of the organisation's local committees, which  were responsible for ensuring the safety of their supporters.</p>

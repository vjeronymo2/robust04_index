			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Paribas to provide Pounds 83m for private Maxwell loans SHARES IN Paribas fell more than 7 per cent yesterday as the French investment bank said it would have to make about FFr800m-worth of provisions (Pounds 82.6m) in its 1991 accounts to cover the risk of losses on its loans to Maxwell private companies. It is the first bank to make a public estimate of the scale of its losses on Maxwell loans. Indeed its losses are likely to be among the biggest recorded by any bank. The bulk of Paribas' exposure is understood to be held in its Swiss subsidiary, Paribas Suisse, which acted as the lead bank in a Pounds 100m syndicated loan to PHA Finance, a Maxwell vehicle. Paribas' share of the facility is unusually high and may be as great as 80 per cent. This loan was secured against 118.5m shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation, the company which is now in administration under UK insolvency legislation. MCC shares are now regarded by the banks as worthless. However Paribas refused to comment on stock market rumours that its net profits fell last year by 41 per cent from FFr2.54bn to FFr1.5bn. The rumours contributed to yesterday's 7.3 per cent share price fall to FFr330, the steepest drop on the Paris bourse. Officials were surprised by the fall, given that Mr Andre Levy Lang, chairman, had already warned earlier this month that the group would be making heavy provisions on several large corporate loans. French banks, such as Credit Agricole, Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit Lyonnais, may face bigger losses on loans to the Maxwell public and private companies than even the UK clearing banks. Credit Lyonnais, which is chairing the steering committee representing bank lenders to MCC, is believed to be particularly exposed, with loans estimated at about Pounds 150m. When the UK clearers announce their 1991 results next month, they are expected to disclose provisions totalling more than Pounds 200m to cover the risk of losses on their Maxwell loans. The biggest Maxwell-related losses are expected to be taken by Lloyds. See World Stock Markets</p>

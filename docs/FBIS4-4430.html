			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi, March 31 (CTK) -- The Czech parliamentary  delegation currently on a four-day visit to Vietnam today met  Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh.    The Czechs are led by parliament chairman Milan Uhde.    Le Duc Anh said that the Vietnamese people respected  democracy and human rights, adding that Southeast Asia could  become a market for Czech goods. He also spoke in favor of  Czech-Vietnamese parliamentary cooperation.    The Czech delegation then met Vietnamese Premier Vo Van  Kiet,  "the man who carries the burden of the Vietnamese economic  reform," Uhde told journalists, adding that the two sides spoke  about the need to sign bilateral agreements on investment  protection, double taxation, and tax evasion.    Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec's visit, due in  April,  will be taking place in a favorable climate, Uhde said, adding  that the current visit managed to do away with a "certain  silence and unease."    Same as during his recent trip to Thailand, Uhde spoke in  favor of three-party cooperation involving the Czech Republic,  Vietnam, and Thailand, with Thailand seen as having free capital.    The Czech also met Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh  Cam.</p>

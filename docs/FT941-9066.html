			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Consumers divide and rule in the iron ore market - Bob Jones reports on the outcome of one of the toughest-ever price-setting seasons The world iron ore industry emerged last week from one of the toughest price settlement seasons it had ever encountered. The February 8 agreements between Australia's Hamersley Iron, a subsidiary of the CRA group, and its Japanese and British customers broke three months of deadlock, but reaction among Hamersley's rival suppliers has been hostile. In the most important settlement, covering 1994-95 Japanese deliveries, Hamersley reluctantly accepted price drops of 9.5 per cent for the standard fines grade and 5.9 per cent for its higher quality lump ore. In return the Japanese steel mills agreed to take an unchanged volume of 18m tons, despite their stated need to reduce next fiscal year intake overall by 16 per cent. Four Australian and Brazilian miners followed the Hamersley lead in Japan and agreed similar price reductions, but other suppliers have condemned the deal. Recent price negotiations have seen a pattern established in which a single supplier agrees a seemingly unfavourable price in return for volume. All other suppliers are penalised because consumers tend to use up all their bonus allocations in the first settlement. The miners have been arguing that demand is now stronger than this time last year, and their delivery figures bear this out. Only two miners recorded a decline in deliveries in 1993. The steel mills' divide-and-rule tactics this year derive from the huge losses they are making in the miners' two major markets, Europe and Japan. Japanese steel losses could total Y240bn (Pounds 1.57bn) in this fiscal year. Germany's largest steelmaker Thyssen Stahl alone lost DM1.2bn (Pounds 460m) in 1992-93. European Union efforts to reduce steel industry capacity are encountering huge resistance from private sector mills, which accuse Brussels of subsidising state-owned industries in Italy Spain and Germany. So the miners have been forced to accept that, as iron ore is at least 95 per cent dependent on the steel industry for sales, the ability of the mills to pay is paramount. They are bitterly upset that the usual supply and demand arguments have been jettisoned this year. In reply the Japanese mills have argued that there are 20m tonnes of over-capacity in the iron ore industry and that shipment problems are merely logistical. There is usually a time lag between improvements in steel and iron ore prices. Hamersley's sales and marketing director, Mr Roddy Kinkead-Weekes, stated after the Japanese agreement that 'the underlying demand for steel and hence for iron ore has firmed and will improve further as the world economy improves'. If history is any guide, booming steel output in North America should presage strong recovery in Europe. But European improvement has been too slow and too late to help miners. Even the argument of increased Chinese demand has left the mills unmoved. During the last decade Beijing has become firmly of the opinion that it is better to import iron ore to make the finished product. Chinese imports have risen from 14.3m tonnes in 1990 to an estimated 28m-30m last year. Further growth can been expected in the next few years, provided China resolves problems at its ports. Not all is gloom. The higher quality pellet and lump grades have seen demand turn round. In Europe and Japan the new lump premium is 8.7 per cent higher. Pellet demand is rising fast: one small producer in Norway saw shipments rise by almost half last year. But pellet prices are likely to fall all the same. Of the two basic types, blast furnace material is suffering from a market in long term decline as the scrap-based mini-mill becomes ever more popular. The only hope of a roll-over of prices is the direct reduction market, whose customers are mini-mills. Expansion of pelletising capacity is under way in India and Sweden and under consideration in Australia and the Middle East. For LKAB of Sweden, saddled with the investment burden of a new 4m-tonne pellet plant to open next year, this year's settlement has been a particular blow.

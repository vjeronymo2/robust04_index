			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FLICKS: FILM AND VIDEO NOTES;  </P> <P> 10 NAPKINS;  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY THEATER WILL COVER YOUR HANDS IN POPCORN BUTTER. AND BEWARE OF  RESTROOM COLORS.  </P> <P> Dateline: Mann Sycamore Plaza 6, 3050 Cochrane St., Simi Valley.  </P> <P> With this installment we have hit a milestone in our series of reviews of  Ventura County theaters -- an even half-dozen.  </P> <P> Food: Let's just say that the Tums family would be thrilled. The hot dog was  the saltiest we have come across and the stale bun did nothing to dull the  sting. The stomachache arrived before the opening credits.  </P> <P> The buttered popcorn rated 10 napkins. That was about how many it took to dry  our hands after finishing off only half a regular-size serving. The guy selling  the food squirted in two streams of that "delicious golden flavoring" stuff  that Mann seems to like to use in lieu of butter. One glob would have been more  than sufficient.  </P> <P> Restroom: Uuuglyyyyy. The color scheme is a mixture of white and a kind of  blood cell red. The stall walls, the door and the sink counter are made to look  like marble versions of these two "colors."  </P> <P> On the up side, the place was clean (though a reliable source says the women's  restroom gets messy late in the day). Also on the plus side -- the  towel/blow-dry option.  </P> <P> Pre-movie entertainment: One of those ad and trivia deals. Lots of ads for  local businesses and upcoming movies. It was backed, not by the more common  Muzak, but by a mix of hard rock and rhythm and blues. A nice change.  </P> <P> Pre-movie ads: One.  </P> <P> Previews: Three.  </P> <P> Special feature: Your name in lights. Or at least your gender. The "Men" and  "Women" signs above the restroom doors were outlined in marquee-like yellow  light bulbs.  </P> <P> Today is a big day for the local video stores, with "The Hunt for Red October"  and "The Jetsons" both becoming available.  </P> <P> " 'Hunt for Red October' will be a blockbuster," said Mick Thiesen, owner of  Video City in Camarillo.  </P> <P> And "The Jetsons"? "I don't think I ordered that dumb thing," he said.  </P> <P> Ojai Film Society feature of the week: "The Man With Two Brains" starring Steve  Martin and Kathleen Turner. The 1983 film is the story of a surgeon who falls  in love with a talking brain when his marriage fails. Voice of the brain  belongs to Sissy Spacek. Showtime is 4:30 p.m. Sunday at the Ojai Playhouse.  LEO SMITH  </P></p>

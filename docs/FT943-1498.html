			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cockerill Sambre enjoys turnround at six months Cockerill Sambre, Belgium's biggest steelmaker, took advantage of the steady economic recovery in Europe with a profits turnround in the first half of this year. The company announced yesterday a BFr277m (Dollars 8.68m) net profit for the first half of 1994 after registering a loss of BFr3bn in the same period in 1993. Consolidated turnover rose by 13 per cent, to BFr84.7bn from BFr74.9bn. The turnround underlines an upturn in the automotive sector and a gradual improvement in steel prices in Europe.

Cockerill said it had carried out its planned BFr22bn investment programme. Group debts rose to BFr9.6bn, compared with BFr8.1bn to the end of December 1993. Shareholders' funds stood at BFr62.8bn.

The bid price was not disclosed, nor is it clear if the Belgian steelmaker is the only party interested in acquiring Eko Stahl. Cockerill's parent company also increased turnover to BFr34.4bn in the first half compared with BFr28.8bn. It posted a net profit of BFr8m compared with a loss of BFrr2.7m.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Property: Time-share sheds its old, shabby image - The British account for 38 per cent of Europeans who part-own a holiday home. Suddenly, the industry has real prospects Perhaps it is the thought of exchanging the British winter for a flat in the sun that makes the idea of owning - or part-owning - a holiday home in a warmer country so attractive. Or it could simply be an extension of the great British desire to own property, wherever it might be. Whatever the explanation, British buyers make up 38 per cent of Europe's 764,000 time-share owners. With the recession apparently easing and the acceptable face of the industry gaining public confidence, there is reason to believe it can achieve steady growth. Time-share buyers do not own property but have the right to use part of a villa or flat, usually on holiday, for a fixed number of weeks. The idea of having your own little place in the sun - or perhaps at a winter ski resort  -becomes even more attractive when the prospective investor gets the advantage of such things as special air fares and discounts on stop-over hotels, excursions and rental cars. Joining one of the established time-share exchange networks, such as Resort Condominiums International (RCI) or Interval International, can give an investor even greater flexibility. Time-share certainly has become better organised, more respectable and more accepted in the 20 years since the concept was imported from the US. But the Time-share Council, the body set up by the industry to act as its regulator, has some cautions. 'Time-share should always be regarded as an investment in holidays, not property,' says council chairman Norman Burden, who owns two time-shares, in Torquay, Devon, and Tenerife, in the Canary Islands. 'Once you have bought your time-share - it can cost anything from Pounds 2,000 upwards - you should write off the cost mentally and not think of re-selling it for at least five years.' There are several reasons for this. One is that the price of the product bought new is high in relation to the true cost of the building: a developer might sell time in one of his properties at anything up to five or six times the cost of building and equipping it. The value of a time-share could fall by up to 40 per cent or more as soon as it is bought because much of the initial price goes towards paying the developer's marketing costs. Indeed, many time-shares in large complexes remain unsold for months or even years, thus depressing the re-sale price. In general, despite European economic recovery, supply still exceeds demand. Re-sale can be a problem for people who have owned time-shares for a long time. Raymond Bass, a retired executive from Pangbourne, Berkshire, bought Pounds 15,000 of time-share 15 years ago and has enjoyed many successful holidays with his family. But now that he and his wife want to sell, they cannot get their money back, mainly because of the depression in property prices generally over recent years. 'I shall be lucky to get Pounds 5,000 for my time-share weeks,' says Bass. In any case, as Burden points out, it would be unwise to bank on a good price for a second-hand time-share - or even finding a buyer at all - in the first five or so years. Bass does not criticise the time-share concept as such. 'We have enjoyed several dozen holidays in time-share apartments or villas in places as diverse as California, South Carolina, several locations in Spain and Portugal, and also in this country,' he says. 'Often, these were in self-contained complexes that provided us with infinitely superior facilities to those we might have enjoyed on a package holiday.' Bass, however, was critical of some big time-share developers  - among them, several large UK companies - which, he claimed, failed to allow for refurbishment in their advance budgeting. One other positive aspect of time-share is the informal networking between friends and time-share enthusiasts that takes place. Just as you might let your son, daughter or neighbour have a week or more in your time-share apartment, so you could equally extend this to a cousin, aged aunt or business colleague. Informal arrangements of this sort are inevitably cheaper to arrange than doing it through an established agency. For those who wish to know more, the Department of Trade and Industry has produced a useful booklet called Your Place in the Sun. This can be obtained free by calling 071-215 3344. The Time-share Council, set up in 1990, can provide details of resort builders and operators as far apart as Scotland and Spain, the Lake District and Louisiana. It also supplies details of agencies specialising in time-share exchanges. The address is 23 Buckingham Gate, London SW1E 6LB (tel: 071-821 8845).</p>

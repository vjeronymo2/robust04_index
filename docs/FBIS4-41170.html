			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Litovkin: "Paratroopers Named as Chief </F> Peacekeepers in Transcaucasus"]    [Text] The peacekeeping operation which was begun by  Russian generals and troops subordinate to them in Georgia and  Abkhazia with a reconnaissance and the introduction into the  conflict zone of a reinforced engineer-sapper battalion and  communications and control subunits, has finally acquired  official, legal status. At a session closed to the press, the  Russian Federation Council, after hearing a report by Defense  Minister Army General Pavel Grachev, ratified the president's  edict on Russian Federation participation in reconciling the  warring parties.    Now the sappers and communications personnel are to be  followed to the Transcaucasus, to the Georgian-Abkhazian front,  by paratrooper peacekeepers. But not, admittedly, the officers  and men of the 345th Parachute Regiment, as was reported  earlier, but their colleagues from Novorossiysk, Stavropol, and  Ulyanovsk. The Russian Defense Ministry has accommodated the  Georgian parliament deputies who believe to this day that the  "fall" of Sukhumi happened purely because of the participation  of servicemen from that regiment in the storming of the city and  object to their presence on the line of disengagement between  the warring forces.    Under the decision agreed by the three sides, the  paratroopers of the 345th Regiment will stay at their positions  in Gudauta and Sukhumi and will guard the Bombory military  airfield and the Moscow Military District Sanatorium, where the  Joint Staff of the Russian peacekeeping forces in the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone is already stationed, as well  as other Russian Army facilities. Major General Vasiliy  Yakushev is charged with leading the peacekeeping forces.    The peacekeeping operation (you can see it in diagrammatic  form in our drawing) [report is accompanied by a two- by  two-inch sketch map captioned "Sketch map of the deployment of  Russian peacekeeping forces in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict  zone"] will cover an area in the region of the Inguri river 56  km wide and 78 km long. The dividing line between control zones  one and two will run perpendicular to the present line of  contact between Georgian and Abkhazian troops along the river.    The actual armed formations of the two sides must be drawn  back from the Inguri river 12 km on each side, so that in the  event of a strained situation arising, no one can hit his  adversary with tank or artillery guns, still less mortar or  machinegun fire (dotted line on the map).    The heavy equipment and main forces of the warring parties  are to go to specially designated areas (indicated on the sketch  map by broken elliptical lines). For the Abkhaz side these are  Ochamchira and Meore-Gudava, and for the Georgian side -- the  eastern suburbs of the cities of Kheta and Senaki (where the  equipment and arms are to be sited), as well as the city of  Chkhorotsku (for personnel).    In the zones there are five checkpoints for the peacekeeping  forces, which will regulate the flow of returning refugees -- at  the destroyed bridge on the Inguri river, among others -- and  bar the passage of weapons into the security and arms limitation  zones, plus 22 observation posts on the entire territory of the  "hot spot" (shown as triangles on the sketch map). Keen  attention will be paid to Galskiy Rayon, where the refugees are  mainly expected to return. It is proposed to site as many as  seven observation posts there.    The headquarters of Control Zone No. 1 will be sited in  Gali, and of Zone No. 2 in Zugdidi. It is proposed to leave up  to three battalions of peacekeeping forces in each zone. On the  west bank of the Inguri they will be composite battalions of the  Batumi Motorized Infantry Division belonging to the  Transcaucasus Group of Russian Forces.    For rapid reaction to explosive situations and incidents,  four mobile groups are being set up, to which 10 helicopters are  to be assigned. These groups, consisting of a reinforced  platoon, will also monitor from the air the Kodorskoye Ravine  zone, which does not form part of the demilitarized area but  causes great concern due to the operations of various  "independent" armed formations there.    The plan for the conduct of the operation was not only  discussed in the Russian Federation Council; the UN mission in  Georgia is also familiar with it. It was coordinated with  Lieutenant General Sergey Dbar, chief of general staff of the  armed forces of Abkhazia, and Major General Guram Nikolaishvili,  Georgian deputy defense minister.    Now it is up to the plan's executors. And not only, or even  mainly, the Russian peacekeepers. It is a matter of the  political will of the Georgian and Abkhazian leadershop to  resolve contentious problems exclusively by peaceful means.    According to information at our disposal, the sending of the  new Russian battalions to the conflict zone and their arrival at  Gudauta airfield is planned for 22-25 June. This will require  60 trips by Il-76 and An-22 planes.    The anticipated cost of the peacekeeping operation in  Georgia  and Abkhazia is 10-11 billion rubles. The officers' and men's  pay alone (there will be some 3,000 of them) will require 1  billion every month. At the same time the Federation Council  rejected the military people's proposal that Russia's "blue  helmets" be paid for as a separate item in the state budget.  The Defense Ministry will have to pay for everything.    On the first day of work, Russian sappers have already  rendered harmless 117 mines. Fortunately, there were no  casualties.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Tianjin is striving to  upgrade all its state-owned enterprises with foreign funds in  less than eight years, said a senior city leader here today.    Mayor Zhang Lichang disclosed this before the opening of the  '94 Tianjin Export Commodity Fair tomorrow here in this, north  China's biggest port city.    More than 300 overseas executives from many international  consortiums and transnational corporations are expected to take  part in the grand fair, co-sponsored by over ten provinces and  autonomous regions in north and northwest China.    The mayor first expressed his warm welcome to all the  overseas business people who intend to attend the fair.    He said he hoped that the Tianjin's economic ties with  overseas firms in industry and commerce throughout the world  will be further strengthened on the basis of mutual interests  and benefits.    Situated in the center of the Bohai Bay area, Tianjin, with  a  population of more than nine million people, is also an  important industrial center in north China, he noted.    The 55-year-old Zhang, who graduated from the Economic  Management Department of Nankai University in Tianjin, said the  city was one of the first group of coastal cities authorized in  1984 by the state to open to the outside world.    As a port city it boasts a number of advantages of  convenience in transport by air, sea and land, enormous  potential for industry and scientific research, and advanced  urban infrastructural facilities, he said.    At the same time, he said, Tianjin has stepped up the  formulation of rules and regulations concerning foreign affairs,  built the country's first service center for foreign investment  and streamlined the registration procedures for foreign-funded  ventures.    According to the latest data, by the end of March this year  Tianjin had signed contracts for 6,682 foreign-funded  enterprises, involving an investment totaling 7.9 billion U.S.  dollars and with a direct use of foreign funds of 5.35 billion  U.S. dollars.    The foreign funds used in the first quarter of this year  jumped to 250 million U.S. dollars.    The mayor said that there are now 15 world-renowned  transnational companies involved in investment in Tianjin,  including U.S. firms like Motorola, Otis and Coca-Cola, the  Japanese companies NEC and Honda, Germany's Henkel, Italy's  Zanussi and Hong Kong's Karry.    There are eight overseas banks in Tianjin, he added.    Zhang said that the foreign investment in Tianjin has two  distinct features: Those who have already invested in Tianjin  are expanding their amounts of investment and scale of  production; and the newcomers are "vying with each other in  looking for investment."    Zhang, formerly director of the Tianjin Economic Commission,  a factory manager and a workshop director, said that the foreign  investment in Tianjin is now expanding to different fields,  including industry, agriculture, finance and banking, and real  estate development, both in rural and urban areas.    He said that the local government's policy is to "let  foreign  investors make money here".    In addition to a good climate for investment, the mayor  said,  Tianjin has great potential for further co-operation.    The city has, since 1983, imported more than 7,000 items of  advanced technology and equipment from abroad to upgrade its old  industrial enterprises.    But, he added, much remains to be done because the general  situation of outdated equipment and products has not changed.  There are about 700 state-owned firms that need to be improved  in the coming few years, he noted.    As a result, more foreign funds will be needed to upgrade  these old enterprises, he said.    Talking about the future development of the city, Zhang said  that the construction of a new development zone of 2,300 sq km  on the coast has already started.    He said that foreign funds will also be used to renovate the  old districts of the city in the coming few years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The paper JUVENTUD REBELDE today published an  article entitled, "What Happened at the U.S. Interests Section?"  in which it sets forth in detail the incidents that occured in  the vicinity of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana on 10 and  11 February. [passage omitted]    In the chronology and analysis of the incidents, JUVENTUD  REBELDE points out that on 10 February, rumors began to spread  through the city of Havana to the effect that the Cuban security  guards had been withdrawn from the U.S. Interests Section, and  that people going to the Section's offices were expeditiously  being awarded visas. During that day, several groups of people  appeared in the area, headed for the U.S. Interests Section.  Party officials explained to them that what they heard was  false, and they desisted.    Later, similar incidents occurred, and the custodians asked  the people to leave because it was all nothing but a  manipulation by unscrupulous people. The area was cordoned off  with police barricades. This cordon was later removed, given the  characteristics of the people who, deceived, were showing up at  the site.    In the chronology published today by JUVENTUD REBELDE, it  was  pointed out that on 11 February, however, the human element that  began showing up at the site changed. Noted was the absence of  confused people and the presence of lumpen. One man even had a  knife hidden under his shirt and was arrested.    In the afternoon, a crowd of some 60 or 70 people formed,  among whom a number of agitators were observed. These people  headed along the Malecon intending to enter the U.S. Interests  Section's offices. Revolutionaries gathered at the place  thwarted the attempt. Those believed to be the ringleaders were  arrested. The police cordon was immediately reestablished. There  were another two similar disturbances later, but the  provocateurs failed to achieve their goal. [passage omitted]    JUVENTUD REBELDE'S article adds: It is obvious who  masterminded the incidents. This is how the mechanisms of the  counterrevolution and imperialism operate -- on the basis of  deception and cynicism. It has once again been confirmed that  the streets of this country belong, and will continue to belong,  to the revolutionaries.    The item states: The economy is in a special period here,  but  the dignity and decorum of a people who evidence daily heroism  will never be.    Let what has occured serve as experience for the  unscrupulous  authors of the escapade. Never will anyone be able to ride  roughshod over the Revolution because to do so, he would have to  ride roughshod over the righteous anger [coraje] and  determination of us millions of Cubans who place no stock in  rumors when it is a matter of defending the unity [integridad]  of the fatherland.</p>

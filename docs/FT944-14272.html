			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Stimulate investment for long term Sir, Two headlines on page 10 of your October 20 edition say: 'CBI warns employers to cut unit labour costs', and 'The case for an imaginative budget'. The first features the Confederation of British Industry's concerns over rising wages at a time when UK productivity is less than that of the US, Germany and Japan. But the CBI also warned that investment in the UK is well behind that of other countries. South Korean industry, for example, spends more on research and development, as a percentage of gross domestic product, than industry in the UK, and employs more graduate scientists and engineers. The Seoul government has announced the aim of raising total national investment in R&amp;D to 4 per cent of GDP, twice the UK level, by the end of the century. An 'imaginative budget' would take actions to stimulate and help industrial investment, especially for small and medium-sized companies, and introduce measures to counteract the endemic short-termism prevailing in industry and the financial markets. Countries such as South Korea know that long-term productivity and competitiveness depend on investments made today. J H Mulvey, executive secretary, Save British Science, Box 241, Oxford OX1 3QQ</p>

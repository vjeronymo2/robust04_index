			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Brussels sounds out plans for E Europe FAR-REACHING proposals to accelerate the political and economic integration of six former communist countries into the EC are to receive a first hearing among EC foreign ministers today, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. The meeting in Brussels is likely to show whether the European Commission's plans for improved, across-the-board access for east European products can win endorsement at next month's EC summit in Copenhagen. Proposals for freer trade with Russia are also on the agenda. The UK, Germany and Denmark are fully behind the Commission's bolder than expected approach toward the east Europeans, but Spain and Portugal are calling for prudence. Today's meeting is also expected to include calls for recalcitrant EC member states to ratify the Europe Agreements offering trade liberalisation to Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. The agreements have been in effect for more than a year for Poland and Hungary, but have been ratified only by the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Luxembourg and Spain. Free-trading Germany has delayed; it is expected to ratify along with the Netherlands, Greece and Italy by August. France has legal problems, Portugal has translation difficulties, and Belgium has 'internal procedural problems'.</p>

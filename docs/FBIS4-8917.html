			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 19 Apr (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the republic of Srspka, said today that  Butrus-Ghali's letter to NATO would not help the peace process.  The letter unfortunately vindicates our decision to reexamine  our relations with the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR], Karadzic  said at a news conference in Pale, adding that the Serbian  soldiers need to know clearly whether UNPROFOR is an enemy or  not.    "We most seriously suggest to the United Nations that it  make  the security zones as secure as possible, demilitarize them, and  prevent the Muslims from attacking Serbian positions from the  protected zones. But, if they want to wage a war we will defend  ourselves in every possible way," Karadzic said.    Asked what he expects from Russia, Karadzic said he still  does not know whether Butrus-Ghali's letter will go through the  UN Security Council at all or not, nor what decision will be  passed. "In any case we rely on our own resources and we are  ready and convinced that we can defend ourselves," Karadzic  stressed.    Most questions related to the situation in and around  Gorazde.    Karadzic repeated several times that the Serbian forces will  not occupy the town center of Gorazde. "We could have done it,  but we want to make Gorazde a protected zone. This means that  it has to be demilitarized and that peacekeeping forces should  be deployed -- in order to separate the forces -- in a 3-km zone  on the left bank, which is the Muslim part," the RS president  said, adding that this could be implemented, as far as the Serbs  are concerned, as early as today.    "The left bank [of the Drina] is much more peaceful than  Muslim radio and their radio hams are reporting. They are  dramatizing the situation with the intention of provoking a  reaction by the international community, while at the same time  Muslim forces are attacking us on the right bank, launching  infantry attacks using boats," Karadzic said, adding that he is  receiving reports on the situation in Gorazde every hour. The  Muslims, however, do not want to stop firing, Karadzic added. He  said that he hopes that the Serbs will this evening establish a  cease-fire and that the Muslims will have to accept this. He  rejected accusations that the Serbs are to blame for the  "catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gorazde and the attacks  on civilian targets."    Representatives of international organizations in Gorazde  are  misinforming the public under pressure from the Muslim forces,  the RS president said, and pointed out that the state leadership  of the RS is maintaining contacts with Yasushi Akashi and the  political sector of UNPROFOR.    "We only want to protect ourselves against Muslim attacks  from the protected zones, and if the United Nations does not  want to do this, we will make Gorazde into a safe zone,"  Karadzic said.    Commenting on a statement made yesterday by Alija  Izetbegovic  that the Muslims would go for "everything or nothing," because  the Serbs had gone for everything or nothing and that they would  "gain nothing", Karadzic said:    "The Serbs most definitely did not go for nothing, but did  not go for everything either. We went for what is ours, to  defend our interests. If the Muslims decide to go for  everything or nothing, the international community must adopt an  attitude toward that."    Dwelling on a remark made by special Russian envoy Vitaliy  Churkin, Karadzic said that Churkin is a very good diplomat. "We  have recently been under the same pressure and I think that this  remark came as a result of an emotional reaction. I think we  can forget that," Karadzic said.</p>

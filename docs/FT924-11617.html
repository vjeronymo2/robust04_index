			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Tighter scrutiny required MOST international transfers of funds between banks will now have to carry details of who made the payment in accordance with a recommendation of Lord Justice Bingham aimed at limiting the scope for bank fraud and money laundering. Swift, the Brussels-based network that handles most electronic transfers of money between banks, has notified all banks that transfers will now have to specify at least the account number of the party making a payment. The reform is intended to obstruct both deliberate fraud by banks and money laundering through a circuit of bank accounts. It should enable regulators and auditors to trace suspicious payments back to their source. Payments through Swift have until now had only to specify the account number into which a payment should be made. Now, the name and address of the payer will have to be included along with an account number where possible. In the vast majority of cases, such details are already given to ensure a record is kept. However, BCCI was one case in which a fraudulent bank kept secret details of payments in order to make it more difficult to trace frauds. Banks customarily make such payments through correspondent banks in the relevant country that handle such transactions on their behalf. Until now, such banks may have been told no more about a payment than from which bank it originated. The Bank of England said yesterday that the Swift reform would tighten the regulation of money transfers. It has also written to the British banks using the Swift network, urging compliance with the new Swift requirements. A proposal for greater details of payments was made by Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditors. Mr John Hitchins, banking specialist partner, said the firm hoped the matter would be pursued by the Basle committee of bank supervisors.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   KwaZulu Land Transfer -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on  25 May publishes on page 16 an editorial examining the transfer  of land to Zulu King Zwelithini. While noting that President  Mandela has defused the crisis "for the time being," the  editorial claims that "disquieting questions remain. The  transfer has the hallmarks of a furtive pact and political  chicanery....Suspicions linger that Buthelezi was preparing a  fall-back position in case the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] lost  the provincial election in KwaZulu/Natal. By transferring land  held by the KwaZulu Government to Zwelithini, he seems to have  been securing an alternative IFP base."    Mandela's Speech -- In another editorial on the same page,  THE STAR describes President Nelson Mandela's speech to  Parliament on 24 May as "romantic" and "wonderfully unifying."  "It charted a possible course for the country which would  constitute a `high road' in anybody's terms. Stripped to its  essence, the president's message is that the middle classes of  this country will not only be allowed to continue in their  productive endeavours, but will be actively encouraged to do so  by the new Government -- on condition that there is full  acceptance of the urgent need for the upliftment of the  poverty-striken and disadvantaged." Noting that the ANC's  Reconstruction and Development Program has been endorsed by all  major role-players in South Africa, the editorial concludes: "In  a programme of sensible, achievable reconstruction and  development lies the future of all of us; if it fails, so will  we."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Mandela's Speech -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY also looks at  President Mandela's speech in its editorial on page 10 of its 25  May issue. The paper says Mandela presented "an inspired,  positive, and attainable vision of the future that together we  can create....His vision of our country's future displays an  idealism for which we all should strive." The editorial  continues: "We believe in Mandela's sincerity and in his  commitment to what he says....We trust the sincerity and  commitment of the party Mandela leads....While we would have  preferred specific commitments on issues such as the free flow  of money and people in and out of the country, we trust the  commitment to dealing with them sensitively once more pressing  issues have been addressed." The paper notes that Mandela's  speech recognized the need to reconcile the concerns of  investors and bankers with the demand that "economic and social  inequalities...be rectified quickly." The editorial concludes:  "The future will not be easy, and attaining the future  envisioned by Mandela implies commitment from everyone. We  cannot choose but to remain on the road we have taken. Along it  we can together create the great society."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Gun Control -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on May 25  publishes on page 10 an editorial that notes efforts being made  in the Pretoria, Witwatersrand, and Vereeniging provisional  parliament to strengthen gun control by revising licensing  procedures. "In general, we will support any effort to impose  gun control on a paranoid society which is `armed to the  teeth.'...While limitations on gun licensing is a step in the  right direction, a comprehensive plan is needed to make the  country relatively gun free." The paper urges that such a plan  take into account the need to improve policing so that citizens  will not feel the need to own a gun, the need to stop  individuals in government agencies from dealing illegally in  guns, and the need to stop the flow of guns from Mozambique and  other neighboring countries.</p>

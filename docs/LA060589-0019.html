			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR DODGERS, IT'S A LONG LOST WEEKEND;  </P> <P> IN 13 INNINGS, ASTROS FINISH 4-GAME SWEEP  </P> <P> The Dodgers all but fled Texas Sunday, headed for Atlanta, where today they'll  face what almost qualifies as a break in the schedule.  </P> <P> Only a doubleheader against the Braves awaits them.  </P> <P> After what the Houston Astros put them through over the weekend, the Dodgers  might look at two nine-inning games as a breather.  </P> <P> Of course, they're only scheduled for nine innings.  </P> <P> They could go longer.  </P> <P> "I'm just glad to be getting the hell out of here," Tim Belcher told reporters  in the Astrodome. "These guys could beat the '27 Yankees, the way they're  playing."  </P> <P> His reference was to the Astros, who overcame a six-run deficit to beat the  Dodgers, 7-6, on a 13th-inning sacrifice fly by Mike Scott.  </P> <P> The victory was the Astros' 10th straight, extending the longest such streak in  the major leagues this season and equaling a club record.  </P> <P> Among the victories were four straight over the Dodgers, including a 22-inning  marathon Saturday night that wasn't decided until Rafael Ramirez produced a  run-scoring single Sunday at 2:50 a.m., CST, ending the longest night game in  major league history after 7 hours 14 minutes.  </P> <P> Those who speculated that such a loss might send the Dodgers into an even  deeper tailspin -- they've lost six of seven -- were surprised when the Dodgers  scored five runs in the first inning Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> "Our mood was good all morning," said catcher Mike Scioscia, whose first career  grand slam was the inning's highlight. "It was good even when they came back  and tied the score."  </P> <P> Jeff Hamilton's run-scoring double made it 6-0 in the third.  </P> <P> So how did the Dodgers lose it?  </P> <P> The game turned on a disputed call in the fifth inning by first-base umpire  Paul Runge, who ruled that pinch-hitter Billy Hatcher, after grounding to first  baseman Eddie Murray, beat the throw from Murray to Belcher.  </P> <P> Television replays indicated that Hatcher was out.  </P> <P> "I didn't have to see the replay," Belcher said. "In my opinion, it wasn't even  close."  </P> <P> The disputed single scored a run, cutting the Astros' deficit to 6-1, and left  the bases loaded with one out.  </P> <P> More important, it seemed to leave Belcher unnerved.  </P> <P> The next batter, seldom-used Louie Meadows, launched a grand slam, his first  home run of the season, over the wall in right field.  </P> <P> "I'd be the first one in line to congratulate Louie Meadows for hitting the . .  . out of the ball," Belcher said, "but, in my opinion, the whole inning was set  up by a bad call at first base. If we get the correct call there, it's a  different inning.  </P> <P> "And if they don't bloop a couple, it's different."  </P> <P> Before the controversial call, Ramirez reached first on an infield single,  Craig Reynolds flared a single to shallow center and Craig Biggio walked.  </P> <P> If Hatcher had been called out, Belcher said, "I certainly wouldn't have given  in to (Meadows) and given him any fastballs even close. But the bases were  loaded and I fell behind, 2-0, in the count.  </P> <P> "And he beat me."  </P> <P> Even so, the Astros still trailed, 6-5, as they did with two out in the ninth  and Biggio at the plate to face reliever Jay Howell.  </P> <P> What happened next?  </P> <P> "I threw it and he hit it," Howell said.  </P> <P> It landed 390 feet away, beyond the left-field wall.  </P> <P> "That's about the size of it," Howell said.  </P> <P> The Dodgers managed only four hits after the third inning, but one of them was  a one-out triple by Chris Gwynn in the 12th.  </P> <P> Reynolds, the Astros' left fielder, then made a running catch on a looping fly  ball by Dave Anderson. Usually an infielder, Reynolds followed with a  one-bounce side-arm throw to the plate to nail Gwynn, who had tagged.  </P> <P> In the 13th, the Dodgers' Alejandro Pena walked Bill Doran, who stole second  and continued to third when catcher Rick Dempsey threw the ball into center  field. Pena then walked Ramirez and intentionally walked Reynolds before second  baseman Willie Randolph made a nice play, gloving a sharp grounder by Biggio  and throwing home for a force.  </P> <P> Scott, though, followed with a fly ball to center fielder Jose Gonzalez, whose  throw to the plate was too late to get Ramirez.  </P> <P> The Astros had their sweep.  </P> <P> "You can't say we lost these games here or we lost these games there," Scioscia  said. "You've got to give the Astros some credit."  </P> <P> Indeed, Jim Deshaies took a no-hitter into the eighth inning of the first game  of the series, a 7-2 Astro victory, and Scott pitched a four-hit shutout  Friday. And then the Astros survived two marathons.  </P> <P> They had a starting pitcher, making his first relief appearance, win a game  with a sacrifice fly. And an infielder make a key play in the outfield.  </P> <P> "We've had some breakdowns," Scioscia said, "but overall we've played good  baseball. We're starting to do the job offensively. We're moving runners along.  Now, we just have to get some hits with guys on base.  </P> <P> "Things will work out."  </P> <P> Escaping Texas, perhaps, will hasten the process.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Never before had a game at Houston included two grand slams. The expansion  Astros joined the National League in 1962. . . . Mike Scott worked the 13th  inning for the Astros to improve his record to 9-3. . . . Before Saturday, the  Dodgers were 17-3 in games in which they scored at least four runs. . . .  Mickey Hatcher, who strained his left hamstring while running from first base  to third in the first inning of Saturday night's game, was placed on the 15-day  disabled list by the Dodgers, who moved relief pitcher Ray Searage to the  21-day list. . . . Hatcher was replaced on the roster by pitcher Ramon  Martinez, who was recalled from the Dodgers' triple-A affiliate at Albuquerque,  N.M., where he was 8-1 with a 2.61 earned-run average and 88 strikeouts in 76  innings. Martinez will start the first game of today's doubleheader at Atlanta.  </P></p>

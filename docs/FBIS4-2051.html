			<p>BFN     [Text] On 14 March Deputy Gao Dezhan voiced his opinions  at the plenum sponsored by the municipal delegation to the  National People's Congress'[NPC] session, in which he said that  he totally supported the government work report given by Premier  Li Peng. The report is succinct in style, rich in content, and  profound in implications. It reflects the whole situation of  the work of party and country as a whole, conforms with the  reality of the entire country and Tianjin Municipality, mirrors  the desire of the vast number of people, and has an important  significance on further promoting the country's programs of  reform and opening up and the development of socialist  modernizations.    Gao Dezhan said: The people throughout the municipality  earnestly implemented the important speech of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping and the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress last year and  based on the past foundation scored vary great achievements in  reform, opening up, economic construction, and in the work of  various fields. Nineteen ninety four is a crucial year for us to  deepen the reform and to maintain a good trend of development in  the national economy and an important year for us to further  consolidate and develop the situation of stability and unity.  We must earnestly implement the spirit of the NPC session and  vigorously do a good job in conducting the municipal work  according to the principles of "seizing the opportunity,  deepening the reform, broadening the opening up, promoting the  development, and maintaining the stability," which constitute  the whole situation in the work of party and country as a whole.    Gao Dezhan said: To fulfill the tasks of this year and to  successfully conduct the local work in line with the spirit of  the government work report, we should further do a good job in  dealing with the following three problems relating to ideology  and concepts: First, we should firmly foster the concept of  whole situation. We should truly place the work of localities  and departments on the whole situation of the entire country's  work and take overall consideration in conducting work. Efforts  should be made to further discern the whole situation, to take  the whole situation into consideration, to abide by and serve  the whole situation, and to achieve in letting the partial  observe the whole. A good job should be done in concentrating  on the three events of reform, development, and stability.  Second, we should firmly foster the sense of opportunity. We  are facing a rarely historic opportunity as well as should  clearly discern the currently favorable international conditions  and the fine domestic situation; be good at seizing the  opportunity, treasuring it, and making good use of it; and  further enhance the sense of emergency and responsibility. We  should also double our efforts in work to promote the municipal  economy to achieve rapid and satisfactory development. Third,  we should further uphold the Marxist ideological line of  emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts. Efforts should  be made to uphold the integration between emancipating minds and  seeking truth from facts and not only to do as much as possible  but also to do what we are capable of in developing the economy.  We should uphold the principle of proceeding from reality in  doing everything, correctly analyze and judge the situation, and  vigorously upgrade our capability in having the situation well  in hand. Efforts should be made to work out practical measures,  to do practical deeds, and to seek substantial results.    Gao Dezhan said: In conducting the specific work, we should  emphatically and successfully grasp the following four aspects  in line with the arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee  and the State Council: First, we should foster new ideology and  work out new methods in developing the economy. Development  represents an essential criterion. By persistently regarding  the economic construction as a center, we should concentrate our  efforts on boosting the economy and maintaining the sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. The  development of sustaining, rapidity, and soundness are  dialectical unity. A growth we have to maintain should be  sustained, rapid, and sound. Therefore, it is imperative to  achieve unification between growth and economic returns. In  developing the economy, we should pay attention not only to the  increase of total supply and demand but also to upgrading the  quality of economic development and truly orient economic  development onto a track with the increase of economic results  as a center and onto a track of depending on scientific and  technological progress to upgrade the laborers' quality. We  should vigorously concentrate our efforts on readjusting the  structure, enhancing the management, making technical progress,  making up the deficits, increasing economic results and profits,  and upgrading the quality of staff members and workers, and make  a large breakthrough in these aspects. We should also seek  growth by upgrading the levels of business, management, and  technology and by increasing economic results. Second, a good  job should be done in grasping well the relations among reform,  development, and stability. Stability represents the premise of  reform and development and without a stable social environment,  we are in no position to do all things. Only by upholding  reform, opening up, and economic development can we  fundamentally maintain the stability. Development represents a  purpose; reform, a motive fore; and stability, a guarantee. All  of the three are an organic and unified entity, are mutually  linked, and help one another forward. Successfully grasping the  relations among the three is very important for us to  successfully conduct our work and fulfill various tasks this  year. We should also foster the thinking of depending on reform  to promote development, deepen the reform, and accelerate the  establishment of socialist market economic systems to promote  economic development. Meanwhile, great attention should be paid  to the issues concerning stability and to providing good social  and political environments for reform and development. Third,  we should persistently "take two-hand approach and be tough with  both hand" as well as achieve rapid development in the economy  and overall progress in the society. We should improve the work  in both economic construction and spiritual civilization to a  new level. Efforts should be made to strengthen the education on  patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; to expand the  pioneering spirit of the new historic period; to vigorously  develop the main melody; and to enhance the construction of  socialist democracy and legal systems as well as the  comprehensive management of public security. Great attention  should be paid to developing various social undertakings, and  maintaining the harmonious development between the economy and  society to promote the overall progress in the society. Fourth,  we should do a good job in dealing with the relation between  developing the economy and upgrading the people's lives and  persistently regard the "three advantages" as a fundamental  yardstick in measuring the work in various fields. We should  make all-out efforts to do practical deeds for the mass, adopt  every possible way and means to do practical deeds for  enterprises, and bring into play the enthusiasm of the broad  masses of cadres and people in building socialism. Efforts  should be made to vigorously develop socialist productive  forces, to reinforce the actual strength of the economy, and to  upgrade the people's lives. By persistently regarding as a  purpose the practice of serving the people wholeheartedly and  upholding the basic principle of "doing everything for the  people and relying on the people to do everything," we should  grasp the work of showing concern for the people's vital  interests and of improving the people's lives by regarding it as  a big event. We should also achieve in having the mass in  minds, doing everything for the mass, and doing our work by  relying on the mass. Enterprises are the foundation of the  economy and the mass is the basis of society. Specifically  speaking, concentrating our efforts on boosting the economy  means to boost the enterprises; particularly to invigorate the  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises; to improve the  people's lives; and to vigorously increase the incomes of staff  members, workers, and peasants.    Gao Dezhan said: Tasks we are facing this year are very  heavy. We must earnestly implement the arrangements made the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council. Units from top to  bottom throughout the municipality should be of one mind, unite  as one, rouse themselves for vigorous efforts to make the  municipality prosperous, work hard, and vigorously do a good job  in conducting the municipal work. Only by so doing can we live  up to the expectations of the CPC Central Committee, the State  Council, and the people throughout the municipality.</p>

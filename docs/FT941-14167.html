			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Observer: Boxing clever Mark Goryachev, a St Petersburg deputy whose main claim to fame hitherto had been for punching Vladimir Zhirinovsky in a canteen brawl, is planning a second, more sophisticated, assault. One of Russia's new entrepreneurs and true liberals, Goryachev is setting up a rival Liberal Democratic party that might be more worthy of the LDP handle. The neo-fascist party's disaffected regional workers are apparently a soft target not because of the impracticability of delivering on December's fantastic electoral promises - a husband for every single woman, accommodation for the homeless, etc - but because their leader has failed to dole out the expected ministerial posts and other sundry benefits.</p>

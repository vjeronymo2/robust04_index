			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by F.M. Mitenkov, V.S. Vostokov, V.N. Drozhkin and </F> O.B. Samoylov (OKBM [expansion not given]); received August  9,1992; UDC 621.039.577 182.3.003]    [Abstract] The urgency of developing projects of low  capacity AESs for remote regions is stressed. But first one must  solve a number of specific problems, such as reducing the cost  of power produced at these AESs and providing skilled personnel  for operating small AESs in remote regions. The first goal can  be achieved by simplifying the design (making it modular),  building the modules in a manufacturing plant and assembling  them on the AES site. To achieve the second goal the design must  permit prolonged AES operation in an automatic mode remotely  controlled from a center that serves several such AESs. The  article describes technical requirements to and schematic and  design solutions of elements of low-power AESs developed at the  OKBM. AESs built using these principles will meet requirements  of self-sufficiency and there will be no need for permanent  on-site presence of the operating personnel. Based on presented  information it is contended that low-power AESs can have  substantial technical and economic advantages over power sources  that use organic fuels. Figures 3, references 2.</p>

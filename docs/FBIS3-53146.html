The Civilian Committee met under Jamil al-Tarifi for the  Palestinian side and Jadi Zohar for the Israeli side. The  Security Committee met under Hasan 'Asfur for the Palestinian  side and General 'Uzi Dayan for the Israeli side.    Palestinian sources have said that all the issues regarding  the transfer of civilian authority to the Palestinian side,  including water, antiquities, land registration, and other  topics, could be finalized at this round of talks. Some 20 of  39 topics on the transfer of civilian authority to the  Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho area have been  finalized.    The Palestinian sources said the Security Committee will  discuss security details, not general topics, and that it is  hoped the Security Committee will make progress similar to the  progress made by the committee on the transfer of civilian  authority. The sources added that the Palestinian side wants  "access" to the Dead Sea so that the self-rule authority will  not feel it lives in a "ghetto" among the Israelis.    Palestinian sources have stated that the death of Israeli  General Nehemya Tamari in a helicopter crash near Jerusalem  might cause the talks to be suspended this evening. The sources  said General Tamari was a prominent figure in the Israeli army  and a personal friend of General Amon Shahaq and other Israeli  delegation members, who might want to attend his funeral  tomorrow.</p>

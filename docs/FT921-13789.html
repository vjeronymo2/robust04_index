			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Arabs may boycott Moscow peace talks ARAB states have been asked by the Palestine Liberation Organisation to review their decision to participate in multilateral Middle East peace talks due to be held in Moscow late this month. This follows a decision by Syria and Lebanon to boycott the talks, aimed at broadening the peace process to include all Middle East states, because of alleged Israeli intransigence. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, said in Tunis yesterday that Arab participation would be discussed in Morocco on Friday at an Arab League session. on Jerusalem. The US and the former Soviet Union, co-sponsors of the latest attempt to promote Middle East peace, believe a regional forum to discuss such issues as disarmament, water and the environment would promote confidence among participants, including Israel. Most Arab states, including those from the Gulf and North Africa, had agreed in principle to attend the Moscow session. Iraq and Libya are among the exceptions. Three rounds of bilateral talks between Israel and its immediate neighbours, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians, have yielded little progress since the meetings began in Madrid last November. The Palestinians have also been threatening to boycott the Moscow round in protest at US plans to provide up to Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in loan guarantees to Israel. Palestinian representatives claim the money will facilitate Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Egypt yesterday halted a planned 30 per cent price rise for butane gas cylinders, in a clear sign of government nervousness over the impact of policies inspired by the International Monetary Fund. The change of heart over gas, used for cooking and heating by most Egyptians, follows strikes against sharp rises in the cost of living. The decision also reflects government concern about public order in the light of Algerian developments.</p>

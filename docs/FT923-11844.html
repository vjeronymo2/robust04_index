			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Greene King pushes case to Morland holders GREENE KING, the Suffolk-based brewer, yesterday pressed its bid for Morland, its Thames Valley rival, with a reminder to its target's shareholders of the 'substantial financial benefits' available under the offer which closes on Friday. These include a threefold increase, from 11.2p to 33.75p, in gross annual income and a capital uplift of nearly 50 per cent, Greene King said. Mr Simon Redman, Greene King chairman, maintained that the offer - worth 484p in convertible preference shares or 450p cash - was generous. Greene King's share price has increased from 507p to 520p since it announced its offer. Over the same period, the regional brewers' index has fallen by more than 11 per cent and the FT-SE 100 has fallen by more than 10 per cent. 'This strong performance indicates that the stock market does not give any credence to what we consider to be the misdirected criticisms of Greene King and its management which Morland's board has been making,' Mr Redman added. Greene King said last week that it had control of 46.9 per cent of Morland's shares. Yesterday, however, SG Warburg, on behalf of Morland shareholders, lodged with Greene King notices of withdrawal in respect of 223,408 shares previously assented to the offer. They amount to 1.05 per cent of Morland's issued share capital and bring the number of withdrawals lodged since July 14 to 322,522 shares or 1.52 per cent of Morland's share capital.</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WAX WONDER: PLAN READY FOR LIFE OF CHRIST MUSEUM  </P> <P> In Christian circles, the Crystal Cathedral put Orange County on the map. A  flock of popular televangelists have helped spread the word.  </P> <P> And now a local amusement industry figure wants to build another kind of shrine  -- a wax museum that would depict the life of Jesus Christ.  </P> <P> Allen Parkinson, the founder of Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, wants to  convert an industrial building here into "The Life of Christ Historical Wax  Museum," along with a separate gallery featuring Latino history and a souvenir  shop.  </P> <P> "It's going to be a lot better than people imagine," said the 58-year-old  Parkinson, who also founded the Japanese Village and Deer Park in Buena Park.  Movieland is still open but the Japanese Village has closed.  </P> <P> At this point, however, it may take a few miracles to raise the roof.  </P> <P> First, there's the matter of money. Parkinson said that, since issuing a  prospectus for limited partnership two months ago, he has raised only about  $100,000 of the $6 million he needs.  </P> <P> Then there's the location. Parkinson said that while he has a building picked  out on Kraemer Boulevard, he does not plan to try to lease it until he raises  the financing.  </P> <P> Lastly, there is his last project -- which created controversy and never got  off the ground. Two years ago, he proposed a "War and Peace Wax Museum,"  including a section on the life of Christ. That wax gallery would have  displayed Nazi military leaders of World War II, scenes of Adolf Hitler's  suicide and a concentration camp complete with a soundtrack of moans of dying  Jews. Parkinson dropped plans for the museum after local Jewish leaders  objected.  </P> <P> But Parkinson, who sold Movieland and the Japanese Village to Six Flags in  1970, dismisses the non-believers and is convinced that the Life of Christ wax  museum is a winner.  </P> <P> Featuring almost 350 figures, the new attraction would be the largest wax  museum in the world, he said. While the Life of Christ wax figures will be  stationary, he said the project will include such special effects as water  changing into wine, a thunder and lightning storm, and the sight of Jesus  walking on water.  </P> <P> Parkinson emphasizes that the new museum will be an historical account of the  life of Christ, rather than religious. He said he plans to make it  nonsectarian.  </P> <P> Parkinson said he has put 250 figures for the museum in storage until he can  raise enough money by selling limited partnerships to go ahead with the  project. With the money in hand, he said he can open the museum in six to seven  months.  </P> <P> He said the Kraemer Boulevard site is centrally located near the Orange and  Riverside freeways, about 20 minutes from Disneyland. While Movieland draws  almost entirely from tourists nowadays, Parkinson said that with the new museum  he would try to appeal to locals as well.  </P> <P> Asked about the market for such a museum, Parkinson said the churches are  filled on Sundays and the Crystal Cathedral, the massive, glass-walled church  built by the Rev. Robert H. Schuller in Garden Grove, packs its pews with  hundreds of thousands who turn out for the annual Christmas and Easter series  of shows at $10 to $25 a ticket.  </P> <P> "Very few people know the life of Christ," said Parkinson, a non-practicing  Mormon who said he is developing the museum for investment purposes rather than  out of any religious conviction. "I don't think anyone knows the chronological  life of Christ."  </P> <P> To help them along, Parkinson said he plans to sell "The Book of Scenes" in the  gift shop that describes each of the 58 wax scenes at the museum. The book, he  said, would be easier to read and understand than the Bible.  </P> <P> The gift shop itself would be something of a showplace, he said, with  chandeliers and marble floors.  </P> <P> For his latest undertaking, Parkinson said he hopes to capitalize on the Latino  market by building the Latin Historical Wax Museum adjoining the Life of Christ  galleries. He said that museum would be advertised in the Spanish media only  and would feature figures ranging from Mexican hero Benito Juarez to Our Lady  of Guadalupe.  </P> <P> Movieland owner Ronald M. Fong said he admires Parkinson's fertile imagination  and added that he does not believe a Life of Christ museum would cut into  Movieland's patronage.  </P> <P> "I think it is two completely different markets," he said. "Some people want to  see movie stars and others want to see religious (figures)."  </P> <P> He said he believes the Life of Christ museum could be successful. "It's the  closest thing to being in church without being in church," he said.  </P></p>

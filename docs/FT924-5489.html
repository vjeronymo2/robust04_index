			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Reduction in bad debts provides boost at Marston MARSTON, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the Burton-on-Trent brewer, increased interim profits by 44 per cent to Pounds 10.1m, helped by a reduction of Pounds 2.47m in exceptional charges. At the same stage last year a pre-tax profit of Pounds 7m was achieved after a Pounds 2.3m provision for bad debts. This time there was no such charge. Trading profit for the six months to September 26 rose 5 per cent to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 9.89m) on turnover 9 per cent higher at Pounds 63.2m (Pounds 58.1m). Interest charges fell from Pounds 310,000 to Pounds 180,000. Earnings per share expanded to 7.7p (5.27p) and the interim dividend is increased to 1.45p (1.34p). Mr Michael Hurdle, chairman, said the results were 'grounds for cautious optimism.' But he added: 'The market is a tough one, characterised by reticence on the part of consumers and aggression on the part of competitors.' Overall beer sales volume increased marginally, against a 1 per cent fall in the market. Marketing expenditure was doubled. Pedigree draught and Low C packaged beer gained from reciprocal distribution deals with several national and regional brewers. Sales through Marston's 671 tenanted pubs fell but there was a 29 per cent increase in both liquor and food sales in the 185 managed houses. Most of the Pounds 7m capital expenditure during the six months was on refurbishments. Net borrowings amounted to Pounds 15.5m, 6.9 per cent of shareholders' funds.</p>

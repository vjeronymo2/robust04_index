			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "Squeeze Put on Drug Addiction in Yunnan"] </F>   [Text] Southwest China's Yunnan province has made marked  achievements in its narcotics control and rehabilitation of drug  addicts.    One of the prominent accomplishments is the reduced number  of  drug addicts, a news release from the Public Security Ministry  said yesterday.    Yunnan, which borders the notorious drug-trafficking "golden  triangle" and has been used as a passageway by drug traffickers,  previously had a large drug-addict population.    However, due to the province's expanded rehabilitation  efforts, the number of addicts was reduced to 40,000 by the end  of last year--a drop of 30 percent from 1990.    And the ranks of new addicts have been kept to 2,000 during  each of the past three years. But before 1990, about five times  as many new addicts became hooked each year.    Yunnan's drug addicts account for 16 percent of the total  addict population in China.    Presently, more than 700 counties in 17 provinces,  autonomous  regions and municipalities have a problem with drug addiction.  Growing numbers of addicts are particularly noted in Sichuan,  Guizhou, Gansu, Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, statistics from  the Public Health Ministry show.    To curb this increasing crime, China reorganized its  high-level National Narcotics Control Commission last July to  guide the overall effort.    The news release attributed Yunnan's achievements to the  province's increased investment in its battle against drug  offences and in law enforcement.    The province began to tighten its narcotics control in 1990.  In the past two years, the State government and Yunnan  provincial government have poured 16 million yuan (1.8 million)  into renovating and setting up 28 rehabilitation centres.    More than 20,000 drug users receive treatment at these  correction centres each year. The approach consists of medical  treatment combined with tough social supervision.    As a result, 10 percent of treated addicts have completely  overcome their addiction.</p>

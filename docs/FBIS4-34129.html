			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 15 June.    The Salvadoran Coffee Council, CSC, reported that coffee  exports during the past eight months had surpassed $120.2  million. According to the CSC, this amount corresponds to  1,031,735 sacks of coffee, each weighing 69 kgs, exported from  10 October 1993 to 13 June 1994. It is part of the 1993-94  coffee harvest period. Receiving countries include Germany,  Belgium, Canada, Spain, Finland, France, Holland, Hong Kong, the  UK, Italy, Japan, Norway, Portugal and the United States. CSC  Executive Director Ruben Ernesto Pinto stated the current coffee  harvest, despite being less than the 1992-93 period, will result  in greater revenues for the country because of rising prices in  the international markets. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1838  GMT 14 Jun 94)    According to recent official figures, during the past two  years El Salvador recorded average annual GDP growth rates of at  least 5 percent and has become one of the Latin American  countries with the highest growth rate. After the signing of  the January 1992 peace agreement between the government and the  guerrillas which brought an end to the 12-year-old internal  conflict, El Salvador implemented a process of political  stabilization that reverberated in the country's economic  growth. GDP, which in 1989 was merely 1.1 percent, increased to  5.1 percent in 1992, and by 1993 real economic growth was 5.0  percent. According to Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador, BCR,  figures, GDP recorded growth rates during the first two months  of the year totalled 7.2 percent. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in  Spanish 2343 GMT 8 Jun 94)    Recent official figures indicate that currency mailed by  Salvadorans living overseas, mainly in the United States, to  their relatives in El Salvador surpassed export revenues by  $152.3 million during 1993. A BCR spokesman pointed out that  during 1993, currency mailed to relatives totalled $884 million,  while export revenues amounted to $731.7 million. During the  first quarter of the current year, revenue originating from  Salvadorans living in the United States has so far totalled  $223.2 million.

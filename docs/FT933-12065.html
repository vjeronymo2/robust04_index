			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / UN general issues order to retaliate: Fury at Serb attack on French UNITED NATIONS military commanders yesterday denounced a Serb bombardment of their forces in Sarajevo as cowardly and threatened to retaliate if they came under attack again, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. Lieutenant-General Francis Briquemont, commander of UN troops in Bosnia, said his men had been 'maliciously' targeted by Serb gunners on Sunday. 'That is the last time that we restrain ourselves from exercising our right to self-defence,' he told a news briefing. The artillery attack, in which French UN peacekeeping troops escaped injury but several armoured vehicles were severely damaged, came just hours after a ceasefire was supposed to go into effect. French General Jean Cot, who commands all UN troops in former Yugoslavia, arrived in Sarajevo to visit the scene of the attack at the Zetra stadium, used in the 1984 Winter Olympics, and said he fully supported Gen Briquemont's stand. 'It is probably the most serious and the most cowardly attack (on UN forces) since the start of this unfortunate affair,' he said.' It is clear. . . . the attack came from a Serb unit.' The French troops who had come under attack had not been able to respond, but action had been taken to enable them to retaliate in future, said Gen Cot. He declined to give details. Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, denied his forces were responsible, accusing the Moslems of doing it to undermine peace talks due to start in Geneva today. A spokesman for Unprofor, the UN Protection Force, said Serb officers were expected to visit the stadium to take part in a UN investigation. They would be shown from analysis of the shell craters that only their forces could have been responsible. Nato has assembled a force of 60 combat aircraft in Italy, which are ready to back up UN troops in Bosnia if they are attacked while protecting 'safe areas' for Moslems. Sarajevo is one of six UN designated havens.</p>

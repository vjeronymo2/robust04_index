			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER;  </P> <P> STREET CLOSURE OKD FOR SHOPPING CENTER  </P> <P> The Whittier City Council voted 3 to 2 Tuesday night to provide the developer  of a more than $20-million redevelopment project with a quarter-mile portion of  magnolia Avenue north of Whittier Boulevard.  </P> <P> Slow-growth advocates Helen McKenna-Rahder and Bob Henderson voted against the  measure.  </P> <P> Closing part of Magnolia, a popular north-south shortcut, remains an essential  feature of the proposed shopping center, designed by Urbatec of Encino. The  city's Redevelopment Agency had already approved the site plan.  </P> <P> The road abandonement " is an inconvenience," said Mayor Thomas K. Sawyer.  "There's no question of that. But it would be extremely difficult not to go  ahead with this project."  </P> <P> At the hearing Tuesday, Urbatec's proposed 16-acre shopping center drew nearly  as much criticism s the road closure from more than a dozen residents who  addressed a standing-room-only crowd of about 130.  </P> <P> A handful of residents living on Magnolia argued for the closure, saying it  would make the street safer and quieter.  </P></p>

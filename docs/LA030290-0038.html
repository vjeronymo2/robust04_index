			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DIVISION IV BASKETBALL PREVIEWS;  </P> <P> GIRLS  </P> <P> When Holtville and Coronado meet at noon for the girls' Division IV  championship, they will be much different teams than those that met in  November.  </P> <P> In the second game of the season in the Coronado Tournament, Coronado (14-10)  held as much as a 10-point lead before losing by five.  </P> <P> "I start three different kids than I did then, and he starts two," Coronado  Coach Ernie Dickerson said. "Looking back on that game, it doesn't mean a whole  lot."  </P> <P> The teams played for the Division IV championship in each of the past two  years, with Holtville (17-9) winning both.  </P> <P> Holtville Coach Mike Pacheco said the change to Golden Hall from the Sports  Arena -- where his team has played in section finals the past four years --  could be a "key factor" for Coronado.  </P> <P> "His kids are so young that if we were playing in the Sports Arena, it could  make a difference," Pacheco said. "Nobody's been at Golden Hall, so there's no  home-court advantage."  </P> <P> The two only varsity returners for Coronado are Mary Strasser and Kelly Kaye.  Strasser, a left-handed shooter who started as a freshman last year, has a  15.5-point average but has averaged 18 the past six games.  </P> <P> Holtville is led by Teresa Ibarra, a 5-1 senior point guard who is averaging 12  points a game.

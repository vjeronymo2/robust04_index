			<p>BFN     [Text] To date, 50 percent of all the tactical nuclear  warheads brought to Russia from the territory of CIS countries  in Central Asia, the Transcaucasus, Belarus, and Ukraine have  been dismantled, our correspondent was told by Vitaliy Yakovlev,  a Defense Ministry spokesman. Within the next few months Russia  will begin measures to withdraw land-based and air-based  strategic nuclear missiles from the territory of Kazakhstan.  The compensation mechanism, he said, has still to be agreed.  [indistinct passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / BBC prepares to trim fat from Choice cuts: The corporation's search for greater efficiency THE BBC is soon likely to modify its controversial new Producer Choice policy, which allows producers to buy in services from outside the corporation. Mr Michael Starks, who is in charge of implementing Producer Choice, concedes that changes will have to be made. 'I think we have got too many business units,' he says. Under the scheme more than 400 separate business units have been set up to trade with each other, both inside the corporation and with the outside world. They are all expected to break even or give a good reason why money is being lost. The progress of the scheme, which was introduced across the BBC on April 1, will be reviewed at the end of its first three months - the review was always part of the original plan. Mr Starks suggests that another area needing attention is the number of individual transactions, and the associated paperwork, conducted between the business units. He believes that the number of units could be reduced and replaced by more annual service agreements between departments. Some staff say that in trying to mimic the marketplace, one form of bureaucracy is being replaced by another. Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the broadcasting union, said yesterday that the Producer Choice costing system was unable to cope with all the data being generated, despite a low volume of programme-making. A number of lighting, scaffolding and make-up contractors had not been paid since April. 'We are not waiting to see if it (Producer Choice) goes wrong. We are waiting to see what the BBC does when it goes wrong,' Mr Lennon said. But Mr Starks says that, overall, Producer Choice is working as expected. Before its introduction, departments had to slim down for the expected lower demand from BBC producers. The volume of work that has gone outside the BBC, Mr Starks points out, has been in line with forecasts - 10 per cent to 15 per cent on average across all departments. Mr Bob Phillis, the BBC deputy director-general who is also responsible for bringing the back-up resource departments together into a single new directorate, also admits that modifications to Producer Choice will be necessary. 'It is going to take a period of settling down, of refinement, of sensible modification in the light of experience,' he says. But he insists that Producer Choice has heightened awareness of the need for proper financial controls within the BBC. Producer Choice's supporters argue that, in spite of the disruption and the loss of several thousands jobs, the system is vital because for the first time there is a measure of the true costs of BBC programmes and their competitiveness. Accountability and cost-effectiveness are central to the BBC's case to the government for the renewal of its Royal Charter in 1996. Critics fear that Producer Choice's complexity makes keeping track of BBC finances more difficult. There are also complaints about bureaucracy. The BBC earlier this year announced moves to curb bureaucracy in the future, and detailed a number of internal reviews into areas such as programme strategy and the creation of performance indicators. Mr Phillis rejects criticisms that one form of bureaucracy has replaced another: 'Nothing I am involved with is increasing bureaucracy. What I am involved in is trying to get on with the task of effectively running this organisation and disbanding as many task forces, work groups, project teams as expeditiously as possible once they have completed the tasks they were set to do.' Much rides on increasing efficiency and devoting a higher proportion of the Pounds 1.5bn licence-fee income to programmes. The government plans to produce a white paper on the BBC's future at 'the turn of the year' and one thing is clear: although it displays little of the hostility to the BBC exhibited by the previous prime minister, and a radical restructuring of the corporation seems unlikely, vigorous downward pressure will almost certainly be applied to the Pounds 83-a-year licence fee.</p>

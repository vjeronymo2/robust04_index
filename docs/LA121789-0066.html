			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRACK COCAINE TRAFFICKING  </P> <P> The lesson couldn't have been clearer: One item in The Times reports that  Richard V. Winrow, a black and ghetto-bred 22-year-old man, was sentenced to  prison for life for dealing a small amount of cocaine (Part A, Dec. 7).  </P> <P> The other item reports the hardly remarkable fact that large American companies  have been profiting handsomely from the sale of millions of gallons of  specialized chemicals vital to the making of the cocaine found in Winrow's  possession (Part A, Dec. 5). The chemicals, it is reported, are shipped openly  from Houston to Colombia in amounts far exceeding any legitimate need.  </P> <P> The tragic irony is that Winrow loses his freedom forever; the corporate heads  probably get a bonus for improving the bottom line.  </P> <P> It might logically be said both are businessmen; as one company is said to have  retorted: If we don't supply it, they'll only get it somewhere else. Indeed!  Winrow could not have said it better.  </P> <P> MARK MILLER  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

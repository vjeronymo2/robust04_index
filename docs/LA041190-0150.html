			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> DELAY VISIT, KING MICHAEL ASKED  </P> <P> The government of Romania, citing the threat of demonstrations, asked ex-King  Michael today to postpone his first visit since he was dethroned in 1947.  </P> <P> But a Bucharest aide to the 68-year-old former monarch said he still plans to  arrive from his home in Switzerland as scheduled Thursday.  </P> <P> "For the moment, the king is not giving up his visit," the aide said after the  ex-monarch's advance party told him by telephone that the government had asked  him to stay away until after elections May 20.  </P> <P> "He still intends to come," the aide said. "Officially, he thanks the  government for its concern and he feels he has no reason not to come."  </P> <P> Ex-King Michael will be the first monarch deposed by Communists in Eastern  Europe after World War II to return to his homeland since Communist rule began  to crumble last year.  </P> <P> The interim government made its appeal after several opposition politicians  said the former king's visit might spark demonstrations and inflame election  passions.  </P></p>

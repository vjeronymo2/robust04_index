			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Night News" program] </F>   [Text] On the eve of the International Anti-Drug Day on 26  June, various localities have taken actions to severely punish  numerous drug traffickers and have openly destroyed large  quantities of drugs, fully demonstrating their resolve to crack  down on drug trafficking. The following are reports from some  localities:    News from Sichuan today says, from January to May this year,  the Sichuan provincial police cracked more than 500 drug  trafficking cases, captured more than 700 drug traffickers, and  seized nearly 50 kg of heroin, 13 kg of opium, and some other  drugs. The province recently openly burned the seized drugs and  severely punished a number of drug traffickers, of whom 14  criminals have been executed.    It has been learned that, over the last few years, because  the anti-drug efforts have been stepped up in Yunnan, Guangzhou,  and other localities, blocking the original drug trafficking  channels, some drug traffickers have turned to Sichuan, making  Sichuan a new transfer point and distribution center for transit  drugs.

Sentences were handed down on 29 criminals, of  whom 10 -- whose death sentences had been approved by the  Supreme People's Court -- were executed after their death  sentences were announced. Four of the 10 criminals executed were  from Taiwan.

In another development, Shaanxi Province recently held  rallies in Xian, Yulin, Weinan, and Xianyang, to announce the  court rulings on 11 drug processing and trafficking cases.  Among the 51 sentenced drug traffickers, 13 were sentenced to  death and subsequently executed, eight were sentenced to death  with temporary suspension of execution, and 11 were sentenced to  life imprisonment. It has been learned that this action was the  most extensive Shaanxi has taken since the liberation of the  country in cracking down on drug trafficking.

News from Shenzhen says Shenzhen and other  localities will hold open trials tomorrow -- the International  Anti-Drug Day -- to try some drug traffickers.

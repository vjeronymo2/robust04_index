			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Offer for KIO's Spanish assets withdrawn A Dollars 2.5bn offer for the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) industrial and property assets in Spain has been withdrawn by Mr Javier de la Rosa, KIO's former Spanish partner, with both sides yesterday blaming each other for the collapse of the proposed deal. Mr de la Rosa made his offer in a faxed letter to the Kuwaiti finance minister on July 15 and asked for an indication of interest within the following 10 days. A spokesman for the Catalan financier said yesterday the offer had been withdrawn on Monday, 12 days after the fax had been sent. Individuals close to the KIO last night confirmed that the offer had been received. 'A fax was received on July 15 containing a highly conditional offer from an unnamed group of Spanish companies and financial institutions to purchase Grupo Torras,' they said. Grupo Torras is the KIO holding company in Spain. 'This fax was received from Mr Javier de la Rosa who identified himself as a minor investor in such a group. 'Due to the conditional nature of the contents of the fax and the need to finalise the offer, an adviser to the KIO contacted Mr de La Rosa requesting a confirmatory copy and discussed tentative arrangements for a meeting to be held earlier this week to clarify the seriousness of the offer. The confirmatory copy was not received and prior to any meetings a fax was received on July 27 from Mr de la Rosa withdrawing the offer.' Mr de la Rosa's spokesman said it had become clear during the 10-day period that the KIO was continuing negotiations started by Mr de la Rosa before leaving Grupo Torras in June, to sell off a large part of Ercros, the Torras chemicals business, to Freeport MacMaRon of the US. Thus the offer could not stand after the 10-day grace period as without the Ercros businesses, the KIO assets in Spain would have been fundamentally altered, the spokesman said.</p>

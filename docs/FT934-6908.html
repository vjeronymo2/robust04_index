			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Chill winds blow through hill farm incomes The wind is bitter at the top of Mynydd Caerau where Mr Richard Howells is herding sheep. Mr Howells is at the sharp end of farming, trying to make a living on the steep, shale-strewn Welsh hills. Next week he faces cuts in government support which helps to keep three generations of his family tending 2,500 sheep and 50 cows on the hills above Port Talbot. About half of Mr Howells' income comes from the taxpayer - the bulk from Brussels and the rest from the UK government in the form of the Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowance. It is this second part that farmers fear will be cut when Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, makes a statement expected on Budget day. Mrs Shephard argues that hill farmers like Mr Howells have seen large increases of up to 40 per cent in their income over the past year following rises in Brussels payments and the devaluation of sterling. But Mr Howells says he makes little more than the Welsh farmer's average of Pounds 7,000 a year out of his 1,800-acre farm, although he does employ his son and one other full-time worker as well as his 80-year-old father. The National Farmers' Union reckons that the overall real incomes of hill farmers have just clawed their way back to the levels of 1988. 'It seems that just as you manage to make a step forward, you are cut back,' says Mr Howells. 'I've been investing in the farm for the first time in several years by putting lime on the fields, which I should do every year, and I won't be able to afford to do that if the support is cut.' The government has little discretion over its Pounds 2.4bn agricultural spending as most of it is dictated by the European Union. But the Treasury has set its sights on the Pounds 130m support to 50,000 farmers in upland areas. The livestock allowance was cut by more than Pounds 2 per sheep last year to Pounds 6.50 per ewe. But it can still make the difference between profit and loss for many hill farmers. Farm groups warn that cuts in income support are turning people away from the land, particularly in poor upland areas where there are no other jobs. 'We're talking about the confidence to remain on the land in these poorer areas,' stresses Mr Tim Bennett, a North Wales hill farmer who represents producers in less favoured areas at the NFU. 'The average age of the hill farmer is over 50 and the government is showing it has no long-term commitment to these communities.' A study by the University of Wales at Aberystwyth shows that about 250 jobs in rural supply industries depend on every 100 farmworkers. It estimates that for every Pounds 10,000 generated on a hill sheep farm, a further Pounds 20,000 is earned in the local economy. The NFU also points to the benefits of attracting tourists to upland areas such as the Lake District. But should the taxpayer continue to fund Mr Howells as a guardian of the landscape when all the mines in his valley were closed 15 years ago? Hill farmers stress that they make a valuable contribution to UK agriculture, providing over 60 per cent of strong breeding stock which is sold to more profitable lowland farms. 'I regard the subsidy to these areas as an investment,' says Mr Howells. His income does not look like going up much this year as increases in Brussels payments and a slight rise in cattle prices have been offset by a drop of around Pounds 5 per sheep in lamb sales and a collapse in wool prices. Hill farming is not an enviable way of life. Mr Howells' day of hard manual labour often starts at 5am and ends 14 hours later. He would like to be free of government support, but realises he never will be. Still, he says: 'I was born here; I think most farmers will stay as long as it's possible.'</p>

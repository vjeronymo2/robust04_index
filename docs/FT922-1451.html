			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Paris blockade threatened A SPLINTER group of protesting French farmers, Coordination Rurale (CR), yesterday pledged to go ahead with its blockade of Paris from the early hours of this morning, despite government warnings, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The group, formed late last year in protest against the growing moderation of the main farmers' unions, plans to set up around 20 tractor road blocks at strategic points between 30km and 50km from the centre of the capital. They are angry at last month's European Community agreement to reform agriculture policy by cutting prices and compensating farmers with direct aid. Mr Jacques Laigneau, the CR's president, said the roadblocks would stay until the farm reforms were withdrawn or until the organisation judged it opportune. The signs are that the disruption will be limited, since the CR is in no mood to confront the police after a warning by Mr Paul Quiles, the interior minister, that the demonstration will not be permitted to impede traffic. Mr Raymond Girardi, a CR leader, said yesterday that the organisation had ordered demonstrators to avoid violence. The main farming union, the FNSEA, is also unhappy with EC reforms, but accepts that they cannot be abandoned and so prefers to negotiate.</p>

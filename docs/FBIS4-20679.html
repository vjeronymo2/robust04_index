In order to discuss feasibility on pervaporation as  wastewater treatment process and influence of impurities in  waste flow to membrane performance, sorption experiments and  pervaporation experiments were carried out with phenol-water  binary solution and real industrial wastewater.    As the result of these investigations, PEBA membrane showed  substantial potentiality for application of phenol contained  wastewater treatment, subject that the wastewater should be  purified to the required quality by vacuum distillation or other  appropriate pretreatment.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   Wastewater discharged from phenolic resin process contains  5-10 percent phenol and several substances. Removal of phenols,  which is difficult to resolve by conventional biological water  treatment process, is usually achieved by liquid-liquid  extraction. In this method, use of extraction solvent, i.e.,  methylisobutylketone (MIBK) might be undesirable in respect to  environmental pollution, energy saving, running cost, etc.    An alternative way is dilution with water up to the  concentration level enable to resolve phenols with biological  treatment. This way is required for not only huge amount of  water but also wide area for wastewater treatment system, i.e.,  activated sludge tank, sedimentation tank, etc.    Pervaporation is known as effective process for separation  of  organic aqueous solution in chemical industry, for example,  dehydration of organic solvent, particularly formed azeotropics,  with hydrophilic membrane and recovery of organics from water  with hydrophobic membrane. The latter case has proposed some  possibilities for recovery of organics included in wastewater.    It is reported by Boddeker et al. that polyether block amide  (PEBA) offers significant potential for phenol selective  membrane material. The property of membrane for real wastewater  treatment is to keep high flux, high selectivity and durability  for the time required. By utilizing pervaporation with PEBA  membrane, depletion of phenol concentration in effluents from  phenolic resin process, shown in Table 1, is discussed and  compared with the case of binary solution.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Experimental </H5>   Sorption Experiments    In pervaporation process, separation factor is affected by  preferential absorption of one of the components of feed liquid  to the membrane.    It seems that to investigate sorption of phenols and other  components to PEBA membrane is instrumental in evaluating  pervaporation performance.    Small pieces of PEBA membrane (abt. 2 cm x 4 cm), which were  dried in vacuum drier until no weight decrease was observed,  were immersed in the sample liquid bottled in flask. After  sorption equilibrium was achieved (abt. 72 hrs after immersion  started) the membrane was picked up, blotted with tissues and  putted in to vacuum evaporator. Weight and composition of liquid  collected from membrane by vacuum evaporation were measured.  Phenol-water binary solution and real wastewater were employed  as sample liquid. Temperature was varied in binary solution  experiment on 3 levels (30C, 50C and 70C). In  case of real wastewater, temperature was kept at 50C. In  order to observe transition of absorption volume, reiteration of  above sorption procedure were executed both with binary solution  and real wastewater respectively.    Pervaporation Experiments    Pervaporation experiments were conducted by batch type glass  cell test apparatus shown in Figure 1. The effective membrane  area was 21.05 cm[.sup]2[/]. The pressure at downstream side  was kept below 1 torr and feed temperature was at 50C.  Composition of permeate and feed mixture were analyzed by gas  chromatograph and absorptiometry.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-37A>      Figure 1. Pervaporation Celltest Unit </FIG>     Total flux, phenol flux and selectivity are measured with  phenol-water binary and real wastewater. To investigate membrane  durability, the time required for reduction of phenol  concentration from 5 percent to 300 ppm were measured in  reiterative trials.  <H5>  3. Results and Discussions </H5>   Sorption Experiments    The results of sorption isotherms of phenol-water binary  solution are given in Figure 2. In this figure, sorption  quantity of phenol and water into the membrane was given as a  function of the feed concentration. The sorption of phenols was  proportionally linear up with increasing phenol concentration.  In low phenol concentration range (below 1 percent), water  sorption was constant. However in more than 1-2 percent phenol,  water sorption was enhanced with increasing phenol  concentration. With increasing temperature, increase in both  water and phenol sorption were observed. This shows that with  increasing phenol concentration in feed, PEBA membrane  preferably adsorbed more phenol and became gradually swollen. In  more than 1-2 percent phenol, the swelling of membrane made its  structure loose enough to permeate water into it.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-38A>      Figure 2. Sorption Isotherms of Phenol and Water in PEBA Membrane </FIG>     The results of the sorption reiteration with wastewater and  binary solution are illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 respectively.  Ratio of weight changes of dried membranes before and after  immersion was defined as degree of swelling which was indicated  by black circle in these figures. Sorbed phenol conc. symbolized  X in these figures, means phenol concentration of the liquid  collected from sorbed membrane. In spite of concentration of  phenol sorption in wastewater was lower than that in binary  solution, the degree of swelling in real wastewater was higher  than that in binary solution. This may be attributed to several  substances such as methanol and formaldehydes contained in  wastewater.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-38B>      Figure 3. Relative Rate of Phenol Sorption From Waste Water by PEBA Membrane </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-39A>      Figure 4. Relative Rate of Phenol Sorption From 5 wt% </FIG>     As far as two months' continuous experiments, it seemed that  degree of swelling of membrane was stable for both solutions.    Pervaporation Experiments    The pervaporation results with real wastewater is shown in  Figure 5, where phenol flux is symbolized as black circle, water  flux as black square and separation factor as black triangle.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-39B>      Figure 5. PEBA Membrane Performance </FIG>     Compared with test results of binary solution, which are  represented by the full lines in Figure 5, both flux and  selectivity in wastewater are less than half. These data with  consideration of sorption experiments, suggest that methanol,  formaldehydes of other substances contained in wastewater might  make membrane swollen. Furthermore, low phenol polymers included  in wastewater accumulated on the membrane and hinder to pass  through membrane. Thus, it resulted in lower membrane  performance.    Figure 6 shows results of reiteration test with same  membrane. In twice trial with binary solution, about 120 hrs  each were required for depletion of phenol concentration less  than 300 ppm. Then, twice trial with real wastewater were made.  In first trial, it took about 240 hrs and in second run, phenol  concentration could not reach less than 1121 ppm even after 309  hrs operation. On the membrane surface used in this trial,  reddish brown-color colloidal accumulates were observed.  Therefore, we tried to devise appropriate pretreatment. As the  most reliable way to remove these accumulative materials, vacuum  distillation was adopted as pretreatment of wastewater.  Condition of vacuum distillation were 100 Torr as operation  pressure and at 50C as feed temperature.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-40A>      Figure 6. Aging Test of PEBA Membrane With Real Feed </FIG>     Square marks in Figure 6 indicate pervaporation data with  wastewater after vacuum distillation. Phenol concentration could  be decreased from 5 percent to less than 300 ppm in about 200  hrs. Some results were obtained in successive eight runs. It  shows that vacuum distillation would be effective as  pretreatment.  <H5>  4. Conclusions </H5>   Through these experimental results, the following findings  were obtained:    1) Using PEBA membrane, phenol concentration in water could  be reduced from 5 percent up to less than 300 ppm, which was the  concentration enable to resolve by conventional biological water  treatment system.    2) Due to some substances contained in wastewater from  industrial phenolic resin process, membrane performance was  decreased.    3) According to sorption experiments, some substances in  wastewater other than phenol caused swelling of membrane.    4) Vacuum distillation is effective as pretreatment for  removal of harmful substances in wastewater.  <H5>  5.

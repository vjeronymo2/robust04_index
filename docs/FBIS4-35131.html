			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno; from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas has  described recent announcements by President Rafael Caldera as  pronouncements of sovereign measures to reestablish Venezuela's  financial system and to recover confidence.    Burelli Rivas said that these measures do not harm  Venezuela's image abroad and that instead, they signify the new  way of governing the country with authority within the framework  of the Constitution. He rejected the possibility that the  measures are in any way contrary to the interests of foreign  investors.    The foreign minister said that the measures have not alarmed  foreigners because similar situations have occurred in other  countries. He said the economic measures have produced  expectations rather than concern about whether they will affect  bilateral or multilateral agreements. The foreign minister said  the suspension of some economic guarantees would have no effect  unless they were accompanied by the suspension of some  constitutional guarantees.    [Begin Burelli Rivas recording] The damage caused in the  finance and banking system and the struggle against drug  trafficking requires that the state should be able to arrest  people, search for people, or prevent certain people from  leaving the country quickly, without having to wait for a judge  to issue an arrest warrant.    The economic measures alone would have served no purpose had  they not been accompanied by the suspension of guarantees on  free travel throughout the territory, departure from the  country, transit in general, and the possibility of raiding the  businesses of people supected of being involved in  drugtrafficking activities.    This is the reason for the suspension of guarantees. [end  recording]</p>

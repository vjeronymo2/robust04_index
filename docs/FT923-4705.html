			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Government faces up to training shake-up: Lisa Wood looks at pressures on Gillian Shephard as she shapes the future of schemes for jobless people MR MIKE O'REILLY, director of human resources at Wimpey, one of Britain's biggest construction companies, believes the government should hurry up and decide what it wants from its training scheme for the long term unemployed. He believes the scheme - Employment Training - is not creating the skilled workers that Wimpey needs, partly because of the restrictions on who is eligible. He is planning a campaign, supported by other building company training executives, to persuade the government to extend the scheme to all unemployed people. Such a campaign is timely. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, will today begin receiving submissions to her wide-ranging review of government programmes for the adult unemployed. Under review is ET itself, Employment Action, the benefit plus temporary work scheme for the long-term unemployed, and Job Clubs, which the government claims is a cost-effective way of getting people back to work. Just how radical the review is will emerge over the next couple of months, with Mrs Shephard likely to be constrained by political and financial pressures. She will face calls from Tory backbenchers who want to follow the US example of Workfare under which only those long-term unemployed undertaking community work receive benefit. Civil servants have given Workfare a lukewarm response, not least because it would be extremely difficult to run sufficient schemes to mop up the large numbers of people eligible. It is understood that the government has similarly been backing off the proposal to cut the entitlement to unemployment benefit from one year to six months. Providers of training hope that the review will concentrate on quality, to equip the UK for any upturn in the economy. But the Department of Employment - like others in Whitehall - is likely to be subject to funding cuts in the current Public Expenditure Survey. ET will be the most vulnerable scheme because the other main training programme, Youth Training, the scheme for those aged 16 to 18, carries a guarantee of a place to all who want one. It is politically sensitive for the gov-ernment that this is met. ET carries no such formal guarantee. As important is the fact that ET is criticised as ripe for reform. Started in 1988, before the recession, its clients are mainly low-skill individuals of whom 47 per cent are inner-city residents who worked in the old manufacturing industries. About 104,000 people are doing ET in England and Wales. The scheme's record is poor. Of those completing schemes only 36 per cent go into jobs or self employment or full-time training and about 30 per cent get a qualification. ET is viewed by many of its clients as a government device to get them off the unemployment register, while many training providers claim they are unable to give quality training because the Pounds 800m-a-year scheme is underfunded. The Unemployment Unit, a research organisation, said that while job entry rates could be explained partly by the weakness of regional employment conditions, qualification rates reflected the poor quality of the training people were receiving. The 82 Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in England and Wales, which administer government funded training schemes, want a freer hand in who they can train on ET. In their submission to Mrs Shephard they are expected to point to a range of alternatives, such as varying periods of training for different groups depending on their needs. Short intensive courses could assist skilled individuals recently made unemployed. More disadvantaged people could have longer training than at present. Last week G10, the group of 10 Tec chairmen who represent the views of Tecs to government, made it clear that further cuts to their training budgets were unacceptable. It is likely, however, that if asked to make funding choices they would opt to have fewer people trained but to a higher quality. Mr Stuart Bishell, managing director of Astra Training, which took over the former government Skillcentres and which is the largest provider of ET training, said: 'We want the focus of government spending on training to be on those people who are most likely to benefit from it most rapidly.' Such a move is being considered by the Department of Employment. Mrs Shephard could argue that in return for cash constraints the Treasury should allow Tecs greater freedom of choice and allow her department to negotiate targets. Tecs for example could be paid varying amounts for training different groups. But the Treasury wants the existing rules on ET eligibility tightened, not relaxed. At present Tecs are only allowed to put other groups on ET after satisfying demand from the long-term unemployed. Another option being considered by the government is to expand Employment Action. EA, set up a year ago, is cheaper than ET but has not been a great success. At present about 23,000 out of 30,000 places are filled. Whether this scheme could be expanded without some element of compulsion is debatable. Tecs would certainly like greater ability to mix and match programmes to meet the needs of their catchment areas - but not if that means less funding for training. It is a demand that government will find hard to meet.</p>

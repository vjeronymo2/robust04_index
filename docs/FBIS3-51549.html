			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani has said the cut in U.S.  aid will not affect adversely the nation's development, because  the country's economy started to pick up late last year.    Earlier this week the country learned that the U.S.  Government would possibly cut its economic aid to El Salvador by  60 percent for the present year--from $230 million down to $94  million.    President Alfredo Cristiani has said in this regard that the  reduction will not affect adversely the country's development,  because the economy has improved.    [Begin Cristiani recording] The country has shown an  economic  improvement, meaning it is capable of sustaining a decrease in  aid so that we can stand on our own. I believe it is the final  objective, because we cannot live off of foreign donations. [end  recording]    We learned on Thursday that UN Human Rights expert (Pedro  Nicken) had certain difficulties in entering the country, but  President Cristiani has denied his entry had been disallowed.  Cristiani has said the UN official may draft his report when he  wishes.    [Begin Cristiani recording] He may come here whenever he  wants. He can visit the country and see for himself. I believe  he will take a look at Onusal's [UN Observers for El Salvador]  reports before drafting his own report. [end recording]    President Cristiani inaugurated on Thursday a soft-drink  processing plant, which will operate in the area of Soyapango,  at a cost of 75 million colons. Its high technology will lead  to better methods of quality control.</p>

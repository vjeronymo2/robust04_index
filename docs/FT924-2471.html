			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / US prices rise 0.2% CONSUMER prices in the US rose a slim 0.2 per cent in November as steady food prices and a moderating trend restrained a sharp jump in energy prices, Reuter reports from Washington. The Labour Department said yesterday the rise in the consumer price index followed an unexpectedly high 0.4 per cent gain in October. Meanwhile retail sales rose modestly last month as the holiday sales season opened, the Commerce Department said. A 0.4 per cent gain in November followed a sharply revised 1.9 per cent jump in October sales - the strongest monthly increase since a 2.3 per cent rise in January. Previously, the department said October sales were up 0.9 per cent. Economists had expected that sales would rise only 0.1 per cent last month. Retail chains indicate sales since Thanksgiving have been stronger than in the past few years.</p>

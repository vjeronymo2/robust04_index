			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Japan's annual corporate  earnings season set in Friday [20 May], with the number of  companies releasing their earnings for the latest business year  ended March 31 peaking at around 250.    The companies make up about 20 percent of Japanese companies  closing their books on March 31.    The so-called Kabutocho Press Club within the Tokyo Stock  Exchange was packed like a morning commuter train with reporters  and corporate financial officers for earnings announcements.    The effects of the prolonged recession were reflected in the  results, with many companies reporting, "sales went down because  of the recession," or "the high yen cut into profits."    Until now, some 350 companies have announced their results  for their latest business year, showing a decline of some 6  percent in combined sales and a fall of some 14 percent in  combined pretax profits from year-earlier levels.    "If steel and auto companies which announce their results  next week are added up, pretax profits will go down further,  probably by more than 20 percent," an economist at a private  think tank said.</p>

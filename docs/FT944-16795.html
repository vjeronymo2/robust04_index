			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Violence increases in Guatemala Violence and human right abuses in Guatemala have increased greatly in recent months, despite the imminent arrival of a UN human rights monitoring mission, observers say. Fighting has been intensified between government forces and left-wing guerrillas of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, who are due to restart stalled peace talks this month. Mr Ronald Ochaeta, director of the Catholic Church's local human rights office, says there were 180 killings in August, at least 35 of them politically motivated, making it the worst month since the office opened five years ago. The UN mission is expected to begin operating early next month, more than seven months after the two sides signed an agreement calling for the immediate installation of such a mission. The UN, which is mediating at the talks, had promised a mission in three months, but has dragged its feet, citing bureaucratic problems in approving finance. Diplomats say that UN officials have been reluctant to commit themselves to a mission while there was still armed conflict, despite making promises at the negotiating table. 'We have to question the UN seriously,' said Mr Ochaeta. 'To a certain extent, the UN is responsible for what is happening at the moment.' The guerrillas announced in early August that they were suspending talks because the government had failed to comply with the human rights accord signed at the end of March. In that, the government agreed that the army would stop pressing indigenous youths into its ranks, cease threats against popular leaders and human rights activists, and try to reduce the levels of violence. But local human rights monitors say they have many complaints of forced recruitment in recent months, while threats and violence have continued unabated. The guerrillas have also violated the agreement, recruiting under-age people and attacking civilian installations. The guerrillas were pushed by the international community into signing an agreement in Oslo in June on setting up a commission to investigate war crimes during the 33-year conflict. The commission's mandate falls short of naming individuals who have committed atrocities, and will have no legal recourse.</p>

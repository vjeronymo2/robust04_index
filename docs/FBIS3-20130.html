			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua by </F> announcer Etienne Leenhardt and journalist Albert Du Roy -- live]    [Text] [Leenhardt] In spite of the fact that it is quite  late, we are live with the interior minister, who is still at  the ministry. Good evening Mr. Pasqua.    [Pasqua] Good evening.    [Leenhardt] Mr. Pasqua, you were delighted after the first  round of the cantonal elections. Are you as happy this evening?    [Pasqua] Listen, the election results must be taken as they  come. One can see that the parliamentary majority has had good  results. As far as seats go, the votes were better distributed  among the Left than within the parliamentary majority. Besides,  the candidates of the National Front prevented the winning of  some seats. Therefore, as we said earlier on, there has been a  change in the majority in some departments.    [Leenhardt] Albert Du Roy.    [Du Roy] Yes. Charles Pasqua, you hoped -- the majority  hoped -- to get a victory in more departments than is the case.  How do you explain ...    [Pasqua, interrupting] Mr. Du Roy, you know in how many  general/councils we already have a majority, don't you?    [Du Roy] 75?    [Pasqua] Yes. Listen, we are in a democracy. One cannot  hope to have 100. Besides, it is obvious that it would have  been attempting the impossible to think that the Socialist Party  would disappear in some departments where it has been deeply  rooted for a long time. We are not the ones who said that we  hoped to win such or such a department. The observers did. Of  course, we would be happy if we had won them.    [Du Roy] The second round took place today. For you, is this  vote mainly local or national?    [Pasqua] I believe that it is first and foremost a local  vote, but one cannot ignore its national aspect. I am not  giving you a noncommittal answer, I am only saying that it is  obvious that the cantonal elections are first and foremost local  elections. Some of this evening's results confirm this.  Moreover, mobilization has been more successful with left-wing  voters, insofar as they have heard and heard again that the  majority was threatened in some departments. This is why they  mobilized more. I would like people to see things as they are.  This evening, as far as seats are concerned -- although we do  not have all the results, since we are still without the results  in 32 cantons -- may I say that the great victors are the  parties close to the majority and those close to the opposition.    [Du Roy] Let us now go beyond the cantonal elections.  Earlier on, the chairman of the French Democratic Union, Valery  Giscard d'Estaing, said that one of the messages of the vote was  that the government had to speed up reforms. Do you agree with  him?    [Pasqua] Yes. However, for the government to speed up  reforms, it would be necessary for those who -- or at least,  this is what I think -- support the government to do so and to  leave it to its work.    [Leenhardt] Thank you very much, Mr. Pasqua. You were  speaking live from the Interior Ministry.</p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MCKINNEY TAKES A STEP ON THE COMEBACK TRAIL  </P> <P> When you see 12-21-1 listed next to a boxer's name, you know he's either a very  bad boxer or someone inadvertently listed the guy's gym locker combination in  the program.  </P> <P> In the case of Jorge Rodriguez of Bell, however, neither was true. He did lug  that incredibly bad record into the ring on Tuesday night at the Country Club  in Reseda. But shockingly, he was not a bad fighter.  </P> <P> He merely was not as good as Kennedy McKinney.  </P> <P> McKinney, the 1988 Olympic gold medalist as a bantamweight before his pro  career was shelved for a year because of a drug addiction, pounded out a  unanimous eight-round decision over Rodriguez in the main event.  </P> <P> The fight had no stirring moments. It had no memorable moments. What it did  have was McKinney, 126 1/2 pounds, consistently beating Rodriguez, 129, to the  punch and scoring a shutout, winning every round.  </P> <P> McKinney is 10-0-1.  </P> <P> In the most exciting bout of the night, Joey De Grandis of Boston, now living  in Los Angeles and being trained and managed by the Ten Goose Boxing Club of  Van Nuys, scored a unanimous four-round decision over Jason Burrel of Corona in  a super middleweight bout.  </P> <P> De Grandis, making his pro debut after winning the New England Golden Gloves  championship twice, pounded Burrel with heavy punches in every round, but  Burrel responded with his own heavy punches and the two often stood toe-to-toe,  tagging each other with thudding blows.  </P> <P> In another wild bout, David Kamau of Kenya, now living in Los Angeles, improved  his record to 6-0 by stopping Alan McMasters of Los Angeles 49 seconds into the  fourth round.  </P> <P> In other bouts, Larry Loy, 128, of Van Nuys, scored a four-round unanimous  decision over Mark Jenkins, 125, of San Diego. Loy is 2-0. Also, Derrick Ryles,  222, of Huntington Beach scored a four-round split decision over 255-pound  William Morris of Ontario and Eddie Cook, 118, of Las Vegas ran his record to  6-0 by stopping Francisco Peralta of Bell in the third round.  </P></p>

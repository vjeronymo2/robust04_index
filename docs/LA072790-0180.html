			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> JUDAS PRIEST TRIAL HEARS MD  </P> <P> A young man who entered into a suicide pact after listening to hours of the  albums of the rock group Judas Priest believed that the music influenced his  actions, a psychiatrist testified today.  </P> <P> Dr. Bruce Tanenbaum said that James Vance "didn't care if he ever got a dime  from the lawsuit" against Judas Priest and CBS Records.  </P> <P> Vance, who survived for three years after blowing away his face, "felt other  people needed to be aware of the dangers" of the music, said Tanenbaum as the  trial ended its second week.  </P> <P> Vance, who was than 20, and his friend Raymond Belknap, then 18, took a shotgun  after listening to hours of the record "Stained Class," drinking beer and  smoking marijuana on Dec. 23, 1985. Belknap shot himself and died instantly.  Vance shot himself, but survived until he died from complications of the wounds  and prescription drugs in November, 1988.  </P> <P> The families claim that subliminal messages on the record telling the young men  "Do it" are responsible for the suicide. They are seeking damages that have not  yet been specified except for the more than $400,000 in medical bills for  Vance.  </P></p>

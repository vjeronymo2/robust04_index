			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- The U.S. clamor about  war preparations of the Korean People's Army is a lie, said John  M. Swomley, executive director of the American Committee on  Korea, after visiting Panmunjom at the head of a delegation of  the committee.    Noting that propaganda against the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea is going on unabated in the United States, he  said Americans are not well informed about the existence of the  concrete wall dividing Korea into North and South.    He contended that the United States should pull its forces  and nuclear weapons out of South Korea, saying the U.S. Forces  have not withdrawn from South Korea still today when the "Cold  War" has come to an end.</p>

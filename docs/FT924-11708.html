			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Crown Comms suspended as bank talks start Shares in Crown Communications, owner of the LBC radio station, were suspended at 6p yesterday after the company entered talks with its banks about a refinancing. The company is seeking to convert a large amount of its net borrowings of about Pounds 15m into equity. 'We are looking at a combination of a number of things, part of which would be debt conversion,' said Mr David Whitaker, finance director. Crown has been in financial trouble for some time, and reported losses of Pounds 5.58m in the six months to March 31, on top of losses of Pounds 6.79m in the previous year. The company has been disposing of non-core assets. LBC, which lost Pounds 300,000 in the half year, is set to at least break even this month, said Mr Whitaker. Share suspensions and talk of refinancings are often the last options when banks are threatening to withdraw support. But Crown's advisers remained optimistic. The Radio Authority, the commercial radio watchdog, said Crown's situation was being monitored but LBC could continue to broadcast as long as it complied with its licence and paid its licence fee. LBC's licence is due to expire at the end of 1994 and will be re-advertised from March next year. Crown is also waiting to hear if a new set of proposals to sell some of its stake in a loss-making French radio network have been approved by the French authorities. Earlier proposals to sell some of the stake were rejected. Crown is now seeking to reduce its effective stake from 49 per cent to 19 per cent. Mr Alain Ayache, a controversial right-of-centre magazine publisher, is believed to be buying some of the shares.</p>

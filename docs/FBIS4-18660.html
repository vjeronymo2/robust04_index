			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanover (ADN-Wirtschaftsdienst-Ost) -- The German  Government evidently intends to make it easier to export high  technology to the former East Bloc states. The HANNOVERSCHE  ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG reports that following the end of Cocom  [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls], the  German Economics Ministry is currently looking into simplifying  procedures for export permits. It will be possible in future to  receive multiple export permits. Businesses would then only  have to register their exports in retrospect.    Until now export procedures for high-performance computers  or  machine tools, for example, sometimes took over a year. Cocom,  the agency responsible for this, was disbanded on 1 April. The  Cocom list, specifying high technology items that were seen as  sensitive in security policy terms and could thus not be sold to  the former communist states, is thus no longer valid either. A  special ruling had previously been needed for each individual  transaction.    The Cocom states -- Japan, Australia, and all NATO states  except Iceland -- have resolved to continue using the list as a  basis for their decisions. The German Government wants to  follow the United States in utilizing the new scope for  maneuver, according to the paper. The new regulations will not,  however, make arms exports any easier.</p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Germans press for European bank to be sited in Frankfurt THE Bundesbank has launched a strong appeal to EC governments to site the future European central bank in Frankfurt. It says such a decision would help establish the institution's anti-inflationary credentials and persuade a sceptical German public to give up the D-Mark in favour of monetary union. Mr Otmar Issing, one of the five top directors of the German central bank, said in an interview: 'In no other country . . . is the surrender of its own currency so deeply felt as in Germany'. The country would have to press on with its efforts to cut inflation before moving on to European monetary union. The central bank would start afresh, Mr Issing said. It was important that it began in a period of stability. 'This can't be achieved if the D-Mark is weak and German inflation is at 4 per cent.' A fierce debate has begun in Germany over monetary union and a joint currency since the Maastricht summit in December Mr Issing's comments represent the Bundesbank's most forthright intervention to date over the location of the European central bank (ECB), also sought by London, Amsterdam, and other cities. They mark a quickening of the debate as the decision looms on a site for the proposed European Monetary Institute, the organisation paving the way for the central bank and whose location is expected to determine where the bank goes. They also show that the Bundesbank, along with commercial bankers and the Bonn government, is treating the ECB's location as a question of popular confidence in Emu throughout the Community. 'One shouldn't underestimate the importance of psychology,' Mr Issing said. 'Stability is regarded as being at one with the D-Mark and Frankfurt. We see a decision for Frankfurt against this background. 'The conditions for a European currency which is as stable as the D-Mark will not just be fulfilled by the (ECB) statute, which largely follows the Bundesbank model, but will also be backed up by people across Europe saying 'this must be done in Frankfurt'.'

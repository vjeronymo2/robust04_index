			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux report: ``Armed Forces: 613.1 </F> Billion Francs Over Six Years'']    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The aim is for France  (represented by a head of state and a prime minister who have  not been elected on the same program and who do not refer to the  same ideology) to maintain its world ranking as second largest  Western military power. France wishes to maintain its autonomy  of intervention wherever its interests are at stake. At the  same time, it wishes to be the driving force in the building of  a European defense.    Edouard Balladur and [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard are  determined to carry through this programming law without waiting  for [the presidential election in] 1995. Some people in the RPR  [Rally for the Republic] and UDF [Union for French Democracy]  had suggested to postpone the exercise until after the  presidential election. The prime minister did not follow this  expedient advice. Precisely because of the importance which he  personally attaches to defense and security questions, it is he  who decided on an increase of 0.5 percent, contrary to the aims  of the law on controlling public spending.    The method adopted consisted of giving preference to what is  reasonable over what is spectacular and adopting an attitude of  great caution. It is in 1997 that we will see whether it is  financially possible to launch several new programs like the  future large transport plane, the second nuclear aircraft  carrier, the NH-90 helicopter, the future sea-to-sea missile...    Between now and then, efforts will be made to successfully  complete the major programs already started: the new generation  of missile-launching nuclear submarines (Triomphant and  Temeraire, due to come into service in 1996 and 1998); the  Leclerc tank (310 will be supplied in the year 2000); the  nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle; and the  Navy's Rafale plane (operational in 1999); the Tigre helicopter  (first deliveries in the year 2001); the Air Force Rafale from  the year 2001-2002 (with a delay of one year mainly due to  technological problems).    The only major program which will be launched as soon as the  law comes into force is the development of the ATPGD (Precision  Weapon Fired over a Long Distance) missile. What is it?  Although the concept has virtually been defined, the program  has not yet been finally decided. It will be a cruise missile  of the Tomahawk type, in other words subsonic like the Apache,  or supersonic like the medium-range air-to-surface missile,  capable of covering between 500 and 1,000 km and reaching its  target with an accuracy of approximately 1 meter. Its warhead  would be exclusively conventional.    The austerity requirement called for a further reduction in  the nuclear deterrence effort. Nuclear funds, which, less than  10 years ago, formed almost one-third of the Armed Forces'  equipment budget, have already fallen below 25 percent and will  fall further until they only account for one-fifth of Section V.  In six years, 134 billion francs [Fr] will nonetheless be  devoted to it, of which Fr10 billion will be just for the Palen  simulation program intended to reduce the number of nuclear  tests. These tests are not mentioned much in the bill.  Everybody knows that the subject is taboo until the  presidential election in May 1995, although all the necessary  steps have been taken to resume them without delay.    With regard to manning levels, the draft programming law  continues the reduction started over recent years, but with much  less brutality. Leotard is not Joxe. The general staffs have  been consulted, and fairly broadly heeded. In all, 42,100 jobs  will be eliminated in six years, of which 25,700 will be  conscripts, 12,800 civilians, and 3,600 regular soldiers.  However, 11,700 new jobs will be created which results in a  figure of 30,400 job losses.    The Army will lose 16,872 jobs; although it is to gain 5,801  in regular soldiers, it is to lose 19,185 conscripts and 3,500  civilians. In the year 2000, it will have 227,000 men (the Joxe  plan made provision for 225,000 in 1997). It will keep eight  out of the nine divisions it has now and the 13 it still had in  1990.    The Navy will lose 2,461 jobs: 2,161 conscripts and 500  civilians. It will gain 200 regular posts. In the year 2000,  it will have 68,441 men (compared with 70,902 today).    The Air Force will lose 6,098 jobs: 1,628 will be regular  Air Force personnel; 4,100 conscripts; and 370 civilians. In  the year 2000, it will have fallen from 94,869 to 88,771 men.    The gendarmerie is the only branch of the Armed Forces to  see  its manning levels increase. It is to gain 750 men in its  regular force, 1,000 conscripts, and 226 civilians. And it will  thus become the second largest branch of the Armed Forces with  95,000 men (as against 93,024 in 1994).    The 11,700 jobs created will relate to intelligence (500  civilians), professionalization (8,200 of which 7,000 will be  engaged by the Army), the gendarmerie (almost 2,000 posts  created), officers (382 naval officers, 123 petty officers, and  500 armaments engineers).    This bill must now be submitted to the Assemblies. The  deputies will debate it on 24 May and the senators in June. It  is not customary for it to generate amendments. However,  Edouard Balladur and Francois Leotard are prepared for a broad  debate, even outside Parliament. They are fairly calm. They  think it likely that criticisms will be expressed in the ranks  of the majority. Some will think that too much is being spent  on defense. Others will say that they would have liked a more  generous law making it possible to launch new programs (for  instance in the antimissile sphere) and at the same time to  satisfy all the industrial sectors of defense and to maintain  their 330,000 jobs. But, when it comes to the vote, there  should be broad agreement.</p>

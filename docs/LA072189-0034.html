			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: ARTIST SHOWS CHANDLER IMITATORS HOW TO BOIL HARD  </P> <P> As a fan of good/bad writing, I step aside this a.m. for the winning entry in  the Raymond Chandler parody contest sponsored by the Friends of the La Jolla  Library.  </P> <P> It was submitted by free-lance artist Spencer C. Clemmer:  </P> <P>  The lazy waves rolled over like a sleeping fat man. I looked east and saw the  tip of an orange sun struggling to rise up and start the day.  </P> <P>  I sat in my car and wondered how I could be admiring such a view in a town as  seedy as Bay City. It was a long day of saps and gats in the hands of not so  nice people. A day I would like to forget. Then I remembered a bottle in my  desk drawer at my office and began to drive with a goal in mind.  </P> <P>  I always leave the reception area unlocked so a client can wait if I'm not  there. This particular morning there was a particular type of client waiting.  Beautiful, if you like that type and my type usually does.  </P> <P>  "Are you Mr. Marlowe?" the oversized lips asked. I guess now days they call a  mouth sensual if it is that voluptuous.  </P> <P>  "Yes, but I've had a very long night that wasn't quite up to my standards, so  would you mind coming back tomorrow?"  </P> <P>  "I was recommended to go to a fellow named Sam Spade."  </P> <P>  "Come right in," I growled.  </P> <P>  "Why should I come to you instead of him?" she teased.  </P> <P>  "He can't turn a phrase quite like I can."  </P> <P>  She stood up and followed me into my office. She had one of those shapes that  would make a priest reconsider his vows. The curves of her figure reminded me  of the number eight. I motioned to a chair and the number sat down.  </P> <P>  She mentioned something about the decor.  </P> <P>  "You can always try a prettier agency."  </P> <P>  "I don't think I like your attitude, Mr. Marlowe."  </P> <P>  "Yeah. But don't worry it's just on loan. Tomorrow I take it back and get a  new one." I had a feeling that once again I was in for another long day.  </P> <P>  Clemmer, 21, who lives in Golden Hill, picked up his $500 prize Thursday night  at a special screening of "The Big Sleep." A writing instructor at UC San Diego  was second ($250), an aerospace worker from Hermosa Beach was third ($150).  </P> <P> Clemmer, a painter and a designer of logos and fancy T-shirts, says he came to  Chandler by way of Bogart movies and the novels of James M. Cain and Dashiell  Hammett.  </P> <P> "When I read Chandler I knew he was more poetic than the others," Clemmer said.  </P> <P> The La Jolla Library feels the same way. Its celebration of Chandler, who died  in La Jolla in 1959, continues this weekend with a round-table discussion,  dramatic reading and fund-raising dinner.  </P> <P> The food, naturally, will be hard-boiled.  </P> <P> Take a Whack at Chewing  </P> <P> Update: The Humane Society of San Diego has finished its investigation of the  clash between Vada Stevens' dogs and an SDG&amp;E meter reader without finding  any evidence to contradict the meter reader.  </P> <P> Lt. Jim Baker says meter reader Joe Cordeiro declined to answer questions and  instead relayed his answers through an SDG&amp;E attorney. Cordeiro's assertion  that the three dogs attacked him is plausible and there were no other  witnesses, Baker says.  </P> <P> Still, Cordeiro was "counseled" that next time he should use the  company-authorized aluminum stick less as a weapon than as a diversion, letting  the dogs chew on the rubber ball at the end of the stick rather than using it  to whack the animals.  </P> <P> Endangered Animals  </P> <P> These are tough times for mercantile animals in North County.  </P> <P> The Two Goats sign at a chic clothing store of the same name in Rancho Santa Fe  has been debolted and spirited away. Its cost is only put at $100, but the  store owners assign a much higher sentimental value.  </P> <P> The goat sign theft followed the disappearance of the 7-foot-tall fiberglass  hen atop the Country Store in Carlsbad and a ceramic pig outside a liquor store  on Highway 101. The hen was discovered in Oceanside, but the pig is still  missing.  </P> <P> A large stuffed bear on the sidewalk of a toy store in Encinitas has been  chained down for its own safety.  </P></p>

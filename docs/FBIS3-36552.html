			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- Vasyl Katko, deputy chairman of the Ukraine  State Committee for the use of Nuclear Power, commenting on 4  February on the decision by the Supreme Council regarding the  further fate of Ukrainian nuclear missiles at the request of a  UNIAN correspondent, observed that "the Russian fuel produced  from Ukrainian missiles with nuclear warheads could be  inaccessible for Ukrainian nuclear power stations." He noted  that according to the agreement with Russia, only the uranium  due to Ukraine will be free of charge for it [Ukraine], which  comes to approximately 25-30 percent of the fuel content of  nuclear power stations. "But if one is to take into account the  fact that Russia in fact increases the price of fuel by 40-50  percent every quarter, then one cannot talk about free Russian  fuel for Ukraine," the deputy chairman of the State Committee  for the use of Nuclear Power is convinced. "Even if Russia  sells the fuel produced from our uranium at a cheaper price,  Ukrainian atomic power stations will hardly be able to acquire  it in sufficient quantities, because nuclear power stations are  currently in dire financial straits."</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Japanese second-tier brokers still suffering SIX of Japan's 10 second-tier stockbrokers remained in the red in the first six months of the current fiscal year. Daily average trading value for the six months to September rose 58 per cent on the Tokyo stock exchange to Y408bn (Dollars 3.77bn). However, trading has been dominated by institutional investor,s and some smaller brokers which rely heavily on retail commissions did not benefit from the increase in trading activity. Cost-cutting and a rise in brokerage commissions and bond trading profits helped New Japan Securities, Kokusai Securities, Wako Securities, and Tokyo Securities return to the black. Kokusai posted the largest pre-tax profit of Y4.7bn, against a pre-tax loss of Y7.2bn the previous year. Pre-tax losses at the remaining six ranged from Y894m at Yamatane Securities to Y5.3bn at Kankaku Securities. On an after-tax basis, Cosmo Securities posted the largest loss of Y72bn as it wrote off losses stemming from its 'tobashi' deals, or manipulating investors' lossmaking accounts. Sanyo saw a pre-tax loss of Y5bn, while Okasan posted a pre-tax loss of Y1.4bn. Yamatane posted a loss of Y269m.</p>

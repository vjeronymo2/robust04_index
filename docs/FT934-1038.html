			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (4): Time to tighten belts - Unemployment The rapid return of mass unemployment to Sweden over the past three years has come as a profound shock to a country that has not known lengthy dole queues since the Great Depression of the early 1930s. Last month, 357,000 Swedes were registered without a job; some 8.4 per cent of the workforce. Total employment has dropped by as much as 9 per cent since the start of the recession at the end of 1990. All the forecasts - both official and independent - suggest it will be at least the second half of next year before the jobless total stops growing. But there is no prospect of any radical improvement in labour market conditions for the foreseeable future. However, the country's comprehensive and well-funded labour market programmes of training and placement are expected to keep the actual level of open unemployment down below the European Union average. Last month, as many as 220,000 Swedes were covered by those measures; 5.1 per cent of the workforce. The government's existing plans provide for a total of 400,000 people being offered a job or training and education in the current financial year. The Swedish Labour Market Board, in its recently published forecasts for the rest of the century, suggests the combined total number of unemployed and those on a labour market scheme will still amount to more than 11 per cent of the workforce. Such a grim outlook is regarded as unacceptable to many Swedes. Even during the recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the country was able to avoid soaring unemployment unlike much of the rest of the western industrialised world. However, Sweden's policy-makers accept privately that it will be very difficult to restore 'full' employment. 'Work for all' used to be the inspiring slogan that successive Swedish governments carried out in practice. But not even the most committed of Social Democrats can really guarantee delivering such an objective. Mr Bildt's government insists that 'In the long term there is no other way to increase employment in Sweden than by pursuing a policy which helps to strengthen and maintain the country in a competitive position and sustainable low inflation and thus lower interest rates'. Ministers rule out monetary and fiscal expansion to cut unemployment. Instead, they emphasise the need for structural changes in the labour market by making it easier for employers to hire and fire; the removal of rules and regulations that they see as obstacles to job creation; and moderation in wage demands. Few in Sweden believe the country can reverse the current spiralling trend of joblessness on its own and there is a widespread acceptance that its employment prospects depend on the development of a wider European strategy. Mr Allan Larsson, the former Social Democratic finance minister, presented an interesting commissioned paper on employment earlier this month in Brussels that won the approval of all the European Social Democrats, including the British Labour party. In flavour and substance it is not far removed from the policy document presented by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, at this month's EU summit. The emphasis is on the need to combine competitiveness with solidarity. In the past, Sweden's Social Democrats used the country's public sector as the main engine for job creation. But Mr Larsson's document rules out any further expansion there. Instead, the emphasis is on creating economic conditions which will enable medium and small-sized private entrepreneurs to hire workers while training and vocational training are given a prominent place in the jobs strategy. Mr Larsson's approach calls for 'a strategy of investment-led growth' as 'the only fair and sustainable route to sound public finances'. It seems unlikely - unless there is a dramatic surge to the left in the German federal elections next December - that Mr Larsson's strategy will be practised by EU member state governments. But it may be used by the left-wing parties in next June's European parliamentary elections and provide the basis for his own party's economic programme in office if they win next September's Swedish general election. The Labour Market Board is not being starved of funds to administer measures to keep a substantial number of people out of the unemployment figures. These measures include some imaginative ideas targeted on workers without a job for three months or longer - such as recruitment subsidies for employers to employ them; educational leave replacement; working life development enabling workers to leave their jobs for a period to be replaced by the jobless; relief work as well as workplace introduction; and youth training schemes to help the 18- to 25-year-olds. But the labour market programmes cannot provide opportunities for all the unemployed. Increasingly, financial resources are being deployed - as a proportion of total spending - into income maintenance for the unemployed and not to labour market measures. Last year, SKr24.07bn was spent on benefit payments to the unemployed and this year the figure will climb to more than SKr50bn. The present government has reduced the maximum benefit available to the jobless from 90 per cent to 80 per cent of previous earnings to a level of SKr564 a day for a maximum of 300 days. The unemployed have to be gainfully employed for at least 75 days over a 12-month period to qualify for the insurance benefit. Since September, they have had to wait five days before the benefit is paid and the benefit can be terminated if a worker refuses 'suitable work' or behaves in an anti-social way that contributes to them not being employed. The Swedish government has aroused opposition in the labour movement with its proposal to reform the existing unemployment insurance system with the introduction of a payroll tax of 1 per cent from January and 2 per cent in 1995 to help fund it. The government also wants to introduce a voluntary insurance scheme which would supplement or run in parallel with the existing system but this is seen as an attempt to weaken trade union involvement in the administration of the benefit. What all sides have yet to accept is that the soaring cost of unemployment is adding to Sweden's mounting budget deficit. The unemployment insurance fund is well into debt at more than SKr50bn and the state is having to borrow on the money markets at competitive interest rates to sustain the present levels of employment benefit. It is hard to see how this can continue indefinitely. Like it or not, Sweden is going to have to tighten its belt and accept that its still relatively generous approach to dealing with unemployment will have to change. This will prove a severe test, however, for the strong social consensus that has lasted for more than 50 years.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Kohl cabinet changes fail to impress GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday announced the promotion of four new ministers to his cabinet, and axed the jobs of seven junior ministers, in a reshuffle intended to revitalise his ailing coalition. Immediate reaction to the long-awaited and accurately predicted shake-up was sceptical, with political observers saying the new faces in the government were scarcely likely to make a big electoral impact. The most important job in the reshuffle was that of economics minister, following the surprise New Year resignation of Mr Jurgen Mollemann. The only involuntary move was the replacement of Mr Heinz Riesenhuber, the research and technology minister since the start of the Kohl administration in 1982. However the man with potentially the most challenging portfolio will be Mr Wolfgang Botsch, who replaces Mr Christian Schwarz-Schilling as minister for post and telecommunications, with the task of overseeing the reform and eventual privatisation of Deutsche Telekom. The fourth job in the reshuffle, that of agriculture minister, sees the retirement of Mr Ignaz Kiechle, the bluff Bavarian who has been one of the most cheerful and staunch defenders of the Common Agricultural Policy in Brussels since 1983. He is being replaced by Mr Jochen Borchert, a Christian Democrat (CDU) from North Rhine-Westphalia, who is himself a farmer and trained agricultural engineer. The new economics minister is, as expected, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the nominee of the minority Free Democrats (FDP) in the coalition, who is currently the director of the Treuhand privatisation agency in Berlin responsible for the textile industry. He was formerly the Berlin city senator responsible for finance, and in 1990-1991 the chairman of Citibank's German subsidiary in Frankfurt. Mr Riesenhuber's replacement is 43-year-old Mr Matthias Wissman, currently economics spokesman for the Christian Democrats in the Bundestag, and from 1973 to 1983 chairman of the youth wing of the party. The oldest in the group is Mr Botsch, who has hitherto been leader of the Christian Social Union group in the Bundestag, the Bavarian sister-party of the CDU. He is seen as a close ally of Mr Theo Waigel, the party leader and finance minister.</p>

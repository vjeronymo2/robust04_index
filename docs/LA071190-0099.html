			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VERDICT THROWS FRAUD PROBE A CURVE;  </P> <P> COMMODITIES: THE GOVERNMENT MUST DECIDE WHETHER TO INDICT 100 OTHER TRADERS AND  BROKERS. WHATEVER HAPPENS, REFORMS SEEM INEVITABLE.  </P> <P> The failure of a jury on Monday to convict three currency traders from the  Chicago Mercantile Exchange on either racketeering or fraud charges may force  the government to reassess whether to seek additional indictments in its  investigation of commodities traders who allegedly bilked customers and skimmed  profits.  </P> <P> More than 100 brokers and traders at the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade,  who have not been charged by federal prosecutors, are under investigation,  according to attorneys in the case. They may face indictments in the  government's extensive probe of corruption on the world's largest commodities  markets, the attorneys said.  </P> <P> Many of those under investigation work in trading pits where the government has  not previously sought indictments, attorneys said.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors could not be reached for comment Tuesday.  </P> <P> So far, 47 brokers and traders and one clerk have been indicted. Sixteen have  admitted their guilt under plea-bargain agreements with the government.  </P> <P> The next trials stemming from the case, scheduled for September, involve  brokers and traders from the Japanese yen pit at the Merc and the soybean pit  at the Board of Trade.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of traders on the cusp of being indicted right now, and those  people have received a tremendous shot in the arm" from the verdict, said an  attorney representing several traders.  </P> <P> "The government may dismiss this verdict, but it still is going to have a big  impact on how it proceeds in future cases," the attorney added. "The government  is not about to undertake weak prosecutions."  </P> <P> In fact, the mixed verdicts in the first trial growing out of the FBI's  two-year undercover investigation is being widely viewed here as a major  setback for the government. While two traders were found guilty of violating  federal commodities laws, none of the three was convicted of the more serious  charges of racketeering and fraud. The jury of nine women and three men failed  to reach a verdict on many of the charges, so a partial mistrial was declared  Monday by U.S. District Judge Ann C. Williams.  </P> <P> Although federal prosecutors vowed to seek a retrial, Merc officials maintained  that the jury's failure to find evidence of a widespread conspiracy vindicated  the exchange's longstanding assertion that trading abuses uncovered by the FBI  represented isolated incidents. A Merc spokesman also noted that the  convictions involved relatively small trades that cost customers only a few  hundred dollars in lost profits. That raises questions, the spokesman said,  about whether the multimillion-dollar investigation, involving four undercover  FBI agents posing as traders, represented a wise investment of government  resources.  </P> <P> "This verdict is a substantial rejection of the idea that there was widespread  wrongdoing here at the exchange," the spokesman said. "I think traders do feel  vindicated. . . . They always felt this was blown out of proportion."  </P> <P> Defense attorneys agreed that the most damaging blow to the government's trial  strategy came from the jury's refusal to accept the government's premise that  illegal trades observed by an undercover FBI agent were part of a widespread  racketeering conspiracy.  </P> <P> "I don't know what the impact of this verdict will be on other cases, but it  shows that juries are not going to be quick to accept racketeering as an  appropriate tool (for the prosecution) in this context," said Alan Blumenthal,  who represented one of the three currency traders. "This jury basically  repudiated the idea of a scheme or a conspiracy."  </P> <P> But if the prosecutors have yet to land a big fish in court, the government's  dramatic use of an undercover sting operation has had a lasting impact on  traders and the exchanges themselves. Since the investigation was revealed in  January, 1989, traders have reportedly been far more cautious and circumspect,  partly out of a fear that government agents or informants are still operating  on the floors of the exchanges. In fact, traders are apparently so suspicious  that some have been ostracized after being wrongly accused of being informants,  lawyers say.  </P> <P> "Everybody thinks there are snitches down there," one attorney said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a series of reform measures have either been proposed or put in  place by the two exchanges and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the  federal agency that oversees commodities trading. The changes should cut down  on the ability of traders to cheat customers and skim trading profits.  </P> <P> Most of the reforms are aimed at tightening traders' reporting requirements  under the frenzied and antiquated "open outcry" system used in Chicago's pits.  A number of rules changes by the exchanges have already shortened the time  between when a trade occurs and when it is officially recorded.  </P> <P> At the Merc, for instance, trading cards, which list each transaction, are  picked up from traders every half hour. Previously, they were collected only  twice a day. That should make it easier to spot traders' attempts to rewrite  orders and falsify prices in order to benefit themselves.  </P> <P> The biggest change could come from a proposal by both the Merc and the Board of  Trade to develop hand-held electronic trading devices. The gadgets would  automatically -- and immediately -- send each transaction to a central clearing  center.  </P> <P> Dennis Klejna, director of enforcement for the CFTC, said Tuesday that he  doesn't believe that Monday's verdict will have any effect on the ongoing  efforts to reform trading practices in Chicago.  </P> <P> He added that, given the fact that the government may seek to retry the three  currency traders, "the Merc's sense of vindication (of its current system) may  prove to be premature."  </P></p>

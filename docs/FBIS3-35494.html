			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Three leaflets were disseminated over the last few  hours throughout Judaea and Samaria, the main one issued from  Orient House, the PLO headquarters in East Jerusalem. This  leaflet notes that it is the Israeli Government that is fully  responsible for the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs.  This leaflet, like other leaflets disseminated in Judaea and  Samaria today, does not at all refer to the possibility that  this massacre was carried out by a private individual as an act  of insanity. This leaflet calls for two things: to strip the  settlers in Judaea and Samaria from the weapons given them by  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], and to declare three days of  mourning in the territories, as of today, in the wake of the  killing of about 50 Palestinians, residents of Hebron, in the  Cave of the Patriarchs this morning.    Another leaflet was issued by Fatah, and it, too, denounces  the massacre. This leaflet calls on the world to defend the  Palestinians who, as the leaflet puts it, are not sufficiently  protected by IDF soldiers, and are thus exposed to slaughter by  the settlers.    Yet another leaflet, jointly drafted by two Rejectionist  Fronts -- the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and  the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine --  categorically calls for a halt to the Israeli-Palestinian talks  in the wake of this morning's massacre in the Cave of the  Patriarchs. This leaflet also calls for a reaction by the  Palestinian street.    We have yet another manifesto, circulated by a Jewish  organization. The Kahana Hay organization has issued an  announcement to the press, terming it a Purim deed in Hebron.  The Kahana Hay members are mourning the death of martyr Barukh  Goldstein who consecrated the name of God by his death, as  Samson did at the time. Goldstein did what the Jews in Persia  did, as noted in the Book of Esther, when they struck at all  their enemies and did as they pleased with their foes. This is  an excerpt of the statement to the press issued by Kahana Hay.</p>

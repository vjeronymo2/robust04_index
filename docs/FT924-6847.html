			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Arts: Ibsen and Bergman - a marriage made in heaven / The first European theatre festival in Dusseldorf is proving a heady experience President Mitterrand paid for it, Giorgio Strehler opened it, and Ingmar Bergman was the catch of week one. At the first European Theatre Festival launched last week in Dusseldorf, radical chic has never been more sparkling. Bergman and Ibsen; Strehler and Goldoni; Brecht directed by his son in law; a revolutionary Catalan Figaro; from London the RNT's Angels in America: stars stud the stage, tickets are gold dust, visitors fill smoky bars for midnight post-mortems. The mood recalls Edinburgh, the variety Vienna and the quality Salzburg: on the first few days' tasting this new festival, whose venue will change each year, looks set to become Europe's most heady and prestigious theatre binge. Bergman doing Ibsen is a marriage made in heaven, and the Royal Theatre Stockholm's Peer Gynt offers a rare chance to see film-maker as stage director. Peer Gynt, its series of frozen scenes in Peer's life unravelled like magic boxes, is a natural vehicle for cinematic theatricality; in to it Bergman, always an autobiographical artist, injects a personal vision which transforms this often wooden piece into an emotional coup de force. A century on, Bergman's art is rooted in scenes close to Ibsen: moral integrity; a sense of sin powerfully visualised; individual expression within claustrophobic relationships; the meeting of dream and reality. Bergman's set is a sinister red room, centre stage, enclosed within the larger frame of Peer's home. High, thick wooden walls carved with flowers, dim gaslights, a grandfather clock, a sturdy crib, hem it in on three sides. Actions, memories, are compressed into this chamber of the imagination; like dreams, each seen has its own visual logic. The wedding guests, in flame-red folk-dress buttoned up to neck and wrists, weighed down with gold brocade and buckles, hijack the room for a hellish, anti-erotic tap dance full of jerkily suppressed lunges for freedom. The trolls, green tarts in flounces, frills and dreadlocks, drag Peer on a rhino to an orgy in a madhouse. They hang over the roof of the room swinging erect green tails and snorting lewdly. Sex screams out, Peer hurtles about trying to conceal a huge rubber penis emerging between his legs. Later, laser beams focus on top-hatted men in black encircling Peer; their accusations echo as distortions from loudspeakers across a vast auditorium and against a chorus of church bells: a choking vision of guilt. Loneliness, repression and sin are the motifs. Solveig's family, Amish-style puritans, march in line like geese, fall to their knees chant prayers, a young child spies on Peer from a doorway. Based on Bergman's own upbringing, they are as chilling an emblem of cruel rectitude as the father in his film Fanny and Alexander. Lena Andre's Solveig, symbol of love, unwinds with conviction and subtlety from torment into a mix of nervousness/grace, fear/determination. As Peer, Borje Andersson is Everyman: chubby, dazed, endlessly flexible face; round, hapless body; a dreamer whose desires are now pathetic, now comic, now horrifying. He sticks out his tongue at us, drops his trousers at the whiff of a woman; he is also the desperate loner; seeking warmth, meaning, justification. A magnificent, inexhaustible performance. The European Theatre Festival to November 27 at the Dusseldorf, Schauspielhaus. Festival information 0211 36 87 136.</p>

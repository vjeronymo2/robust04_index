Both generals have been  sent back to Russia on the orders of Andrejs Rucs, the chairman  of the local government of Vidzeme district of Riga, when  representatives of the local government went to a property of  the house management enterprise of the Russian Army at 9 Krusta  Baznicas Street this morning in order to take it over according  to the local government's resolution.    Taylakov and Vodopyanov threatened to set guards at this and  two other sites due to be taken over, but as the sites were  already under control of the Home Guard, Rucs decided to send  the generals out from Latvia to avoid incidents.    Rita Aksenoka, aide to the prosecutor general, reports that  corpus delicti can be seen in the action by the local government  officials. The proceedings were instigated according to Clause  162 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Latvia, which deals  with abuses of power and authority, and Clause 125, which deals  with illegal detention. The case is being investigated by the  prosecutor's office's department for particularly serious cases.    Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the Latvian bureau for monitoring  the Russian troop withdrawal, reports that both generals have  already returned to Riga. According to the LETA news agency,  Russia has discontinued the talks on troop withdrawal from  Latvia in this connection.</p>

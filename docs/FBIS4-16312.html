			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Pozdnyakov report in the "Special Case" column: </F> "A Criminal Case Has Been Opened Against the Russian State TV  and Radio Company Petersburg-Channel 5. Mr. Pravdyuk Blames  Everything on 'National-Patriots, Communists, and Above All  Zionists'"]    [Text] The St. Petersburg Main Internal Affairs  Directorate's economic crimes department has presented to the  city Prosecutor's Office the results of an examination into a  statement by a group of State Duma deputies about illegal  activity by Bella Kurkova, chairperson of the Russian State TV  and Radio Company [RSTVRC] Petersburg-Channel 5; and her  husband, Vadim Tareyev, with an inscription, "For initiating  criminal prosecution."    This action is based on testimony by Valeriy Mikhaylov,  director of the joint stock company Commercial TV and Radio  Center of St. Petersburg, who alleged that Mrs. Kurkova extorted  sponsorship from him for Mr. Tareyev's private enterprise.  According to Mikhaylov, "the Russian General Prosecutor's  Office, which demanded part of the materials to be sent to  Moscow for study," has also shown interest in the investigation  results.    The leadership of the RSTVRC Petersburg-Channel 5 has  reacted  in a peculiar manner. In an interview with the city daily  VECHERNIY PETERBURG, RSTVRC First Deputy Chairman Viktor  Pravdyuk put forward several mutually exclusive ideas as to who  is to blame for the trouble that has occurred with the RSTVRC  Petersburg-Channel 5 executives. Mr. Pravdyuk stated that "the  provocation against St. Petersburg TV" was organized by former  TV and Radio Company employees led by Mikhail Syroyezhin,  Kurkova's former deputy for advertising. Viktor Pravdyuk said  that the "provocateurs are national patriots and communists  seeking to place TV broadcasting under their control at any  price, and, most important, Zionists and the NTV company, which  articulates their interests."    The paradoxical thinking of Kurkova's first deputy, who has  constructed an elaborate legend about Russian nationalists  trying, with the help of Jewish money, to remove democrats from  top executive positions at RSTVRC Petersburg-Channel 5, has  surprised many observers. Even so, a measure of ambiguity in  Mr. Pravdyuk's perception of reality may be due to the anxious  anticipation of the results of an investigation into a criminal  case which the St. Petersburg Prosecutor's Office is most likely  to open against Mrs. Kurkova. Within the next few days  documents will be presented to the Prosecutor's Office about  foreign bank accounts held by some modest civil servants closely  linked with the leadership of the State TV and Radio Company  Petersburg-Channel 5.</p>

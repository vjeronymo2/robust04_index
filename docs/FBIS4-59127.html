			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by the APF on 4 May; place not </F> given -- recorded, read by announcer]    [Text] In the name of the God, the merciful, the  compassionate. A political statement released by the Alliance  of Palestinian Forces [APF]:    The APF's Central Command has convened a meeting to study  the  dangers of the agreement signed in Cairo between 'Arafat -- who  has, along with his team, switched over to the camp of the  enemies of the people and the revolution -- and Rabin, the prime  minister of the Zionist entity, in the Cairo circus, with the  Americans playing the role of sponsors and the Egyptians playing  the role of middleman.    The APF's Central Command decided to expose the risks the  agreement carries for the rights of our people to liberation,  repatriation, self-determination, and national independence.    The APF's Central Command would like to make the following  points:    This agreement of capitulation is little more than a  reorganization of occupation and redeployment of the occupying  military along the borders with Egypt and Jordan, the crossings,  road junctures, and the security arrangements around the Zionist  settlements. Thus, the agreement amounts to a complete  capitulation to U.S.-Zionist terms, turning Gaza and Jericho  into discrete crossings and cantons.    This agreement blatantly ignores Jerusalem, the capital of  Palestine, as well as the Palestinian refugees and their right  to return to their homeland, leaving them vulnerable to  resettlement in the host countries and in the diaspora.    This agreement ignores thousands of Palestinian expellees  and  prisoners and detainees who are being held in the prisons of the  occupation authority. The agreement of liquidation approaches  their case selectively, providing the release of several hundred  detainees, whose prison terms had either nearly or completely  expired.    This agreement sets out to tear asunder the land and people  and marks a dangerous gateway for the Zionist penetration of our  Arab nation and people with a view to controlling their  resources through a plan of normalized relations, which has  already begun in certain Arab capitals.    Driven by our concern for the supreme Palestinian interests,  and in the name of the Palestinian Arab people and the Arab and  Muslim nations and world public opinion, the alliance announces  the following:    First, this agreement of liquidation is null and void and is  binding neither on the Palestinian people, nor on the Arab and  Islamic masses. The signers of the agreement do not speak for  the Palestinian people. Accordingly, we urge our Palestinian  and Arab masses to take a determined stand against this  U.S.-Zionist-'Arafatist conspiracy being peddled by certain Arab  governments, led by the Camp David regime.    Second, the APF reiterates its determination to maintain the  struggle and thwart the implementation of this agreement. It  calls on the Palestinian and Arab masses to boycott the  self-rule institutions and defy all their decisions, including a  boycott of the elections. The APF further calls for ostracizing  and besieging the self-rule clique as a tool of repression  manipulated by occupation, as envisaged in the ominous agreement.    We urge our Arab and Islamic masses and the patriotic  governments and world public opinion to stand by the Palestinian  people's struggle and support them as they fight to topple the  agreement. We call on them to boycott and refuse to have  anything to do with the self-rule institutions and agencies as a  confirmation of our people's cohesion with the Arab and Islamic  nations.    Third, the alliance reiterates a commitment to the  continuation, escalation, and enhancement of the valiant  intifadah. It also pledges to secure whatever is necessary to  ensure the continued dynamism of the intifadah until the  national goals of our people are attained.    Fourth, what 'Arafat and his team have done in signing the  agreement with the Zionist enemy in Cairo amounts to treason  against the nation, the liquidation of the Palestinian cause,  and the disposal of the PLO. The APF reiterates its adherence  to the PL0 as a national achievement and demands that its  institutions be rebuilt on democratic foundations.    The APF extends greetings to our people who have renounced  this agreement by declaring the signing day a day of national  strike and national mourning. The alliance hails our people's  valiant intifadah as it confronts occupation, and urges them to  close ranks and upgrade their militant, mass action inside and  outside the occupied territory with the objective of toppling  the agreement of humiliation and disgrace and realizing the  aspirations of the Palestinian people. It calls for 15 May,  1994 -- the anniversary of the theft of Palestine -- to be  observed as a day of sweeping anger in the homeland and in the  diaspora.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOZ NO COOP  </P> <P> I have seen some sick things in my life, but director Bruce Malmuth saying that  football player Brian Bosworth has "a little bit of Gary Cooper in him" makes  me want to pluck my eyes out (Outtakes, March 11). The only way Boz could have  any Gary Cooper in him would be if he ate a bowl of Mr. Cooper's toenails.  </P> <P> BILL TURNER  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> 'WHITE HOLE AREA' ZONE RULING DELAYED  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday delayed a decision on whether to modify the zoning  of a vast area of former wetlands, a controversy which has brewed for more than  a decade.  </P> <P> The proposal, now set for a vote on Feb. 20, would impose new restrictions on  225 acres.  </P> <P> City planners say it would protect critical wetlands while still allowing  owners of the property to propose some development.  </P> <P> The zone change formally designates as wetlands nearly all of the "white hole  area" -- so called because years of controversy over its use has left it a  white spot on city zoning maps. The area is a wide swath of largely privately  owned properties along the inland side of Pacific Coast Highway, extending from  Beach Boulevard to the mouth of the Santa Ana River.  </P> <P> The change sets new restrictions on the use of the land, most of which  environmentalists hope to restore to an active natural refuge for birds and  other wildlife.  </P> <P> The area has emerged as a hotly debated battleground between environmentalists  and developers, much like the fight over the Bolsa Chica Wetlands Reserve  before a compromise on that area was reached last year. Although the state  Coastal Commission has designated the white hole area as an environmentally  sensitive region, the property owners have contended that they have a right to  develop it and that most of the wetlands are in too bad a state to be revived.  </P> <P> A coalition of environmentalists, property owners and government officials was  recently formed to work out an agreement that they hope, like the Bolsa Chica  settlement, will be mutually amicable. The group, the Pacific Coast Highway  Coalition, held its first meeting last month. JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAN HASN'T FORGOTTEN RUSHDIE  </P> <P> Novelist Salman Rushdie marked the start of his second year in hiding from the  death sentence pronounced upon him by Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini  with a request, through intermediaries, for a dialogue with British Muslims to  work things out. The answer came back quickly. The deputy director of London's  Muslim Institute, noting that he spoke for "the whole community here," said the  only acceptable resolution would be for Rushdie to be extradited to a Muslim  country to face trial on an accusation of blasphemy.  </P> <P> What could Rushdie expect in such a case? "According to Islamic law, the  punishment is death." The speaker of Iran's Parliament reaffirmed the  authenticity of this view by announcing that the edict against Rushdie "remains  in full force."  </P> <P> And so Rushdie, born in India, now a British citizen and author of the novel  "The Satanic Verses," which many Muslims consider insulting, must go on living  his strange underground life, protected by armed policeman but isolated from  every aspect of normal existence. The $1-million reward promised by Iran to  anyone who kills him still stands. Rushdie's protest that he could not be  guilty of blasphemy since he long ago gave up being a believing Muslim has been  brushed aside. He is learning what victims of religious persecution have  learned throughout history: What counts is not how he defines himself but how  his tormentors define him.  </P> <P> The world has witnessed much strange and odious behavior from Iran in the 11  years since its Islamic Revolution. The open avowal of a right to terrorize a  person for exercising free thought and free speech in a free society is only  one notably bizarre example. Within Iran itself, of course, thousands have  suffered barbaric torture and execution because clerical authorities accused  them of heresy or insufficient piety. It is small consolation, but unlike these  victims, Rushdie at least has some place where he can hide.  </P></p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Books: Wodehouse meets the mullahs - Summer Fiction EAST OF WIMBLEDON by Nigel Williams Faber Pounds 14.99, 374 pages IN THE KINGDOM OF AIR by Tim Binding Jonathan Cape Pounds 14.99, 374 pages KISSING THROUGH A PANE OF GLASS by Peter Michael Rosenberg Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 14.99, 235 pages THE CENTRE OF THE LABYRINTH by Philip Lloyd-Bostock Quartet Pounds 16.95, 472 pagews BRAVE OF Nigel Williams to write a book about English Moslems, poking fun at the eccentricities of a religion not noted for its sense of humour towards British novelists. Brave, but not blasphemous, so the mullahs need not be alarmed. There is nothing in East of Wimbledon to get them issuing fatwas or burning the book in the streets. It is just a gentle dig at the oddities of Islam, as exemplified by the activities of a group of Dharjees - loosely based on a real Shiite sect - who prowl London's better-class suburbs, threatening death and damnation to anyone who has the temerity to get in their way. The plot revolves around Robert Wilson, an unemployed and rather feeble Englishman who fakes a conversion to Islam in order to get a job at Wimbledon's Islamic Independent Boys' Day School. The school is run by Mr Malik, a disgraceful reprobate whose interest in drink and women is not what a headmaster's ought to be, especially a Moslem headmaster's. Among the pupils is Hasan, a blind 10-year-old 'prophet' - again based on a real Islamic character - who the Dharjees believe is destined to appear on earth one day and save the world. So far, so Evelyn Waugh. But the author's approach is more PG Wodehouse than anything, Wodehouse combined with a fair measure of slapstick and farce of the Carry On kind. There are mad Irishmen here, dog murderers, Moslems with tea towels on their heads, old ladies helped on their way to Paradise by a No 33 bus. The Radcliffe Camera triggers a joke about photography, and the failure of anyone to murder Robert Wilson for a reward of Pounds 10 is promptly followed by a raising of the blood money to Pounds 12.50, but still without result. Williams' humour, in other words, is a little forced in places, rather more forced than is welcome. He pitches his wit at the undergraduate level and hits the mark as often as not. But one cannot help feeling that he would have written a better book if he had suppressed the urge to amuse all the time and simply allowed the jokes to arise naturally from the writing, as they surely would have done if he had had enough confidence in himself and his past achievements to let it flow. Tim Binding has no past literary achievements to fall back on, being a first-time author and a former publisher to boot, but he has not let that stop him. In the Kingdom of Air is a most interesting book, albeit flawed in one or two respects. It tells the story of a young man growing up on the Medway, and of his affair with a teenage girl named Stella, who disappears one night, never to be seen again. The police suspect the young man of her murder and question him endlessly. However, they have no evidence and let the case drop. Many years later, the young man's sister spots Stella at a London railway station and follows her home. Gradually the truth emerges about Stella's disappearance. It is an intriguing story, neatly put together, although the structure is rather too complicated for what is in essence a fairly simple plot. The author fights shy of dialogue and writes paragraphs of prose that go on for pages at a time. But he has a definite talent nonetheless, one that will doubtless serve him well in future years. What a pity he has already wasted so much of his life as a publisher. It is not a bad week for first novels. Peter Michael Rosenberg's Kissing through a Pane of Glass was runner-up for last year's Betty Trask prize - a greater recommendation than it might at first appear - and is about love, as Trask awards have to be. In particular, it is about a young man's passion for a beautiful girl he met in India, a girl with a mysterious past. The story begins unpromisingly at Sussex University, where the young man is learning everything he can about sex. Since he is not in the least good-looking, this is an uphill task. But just when one is thinking that there is only so much one wants to know about an unattractive youth searching for sex on the south coast, the story switches to India, where he has gone after graduation. There he meets the beautiful Liana, who promptly surrenders her virginity to him within a few hours of their first meeting. Well, we all have our fantasies. But there is method in the author's madness, as soon becomes apparent. The madness in fact is Liana's, because she is seriously disturbed, and it becomes the hero's mission in life to take care of her and protect her from herself. The story is a moving one, skilfully told, well worth persevering with after a hesitant start. Philip Lloyd-Bostock's first novel, The Centre of the Labyrinth, is also his last, the author having died of Aids seven years ago. Indeed, he was still working on the book when he died. It is a highly intellectual work - Lloyd-Bostock was an Oxford don with an interest in semiotics - which begins by charting the relationship between a beautiful heiress and a homosexual photographer, and ends not altogether surprisingly with the photographer's discovery that he has Aids and is going to die. People in a similar situation may well wish to read the book and empathise. If they do, they should be warned that it is not a particularly easy read, partly because the author still had plenty of corrections to make, but mostly because he wrote like an academic in the first place, which is not always the best of recommendations for a novelist, even one with as large a vocabulary as Lloyd-Bostock's.</p>

The  document calls for reciprocal consultations in matters of  security, defense planning and strategy. It calls for the  exchange of know-how and information, and visits by officials  and officers. The DETA agency reports that the two countries  will develop programs for the education and practical training  of servicemen and work out other matters jointly.    Denmark is the first NATO country with which Latvia has  signed such an agreement, but 32 Lithuanian officers have  already begun training in officer courses at a Danish military  school. Representatives of the main subdivisions of the national  defense service--the field army, state border guard service,  naval forces and civil defense department--have been sent to  attend the courses.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Another one under his belt: Nafta was a lesson for Clinton on the power of his office The spinmeisters are having a field day now that Nafta is over and won. President Bill Clinton's fans say he alone pulled it off, demonstrating toughness with his own Democratic party, persuasiveness in argument and shrewd tactical sense in understanding that this was a victory that could only be gained late in the day. He displayed, they said, the sort of resilience against all odds that characterised his election campaign and this means broad sunlit uplands ahead, even in the Washington political swamp. His detractors are dismissive, saying he was too slow to realise that Nafta might lose, bought it with give-away deals, was bailed out by his vice-president, Al Gore, conqueror of Ross Perot in televised debate, and only survived on the backs of a Republican vote he can never again take for granted. The truth is an amalgam of some of the above, and more besides. Perhaps the most objective assessment has come, surprisingly, from Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, a Nafta supporter but normally the most partisan of politicians. 'I have to say I am impressed,' he said hours before the House voted but when victory seemed assured. 'I had my doubts but it has become clear that he understands it is important to win and he has not just stuck with it but fought hard and realised what would happen to his presidency he if he failed.' The same could have been said for the budget battle in July and will doubtless be said again when healthcare reform comes to congressional crunch next year. The Clinton presidency, it seems, is destined to live or die on a handful of hard-won votes. It may be a rum way to run a railroad but from Tokyo to Paris these are the tracks on which democratic governments are now consigned to run. The clear lesson from Nafta, certain to be duplicated over healthcare, is the extent to which most of the tough domestic issues, taxation only partly excepted, cut completely across party lines. Success or failure depends on amassing a series of shifting coalitions, often with unlikely bedfellows. Most of the Democrats who sustained Mr Clinton over the budget deserted him over Nafta. A majority of the Republicans, who voted as a bloc against the budget because of its tax increases, supported him on Nafta. Already on healthcare there are more glimmerings of an alliance between the White House and moderate Republicans than with conservative Democrats. Liberal members of the president's own party somehow have to be brought on board, if only to offset the certain opposition of the Republican right wing. The fault lines in both parties are now very deep. Democratic wounds, especially with organised labour, will take some repairing. But Mr Clinton, always good at political healing, was conciliatory in victory on Wednesday night, as was Mr Thomas Foley, the Democratic Speaker of the House, in the last speech of the great debate. With time the unions will probably retract threats to work against Democrats who supported Nafta. They will fight Gatt, if it comes to them, but with small expectation of success and thus much less effort. It is no exaggeration to say that Nafta might prove to be the last great stand of the old left. Deprived of the demonology of the Reagan/Bush presidencies and with tenuous peace prevailing in central America, it has been pushed to find great causes around which to unite. Working with Ross Perot and the 'America First' brigade cannot have been a pleasant experience, especially since it came up short. Divisions in the Republican party, contemplating a ferocious contest for the 1996 presidential nomination, are perhaps more profound now that the Cold War no longer provides cohesion. Jack Kemp, who probably will run, and Pat Buchanan, who says he will not again, slugged it out on TV this week offering two very different visions of what the party should look like - and both come from its right wing. One of the more fascinating spectacles of the past two weeks has been the performance of Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the chief Republican attack dog and almost certain to be its next leader in the House. Not only was he seen co-operating closely with President Clinton, a prospect once considered unthinkable, but he was even nice to some of his less conservative colleagues. He also delivered the goods, in the shape of 132 Republican votes for Nafta. It is a larger question, however, if this bipartisan approach will extend to other issues, above all healthcare. A clear loser in Nafta was Ross Perot, increasingly perceived as not only just another politician but also a most bad-tempered one. Both parties, especially Republicans, will be relieved at this, but the well of discontent he tapped last year as an independent presidential candidate has not evaporated and there is every chance that he will continue to throw his vast financial resources at issues which catch his fancy, including healthcare. But it is Bill Clinton who gets the most attention. Here he is, 10 months into his presidency, with two big victories under his belt and a long list of lesser ones yet still unable to command the heights of respect that his record might seem to warrant. This month's off-year elections showed no regard. Polls this week, admittedly taken before the vote, put his approval rating at generally below 50 per cent. This is the lowest of any president after nearly a year except, curiously, Mr Reagan. Since Nafta seemed so dimly understood by most Americans there is no assumption that Clinton will get a lasting bounce up again. His poll standing seems to rise most when little is happening - as in the summer. In a TV interview this week, Mr Clinton was typically philosophical. 'Any time you try to change as many things as we do, you put yourself on the line. But that's the kind of person I am. I didn't run for president to husband my popularity or to be very limited in my aspirations.' What he might have learned from this struggle, though, is a lesson in the power of his office. All along, even when it appeared well ahead, the anti-Nafta coalition confessed a fear of what might happen if Mr Clinton woke up to this fact, not simply because of the patronage at his disposal but also because of the force of argument he could bring to bear. He had been pondering this, too, though for non-trade reasons. A few weeks ago, he held a White House dinner for a small group of intellectuals, including William Julius Wilson, the black sociologist from the University of Chicago. Their advice was the imperative of using the presidency once again as a 'bully pulpit', as Theodore Roosevelt once called it and as Ronald Reagan so effectively used it. Thus, last weekend, at Rev Martin Luther King's old church in Memphis, Mr Clinton delivered a powerful sermon on crime and on the responsibilities of black citizens to arrest the decay of their families and communities. Dr Wilson probably was nodding in approval. It is a far cry from this message to the legislative complexities of anti-crime legislation and healthcare. Some White House officials already think Mr Clinton spreads himself in public too thinly, others want him to impose himself with greater authority on the political culture. Both seem difficult to achieve, given his intellectual and political eclecticism. Meanwhile, business will go on. Nafta digested and the instant spin spun out, it will be back to healthcare, Bosnia and Haiti, a possible Cabinet reshuffle, a balanced budget amendment, the Gatt conclusion, Apec in Seattle, Nato in Brussels and Yeltsin in Moscow. At least the foreigners now have reason to be impressed.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HEMISPHERIC TRADE ZONE?

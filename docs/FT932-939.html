			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: United considers low-cost airline UNITED Airlines, the large Chicago-based carrier, is toying with the idea of creating a 'new' low-cost airline to fly its short-haul domestic routes. United stressed that the idea was only one of many possible cost-cutting moves under consideration and no decision on this was likely for some months. However, if such an idea was pursued, it conceded that the 'new airline' might then be spun off to the existing shareholders in UAL, United's parent company, via some kind of 'demerger' scheme. Like many of its big competitors, United has found it difficult to make money on short-haul domestic routes in the face of the US recession and savage fare wars. The 'big three' US carriers - American, United and Delta - have all complained that they have difficulty competing with some of the more financially-troubled carriers, who have won large pay concessions from their employees. Northwest Airlines, for example, is seeking pay concessions of nearly Dollars 900m from employees over three years while Continental and USAir have achieved similar goals. United has been looking for ways to cut costs after it failed to secure concessions from some of its own unions at the start of 1993. It has already slashed planned expenditure on new aircraft, introduced a five per cent salary cut for management, and axed several thousand jobs. Herman's, the sporting goods chain which was owned until recently by Britain's Isosceles group, is selling 21 stores in Washington, Arizona, Utah, Idaho and Illinois to LPG Group, a joint venture company representing three separate retail groups. The deal will leave Herman's, which is now in bankruptcy, focusing on its stores in the North-East. LPG Group will pay at least Dollars 550,000 for the long-term leases on the stores and assume the liabilities and obligations on the leases.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Video games control pact Video games manufacturers throughout Europe have agreed a rating system for software that will allow parents to gauge levels of sex and violence in games before purchase, writes Diane Summers. The move to self-regulation is intended to head off any attempts to introduce statutory controls and comes as manufacturers in the US have announced plans to introduce a similar voluntary system. The European Leisure Software Publishers Association, which says it represents all the software publishers in the region, announced yesterday that four categories of games will be introduced: those suitable for children aged 0-10, 11-14, 15-17, and 18 plus.</p>

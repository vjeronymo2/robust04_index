The workers  there were full of spirit and joy to welcome the visit of Chen  Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee. This small  grain shop has changed greatly in the short span of one month.    As soon as Chen Xitong entered the grain shop yesterday, he  first found female worker Lu Wenmei who had complained tearfully  that the grain shop suffered deficits and the workers received a  low income last month and said to her cordially: Thank you for  speaking the truth. You have made us realize the actual  situation and pay more attention to helping money-losing  enterprises "shake off poverty." This time you must also speak  the truth. What is the situation now? Lu Wenmei grimed from ear  to ear and said emotionally: Thank you for your kind concern;  the grain shop has changed completely; everybody here is full of  enthusiasm for work and have the confidence to work hard to  bring about an upsurge.    While inspecting sanitation work on 21 last moth, Chen  Xitong, Zhang Baifa, and Ouyang Wenan suddenly changed the  district authorities' schedule to make a spot check on this  grain shop. At that time, Lu Wenmei reflected tearfully the  actual difficulties in the living standards of workers of this  grain shop. According to Dongcheng District's investigation,  about one-third of this kind of grain shop suffered deficits.  Chen Xitong was very concerned about this and instructed  Dongcheng District to devise plans to solve this problem within  a month. Thus, efforts to make major breakthroughs of strategic  significance in realizing the goal of becoming well-off ahead of  schedule began.    Dongcheng District and the government immediately  established  a work group to study and formulate the initial plan for making  "Hepingli grain shop and all money-losing grain shops in the  whole district shake off poverty and become comparatively  well-off" along with the district grain bureau and Hepingli Siqu  grain shop. The newly appointed manager of Siqu grain shop did  not go home for a week. He studied with workers ways to reform  and invigorate the grain shop, to shake off poverty, and to  become prosperous. They raised 50,000 yuan to refurnish and  renovate the shop, increase operational facilities, and improve  the shopping environment. Internally, this shop implemented the  operational and job contracting system and shared the contract  base figure to all operational groups. After implementing the  contract system, this grain shop, in addition to ensuring grain  and cereal oil supply, also carried out diversified  undertakings, added some new service items, increased  commodities like bread, small packages of miscellaneous grains,  and daily necessities to over 190 varieties, and set aside a  part of the shop to run a restaurant. This small shop put on a  new look and generated a business volume of 7,000 yuan in three  days, doubling that of the previous month, and enabled the  income of workers to greatly increase.    At a forum following the investigation and study, Dongcheng  District grain bureau gave a work briefing on helping the  money-losing grain shops shake off poverty and become  prosperous. During the past month, all grain enterprises  conducted general discussions on how to emancipate the mind and  reach a common understanding: After the decontrol of grain and  cereal oil prices, they failed to make their business keep pace  with the situation, and their ideology basically remained at the  level of complaining, laying bare the difficulties, and asking  for policies from the higher levels. It is necessary to carry  out the socialist market economy in the course of development.  It is impossible for us to return to the old track of the  planned economy and to lead a life by relying on state  subsidies. It is also impossible for the state to make us  prosperous by giving subsidies. Therefore, we must cut off the  road to retreat and blaze a new trial. The district grain  bureau and grain management office have urged all cadres to each  give an order to change the outlook of 42 money-losing grain  shops in the district in line with Siqu grain shop's  requirements of shaking off poverty and becoming prosperous.  According to the briefings of the district party committee and  government, the grain enterprises should take the lead in this  work, consider helping poverty-stricken shops, plants, schools  and households shake off poverty and become prosperous as a  strategic issue, accelerate the development of the whole  district, and realize the goal of becoming well-off ahead of  schedule.    During the forum, Executive Vice Mayor Wang Baosen said: The  municipal party committee and government have been greatly  concerned about the low income issue of workers. The economic  departments dealing with comprehensive work should study the  experience of Dongcheng District, emancipate the mind, deepen  reform, help the poor shake off poverty and become prosperous,  do more practical things for the masses, and care for and make  good arrangements for the living of low income workers,  particularly before the Spring Festival period.    Ouyang Wenan, member of the standing committee of the  municipal party committee, said: The low income issue of  workers has a bearing on social stability and becoming well-off  ahead of schedule. It is necessary to conscientiously conduct  investigation and study and devise specific measures for solving  this issue.    Chen Xitong also gave a speech, in which he said: It makes  me happy to see the improvements of this grain shop today. The  Dongcheng party committee and government have realistically  regarded solving the low income issue of workers as a major  task, and showing that they have kept the people and workers in  mind. Making breakthroughs in Siqu grain shop, promoting this  experience to the whole district, and helping poverty-stricken  shops, plants, schools, and households shake off poverty and  become prosperous is a good method. We have great hopes for  realizing the goal of becoming well-off ahead of schedule.    Chen Xitong said: Workers of grain enterprises across the  municipality have done much hard work in conscientiously  implementing the plans of the party Central Committee, the State  Council, and the municipal party committee and government, which  showed that this contingent has awareness, has observed  discipline, and is trustworthy. He thanked and saluted the  grain enterprises on behalf of the municipal party committee and  government.    Chen Xitong fully affirmed Dongcheng District grain bureau's  effort in emancipating the mind while tuning out the  disparities, freeing itself from the ideological shackle of  complaints, laying bare the difficulties, and asking for help  from the higher level, enhancing spirit, and in particular,  recognizing that it is no longer possible to return to the old  track of the planned economy to lead a life of relying on state  subsidies and that it is no longer possible for the state to  make the grain enterprises become well-off by providing  subsidies. By doing so, this grain bureau has grasped a key  point. When we have a leap forward in ideology and hope in our  work, we will be able to find a way to shake off poverty and  become well-off.    Chen Xitong pointed out: The Dongcheng District party  committee and government have made a good start in  conscientiously studying plans and measures for solving the low  income issue of workers. All districts and counties across the  municipality and all departments should study and use Dongcheng  District's method for reference, devote energy to  conscientiously conducting investigation and study, grasp  typical cases, make breakthroughs in some major aspects, and  solve the problem of the poverty-stricken shops, plants,  schools, and households. He stressed: Mountainous areas and  housing and low income issues of workers constitute the most  difficult points in Beijing's realization of its goal of  becoming well-off ahead of schedule. He called on leaders of  the party committees and governments at all levels across the  municipality and all departments to get moving and go to the  mountainous areas and poverty-stricken shops, plants, schools,  and household, and conscientiously conduct investigation and  study to change this situation. All leaders should always think  about what they have done to solve poverty-related issues, and  should visit not only the prosperous areas but also the  poverty-stricken areas. Under an excellent situation, we must  never forget that there are also some fairly poor areas. We  should conscientiously conduct investigation and study, support  and help the poor, bring about a better situation, and let more  people see the superiority of socialism and feel the concern of  the party and the government. The Spring Festival will come  very soon. We must show concern for the poor households and let  them spend the Spring Festival happily. This is a most  practical and good thing we should do.</p>

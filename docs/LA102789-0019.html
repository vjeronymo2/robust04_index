			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: MAITRE D' TAKES MENU BACK TO CZARIST RUSSIA  </P> <P> One of the many perks that went with having VIP status in Czarist Russia was  that, sooner or later, a particularly delectable dish would be named in your  honor.  </P> <P> A list of the choicest Russian dishes reads like a page from the St. Petersburg  social register: coupe Romanov (vanilla ice cream, strawberries and liqueurs),  beef stroganoff (the Russians did not then and do not now make it with canned  mushroom soup) and crepes Ovanesoff, or feathery pancakes stuffed with  raspberries macerated in curacao. Even the bourgeoisie occasionally figured in  the nomenclature game, as in the endearing kotleti Pojarski, named for a famous  innkeeper credited with creating these breaded meat patties in creamy paprika  sauce.  </P> <P> Travelers to the Soviet Union grumble that the cooking now is quite a bit less  than aristocratic, and, although no dish has been named officially for Soviet  leader Mikhail Gorbachev, it is easy enough to guess that, given the current  food shortages, various mystery meat concoctions may well have been dubbed in  his honor.  </P> <P> The fact is, however, that classic Russian cooking can be superb. It also is  quite difficult to find, but La Jolla's Maitre D', usually a bastion of French  haute cuisine, has written a lengthy menu of classic dishes for its monthlong  Russian food festival. The festival opened last week and will conclude Nov. 19,  and, although the restaurant does not claim any affiliation with the city's  Soviet arts festival, the timing obviously is not coincidental.  </P> <P> Two months ago, Maitre D' proprietor Louis Zalesjak filled a crock with  peaches, grapes, apples and Stolichnaya vodka and allowed it to steep while he,  his partner and their chef, French-born Jean Michel Carre, flew away on a  six-week tour of Europe that included a stay in the Soviet Union. The resulting  brew, based on a recipe from the august Imperial Hotel in Vienna, carries a  wallop under its veil of fruited fragrance and is offered by itself or as a de  rigueur accompaniment to an order of caviar and blinis.  </P> <P> The stay in the Soviet Union offered Carre a chance to fine-tune the menu,  which concentrates primarily on the grand dishes of the old days, with a few  Georgian offerings -- Georgian cooking is highly respected in the U.S.S.R. --  thrown in to balance the often rich and creamy Russian entries. However,  because many of the grand dishes were created by French chefs in the employ of  powerful families, Carre must have found them familiar, as should anyone  acquainted with French cuisine. Sour cream typically enriches sauces, which  tend to be more highly seasoned than French and often include much paprika and  onion.  </P> <P> The menu opens with zakuski, the Russian word for hors d'oeuvres that usually  signifies a whole buffet of nibbles to be browsed as a prelude to dinner.  Maitre D' instead serves them by the individual order, and the choice is good,  beginning with the classic Osetrina of smoked sturgeon wrapped in the buttery,  yeast-raised pancakes called blini. Sirniki, a Georgian mouthful, is  good-looking but a little bland; it takes the shape of a great wedge of crisp  phyllo pastry wrapped around a cottage cheese stuffing.  </P> <P> Other choices include a rich liver paste (pastete); piroski, or small butter  pastries filled with highly seasoned chopped meat; thinly sliced smoked pork  loin on a bed of pita bread, and an exquisite, Moscow-style borscht. This last,  reddened with beets and enriched with cabbage, celery, onions and a spoon of  sour cream, is based on a beef consomme of such clarity and depth that the  flavors almost seem visible, rather like fish swimming through a shaft of light  in a deep mountain lake.  </P> <P> The menu would not be Russian without caviar, and it offers five, beginning  with golden caviar and progressing, in terms of choiceness and price, through  red, pressed Beluga, Sevruga and fresh Beluga. Caviar is, in the end, caviar --  not much can be done to it, and it was not sampled. But the restaurant makes a  grand show of presenting it in a foot-tall silver egg, which opens to reveal a  glass raft, laden with the precious eggs and floating among tiny floes of  crushed ice. Blinis and iced vodka arrive on the side, and the prices for an  ounce of the extravagant stuff range from $12 to $35.  </P> <P> Kulibiac heads the entree list. This famous dish (which does not, however,  appear to have been named for a famous individual) is a sort of salmon  Wellington and consists of layers of richly sauced fish alternating with rice  and chopped mushrooms inside a case of puff pastry. Sibirsi pelmeny are very  typical of everyday Georgian cooking, although Maitre D' gives these  tortellini-like pasta rounds a dandy finish with a sauce of sour cream, beef  stock and dill. The minced meat stuffing is flavored with grated lemon peel and  much garlic, and in Georgia would also include a great deal of cayenne pepper,  a seasoning the restaurant chose to suppress in deference to local  sensibilities.  </P> <P> So many dishes are based on chopped meat -- beef, lamb and veal, alone or in  combination -- that the preparations sometimes seem as much Turkish or Greek as  Russian. Given the nearness of these lands, the culinary similarities are  unsurprising. The bitoski, or breaded patties of veal ground with butter, are  particularly elegant under their cloak of stroganoff-like brown sauce. Similar  dishes include the Pojarski cutlet, based on beef and veal and dressed with a  highly seasoned sour cream sauce, and the humbler but tasty stuffed cabbage  rolls. The Luli kebab combines chopped beef and lamb in patties, which are  broiled on a skewer.  </P> <P> Zalesjak was born to a hotel-owning family in Yugoslavia, trained at Swiss  hotel schools and has been maitre d' (hence the restaurant's name) at important  hotel dining rooms in New York, Montreal, Bangkok and elsewhere. He likes to  make a great show of serving. Flaming dishes generally are dismissed these days  as all pomp and no circumstance, but this point of view forgets that tableside  cooking, when done properly, can produce exquisite results. Zalesjak flamed a  skewer of beef "troika" at table -- and danced a quick Cossack step as he did  so -- and the resulting cubes of marinated filet were, in fact, delicious. The  burning brandy sealed the meat and set the flavor, which was picked up further  by a thin but sharp brown sauce.  </P> <P> The desserts tend to be simple but rich, and the blinchiki, or thin pancakes  filled with sour cherries, are particularly nice. Sour cream is served on the  side, but by this point in the meal it seems a little too much of a good thing.  </P> <P> The restaurant has hired a pair of musicians, including a former professor of  music at Moscow University, for the duration of its Russian food festival, and  the musical mix is a delight. The tempo changes from Tchaikovsky on the piano  to Edith Piaf standards on the accordion and violin, and, believe it or not,  balalaika renderings of "Those Were the Days" slipped in among the Russian folk  tunes.  </P> <P> Most appetizers and desserts are in the $5 range, and most entrees are priced  at $15. The wine list, which from a connoisseur's point of view is a marvel,  features very, very few moderate bottles, and the bill can rise accordingly.  Dinner for two with house wine, tax and tip should cost about $65 to $90.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MAITRE D'  </P> <P> 5523 La Jolla Blvd., La Jolla  </P> <P> 456-2111  </P> <P> Dinner served Tuesday through Saturday; closed Sunday and Monday.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Reservations suggested.  </P></p>

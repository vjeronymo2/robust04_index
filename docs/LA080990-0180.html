			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> DANGER TO CHILDREN IN TRUCK BEDS CITED  </P> <P> Dogs that ride in the back of pickup trucks receive more stringent protection  under California law than children who ride in the back of trucks, a UC Irvine  associate professor said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "Putting a child in the back of a pickup truck is like putting a child in the  middle of a busy street, because the chances of a child being ejected and  ending up in the street are very great," said Phyllis F. Agran, an associate  professor of pediatrics whose research was published in the prestigious Journal  of the American Medical Assn.  </P> <P> Agran's article, "Pediatric Injuries in the Back of Pickup Trucks," studied  accidents involving 290 Orange County children, ranging from infants to  14-year-olds, who were ejected from the back of pickup trucks.  </P> <P> The study, whose authors include UCI researchers Diane G. Winn and Dawn N.  Castillo, concluded that children who rode in the back of trucks sustained more  severe injuries and were more frequently injured and ejected than those who  rode in the cab -- even in the absence of a collision.  </P> <P> For instance, 9% of 201 children who rode in the cab were ejected even when the  truck was not involved in a collision, but 24% of 89 children who rode in the  truck bed were ejected even when there was no collision, Agran's study showed.  </P> <P> "Any kind of turn, swerve, sudden stop can result in a child being ejected,"  she said."  </P> <P> Agran noted that under California law, dogs must be leashed or otherwise  restrained when riding in the back of a truck. Also, she pointed out, children  under the age of 12 cannot travel in a truck bed unless they are restrained or  in an enclosed space.  </P> <P> "But all that is null and void if a parent is traveling in the back with the  child," Agran said.  </P> <P> Dogs, however, must be restrained, even in the presence of an adult, so the law  is more stringent for dogs, she said.

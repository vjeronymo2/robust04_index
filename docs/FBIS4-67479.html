			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The Sino-Australian  Mine Waste Research and Management Project, a cooperative  science and technology program between the two governments,  started here today.    According to an official from the Chinese Ministry of  Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation, the aim of the project, the  memorandum of understanding of which was signed in 1992, is to  assist China in mitigating environmental degradation caused by  the depositing of mine waste through introducing suitable  technology from Australia.    Another purpose is to develop rehabilitation plants at mine  sites, and make policy on mine waste management, the official  said.    She added that the Australian Government has supplied 3.5  million U.S. dollars and technology for the project. Australian  experts have inspected the project facilities, some of which  have already been set up.    The Beijing General Research Institute of Mining and  Metallurgy, the Zhongtiaoshan Nonferrous Metals Company of north  China's Shanxi Province and the Tongling Nonferrous Metals  Company in east China's Anhui Province are participating in the  project.    Among those present at today's inauguration ceremony were  Qin  Zhongda, vice-chairman of the Environmental and Resources  Protection Committee of the National People's Congress, He  Boquan, deputy president of the China National Nonferrous Metals  Industry Corporation (CNNC), and Sam Gerovich, minister of  Australian Embassy.    He Boquan told the ceremony that over the past decade  China's  production of ten nonferrous metals has tripled, with a total  output of 3.29 million tons last year. However, the volume of  mine waste is also on the rise.    Each year, he said, CNNC affiliates generate a total of 60  million tons of mine tailings, accounting for 89 percent of the  sector's industrial solid waste.    So far, he added, the accumulated mine tailings amount to  one  billion tons, taking up two million ha of land, and with only a  small portion reutilized.    Gerovich expressed the hope in his speech that the project  would become a catalyst for future two-way investment in the  field, and further the cooperation between the two countries in  various aspects.    According to him, the Australian investment in China totals  one billion U.S. dollars, encompassing 1,200 projects. He added  that Chinese investment in Australia currently stands at 350  million U.S. dollars.</p>

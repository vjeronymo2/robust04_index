			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Protecting the Dorset coastline RENDEL GEOTECHNICS, part of the High-Point Group, is preparing a detailed design for a scheme to protect part of the town of Lyme Regis in Dorset from coastal erosion and wave attack and improve the town's antiquated sewerage and sewage treatment system. The scheme will incorporate 1,500 cu metres of storm water sewage storage tanks, a tunnel beneath part of the town, a pumping station within the new sea wall and inland pipelines as part of a major restructuring of the town's sewerage system. Work on the new sea wall, stretching from Cobb Gate along Gun Cliff, where the existing 18th century walls are listed structures, to Church Cliff, is expected to start in September. The scheme is being prepared for West Dorset District Council and South West Water and a prequalification exercise, which is currently underway, will produce a shortlist of six contractors. A grant for the coastal protection part of the scheme is being sought from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The new sea wall will be reinforced concrete with natural rock facing to conform with the designation of the town as a part of an area of outstanding natural beauty. It will be protected by 15,000 tonnes of rock armour.</p>

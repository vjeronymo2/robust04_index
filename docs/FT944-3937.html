			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / International Company News: Groupe Bull privatisation sees interest from overseas rivals The privatisation of Groupe Bull, the loss-making French computer manufacturer, has drawn a response from some powerful participants in the international computer, telecommunications and electronics industry, according to sources speaking after the close of the offer period yesterday evening. The candidates, which are largely in line with expectations, include NEC of Japan, which holds 4.4 per cent of Bull's shares and is thought to be seeking to raise its participation to 10 per cent. Quadral, a holding company which controls CSEE, the French electronics group, is proposing a joint offer with AT&amp;T of the US to take a stake of up to 40 per cent of the state-owned computer manufacturer. Motorola, which recently concluded a technology partnership with Bull has declined to comment on whether it is seeking to invest in the French group, as has IBM of the US, which holds 2.1 per cent of Bull. But sources indicated that the privatisation had drawn interest from several groups, including non-Japanese Asian companies. These are reported to include Samsung of South Korea and Acer of Taiwan. Government officials declined to comment on the number and nature of the proposals which had been received. The offer from AT&amp;T and Quadral is thought to involve a joint company with a majority holding for the French group. AT&amp;T has declined to confirm whether it is seeking access to the French telephone services market as a condition of the proposal. The French government wants to reduce its 76 per cent stake in Bull to a minority holding by next spring. Although the company is reducing losses which have totalled more than FFr20bn (Dollars 3.7m) since 1989, its precarious position has prompted its state shareholder to seek privatisation through the formation of industrial partnerships rather than through a public offer for shares. Under the terms of the privatisation process, the various proposals will be reduced to a short list after consultation between the government and the privatisation commission, an independent body which advises the government on the sale of public sector assets. The selected companies will have six weeks to proceed with a detailed examination of Bull's condition, after which they may make a binding offer.</p>

He was elected an active member of the  Academy of Cosmonautics, RARAN [not found], and is a  corresponding member of the RF Engineering Academy.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] What changes are  occurring in the Strategic Missile Troops [SMT] as a result of  the reform of the RF Armed Forces that have begun and what are  the prospects for the near future?    [Dvorkin] The changes that are occurring in the Strategic  Missile Troops have been caused mainly by the consequences of  the disintegration of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, by  the disintegration of the cooperation of missile weapons  developers that had developed over the decades, by the  difficulties of the country's economic situation, and also by  the limitations established by the START treaties.    Today the Missile Troops number 1,260 ICBMs in fixed and  mobile basing variants that are equipped with 6,300 warheads and  which are organizationally deployed in 27 position areas (PR) on  the territories of Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine. In  the process, the SMT formation located outside the Russian  Federation numbers 361 ICBMs and 2,361 warheads in seven  position areas.    There are 176 launch silos (13%) located in Ukraine  in two  position areas near the cities of Pervomaysk and Khmelnitskiy.  Missile complexes with two types of missiles are deployed in the  first position area: 40 launch silos with RS-18 ICBMs and 46  launch silos with RS-22 ICBMs. There are 90 launch silos with  RS-18 missiles deployed in the second position area.    There are 104 launch silos (8%) of RS-20 heavy ICBM's  deployed equally in the two position areas of "Derzhavinsk" and  "Zhangis-Tobe" in Kazakhstan.    In Belarus, by the beginning of 1993, 81 (6%)  launchers with  RS-12M ICBMs were deployed in the three position areas of  "Mozyr", "Lida" and "Postavy". At the present time, nine of them  have been redeployed onto Russian territory.    There are fixed missile complexes with RS-20, RS-22, RS-18,  and RS-16 missiles that are equipped with multiple independent  reentry vehicles (MIRVs) and with single-warhead RS-10 and RS-11  missiles, and also mobile missile complexes in the Missile  Troops inventory: rail complexes with RS-22 multi-warhead  missiles and ground-based complexes with RS-12M single-warhead  missiles. The share of fixed missile complexes in the SMT  formation by number of launchers is approximately 70%  and, by  number of warheads -- approximately 90%, and the share of  mobile missile complexes is 30% and 10%,  respectively.    The fixed missile complexes support accomplishment of  retaliatory-counterstroke strike [otvetno-vstrechnyy udar] and  retaliatory [otvetnyy udar] strike missions.    Mobile missile complexes play a main role in supporting the  SMT formation's effectiveness in a retaliatory strike after  bringing pressure to bear against the position areas.    The existing SMT formation consists of 64% of the  warheads  and 57% of the weapon platforms of our strategic nuclear  forces.    A large portion (60%) of the missiles of fixed  missile  complexes (RS-20's modifications 1 and 2, RS-18's, RS-16's,  RS-10's and RS-11's) were placed on combat alert duty at the  beginning of the 1970's and at the present time the duration of  their operation totals 11-19 years. Approximately 15/% of the  missiles of the fixed missile complexes (RS-20's modification 3  and RS-22's) are the latest generation missiles that were  developed by "Yuzhnoye" KB [Design Bureau] (Dnepropetrovsk). Of  the 278 RS-20 heavy ICBMs deployed, 196 missiles of the first  two modifications were placed on combat alert duty in 1976-1980.  The process that has begun to withdraw them from the effective  combat strength will be completed in the next 10 years.    Of the 82 RS-20 modification 3 ICBMs that were deployed in  1988-1991, 24 missiles are deployed in Kazakhstan and 58 -- in  Russia. They must be removed from combat alert duty by the  expiration of the prescribed operating periods, that is, no  later than 2005 and, when the START II Treaty is taken into  account -- by the year 2003.    By 2005, it will be necessary to scrap the RS-16 and RS-22  light ICBMs that are deployed at the present time and we also  will have to scrap the RS-18 missiles if we don't manage to  extend their maintenance periods.    In 1987-1991, 92 RS-22 10-warhead ICBMs were deployed in the  rail and fixed variants. Based upon operating periods and treaty  limitations, they will also be removed by 2003.    Single-warhead ICBM's are represented in the SMT by three  types: RS-10's and RS-12's -- fixed basing; RS-12M's -- mobile  basing. Deployment of the first two types of missiles was  carried out in 1971-1981. At the present time, they are being  removed from combat alert duty. We propose completing this  process during the next three years. Highly-survivable mobile  ground-based complexes with RS-12M ICBMs have been introduced  into the effective combat strength of the SMT since 1985.    Assessments indicate that, regardless of the START I and  START II treaties, we will need to remove and scrap  approximately 1,200 missiles, which are 95% of the  existing SMT  formation, by 2005.    According to the terms of the START I Treaty, the effective  combat strength of the Missile Troops is authorized to have up  to 1,000 launchers and 3,000 warheads. We planned to ensure the  development of this formation through modernization of the  RS-12M single-warhead missile and its deployment in mobile  ground-based and fixed variants, and maintenance of the RS-20,  RS-22 and RS-18 missiles in the effective combat strength until  the year 2000 with the extension of their operating periods and  subsequent augmentation of their strength using the latest  modifications of RS-20 ICBMs and the modernized RS-22 missile.    The breakdown of the cooperation of SMT weapons  manufacturers  has disrupted these plans. Reproduction became impossible and  the possibilities for extending the operating periods of the  newest ICBMs with MIRVs have been restricted. With the  preservation of the START I Treaty and under the new conditions,  it would be necessary to conduct experimental-design work in  short periods of time (3-4 years) and create the cooperation of  developers and manufacturers of Russian ICBMs with MIRVs for the  timely replenishment of ICBMs with MIRVs in order to begin their  deployment in the SMT formation to replace the RS-20's and  RS-22's by the end of the 1990's.    However, obtaining the required financing to conduct  experimental-design work, and testing and deployment of the  required number of ICBMs with MIRVs under the conditions that  have developed is quite problematic. I need to say that the  terms of the START II Treaty permit us to substantially smooth  over the negative consequences for our country of the breakdown  of the cooperation of SMT weapons developers since it is easier  to create the formation of the SMT and strategic nuclear weapons  as a whole that is comparable in combat capabilities with the  U.S. strategic offensive forces formation and thereby ensures  maintenance of the military strategic balance at a lower level  of nuclear confrontation.    The START II Treaty limitations provide a fundamental  capability to the Missile Troops to have up to 1,200 or more  single-warhead missile launchers, depending on the development  of the naval and aircraft components of the strategic nuclear  forces. The specific distribution of the number of warheads and  weapon platforms among the components of the strategic nuclear  forces triad must be determined by the military-political and  domestic economic situation in Russia that is taking shape. We  propose carrying out the deployment of the formation in the 19  existing position areas on RF territory. In accordance with the  provisions of the START II Treaty, a significant portion of the  single-warhead missiles in the fixed variant can be deployed in  reequipped heavy missile (90 silos) and light ICBM with MIRV  launch silos.    In accordance with the terms of the START II Treaty, the  number of Missile Troops position areas is being reduced in  relation to the current number by eight positions: seven  position areas in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan and one in the  Russian Federation. In the process, the personnel strength of  the RF SMT must be reduced insignificantly which is associated  with the increase of the SMT's mobile formation. In contrast to  fixed missile complexes, several times as many personnel are  required per launch crew in mobile missile complex subunits.    Under conditions of the deep reductions in accordance with  the START II Treaty, the SMT will be capable as before of  playing the role of a leading component of the strategic nuclear  forces which is caused by its high combat capabilities.    Assessments indicate that, despite the reduction of the  share  of the SMT per number of warheads from 64% to 30%  at the  present time in accordance with the START II Treaty, their  contribution in a strategic nuclear forces potential retaliatory  strike even increases as a result of the increase of the  formation's survivability and better operational specifications  for the functioning of the SMT combat command and control system.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] What is occurring with  the SMT large formations in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine?    [Dvorkin] The positions of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine  with regard to the nuclear weapons deployed on their territory  is having a definite impact on the prospects for SMT development  and implementation of the START treaties.    In accordance with the Lisbon Protocol that is an integral  part of the START I Treaty, the Republic of Belarus, Republic of  Kazakhstan and Ukraine reaffirmed the USSR's obligations in  accordance with the START I Treaty and were obligated to accede  to the 1 June 1968 Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons  as participating states that do not have nuclear weapons. Taking  into account the state obligations that have been assumed in  accordance with the START I Treaty and also the bases of CIS  nuclear policy that are recorded in the Agreement on Joint  Measures With Regard to Nuclear Weapons (Alma-Ata, 21 December  1991) and the Agreement on Strategic Arms (Minsk, 30 December  1991), packages of bilateral agreements that regulate all of the  aspects of the activities of the nuclear forces that are  temporarily deployed on the territory of Belarus, Kazakhstan and  Ukraine have been prepared and partially signed.    Our mutual relations with the Republic of Belarus with  regard  to nuclear forces have been completely defined. The process of  withdrawing mobile complexes with RS-12M ICBMs has already begun.    Kazakhstan, just like Belarus, has ratified the START I  Treaty. However, the state affiliation of the nuclear weapons  and the status of the nuclear forces on the territory of the  Republic of Kazakhstan have not been determined at the present  time. The Republic leadership's position with regard to the time  periods for the elimination and withdrawal of strategic nuclear  weapons is not completely clear. Nevertheless, the missile  weapons specified combat readiness is being maintained,  scheduled maintenance of the missile complexes is being  conducted, and the first 12 missiles (six in each of two  position areas) have been removed from combat alert duty.    The greatest uncertainty is being preserved with regard to  the nuclear weapons in Ukraine, whose parliament has still not  ratified the START I Treaty. Ukraine has established  administrative control over the ICBMs located on its territory.  At the same time, centralized combat command and control of all  ICBMs, including those deployed in Ukraine, is being maintained  and carried out only from Russian territory.    The Agreement Between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on  the Procedures for Implementation of Warranty and Inventor's  Supervision [avtorskiy nadzor] Over the Operation of the  Strategic Missile Complexes Located on Their Territories was  signed at the beginning of September of this year at Yalta and  entered into force from the moment it was signed. In this  agreement, the parties, guided by the need for nuclear and  ecological safety, the exclusion of unsanctioned employment of  nuclear weapons and maintenance of the missile complexes in the  proper technical state, have agreed to conduct work on warranty  and inventor's supervision using specialists of developing and  manufacturing enterprises without regard to on whose territory  they are deployed.    At the same time, an Intergovernmental Agreement on  Scrapping  Nuclear Warheads and the Basic Principles for Scrapping Nuclear  Warheads of the Strategic Nuclear Forces That Are Deployed in  Ukraine were signed and have equal force. These documents define  the procedures and conditions for removal and transportation to  Russian territory and for scrapping and dismantling of all types  of ICBM nuclear warheads and also warheads of air-based nuclear  cruise missiles.    I am far from the thought on the unimpeded implementation of  these agreements. Quite a few barriers have quite rapidly  appeared and will continue to emerge in the future. We must  apply significant efforts. However, it is important that the  parties have reaffirmed their adherence to the 1 July 1968  Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the START  I Treaty.    According to U.S. State Department associates, evidence  exists that Ukrainian specialists are undertaking attempts to  establish operational control of the ICBMs on their territory.  However, first of all, the data we have does not confirm that  and, second, attempts to implement these plans would cancel out  all of the international and bilateral agreements and treaties  with the participation of Ukraine, leaving it in a state of  isolation. In my opinion, Ukraine understands the senselessness  of such steps. Under any development of the political situation,  the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine is a question of  time since Ukraine does not have at its disposal the  capabilities to manufacture nuclear munitions and to test ICBMs  and, consequently, to renew the strategic offensive weapons  formation.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] What are the prospects  for further reductions of strategic offensive weapons and how  will this affect strategic stability?    [Dvorkin] Maintenance of the capability to maintain a  balance  (equilibrium) of forces both for the potential for deterrence  (the effectiveness of retaliatory operations) and also for  counterforce potential (the capability to destroy strategic  military targets in preemptive operations) can be the criterion  for the maximum depth of strategic offensive weapons reductions.    There can also be other criteria based first of all on the  required level of damage in retaliatory operations but this is a  separate topic.    In accordance with the START I Treaty limitations, up to  4,900 warheads can be deployed on ICBMs and SLBMs [submarine  launched ballistic missiles]. It has been assumed that the  United States will carry out the reductions with the  simultaneous accomplishment of strategic offensive forces  modernization programs under the terms of the START I Treaty:    deployment of new Minuteman IV missiles in the launch silos  of existing Minuteman II and Minuteman III missiles and  acceptance into the inventory of mobile Midgetman small ICBMs;  and,    completion of the construction of 18 Ohio Class SSBNs  [nuclear ballistic missile submarines] and equipping them with  Trident II SLBMs and others.    As a result of reductions in the effective combat strength  of  the U.S. strategic offensive forces, the number of ICBMs and  SLBMs must be reduced by approximately 25% (from  approximately  1,656 to 1,200 missiles) and, the number of ballistic missile  warheads -- by approximately 30% (from 7,954 to 4,900  weapons).  However, qualitative changes in the formation would have a  substantial impact on the increase of its combat capabilities.  The ballistic missile formation's counterforce potential would  increase by a factor of 1.3 and potential for deterrence -- by a  factor of 1.1-1.35, with regard to 1992. By the time of the  completion of the implementation of the START I Treaty, the  United States would surpass Russia in these indicators by  approximately a factor of two.    Under the terms of the START II Treaty, approximately 932  ICBMs and SLBMs equipped with 2,228 warheads could be in the  effective combat strength of the U.S. strategic offensive forces.    Furthermore, during the course of preparations for the  Treaty, the American side carried out unilateral steps for the  termination of the Midgetman Small ICBM development and  deployment program and terminated production of W-88 warheads  for Trident II SLBMs.    In the event the enumerated measures are implemented, the  CIS  missile formation's counterforce potential will be reduced by a  factor of three with regard to the current level after  elimination of the MX ICBM, reduction of the number of warheads  for the Minuteman and Trident II missiles, and termination of  equipping the latter with W-88 warheads. The deterrent potential  will be reduced by approximately a factor of two.    Under the terms of the START II Treaty, the counterforce  potential of the RF strategic nuclear forces is also being  reduced by approximately 45% with the elimination of  ICBMs with  MIRVs, however, the superiority of the U.S. strategic offensive  forces (by a factor of 1.2) is noticeably less in contrast to  the terms of the START I Treaty.    The reduction of the U.S. strategic offensive forces'  offensive capabilities and the increase of the portion of mobile  complexes in the Missile Troops formation from 30% with  the  limitation of strategic offensive arms at the level of 6,000  warheads to 50...60% with deeper reductions causes an  abrupt  increase of the survivability of the domestic ICBM formation.  Under conditions of the implementation of the START II Treaty,  the potential of an SMT retaliatory strike increases by a factor  of 1.5 and, of all strategic nuclear forces -- by approximately  20/% and levels out with the American potential.    Comparison of the terms of the START I and START II treaties  indicates that, with the directions and trends of development  that have taken shape for Russian and U.S. strategic offensive  weapons, the counterforce and deterrent potentials of the sides  are coming closer together as the number of warheads is reduced.    The trend toward the combat capabilities of the sides'  strategic forces coming closer together is strongly manifested  at the level of 5,000-6,000 strategic offensive weapons or less.  This is occurring for a number of reasons. First of all,  according to the START I Treaty, the number of warheads is being  reduced significantly more radically than weapon platforms (from  approximately 2,400 to 1,600) which is promoting the increase of  the stability of the formations' combat systems since the  average number of warheads per weapon platform is being reduced  from 4.5-6.3 to 3.5-4.0 in accordance with the START I Treaty  and the terms of the START II Treaty generally do not envision a  further reduction of the number of weapon platforms (the average  number of warheads on weapon platforms can be 1.9-2.2).    Second, the portion of warheads on mobile ICBMs is  increasing  in the ground component of Russia's strategic nuclear forces  which, along with the reduction of the other side's counterforce  potential, is drastically increasing survivability and,  consequentially, the deterrent potential of the SMT formation.    So, an analysis of the correlation of the combat potentials  of the existing and future U.S. strategic offensive weapons  formations and RF strategic nuclear forces indicates that a  reduction of warheads promotes the strengthening of  military-strategic stability and meets Russia's national  security interests.    The equality of the offensive and defensive potentials of  the  United States and Russia can be preserved with further  reductions of strategic offensive weapons (below 3,000 warheads)  and maintenance of a rational structure for the strategic  nuclear forces. However, as strategic offensive weapons are  reduced, the absolute significance of these potentials is also  reduced which could reduce the significance of nuclear arsenals  as a tool for maintaining military-strategic stability.    The employment of various approaches, while taking into  account the impact of the most significant factors that are  capable of having a negative impact on the military-strategic  balance in the period until 2010 (joint employment of nuclear  forces of the coalition of states, utilization of  precision-guided weapons during the course of a non-nuclear  period of military operations for strikes against CIS targets,  the employment of tactical aviation nuclear weapons in a nuclear  missile strike that is coordinated with strategic forces, or  deployment of even a limited U.S. territorial ABM [antiballistic  missile] defense), indicates that, from the point of view of the  stability of the military-strategic balance, the possibilities  for further reductions of strategic offensive weapons without  neutralization of destabilizing factors is quite limited,  although it does exist.    In my view, the transformation of the Triad into a Dyad by  reorienting all heavy bombers to the accomplishment of missions  in war with the employment of conventional weapons could be one  of the possible directions on this path.    Strategic aviation with nuclear weapons would certainly play  a priority and quite independent role in the nuclear strategy if  the sides did not have ICBMs and SLBMs. However, the  contribution of heavy bombers to the accomplishment of the  nuclear deterrence mission with the availability of adequate  ICBM and SLBM forces is, in my view, beyond the threshold of  discernibility. Obviously, therefore nothing is known about the  U.S. plans to conduct air operations in the process of and after  conducting massive nuclear strikes using ICBM and SLBM forces.  With the shift from the Triad to the Dyad, the sides' strategic  offensive weapons could be reduced in the manner being examined,  for example, to a level of 2,500 warheads.</p>

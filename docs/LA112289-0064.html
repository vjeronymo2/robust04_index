			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMMITTEE BACKS MORE FUNDING FOR FOOT  PATROLS  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council committee voted Tuesday to support spending more  money on a controversial police foot patrol program after funds originally  budgeted for it run out on Dec. 1.  </P> <P> The council's Budget and Finance Committee voted 3 to 0 to recommend spending  an additional $250,000 for the program. The matter now goes before the full  council, which earlier refused to override Mayor Tom Bradley's veto of a  $2.5-million budget for the program. Bradley called the expenditure a  "premature raid on the city's reserve fund."  </P> <P> The foot patrols, which began in September, apparently are highly popular among  residents in the 18 "crime hot spots" where they operate. Money for the first  three months of the program was allocated from the existing Police Department  budget.  </P></p>

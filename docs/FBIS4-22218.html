			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by R. Kronik, under rubric "Extreme Situation": </F> "But Our Television Center Is Operating"]    [Text] This is the first time that something like this has  happened since the blue screens lighted up in our apartments.  The Ostankino channel "went on strike," and one can understand  the disappointment on the part of the television viewers who  were unable on Thursday evening to see either the next segment  of the movie "Simply Maria" or "Santa Barbara."    The RF [Russian Federation] Trade Union of Communications  Workers carried out its threat against the government and the  television companies that owed the communications enterprises 80  billion rubles.    However, we were all pleasantly surprised when, after  switching our television sets to Channel 11, we saw the local  programs being transmitted. "How did you manage to do that?" we  asked A. A. Bichoyev, chairman of the KBR State Television and  Radio Company.    "Our State Television and Radio Company," he said, "is  carried on the budget and is financed from Moscow by the Russian  Television and Radio Administration. As a rule, we have a large  amount of difficulty getting the money from there. Frequently  there are delays in getting it. Back in December we were told  not to hurry to settle accounts with the communications workers.  We were told that, wherever they went, they would still be  working. But we did not take that course of action. Instead, we  attempted to settle accounts with the radio and television  broadcasting center. Just a few days ago we paid off the last  debt, and from now until the end of the month our program will  operate in the usual mode."    "On Thursday you even surpassed it."    "Yes, we were sorry for the television viewers in our  republic who were left without spiritual nourishment, and we  found the opportunity to continue the program for one and a half  hours. True, the movie that proved to be available was not one  of the best, but we hope that it kept some of our young people  in front of the screen, rather than wandering around aimlessly  in the street."    "You mentioned centralized financing. But what does  advertising provide?"    "We earn a miserly amount from it, unlike our associates in  Rostov, Volgograd, Chelyabinsk, and a number of other cities. In  our part of the country, unfortunately, many enterprises are  standing idle, and there are not too many that want to advertise  their products or services. We are taking the course of action  of, so to speak, tightening our belts, rather than becoming  debtors, since we realize that life is difficult for the RTPTs  [Radio and Television Broadcasting Center] also. We have normal  business relations with A. Khatsukov, who heads that center. We  try to help each other to the best of our ability, so that our  problems do not cause the television viewers and radio audience  to suffer, as happened on 10 February in most regions of Russia."</p>

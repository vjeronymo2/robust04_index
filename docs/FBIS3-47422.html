Anwar said  Sabah would have a bright future under a Barisan Nasional  government.    He said the unity of the people would be maintained to  strengthen the party so that it would be able to take over the  state.    Anwar, who is also finance minister, said the Barisan  Nasional would continue to safeguard the interests of the people  of Sabah.    "The Barisan Nasional will continue to strengthen unity  among  all races in Sabah," he said when addressing a large gathering  comprising Barisan Nasional leaders and members who braved the  rain to welcome him at the old airport here this evening.    Anwar, who is also UMNO [United Malays National  Organization]  deputy president, said unity among the people in the state was  vital towards ensuring victory over the Parti Bersatu Sabah in  the next elections.    "I thank all of you for coming here to welcome me and I  think  the future of the state under the national coalition is bright,"  he said to applause from the crowd.    He said the Barisan Nasional wanted Sabah to be as developed  as other states and that this would not be impossible if the  people gave their undivided support to the Barisan Nasional.  [passage omitted]    It was Anwar's first official visit here since he was  appointed deputy prime minister on 1 December. Anwar will visit  Tawau and Semporna tomorrow before returning to Kuala Lumpur in  the evening. [passage omitted]</p>

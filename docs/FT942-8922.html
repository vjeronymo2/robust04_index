			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Economic recovery aids Hanson Evidence of economic recovery in Hanson's two main areas of activity could be detected in many of the half year figures published by the Anglo-American conglomerate yesterday. Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said the first half of the financial year, to end-March, was 'marked by clear signs of emerging economic recovery in the UK and continuing improvement in the US'. He said the group's profits were still close to their trough, with the potential peak - based on the group's previous records in each division - at Pounds 1bn more in a full year. The group is involved in many cyclical areas - such as bricks, aggregates, lumber and polyethylene - which were now seeing the benefit of the economic upturn translated into rising volumes and increased prices, and in turn higher profits. At London Brick, for instance, volumes rose by 10 per cent and prices by 5 per cent with lower levels of price discounting too. As a result, brick stocks in the UK have fallen to less than four months worth. ARC, the aggregates business, increased prices between 6 and 10 per cent on March 1, while in the US, polyethylene prices were upped by 5 per cent, with every extra cent adding Dollars 35m to Dollars 40m (Pounds 27m) to operating profits in a full year. Forest products profits rose 20 per cent to Pounds 60m. Even so, some areas saw profit falls. Grove Cranes fell from Pounds 15m to Pounds 5m as excess equipment with dealers, both new and used, depressed markets in Europe and the US. Profits from SCM Chemicals, which makes titanium dioxide, fell 15 per cent to Pounds 44m as prices dropped 5 per cent, offsetting a 9 per cent rise in sales. The figures were the usual Hanson maze of one-off items, both positive and negative. Group sales in the half were ahead 17.7 per cent to Pounds 5.64bn, with Pounds 848m coming from acquisitions, virtually all from Quantum Chemical, bought on the final day of the last financial year. Operating profits from continuing businesses fell to Pounds 373m (Pounds 391m), but acquisitions contributed Pounds 70m. Quantum's polyethylene activities made Pounds 32m and Suburban Propane chipped in Pounds 38m. Discontinued operations such as Beazer Homes, floated in the half year, made Pounds 28m (Pounds 40m). A profit of Pounds 333m (Pounds 40m) was recorded from disposals, which includes the housebuilding sale, the office products business, and a number of small UK activities. There was a Pounds 155m swing on the interest line to a negative Pounds 119m. Mr Bill Landuyt, finance director, said this was in line with warnings made last December of an expected adverse swing during the current year of Pounds 275m. That left pre-tax profits at Pounds 683m, some 35 per cent up on Pounds 507m. Organic growth in operating profits was 8.4 per cent to Pounds 453m, with the rate accelerating between the first and second quarter, Mr Bonham said. That figure excluded disposal profits, and the Pounds 80m (Pounds 25m) cost of the Peabody coal strike, settled in December. A potential concern was a cash outflow of Pounds 246m. However, Mr Landuyt blamed most of this on a Pounds 387m rise in working capital which resulted from a number of changes. The refinancing of debt meant that Pounds 145m of accrued interest at the end of the last financial year had not been replaced, and the change of date for the budget - in advance of which Imperial Tobacco usually runs down its stock, left it with Pounds 80m higher working capital. Mr Landuyt said on a normalised basis, there would have been an inflow of Pounds 100m. The cash raised from disposals, which totalled Pounds 815m, and the issue of shares which brought in Pounds 116m, with Pounds 89m coming from the exercise of warrants issued in 1987 when Hanson bought Kidde, cut gearing from 86 per cent to 69 per cent over the six months.</p>

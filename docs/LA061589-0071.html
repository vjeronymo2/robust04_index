			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TONY CLARK TO TRANSFER TO CHRISTIAN  </P> <P> Tony Clark, section basketball player of the year and a first-team all-section  baseball pick as a junior, has announced he will transfer from Valhalla and  play his senior year at Christian High School in El Cajon.  </P> <P> Clark led the county in basketball scoring with 29.3 points a game for the  Norsemen and also led the county in home runs (11). He said he doesn't know  much about the athletic programs at Christian but that he plans on playing both  sports for the Patriots.  </P> <P> His decision was based on the private school's "attitude and atmosphere, not  athletics," Clark said. "Primarily, the decision was made by my parents. They  were concerned about my moral values. They thought I would be surrounded by  people with a positive attitude there."  </P> <P> For Clark to be eligible at Christian, he must have a section "public/private  transfer" form signed by Valhalla Principal Bob Avant. Clark said rumors were  circulating that Avant was reluctant to sign the form, but "there should be no  problem," he said. "As of now, it's going as it was drawn up."  </P> <P> Avant could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Christian, of the City Central League, competes in smaller-school Division IV  in the playoffs. Valhalla is a Division I school.  </P> <P> "The competition doesn't really make any difference," he said. "City league  teams are supposed to be better. From that standpoint, the level of competition  will rise." KIM Q. BERKSHIRE  </P></p>

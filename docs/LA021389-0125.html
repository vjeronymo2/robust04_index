			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PM BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S. TO SELL TRITIUM DESPITE PINCH  </P> <P> The Energy Department has decided to continue selling tritium to private  companies despite what it calls a serious pinch on supplies of the radioactive  gas used to make nuclear warheads, officials said today.  </P> <P> Last year the department, through its Oak Ridge National Laboratory in  Tennessee, sold about 240 grams of tritium to U.S. and foreign companies, and  this year's sales are projected at 230 grams, department spokesman Phil Keif  said.  </P> <P> "This is a small piece of the total production," he said, adding that the exact  total is classified.  </P> <P> The practice of commercial sales of tritium dates back several decades but it  has come under review by the Energy Department since production was halted last  spring at the Savannah River Plant -- the government's sole source of the gas.  </P></p>

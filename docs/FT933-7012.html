			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Natal sugar growers struggle against drought SUGAR GROWERS in Natal are struggling to save what they can of the drought-stricken 1993-1994 crop, which is expected to yield only 1.2m tonnes, down 300,000 tonnes from last year and 900,000 tonnes below the normal level, according to industry officials, reports Reuter from Durban. 'There was some rain in parts of Zululand but it is not going to do anything to this crop. It might save the cane roots from dying,' South African Sugar Cane Growers' Association executive director Mr Rex Hudson said. He added that the Natal south coast and midlands were the worst affected production areas. Extensive replanting would have to be done as a result of the drought, he said.</p>

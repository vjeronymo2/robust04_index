			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / New victim in bank scandal CITIBANK of the US has transferred the chief of its Indian investment banking operations following intense criticism of the bank's role in the Rs35bn (Pounds 816m) securities market scandal, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. Mr AS Thiyagarajan's departure for New York means the four foreign banks most active in the securities market have now lost their top officials since the scandal erupted in April. All four - Citibank, US-owned Bank of America, Australia's ANZ Grindlays and Standard Chartered Bank of the UK - were criticised by the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, and by a parliamentary committee investigating the scandal. A Citibank official confirmed Mr Thiyagarajan's transfer to the bank's headquaters but declined to comment on reports that he was being shifted after criticism from the Reserve Bank of India about Citibank's operations in India.</p>

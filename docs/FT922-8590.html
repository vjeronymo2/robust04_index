			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Sidlaw advances 41% to Pounds 4.6m SHARES IN Sidlaw outperformed the market yesterday with a 6 per cent rise to 296p as the oil services, packaging and textiles combine revealed interim profits 41 per cent ahead at Pounds 4.6m and a 14 per cent increase in the dividend. Mr Digby Morrow, chief executive, said the profits increase reflected the success of attempts to 'carefully position' the group. Sidlaw expanded into packaging three years ago to offset the more cyclical oil and textiles sectors. Turnover rose from Pounds 40.6m to Pounds 45m for the six months to March 31. The interim dividend is raised to 3.75p (3.3p), payable from earnings 34 per cent higher at 9.5p. The packaging division lead the way, with operating profits Pounds 700,000 higher at Pounds 2m, on sales 18 per cent higher at Pounds 18m. A two point rise in margins to 11 per cent and the inclusion for six months of Venus, the flexible packaging company acquired last year, was behind the increase in profits. Mr Morrow said the group intended to invest heavily in capital equipment. Some Pounds 3m was budgeted for packaging expenditure in the next 12 months. Oil services, where Sidlaw provides warehousing, manpower and management skills to the North Sea oil industry, enjoyed a Pounds 400,000 rise in profits to Pounds 2.7m . The benefits of the joint venture with the Dutch Smit group - which aims to provide supply chain management to on- and off-shore oil producers internationally - would not make a significant contribution for about three years, he said. The venture, announced in March, is expected to cost Sidlaw an initial Pounds 500,000. Textiles increased margins and profits in a difficult environment. The operating return increased from Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 500,000. Gearing fell from 26 per cent at the year-end to 21 per cent. Mr Ian Bodie, finance director, said this was expected to fall to less than 20 per cent and possibly as low as 15 per cent by the year-end.</p>

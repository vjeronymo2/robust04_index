			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Scottish sword-play: John Smith combines charm with menace, but can he persuade voters to support the Labour party It will be more a coronation than an election. Shortly after 2.30pm on Saturday, Mr John Smith will win the Labour party leadership by such a large margin of votes that the necessity for a three-month-long contest has already been called into question. Nonetheless, what has long been seen as a fait accompli will bestow upon the new leader a formidable measure of authority. That said, the mood in London's gloomy Royal Horticultural Hall is likely to be more sober than ecstatic. Though many of Mr Smith's supporters privately believe that it was he, not Mr Neil Kinnock, who should have led Labour into April's general election, some feel that, at 53, he may not be the perfect choice for the next election in 1996-97. Further, although Labour MPs agree that there is no alternative for now, doubts remain as to whether a cautious Scottish lawyer can persuade the electorate to abandon Mr John Major's leadership for his own. 'It will be our bank manager versus their bank manager,' one cynical Labour frontbencher muttered recently. 'The question I ask is: how do we persuade the public to risk moving their accounts?' That is the pessimists' view, born out of Labour's still unrelieved depression and a lacklustre leadership campaign that signally failed to function as an effective post-mortem on the election defeat. There are others, however, who believe that Mr Smith's accession may be unexpectedly timely. His age and natural authority, they claim, will contrast usefully with that of a still inexperienced prime minister, lending Labour a gravitas essential to complete the long march back to electability. The flamboyant Kinnock era of platform oratory, behind-the-scenes fixing and head-on confrontation with the Trotskyite left has purged the party of its early 1980s extremism in a way that would have been more difficult for a leader from the right wing of the party. Now, just three months after the election, the economy and Europe have left the government again looking divided - ripe for the forensic skills of a heavyweight Edinburgh advocate whose despatch box credentials are already proven. Mr Smith, his enthusiastic supporters claim, is ideally suited to a new era in British politics - one not of grand ideological clashes, but the close-quarters cut and thrust of two versions of pragmatism, vying for the centre ground. Talking in his Westminster office this month, Smith made clear that his two prime personal objectives remain down to earth: to address Britain's industrial failures and to use education and training as the tool to 'liberate' the lives of the less well-off. It is a manager's vision that assumes a collaborative instinct in society and quarrels with the notion that Conservatism runs with the self-interested grain of human nat-ure. 'We are only fulfilled properly in the community. Of course we want a good house and a good job . . . but we also want a decent society that cares for the less well-off.' Labour's 14th party leader traces such convictions to his Highland roots as the oldest child of a primary school headmaster in Ardrishaig, an isolated coastal village situated half way down Argyll's misty Kintyre peninsular. A cheerful child, his earliest influences stemmed from the presbyterian socialism of his father Archibald - replenished weekly by the arrival of the New Statesman - a warm, artistic mother and two admiring younger sisters. Mr Iain 'Eeny' McGregor, a contemporary, remembers Smith as a child prodigy who, as young as 10 years old, was already lecturing his schoolmates on the benefits of the National Health Service and the importance of nationalising coal. 'We all wanted to play cowboys and Indians, but John was able to hold our attention although no one really understood what he was on about,' he recalls. By the time he reached Glasgow University, he was regarded by the Labour club's young tyros - like Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow Scottish secretary - as an experienced political operator, if one who combined his politics with a rumbustious conviviality, Gaelic singing, frequent laughter and generous helpings of whisky and beer. The student politician had little time for the Bevan versus Gaitskell schism dominating Labour at the time. To this day, Smith scorns ideology in favour of practical solutions to the perennial if pedantic human problems of poverty and poor education. 'Political activity is above all moral activity,' he said last month. For Smith, the Good Samaritan is a more appropriate role model than intellectuals such as Marx, whom he is proud never to have read. Mr Donald MacCormick, the television journalist and friend from university days, remembers that unlike other students, Smith was already a figure in Scottish politics, attending conferences, canvassing in local elections and, at 23, vigorously contesting the safe Tory seat of East Fyfe in 1961. 'He was by no means the statesmanlike prime minister in waiting, but where some of us were dilettante, John was already professional,' he observed. That single-mindedness took Smith to the Scottish bar - an option that combined security with the chance to hone debating skills. By the time the 31-year-old Smith was elected for Airdrie and Coatbridge (later North Lanark) in 1970, colleagues at the Scottish bar agreed he was throwing away a career that would have offered fortune if not fame. Yet within little more than a year in parliament, he risked jettisoning his political future by joining the 69 Labour rebels who ignored a three-line whip and backed Britain's accession to the European Community. It was his first and only serious confrontation with the party establishment. Despite his rebellion, promotion came rapidly. After declining Harold Wilson's offer of a Scot-tish job, he rose swiftly to minister of state in the energy department under Mr Tony Benn - who, though often an opponent, still describes him as 'able and charming'. Under Jim Callaghan's leadership in 1977-78, Smith's barrister's skills were put to use in the effort to devolve powers to Scottish and Welsh national assemblies against the formidable unionist obstacles of Mr Tam Dalyell, the Labour maverick, and Mr Enoch Powell. His reward - despite defeat in the subsequent referendum - was to be (at 39) Callaghan's youngest cabinet minister at the Department of Trade, Prices and Consumer Protection, enough time to introduce legislation against insider trading before the election defeat of 1979. In opposition, Smith has built his name on harrying the government. His merciless attacks on Leon (now Sir Leon) Brittan during the Westland affair earned him the shadow chancellorship from which he bear-baited Nigel (now Lord) Lawson in clashes remembered as among the most effective of recent times. Despite his heart attack in 1988, there has seldom been any doubt that the shadow chancellor was Neil Kinnock's natural (if not preferred) successor. An unflappable television performer whose moral standpoint, sharp wit and occasional irascibility combine charm with menace, he is understandably the Labour opponent most Conservatives most fear. What is more, inside a party criticised for being driven by the whims of public opinion, his loyalty to an old-fashioned redistributionist Labourism has won him respect. 'I haven't basically changed my political stance since I was a student,' he commented. Was that a good thing? 'I don't know . . . but it is slightly better than all those left-wingers who are now Thatcherite stockbrokers,' came the reply. Yet for all this admirable consistency, serious doubts must remain as to whether the electoral mountain can be conquered. Few believe the seven and a half percentage points that divided the two main parties in April can be bridged by integrity and personality alone. The party leader-to-be has given some clues as to how he means to proceed. For up to a year, detailed policy issues will be put to one side to allow a wide-ranging debate on the goals of a modern social democratic party as it approaches the millennium. It is clear that the aim is to conquer new ground by remodelling the state as champion of the individual against entrenched vested interests, whether of the public sector or privatised industries. Stress will be placed on government as pro-active 'empowerer' of the community's collective interests. The broad thrust of Labour's 1992 manifesto is unlikely to undergo radical revision. It is the tone and packaging of its proposals for reviving industrial investment and enhancing education and skills training that will be given greater prominence. Mr Smith's conviction is that the nitty-gritty business of making Britain function more efficiently should take precedence. Nonetheless, the rumbling symbolic battles over the role of the unions, the party constitution's Clause Four (which advocates state ownership), or electoral reform, all threaten to set the self-proclaimed 'modernisers' against party conservatives. Both sides will expect the leader's backing. His instincts tend to lie closest to opponents of deep-rooted change, but finding compromises will test his untried skills of party management. As some of his Kinnockite critics have argued, the canny shadow chancellor often kept out of the firing line when some of the biggest battles of the past decade were being fought. He has never been a member of the party's policy-making national executive committee, of which he will now be primus inter pares. Collegiate by instinct, confident by nature, Smith is promising to end the bunker mentality of the Leader of the Opposition's office and integrate it with party headquarters in Walworth Road. Yet his strategy for winning the backing of his party and the electorate at the next election is ultimately based, in his own ponderously legalistic phrase, on 'analytical reasoning and persuasive exposition'. His admirers believe that if he can convey both his own good nature and his seldom exposed passion to the electorate, Smith could shed some of the boring bank manager image. He is ready to embrace whatever changes are necessary, whether they be in policy or the party's internal structures. But his core values - a very Scottish species of practical Christian socialism - are not negotiable. Instead, he is convinced his task now is to persuade the electorate to make them theirs. It must remain in question whether the south of England will ever be ready to do so.</p>

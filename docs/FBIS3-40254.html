He studied dentistry in Belgrade, where he  achieved notable success as a youth functionary. Upon receiving  his diploma, he got a job at the Knin Health Center, but  completed his specialization in Sarajevo. To the people of Knin,  however, Babic is much less known as a dentist--there is a  witness (the name and address are known to the editors) who  alleges that Babic accidentally pulled one of his healthy  teeth--than as a politician; among other things, he was the  party secretary at his health center. He witnessed the  disintegration of the LCY [League of Communists of Yugoslavia]  as an LCC [League of Communists of Croatia] delegate at its  last, 14th congress. Behind the scenes, he opposed Ivica Racan  and part of the Croatian delegation, failing to comprehend what  they had against Slobodan Milosevic and why they were supporting  the Slovenes. He returned to Knin, definitively breaking with  the reform faction of the Croatian communists and launching his  career as a national politician.    Under the supervision of Dr. Jovan Raskovic, Babic quickly  became one of the founders of the SDS [Serbian Democratic  Party]. He ran for the post of president of Knin Opstina in the  first multiparty elections in Croatia in 1990 and was elected.  However, he was not satisfied with the results of the elections;  the SDS won in only three of the total of 11 Serb opstinas in  Croatia. In this way, Raskovic was forced to negotiate with  high-ranking Croatian functionaries (it appeared to be a matter  of days before he would be officially declared the new Svetozar  Pribicevic), and Babic himself conducted some of the  negotiations, especially with the ministers in the Croatian  Government in charge of the economy. He sought the combination  of the northern Dalmatian and Lika opstinas into one community  that would be better able to develop. The Croatian side,  however, wanting to be done with the communists once and for  all, allowed the SDS to repeat the elections in an  "antibureaucratic" manner--Zagreb figured that this would  satisfy Raskovic, and that he would support them in the  inevitable conflict with Milosevic. Throughout the summer of  1990, Krajina teemed with various SDS rallies. Besides Raskovic,  Babic was an obligatory speaker. While the former spoke about  the Serb soul, the latter dealt with the Serb stomach; while the  party chairman met with priests, the president of Knin Opstina  set up the party apparatus; while the psychiatrist attended  village feast celebrations, the dentist spent endless hours at  meetings of activists. Along the way, Babic the pragmatist  accumulated various executive functions. At the end of the  summer of 1990, the bills finally came due: Dr. Tudjman asked  Raskovic to take a definitive stance toward Serbia. The latter  was unable to do so, in part because of his personal ties with  the SANU [Serbian Academy of Science and Art] and Francuska  Street 7, in part because of pressure coming from within his own  party. At their last meeting, Raskovic explained to Tudjman why  he should not strain relations with Serbs in Croatia too much,  providing the legendary explanation: "The Serbs are an insane  nation." Then he made two mistakes: He did not inform the SDS  leadership of what happened at the meeting, and he left for the  United States. The notes from the meeting published by DANAS in  Zagreb spelled the end of his political career. Babic pointed  out to his fellow fighters, there you have it, Uncle Jovan is  good and intelligent, but he is frivolous and naive, and in his  absence Babic took over the party. The situation was also more  than advantageous for him: Public debate was in full swing  concerning amendments to the Croatian Constitution, i.e., the  introduction of new symbols (the odious "checkerboard" flag) and  the elimination of the Serbs as a constituent nation, as that  would be characterized today.    In any event, the barricades appeared on 17 August as a Serb  reaction to the Croat reaction that the announced referendum on  autonomy for Krajina would be prevented "by all means." It  seemed that everyone in the crowd that emerged was confused--the  Croat policemen sent to remove the barricades, the Serbs at the  barricades, the tourists forced to take detours, Dr. Raskovic,  and Dr. Tudjman--everyone except Milan Babic. In his capacity as  president of the opstina, he declared a state of war on Radio  Knin, reported attacks by "Tudjman's special forces," said that  he had proof that chemical warfare was being waged, and  instructed the population to save ammunition after the victory  by the "Red Star" because it would soon be very necessary. All  authority in Knin was his now. There were no more serious  negotiations with Croatia. Everyone who attempted to negotiate,  such as Veljko Dzakula, or the former Assembly deputy Radoslav  Tanjga, received Babic's anathema. It was obvious that the  president of the SAO [Serb Autonomous Region of] Krajina was  doing little at his own initiative; after the 9 March 1991  demonstration in Belgrade, he sent Slobodan Milosevic a letter  of support and demanded a settling of scores with "the  Draskovicites and students" for the sake of Serb unity.    Many regard Plitvice Easter, 1 April 1991, as the beginning  of the war in Croatia. The day before, Babic declared  unification with Serbia in Korenica, taking the Serbian  parliament completely by surprise and showing that dealing with  him would not exactly be an easy thing. The open warfare that  subsequently broke out put many things on the back burner, until  it was "frozen"--by the signing of the Vance plan. In the  meantime, Babic had advanced to the post of president of the RSK  [Republic of Serbian Krajina], and as such he was the sole  master of Krajina. He figured that trade with his state was  secure, and to the surprise of everyone, he refused to sign the  plan. He was assailed for hours at a meeting of the SFRY  Presidency, but he refused to budge. Finally, Slobodan Milosevic  was forced to write an open letter calling for his dismissal.  The people of Knin remained faithful to their opstina president  ("Slobodan, write another letter, we did not understand the  first one"), but executors of the deed were found in the persons  of Goran Hadzic and Mile Paspalj. Babic was replaced, and his  political fate seemed sealed.    Babic, treated as a potential rebel, spent the period  following his dismissal criticizing the new Krajina leadership  and the Vance plan. He let it be known that he had no intention  of retreating and that he was prepared to wait. On two occasions  he was mistreated: Under unclarified circumstances, in March  1992, officer Zdravko Vranjes fired his gun at his apartment,  and in July of the same year a group of unknown policemen beat  him up in Benkovac and held a pistol in his mouth. Nevertheless,  after a ritual reconciliation with Martic in October 1992 (they  had fallen out over the Vance plan), things began to look up for  Babic. It also turned out that he had evolved and mastered the  political vocation. He is cold-blooded, does not expose himself  in Krajina political showdowns, and in general he uses  others--the local radicals, for example--to skillfully advance  his aims. He is patiently building a party with numerous people  who are dissatisfied with the Hadzic team, which is no problem  whatsoever under the conditions of everyday life in Krajina.  They say that he has changed quite a lot in waiting for his five  minutes, but that in one regard he has remained consistent: He  will never go back to Croatia, no matter what the price.</p>

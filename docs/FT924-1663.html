			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Yeltsin pins export hopes on China visit PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia today begins a three-day visit to China which will underline the two countries' mutual need for good relations despite the different paths they are taking away from communist ideology. Mr Yeltsin hopes to win some 20 agreements on industrial and technical co-operation and trade. Trade is growing and is expected to approach Dollars 5bn this year, of which arms sales to Beijing are a significant component. His visit is the first by a top Moscow official since Mr Mikhail Gorbachev received a hero's welcome from pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing in 1989. Russia, which has suffered a sharp contraction of export markets, sees Chinese demand for arms as a way of keeping defence industries going and retaining jobs. This year, it has sold 24 Su27 high performance fighter planes, missile guidance technology, rocket engines and MiG-31 interceptors to Beijing, causing consternation among China's Asian neighbours. A diplomat in Beijing said: 'The Chinese need to replace just about every bit of military equipment they've got and Russia is the only country that will sell it to them.' China's communist leaders are adopting a pragmatic approach, wooing the new states of the former Soviet empire and at the same time denouncing the betrayers of communism. Mr Igor Rogachev, Russian ambassador to China, said that as nuclear powers and permanent members of the UN Security Council, the two countries were important influences on global and Asia-Pacific peace and stability. Mr Yeltsin is due to meet Chinese premier Li Peng and Jiang Zemin, Communist Party general secretary. Asked yesterday why authoritarian China was more successful in its economic reforms than democratising Russia, Mr Yeltsin said: 'China has been reforming for 14 years - we started only less than a year ago.' The brusque reply disguises the fact that many Russian industrialists admire the Chinese path: Mr Arkady Volsky, the industrialists' leader, has talked warmly of the Chinese model, while insisting he does not wish to copy its adherence to communism.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> TRACT OKD WITHOUT LOW-INCOME UNITS  </P> <P> The City Council has approved a 3,700-home development near the Tustin Marine  Corps Air Station without requiring that the Irvine Co. include any housing for  low-income residents in the project.  </P> <P> Critics protested after Tuesday night's five-hour public hearing that the  council's action ignores housing goals approved last year by the former City  Council. Those housing goals call for 12 1/2% of housing in Irvine to be set  aside for families earning half or less of the county's median income and  another 12 1/2% for other low-income families.  </P> <P> The council approved the Westpark II development by a 3-1 vote, with  Councilwoman Paula Werner dissenting.  </P> <P> "Did we get enough out of (the Irvine Co.) in what we approved tonight?" Werner  said after the meeting. "No, I don't believe so."  </P> <P> The plan approved by the council requires the Irvine Co. to ensure that at  least 10% of the units built in Westpark II are affordable to families earning  up to half the county's median income, or $24,550 for a family of four. But the  requirement takes effect only if the company receives government subsidies to  build the units.  </P> <P> The plan, though, does require the company to build housing units, convert  existing housing in the city or pay fees aimed at providing 385 units for  families earning less than 80% of the county's median, or about $39,280 for a  family of four.  </P> <P> But since the plan gives the Irvine Co. options around actually building the  low-income units, the company likely will build none, said Mary Ann Gaido, who  was on the Planning Commission when it drafted the housing goals.  </P> <P> "This is a major change for this city," Gaido said. "It's a major financial  giveaway to the Irvine Co."  </P> <P> Recent projects approved by the former City Council majority mandated that at  least 10% of the units built be affordable to families earning half the  county's median without guarantees of government subsidies.  </P> <P> Approval of Westpark II, which will be located on 350 acres west of Culver  Drive between Barranca Parkway and Irvine Center Drive, caps three public  hearings before the City Council and several previous hearings before the  Planning Commission. The approval requires a routine second council vote later  this month.  </P> <P> Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan and the other council members voting for the project  said they are not turning away from the city's goal of providing affordable  housing.  </P> <P> Since the city's housing plan has a goal that 25% of housing should be  affordable to various income groups, she said, mandating builders to follow  that could effectively stop new houses, including affordable housing, from  being built.  </P> <P> "Do you want do-able housing, or do you want to make the rules so onerous that  you can't build any houses at all?" Sheridan said. "That just exacerbates the  (housing) problem."  </P> <P> Councilman William A. (Art) Bloomer said he is optimistic that financial  subsidies will be available to allow the Irvine Co. to build the affordable  units and meet the city's low-income housing goal.  </P> <P> "A lot of people would have liked to see this (requirement) laid entirely on  the Irvine Co.'s back," Bloomer said. "And I think if we had done this, the  Irvine Co. would have pulled back on this project."  </P> <P> Even without mandatory requirements for affordable housing, the Irvine Co. is  committed to building affordable units in the new Westpark II and will work  with the city to find the financing, said Michael Le Blanc, vice  president-entitlement for Irvine Community Builders, the Irvine Co.'s  residential building wing.  </P> <P> If tract maps for Westpark II are approved on schedule, homes could start going  up in just over a year, Le Blanc said. Tuesday's plan requires the company to  provide five neighborhood parks and set aside land for two schools and two  child-care centers. TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister denies apple juice hazard THE Government yesterday denied that it had put public health at risk by allowing the continued sale of apple juice which contained high levels of a chemical which can cause cancer and birth defects. The Ministry of Agriculture confirmed that high levels of patulin, produced by moulds on rotting apples, had been found in five out of 32 samples of apple juice tested in March. Mr Nicholas Soames, the food minister, told the Commons that the levels of patulin discovered in the juice were not considered an 'immediate hazard to health'. The findings had been referred to the official Committee on Toxicity, and a report would be published next month, the minister said. Answering an emergency question from the opposition, Mr Soames said that agriculture ministry in accordance with the 'best scientific advice available in the land'. He said food safety standards in Britain were the highest in the world. Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman (C Lancaster) demanded: 'Will you assure the young woman who rang my constituency office this morning, and is expecting a baby shortly, that she need have no fears for the baby or herself?' Mr Soames replied: 'I am happy to give the absolute assurance that that is the case.' Mr Gavin Strang, Labour spokesman on agriculture, said the government had not denied that patulin could cause cancer and other 'life-threatening' conditions. The government should have immediately published the test results last year and 'removed all toxic apple juice from the shelves,' he said. Their failure to do so underlined the need for an independent food standards agency, he said. But Mr Soames accused him of 'ridiculous and idiotic scare-mongering'. Supermarket chains such as Sainsbury and Marks &amp; Spencer said yesterday that they rigorously screened their apple juice for patulin. However, the Consumers' Association said that the public should have been told as soon as the high levels of patulin were discovered. 'The government's handling of the problem is the latest in a long line of cover-ups by the government,' said Mr John Beishon, the association's director.</p>

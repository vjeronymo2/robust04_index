			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Project Themes and Objectives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Introduce African judges to the American legal system and the principles upon which it is based, particularly the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Provide a formal training component for the dual purpose of benefiting the individual visiting judges and enabling them to develop improved in-service training programs for colleagues in their home countries; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Discuss constitutional issues including due process, rules of evidence, equal protection and criminal procedure; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Demonstrate various U.S. models for enhancing judicial efficiency, including caseload management and trial conduct techniques and alternative dispute resolution; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Promote long-term linkages between African and U.S. court systems to foster dialogue on issues of common concern and to enhance the institutional capabilities of the African judiciaries; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Develop and/or purchase specialized support materials for participating institutions in each of the target countries. Such materials might include but are not limited to legal reference and research books, training videos, textbooks or other instructional materials. Grant monies of $30,000 must be used for this purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Participants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The African participants will be judges selected through coordination among U.S. Information Service personnel in the target countries, USIA, and the African partner institutions. All participants must have strong English-language skills. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. consultants who will travel to Africa will be selected by the grantee institution in consultation with USIA. The grantee should provide the names of American participants and brief, relevant biographical data. American participants should be selected on the basis of their experience and expertise in the thematic field. Experience in communicating to foreign audiences and general knowledge of Africa and of the countries involved in the project are highly desirable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Recommended Program Structure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following suggestions should not serve as a blueprint, but as a stimulus for the development of an original program design. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Phase One:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The program could begin with a 3&hyph;4 week U.S. study tour for a group of approximately 10&hyph;12 judges representing the target countries. The study tour should allow the African jurists to visit several locations in the U.S. and should include cultural activities as well as the following professional components: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _A series of field visits to familiarize the visiting jurists with the operations of courts and other legal institutions such as bar associations, law schools, and legal training organizations; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _An intensive visit of several days duration to a state court system which is of a scale similar to the national courts of the target countries; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Formal judicial training to address the program themes in both the constitutional and court administration areas; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _A concluding session to evaluate the study tour, make plans for the follow-up visit of American specialists to Africa, and discuss needs for the specialized support materials to be provided with grant funds. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Phase Two:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One or more American judges, judicial training specialists and/or experienced court administrators would visit each of the target countries for consultations, workshops or other activities with local counterparts. Ideally, the Americans would work closely with Africans who participated in Phase One to build on that earlier phase. For example, they might collaborate to train and to plan professional development programs for many others. One approach might be for the Americans and their Phase One African partners to conduct week-long workshops for 10&hyph;20 African judges on selected constitutional or court management issues; another approach might be to convene 10&hyph;20 African judges to begin designing a country-specific professional development program of coursework and practical experience and technical progress. In planning these follow-up activities, the grantee should work closely with the African participants in the U.S. study tour and with U.S. Information Service personnel in Africa to ensure that the activities are tailored to meet the needs of the African countries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

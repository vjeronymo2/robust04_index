			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): A reader writes . . . Having just returned from a four-day holiday in Paris, I felt compelled to write regarding the daylight robbery of holiday-makers by currency shops. My first transaction - a Pounds 100 traveller's cheque on October 26 via Banque Indosuez - was at a rate of 8.18 francs to the pound. This resulted in an exchange of 818 francs, inclusive of commission. My second transaction the following day was at a Chequepoint Bureau adjacent to the Pompidou Centre. When I inquired about the rate, the clerk pointed to a board which displayed numerous figures and conditions - all, of course, in French, which I do not speak. While the rate of FFr8.05 did not appear quite as good as my previous day's exchange, I was happy to proceed on the basis of expediency. So, I signed my traveller's cheque for Pounds 200. The clerk then made a lengthy telephone call which, he said, was necessary to safeguard my interests against theft. Following this, I was presented with FFr1,430 and a receipt showing an exchange rate of FFr7.15. I questioned this but was told it was correct. An argument ensued, during which I asked for the transaction to be cancelled and demanded my cheque be returned. I was not successful so I went to Chequepoint's head office in the Avenue des Champs-Elysees. There, I encountered a very hostile manager. Incidentally, I checked the bank rate later that day with Banque Indosuez; it was FFr8.12. The difference of FFr0.97 between the two rates is 11.9 per cent - which is quite extortionate. My error, of course, was in not firmly establishing the rate beforehand. But I cannot imagine why the authorities in France allow such money shops to operate. I would be most interested to hear if you have received letters from other aggrieved travellers. I should also be interested to know if there is any authority in France to which I can write on this subject. The French need to bring the activities of these 'money bandits' to heel.

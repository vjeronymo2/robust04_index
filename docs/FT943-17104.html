			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Strike hits Norway's hospitals The Norwegian government yesterday ordered more than 1,500 nurses and other health workers back to work after a three-day strike that affected 38 hospitals and clinics. The minister for local government, Mr Gunnar Berge, met representatives for the Norwegian Nurses Association and four other hospital workers' unions and told them of the government's decision to force the striking parties to take the conflict to legal arbitration today. The conflict, centering around the female nurses' demand for equal pay with their male colleagues, has reportedly led to serious consequences at the 38 hospitals and clinics involved. Several cancer operations and other vital surgery were cancelled during the strike and many people in need of hospital-care were turned away without treatment. 'Since we don't see any willingness from the five unions to return to negotiations, we have to consider the suffering by the sick and the serious consequences this conflict is causing, we have decided to force the parties to come to legal arbitration tomorrow,' Mr Berge said in a statement to reporters.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / European Law: A code for EC lobbying A key committee of the European Parliament is considering a report containing proposals aimed at 'laying down rules governing the representation of special interest groups at the European Parliament'. In other words, the EC Parliament will consider regulating lobbying. Lobbying - which could be generally defined as the influencing of legislative, regulatory and political decision-making - is one of the ways in which the governed communicate with government and is very serious business in the EC. The report marks the beginning of an important debate within the EC, a debate whose outcome will determine no less than the integrity and effectiveness of the European Community's law-making processes. While it technically addresses lobbying of the EC Parliament only, the EC Commission has also begun to consider this subject, and the debate in one body will undoubtedly be heard in the other. The title of the report is a bit too modest, for while it refers only to 'special interest groups' (one imagines truffle producers or vinegar bottlers), it actually applies as well to general interest groups such as associations of labour unions, manufacturers, employers and others. The primary author and 'rapporteur' of the report is Marc Galle, MEP, a courtly former literature professor whose gracious manner belies his canny wisdom. Mr Galle, a Belgian, was confronted with two main questions: should lobbyists be required to be 'registered', and should there be a code of conduct applied to lobbyists? While it still faces many changes and amendments, the report answers both these basic questions in the affirmative. It does not actually propose a code, only that one be drawn up, with input from lobbyists. At its worst, such a code of conduct could isolate decision makers from lobbyists or, at the other extreme, allow lobbyists to exert improper influence. At its best, the code could steer the EC away from the sort of seamy system that now exists in the US, where the giving of money is intertwined with the exertion of influence over legislation. Drawing on some years of experience in both Washington and Brussels, I would offer the EC Parliament, and eventually the EC Commission, these suggestions for a lobbying code: Distinguish between obtaining information and lobbying; only the latter should be subject to registration, a code or any regulation whatsoever. Information in the EC - for example, the status of a directive, the scheduling of an official meeting, the text of an official document - should either be public or confidential. If it is public, anyone who asks should be able to obtain it. It should not be given, as is now often the case, to lobbyists or some lobbyists, based on who their friends are. If information is confidential, it should be made available to no one outside the EC offices working on the matter. Have a clear definition of what constitutes lobbying, thus requiring registration and code compliance. Here again, the EC should avoid the US experience of having a law (in the US it is the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act of 1946) with so many uncertainties that it is virtually unenforceable and unenforced. Distinguish between being paid to lobby, by an employer or a client, and lobbying out of personal interest. Here, the US experience is positively instructive, since there is a constitutional protection of the right to petition the government. Ordinary people in Europe should be encouraged to lobby the EC and should face no restrictions. Impose a clear separation between lobbying and the giving of money or anything else or value. One could argue whether inviting an MEP or EC official to lunch or dinner is corrupting. As long as a particular lobbyist does not consistently entertain a particular official who has authority over a matter the lobbyist is working on, I do not think so. But the real question here has to do with lobbyists paying MEPs, their assistants or other EC officials, be it outright or under some form of employment or consulting contract, or making other gifts that are of greater than nominal value. Have rules that will reveal generally which principal is lobbying what issue, but do not impose such stringent, bureaucratic or vague requirements as to constitute a barrier to proper lobbying. Lobbying should be a right, and the public should have a similar right to know generally who is lobbying on what. Here, Mr Galle's report sounds the right note, explicitly seeking to ensure that 'lobbying is transparent (and) that various lobbying groups are placed on an equal footing'. Another US law, the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, has the opposite problem from the 1946 Lobbying Act: it requires so much detail that it has often been criticised as being unduly burdensome. Do not discriminate between lobbyists from the EC versus those from without. Doing so would be a form of protectionism and could invite damaging retaliation. To the extent such limitations exist outside the EC, the EC should use the present process as leverage to get those limitations removed.

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / BT warns on outlook for dividends: Improvement in profits, volumes and advertising demand - Shares slip 7p FIRST-HALF results at British Telecommunications reflected a modest recovery in the UK economy, with improvements in profits, call volumes and demand for Yellow Pages advertising. The shares slipped 7p to 469 1/2 p, however, on warnings that the present rate of dividend growth was unlikely to be maintained. Mr Iain Vallance, BT chairman, announced an interim payment of 6.65p, up 8.1 per cent. But 'future dividend policy will need, more than ever, to take account of continuing low inflation, harsher regulation, tougher competition and emerging long-term needs and opportunities'. The City interpreted his remarks to mean that current market expectations of secure dividend growth of 8.5 per cent or so with a dividend cover of about 1.7 times, were unrealistic. Under the terms of its licence, BT must keep increases in its main prices to the rate of inflation minus 7 1/2 per cent. BT has been making clear the difficulty of meeting a formula set when inflation was significantly higher than now. Last week it announced the first Pounds 125m of Pounds 500m worth of price cuts to stay within the limit. Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 grew almost 50 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn from Pounds 1.02bn. After adjustments for redundancy charges and losses on disposals, however, the true increase was only 2.5 per cent. In the first six months of 1992, the company took redundancy charges of Pounds 442m and disposal losses of Pounds 135m, compared with Pounds 150m and a profit of Pounds 2m respectively this time. Turnover was up 3.5 per cent to Pounds 6.76m. Earnings per share came out 45 per cent ahead at 15.6p - but leaving aside charges and disposals the increase was only 0.3 per cent. Inland call volume grew 1.4 per cent in the half year and 3.5 per cent in the second quarter, compared with a decline of about 1 per cent a year ago. The increase in call volume more than compensated for volume discounts introduced through the year, BT said. On a 12-month moving average, there was a 3 per cent increase in inland call turnover and a 7 per cent increase in international call turnover. During the first half 4,400 people left the company. Some 30,000 are expected to leave within two years. Mr Vallance said the company was in continuous talks with a broad range of prospective partners in new businesses including multimedia and entertainment. Lex, Page 20, London SE, Page 42</p>

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (11): Reaching for the stars - Stewart Dalby asks whether more hotels are needed ON THE face of it, Cardiff seems to have plenty of hotels. If you emerge from Central station and look skywards slightly to the right, your eyes are met by the masthead of the Holiday Inn (182 rooms). It is unusual to see a Holiday Inn in a British city centre: they tend to be built on the periphery of towns, close to motorways. Two hundred yards from the Holiday Inn, past the ice rink, is the International Hotel (143 rooms), built by Brent Walker at a cost of Pounds 7.5m, and opened last September. If, instead of crossing St Mary's Street to the Holiday Inn in Mill lane, you turn left down St Mary's Street, you quickly come to the Royal Hotel (63 rooms). Continue past St David's Hall, and you come to the Angel Hotel (91 rooms). Situated between Cardiff Castle and the Arms Park rugby ground, the Angel describes itself as the city's premier hotel. Close by is the Park Hotel (119 rooms) and the Crest Hotel (157 rooms). Farther out, near to the motorway, are the Post House (150 rooms) and the Moat House (144 rooms). All of these are three- or four-star hotels. Most could be described as new 'business' or old 'town' hotels. They all charge between Pounds 50 and Pounds 80 a night. If a couple of places not mentioned are included, the total number of bedrooms in quality hotels is around 1,000 to 1200. If one were to include two-star hotels, Cardiff probably has some 6,000 rooms available. How much accommodation does a city need? Albeit a capital city, though one which is not yet an established business-and-services centre, nor on the well-mapped circuit for cultural and heritage tourists? For the moment, the answer would seem to be: about what it has got. The occupancy rate of the Holiday Inn, for example, is 70 per cent, spread through the week. It is full of business people during weekdays, while weekends are a moveable feast. If there happens to be a rugby international at Cardiff Arms park, the hotel is full to overflowing; if there is not, it can be empty. According to Jack Nicholas, general manager of the Holiday Inn, a good weekend trade was beginning to build in family tourists taking advantage of heavily discounted room prices. But this was thwarted by the Gulf war and the recession. The past few months have seen a decline in weekend bookings. Most of Cardiff's other quality hotels probably have occupancy rates similar to that of the Holiday Inn, though the International Hotel has an occupancy rate of 50 per cent, being a new hotel still building up business. If supply seems to be roughly in line with current demand, the situation could soon change, even though a Copthorne hotel is being built, for Cardiff has aspirations to become both an important business-and-services centre and a cultural tourist city, in the manner of York, Chester or even Glasgow. For most people, the transformation to a services or business city is linked with the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. When the barrage is built across the bay, Cardiff could become a maritime city with some 5m sq ft of extra office space, many tourist and leisure facilities, and 30,000 new jobs in buildings that will be put up on what is now largely derelict land. The development corporation believes it will be 10 to 15 years before these targets are realised. Before then, other developments could ensure a greater demand for hotel rooms. Opposite the International Hotel is the half-finished World Trade Centre, being developed by Brent Walker. Technical problems have delayed its completion. But with a city grant and a soft loan from the European Investment Bank, it should now be finished by the middle of next year. It will have exhibition space and conference facilities for 5,000 people. Brent Walker also bought the ice rink in 1989. It has managed to change its use designation (though it is home to a successful ice-hockey team, which will continue to use it), and it can now be covered over and used, for example, for rock concerts. It seats 4,000. Despite Brent Walker's well publicised financial problems of the past year, these projects are proceeding, and will mean a greater demand for hotel space. So, too, may the efforts being made by Cardiff Marketing, a private company supported by local councils and the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. The thought underlying Cardiff Marketing's efforts is that, if Glasgow can be publicised into life, then why not Cardiff? It is, after all, a capital city with a rich cultural identity. It is estimated that 2m visitors went to Cardiff last year, but fewer than 100,000 went to tourist centres for information. The potential is therefore considerable. The city may even get a five-star hotel.</p>

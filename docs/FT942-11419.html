			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (3): The partnership strengthens - Britain's president of the Board of Trade aims to work closely with industry UK government policy has witnessed a sea-change during the past two years. While this may not add up to the level of intervention which some exporters had hoped for, indeed expected, from president of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine, exporters are generally happier with the level of support they receive from government than during, particularly, the autumn years of the Thatcher era. At that time some Treasury officials, for example, even spoke darkly of abolishing altogether what remained of the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGG) after the latter's short-term insurance division had been sold off to the Dutch insurer NCM. In the event ECGD survived and its former short-term insurance section run by NCM in Cardiff enjoys considerable government reinsurance support to underpin its operation. Meanwhile, Mr Heseltine and minister for trade Richard Needham are continuing to build a government and industry export partnership - a theme which these days also resonates around Downing Street - to help UK-based companies maximise overseas sales. 'I have always believed that a partnership between government and industry is vital to improve Britain's competitiveness, a matter I have put at the top of my department's agenda as the key to winning in markets and thereby achieving greater prosperity,' Mr Heseltine told the FT Exporter. 'My colleagues and I have restructured the Department (of Trade and Industry) to get closer to industry and to serve it better,' he adds. For years British exporters have complained that many of their competitors - French exporters have been habitually singled out - have received greater export credit insurance support, whether in the form of the greater availability of cover or lower premium rates - or both. 'The export credit cover and premiums available are now broadly competitive with our rivals,' says Mr Heseltine. In the past three years, the active promotion of UK exports has been reflected in a rising level of credits provided by the ECGD and in the active targeting of ECGD cover. It was announced in the last November budget that the level of available ECGD cover would be raised to Pounds 3.2bn for 1996/97. This represents a near doubling of the level of cover available since 1991/92. Cover in 1993/94 was Pounds 2.7bn. To make best use of this, a significant proportion of the cover has been targeted on the so-called amber zone markets - areas where risk is significant or the ECGD's exposure is most concentrated. These markets include China, India, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey and Zimbabwe. This policy, coupled with judicious premium reductions where possible, is especially close to the heart of Richard Needham, who has placed a particularly strong emphasis on building UK competitiveness in high economic growth markets, such as China and Indonesia. In order to enhance the availability of short-term insurance, primarily through NCM, the government has also provided substantial reinsurance support because of a perceived lack of capacity in the private reinsurance market. According to Keith Johnson, chairman of the British Exporters Association, a lobby group comprising representatives from industry and the banking sector, the government is 'embracing pragmatism and realism'. 'Since the arrival of Michael Heseltine and Richard Needham, the DTI has started to give encouragement to firms to go out there and win export orders,' he says. Mr Johnson says three main factors have emerged: more flexibility for ECGD to come on cover quicker for difficult risks, such as Kazakhstan and Vietnam; a gradual reduction in premium costs; and willingness by government to match support provided by foreign governments to their exporters - a policy he terms 'competing government to government, leaving the way clear for industry to compete on an even basis'. However, he argues that 'we still have some way to go' and warns against complacency. 'The Americans have the Eximbank (Export Import Bank) 'war chest' with Dollars 900m with a mandate to 'compete and win'. The French government has a continuing capability to keep French industry competitive and elsewhere, for example, emerging tigers such as Taiwan and South Korea have vast resources to effectively compete on the medium term finance front. 'The UK government has to be continually aware of these competing pressures and respond appropriately in terms of ECGD premium rates and cover availability,' says Mr Johnson.

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Spaniards set for record Dollars 300m equity placement Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas (FCC), a leading and highly diversified Spanish construction company, is to make the largest ever equity placement by a private Spanish company. The bulk of the placement, which could raise more than Dollars 300m, will be offered to US and UK institutions, with Goldman Sachs, the US bank, leading the US tranche and co-leading the UK and continental Europe tranche with Schroders of the UK. Banco Central Hispano will place a smaller tranche among domestic institutions. Analysts said FCC's decision could inspire more domestic companies to tap the markets. Large Spanish corporate placements are usually the domain of the public sector, the latest being the utility Endesa which announced a Dollars 1.4bn global offering last weekend. Some 20 per cent of FCC will be offered to the markets which will raise the amount of its shares that are freely traded to 40 per cent, one of the biggest among the domestic construction companies. The equity being offered is made up of treasury stock, stock owned by FCC's cement subsidiary Valderribas and a portion of the 74 per cent shareholding in FCC that is owned by the Koplowitz family. In addition to its lead management role, Goldman will act as the global co-ordinator of the placement and the design of the global offering - private placements on two international tranches, one for the US and one for the UK and continental Europe, and a third tranche for domestic institutions  -follows closely the pattern that Goldman established when it brought Repsol, the state-owned energy group, to the market last year. The FCC mandate turns Spain into one of the US bank's leading profit centres. Goldman will be advising Endesa's global offering, which is likely in May, and it could also place another portion of Repsol equity on the market after the summer. FCC is a holding company with divisions covering construction, cement, property, car parks, waste management, and waste collection and street cleaning. It shares the leadership of the domestic construction industry with Dragados y Construcciones, has a 70 per cent quota of the fast growing waste management sector and is the second largest cement company after Cemex, the Mexican producer which acquired large Spanish cement companies two years ago.</p>

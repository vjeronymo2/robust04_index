			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Trade Minister Robert Urbain, by </F> Jacques Hislaire; place and date not given: "`Nothing  Provisional' Says Robert Urbain"--first paragraph is LA LIBRE  BELGIQUE introduction]    [Text] Foreign Trade and European Affairs Minister Robert  Urbain has returned from a limited 12-day political and economic  mission which took him successively to Qatar, Pakistan, and  Syria (we will return to this subject in Saturday's LIBRE Propos  section and the Business section of the following Saturday). He  followed the crisis and reshuffle from Doha, Islamabad, Lahore  and Damascus by telephoning President Busquin and his advisers  every day. They also sent him a daily press review. He gave us  an interview before his departure from Damascus.    [Hislaire] Are you satisfied by the reshuffle?    [Urbain] Yes, in so far as I am still combining  responsibility for Foreign Trade and European Affairs at the  federal level. Combining the two ministries has definite  advantages, because Belgium embodies Europe for most of the  countries I visited. That is also why I met the amir of Qatar  and the president of Pakistan. And if his son had not died  accidentally a few days earlier, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad  would have received me also.    [Hislaire] Could such a role be carried out by a foreign  trade minister representing Wallonia or Flanders?    [Urbain] I do not think so. Someone said to me that he knew  Belgium well because it is next to France. People can locate  our country, but they cannot locate our regions yet. A federal  foreign trade minister is indispensable for the macroeconomic  approach to bilateral trade, in order to provide support to  export companies.    [Hislaire] Were you disappointed not to be asked to succeed  Come as deputy prime minister?    [Urbain] No. I am not disappointed at all because I asked  for nothing. The reshuffle unites experience with the fresh  energy that others are contributing. It is neither provisional  nor transitional, although the three "Guys" are not definitively  excluded from participating in government later.    [Hislaire] And the crisis within your party?    [Urbain] That is an excessive assessment. There has been no  split within the national committee of the PS [French-speaking  Socialist Party]. It is true that there is a malaise in public  opinion, which would like to know what is true or false in the  accusations made both by the investigating magistrate and by the  rumors or witnesses. I share this feeling. The truth must  emerge as quickly as possible in a totally transparent way. The  guilty -- if there are any -- must be prosecuted without  indulgence. Beyond the Agusta affair -- it would be wrong to  forget this -- lies the death of a man, Andr Cools.</p>

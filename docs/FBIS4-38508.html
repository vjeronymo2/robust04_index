			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 21, RIA -- The process of transforming  the Democratic Russia movement into a party of the same name is  being continued. A two-day conference of representatives of  more than 40 regional affiliations of the movement opened today  in the parliamentary centre of Russia to form an organising  committee and discuss the strategy and tactics of advocates of  reforms.    According to one of the leaders of Democratic Russia,  Aleksandr Korotich, the new party will differ from other Russian  parties formed after the CPSU [Communist Party of the Soviet  Union] pattern, that is it will abandon the vertical line of  democratic centralism.    In his speech, one of the co-chairmen of Democratic Russia,  Lev Ponomarev, noted that the idea of turning the movement into  a party has been maturing for a long time and become now vital  since under the new law on parties, currently considered by the  State Duma, only parties may participate in elections while  movements should leave the political stage and become mass  organisations only.    "Like when we started our struggle against communism, now as  reforms have choked we should start from the very beginning and  are doomed to many years of tenacious efforts," said Lev  Ponomarev.</p>

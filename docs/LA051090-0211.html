			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION DIVING;  </P> <P> IRVINE FRESHMAN HOLDS OFF TEAMMATE  </P> <P> Zack Williams felt the pressure Wednesday in the Southern Section 4-A diving  championships at the Industry Hills Swim Center. He also responded to it.  </P> <P> Williams, a freshman from Irvine High School, was chased throughout the day by  teammate Chris Vonk. The two were no more than 10 points apart throughout the  competition and, with three dives left, Vonk pulled to within six points.  </P> <P> "I knew it was going to be Chris and me before the meet," Williams said. "He  kept hitting his dives, so I knew I couldn't make a mistake."  </P> <P> He didn't.  </P> <P> Although only 14 years old, Williams showed the pose of a senior. He held off  Vonk to finish first with 516.25 points. Vonk, a sophomore, was second with  487.  </P> <P> Jason Hubbart of Mission Viejo was third (437.65), Mike Churgel of Fountain  Valley fourth (377.20) and David Chavez of Fontana fifth (374.05).  </P> <P> In the girls' competition, Daryl Dolan of Simi Valley rallied in her final  three dives to win the competition. Dolan finished with 456.05 points.  </P> <P> Joy Burkholder of Capistrano Valley was second (449.40), Jennie Maxwell of  Capistrano Valley third (447.35), Amy Palmer of Dana Hills fourth (421.05) and  Christine Everaert of Sonora fifth (415.50).  </P> <P> Maxwell, a freshman, led most of the event. But midway through the meet, Dolan  began to catch up.  </P> <P> On her sixth dive, Dolan was scored 10, 9, 8 1/2, 8, 8. She made three strong  dives at the end to pull ahead.  </P> <P> In the boys' competition, Williams and Vonk dominated the field for most of the  meet. Hubbart hung close for a while, but by the time the field was trimmed to  16 divers, it was pretty much an all-Irvine competition.  </P> <P> "I really thought I had him with my last dive," Vonk said. "It was my best of  the day."  </P> <P> However, Williams out-pointed Vonk on his last dive to win the meet.  </P> <P> "I was really scared going into that last dive," Williams said. "Chris put the  pressure on. I just tried to remain calm, which was tough. But I managed to do  it."  </P></p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Blair's control of executive is reaffirmed Mr Tony Blair's authority over the party was underlined when the conference decisively rejected an attempt to reassert its own dominance over the national executive. The growing isolation of his critics was emphasised when a card vote resulted in a resolution reaffirming the conference's 'unique position' being defeated by 72.7 per cent to 27.3 per cent. In the most controversial debate of the final session constituency activists loudly cheered complaints by some delegates that the views of the conference on the retention of Clause 4 in the party's constitution were being ignored. Ms Christine Bowden, from Hove, protested that a motion passed by the conference on Monday had been 'overturned' by Mr Blair when he called for a review of the constitution in his speech the following day. She said: 'Conference is our voice - listen to it Tony Blair. We don't come here to bask in reflected glory.' Ms Bowden deplored the 'setback for Blair' headlines earlier in the week when the conference narrowly voted in favour of retaining Clause 4. 'Company directors don't describe shareholders' decisions a 'setback','she said. To further applause, Ms Bowden said that it was the constituency activists who did the 'door stepping' and lived in the same world as the electorate with which the party had lost touch in recent years. Ms Agnes Davies from Cumnock, Carrick and Doon Valley said: 'I have no intention of coming to a conference when the decisions about what is going to happen have already been made.' In a clear response to the anxieties of some delegates, Mr Larry Whitty, in his final speech as the party's general secretary, urged the leadership to remember 'you have to take the people with you'. He highlighted the importance of the party's links with the trade unions.</p>

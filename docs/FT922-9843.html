			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / World Trade News: France abandons air agreement with US THE ROW between France and the US over Franco-American air capacity has come to a head with the French government announcing it has abandoned the 55-year-old agreement on transatlantic air traffic. France has for months been fighting the US over its proposals to increase its transatlantic routes. Unless the two countries can strike a compromise, there is a risk of serious disruption to flights between France and the US, although the French transport ministry said there will be no immediate break in services. The reason for the dispute is a proposal by the US Trade Department to increase the volume of traffic from eight American airlines to and from France by 35 per cent this year. The French government has also recently been in dispute with Washington over other trade issues, notably the farm subsidies in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In the air capacity dispute, France says the increase should be limited to 15 per cent. Air France has campaigned strongly to limit the increase in transatlantic US traffic. The airline, which makes around 15 per cent of its annual sales from transatlantic flights, is concerned that the profitability of its routes would come under pressure if there were greater competition from US airlines.</p>

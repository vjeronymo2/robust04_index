			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet imports 'key to commodity prospects' IMPORTS BY the former Soviet Union in the coming year will be the key factor in soft commodity prices, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. Some commodities are likely to benefit from the Soviet collapse, including wheat, maize, barley and oilseed meals. Others, such as sugar, will suffer from depressed demand. The EIU points out that in 1989-90 Soviet imports accounted for 25 per cent of world trade in maize and barley, 20 per cent of the sugar trade, 16 per cent of wheat trade and 15 per cent of soyabean meal trade. 'Its ability to feed itself to a greater or lesser degree is a matter of concern to exporters of those commodities, and to importers competing for the same supplies.' The latest figure for the 1991 Soviet grain harvest - 156.3m tonnes - is also the most alarming, sharply down on earlier estimates of between 180m and 190m tonnes. However, that figure could be unduly pessimistic as the Soviet authorities have a vested interest in painting the picture as black as possible in order to strengthen their case for requesting food aid. In any case, predictions of famine have been exaggerated, the EIU believes. The 1990 Soviet harvest was good, and it is likely that a fair amount of Soviet grain, still on the farms, will find its way in to use. In addition, the realistic pricing of bread has reduced consumption, principally because there is less waste now the cost is not derisory. The EIU estimates that the most the Soviet Union will be physically able to import in 1991-92 will be about 40m tonnes, 2m tonnes more than the 1989-90 figure. 'That amount would keep the international trade nicely topped up without blowing prices through the roof.' The Soviet Union needs imports not to avoid famine, but to avoid paying decent prices for home produced goods, the EIU suggests. 'The fact that state grain procurement late in October was only a quarter of the projected harvest and only half what was needed to feed the population through the winter months is an indication that Soviet farmers are in revolt, and are holding back supplies until farm-gate food prices are raised substantially in real terms.' The EIU believes that farmers' dissatisfaction contributed to the poor 1991 harvest, and points out that the authorities do not have long to motivate them for the 1992 harvest. However, in the long run the Soviet Union will again be an agricultural exporter. Soviet sugar imports are not expected to exceed 4m tonnes in 1992, compared with 4.6m tonnes in 1991. The EIU cites the shortage of hard currency, the transition to a market economy and the prospects of a better domestic crop. Of subsidiary importance is the Soviets' ability to afford luxuries such as cocoa and coffee. However, from the coffee and cocoa producers' viewpoint, the Soviet Union and eastern Europe are among the best potential markets. Consumption rates for coffee in the Soviet Union are low, averaging only 0.24 kg a head in 1988, compared with saturation rates of more than 10 kg a head in some European countries, the EIU points out. Soviet cocoa grindings are estimated to have fallen to a 20-year low of 75,000 tonnes in 1990-91. International Cocoa Organisation figures show Soviet consumption at 0.71 kg a head, compared with Switzerland's 4.62 kg. However, in both commodities the EIU predicts that the shortage of hard currency will prevent any big improvement in Soviet consumption figures for at least another year.

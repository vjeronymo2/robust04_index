			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Italy suffers further run on the lira THE LIMITED breathing space afforded the Italian government by Monday's 7 per cent devaluation was wiped out yesterday by a sustained wave of speculation against the lira, forcing the currency below its D-Mark floor. The plight of the lira in another chaotic day on the European currency markets - combined with a 5 per cent slide on the Milan bourse and a jump in overnight money rates to 50 per cent - led to rumours the currency would be allowed to float. Ahead of the suspension of sterling in the Exchange Rate Mechanism and the meeting last night of the European monetary committee, the Bank of Italy denied the rumours. But an Italian treasury official said later, according to the AP-DJ news agency, that the most likely scenario to emerge from the committee's meeting would be a three-day suspension of the lira from the ERM. It was uncertain whether this referred to three working days, including Monday, or whether the lira would re-enter the ERM when markets opened on Monday. The Italian official, who declined to be identified, said that sterling would be suspended from the ERM for an indefinite period. Italian ministers held a four-hour crisis meeting, lasting until early today, to prepare for a full-scale cabinet session this morning which is due to announce some emergency measures tackling spending, along with an advance of the 1993 budget. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, and Mr Lamberto Dini, managing director, were also brought in to join talks with Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, and economic ministers. At one level, the meeting was intended to demonstrate that the cabinet and the Bank of Italy were co-ordinating closely after suggestions that Mr Ciampi was unhappy with the government's handling of Sunday's devaluation. Earlier in the day Mr Amato went before the Chamber of Deputies to defend his controversial decision last Wednesday to seek emergency powers to handle the economy. He insisted such powers were necessary for the executive to react in real time to a fast-moving crisis. However, he said he was willing to negotiate the terms on which such powers were granted by parliament. The lira's slide from its central position in the European Monetary System realignment agreed over the weekend of L810 against the D-Mark to L828 in late trading came despite heavy intervention by the Bank of Italy and the Bundesbank. The lira also fell sharply against the dollar and yesterday at L1,219 was almost 12 per cent below its Friday fixing. One banker said the lira's fall contained elements of market hysteria, apart from the lure of speculative gains; but the pressure was also based on assessments that the 7 per cent devaluation had been insufficient. Hopes among Italian officials that the troubles of sterling would distract attention proved groundless. The one positive development yesterday was the approval by the Senate of a special decree granting the government authority to carry out reforms of pensions, health, regional administration and the civil service, the main causes for overspending in the public sector. The decree looks set to be endorsed by the Chamber of Deputies and this will enable the government to prepare in detail the 1993 budget. The reforms are expected to provide savings of L23,000bn (Pounds 10.8bn) next year and L35,000bn in 1994. The reforms will reduce state pensions and raise the pensionable age in stages from 55 years for women and 60 for men to 65 for both through a system of incentives.</p>

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Technology: CD films - coming soon A handful of fierce competitors in the consumer electronics industry has jointly agreed on the basic specifications of a standard-sized compact disc that contains roughly an hour and a quarter of video and sound. The new CD will allow most feature-length films to be stored digitally on two standard CDs. Philips of the Netherlands, Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial, JVC and Sony announced in Tokyo that they would co-operate in promoting the new format, based on an existing sound and pictures CD used for karaoke. Commodore, the US games computer manufacturer, Samsung and Goldstar of Korea and JVC have also joined the group. Philips and Sony co-operated in developing the original audio compact disc, and most of the companies involved in the new video CD standard have already signed an agreement on interactive CD, which combines video images, computer animation and sound in an interactive format for entertainment and games. But in the marketplace the partners are usually fierce rivals. Video CD will have roughly the same picture quality as a standard video cassette and should be on the market in the middle of next year, said the companies. In common with interactive CDs, video CD uses picture compression techniques developed by M-Peg, the Moving Picture Experts Group, which was set up to establish a method of converting pictures into a digital form. Laserdiscs, another sound and video system, are larger in diameter, use analogue storage and have a higher picture resolution, 430 lines as against the 300 lines on the new video CDs. Laserdiscs have proven particularly popular in Japan, where one in 10 households has a laserdisc player. Unlike standard video cassettes, neither laserdiscs nor video CD can be used for making home recordings. The partners have agreed to use a single logo for the new system to indicate that it runs on hardware based on the format. Publishers have already started to use the new format for film, music and education programmes, they said.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nissan to buy out Spanish unit Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, is offering to buy out minority shareholders in its troubled Spanish subsidiary Nissan Motor Iberica. The Spanish operations have run up heavy losses in the past two years, forcing Nissan to undertake a radical restructuring to comply with Spanish corporate solvency law. Under the impact of heavy losses, expected to total around Pta40bn (Dollars 290m) this year, Nissan is planning to write off about two-thirds of the company's share capital, which will be reduced from Pta60bn to around Pta20bn. The takeover by Nissan of full control of the Spanish operations is expected to be followed by drastic rationalisation measures. It is seeking to cut its costs by about Pta10bn in the three years 1993-95 and to eliminate around 1,100 jobs from its workforce which totalled 7,200 at the start of the year. The Japanese carmaker, which holds 70.3 per cent of the equity of Nissan Iberica, said yesterday it had filed an offer with the Spanish stock exchange commission for Nissan Europe to acquire the outstanding 29.7 per cent minority holding in the company ahead of the capital write-down. The Japanese carmaker said it was offering shareholders the possibility to sell their shares 'in conditions that we believe to be favourable in view of the current and mid-term situation of NMISA'. Shares in Nissan Motor Iberica, suspended on Thursday, closed on Wednesday at Pta147. The share price has slipped from a high for the year of Pta434 as its financial crisis has deepened. Details of the offer, which were not disclosed, must be approved by the stock exchange commission. It is believed the final Nissan offer could be worth about Pta250 a share, which would value the bid for the minority holding at around Dollars 65m.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Venezuelan 'confusion' attacked VENEZUELA'S leading business association, Fedecamaras, has warned that delays by the Congress in choosing a new interim president have caused a power vacuum and a spate of national confusion. The crisis developed after May 21, when the chairman of the Venezuelan senate, Senator Octavio Lepage was sworn in as acting president of Venezuela, in place of President Carlos Andres Perez who was suspended from office to face corruption charges. The governing Democratic Action (AD) party and opposition groups have not yet agreed on a replacement for Mr Lepage to complete Mr Perez's term, which is to expire next February. At the weekend, the ruling party suffered a defeat in two gubernatorial elections. In the eastern state of Sucre, the candidate for the socialist party MAS, Mr Ramon Martnez, beat the AD contender, Mr Gaston Navarro. In the western state of Barinas, unofficial returns gave a narrow win to the candidate of the main opposition Christian democratic Copei party, Mr Gerhard Cartay, over Mr Rafael Rosales of AD. The results mean that opposition parties have now wrested control of most state governorships away from the ruling party. Of the 22 governorships, Copei holds 11, while AD has eight.</p>

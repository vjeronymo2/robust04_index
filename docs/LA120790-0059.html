			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DETMER AIMING FOR ANOTHER HEISMAN AWARD  </P> <P> Ty Detmer, the third consecutive junior winner of the Heisman Trophy, claimed  his award Thursday, saying he'll be back for another season if not for another  statue.  </P> <P> "It'll be a different team and a whole new season," the BYU quarterback said.  </P> <P> "We're losing quite a few players. We've got a young team next year. I'm going  to enjoy it now, while it's here."  </P> <P> Detmer received the award at the Heisman dinner Thursday.  </P> <P> "This is just an overwhelming night for me and my family," he said in his  acceptance speech. "This is the greatest award any individual can receive.  </P> <P> "I grew up in awe of the Heisman Trophy and I'm still in awe of it."  </P> <P> Archie Griffin, the Heisman winner in 1974 and 1975, is the only player to win  the award twice. Ironically, two of Detmer's chief rivals for the trophy this  year -- Houston's David Klingler and Notre Dame's Raghib "Rocket" Ismail -- are  also juniors.  </P> <P> Detmer rode a string of 23 consecutive 300-yard games to college football's  most prestigious award. His resume includes 25 NCAA passing or total offense  records. The 13th-ranked Cougars (10-2) will meet Texas A&amp;M in the Holiday  Bowl on Dec. 29.  </P> <P> Thursday, Detmer recalled the moments before he found out he had won it last  Saturday night.  </P> <P> "Right before, I felt a rush of adrenaline and my stomach turning," he said.  "Then you hear your name. It was a great feeling. I was surprised because you  don't want to get your hopes up."  </P> <P> When Detmer decided he was going to be a quarterback, he went shopping for the  appropriate program rather than waiting to be recruited. "I committed before my  senior year in high school," he said. "I recruited them because of the  quarterback situation."  </P></p>

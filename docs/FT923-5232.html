			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Letter: 'Visionary' approach to defusing the sterling crisis Sir, The current sterling crisis once again points up the blindness of the City and the government to the 'real economy'. The long-term value of a currency is determined by the relative supply and demand for it, arising from the flow of trade. The 'hot money' of capital flows and arbitrage reflects only the short-term exploitation of differences and bears little relation to the underlying strength of the economy in the longer term. To try to counteract long-term trends with short-term weapons is merely to store up bigger problems for the future. A more visionary approach than fiddling with interest rates or criticising the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) would be to take the ERM quickly forward to the stage of a common European currency. Exchange rates within Europe would then cease to be a factor in economic management, and interest rates would be influenced by an institution with a proven record of nurturing the 'real economy' - that is, the Bundesbank. I fear that this view will be shared by few in the City, however, as too many of their livelihoods depend on the retention of these cumbersome national differences in a world which has outgrown them.

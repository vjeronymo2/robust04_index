			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Irish plan to boost exports THE IRISH government is planning to increase exports from indigenous Irish companies by 50 per cent over the next four years, from IPounds 3.7bn (Pounds 3.8bn) to IPounds 5.5bn, with growth coming in particular from the mainland European market. Mr Charlie McCreevy, the trade and tourism minister, said: 'I see the main growth opportunities coming from continental European markets as Irish industry accelerates its diversification from its traditional UK market.' The government is to provide an additional IPounds 12m in finance over the next three years, to enable exporting companies to increase their full-time sales forces working in Europe, to take on additional customer support staff with business and language skills and to part-finance 10 new group marketing schemes. Mr Conor McCarthy, Irish Trade Board chairman, said: 'We have an urgent need to build stronger market positions in mainland Europe. . . the sterling depreciation in September put Irish manufacturers in difficulty, not just in Britain, but right across our whole market-place spectrum.' He said that the 10 per cent devaluation of the punt in January 'does not represent a return to the status quo'. He pointed out that the proportion of Ireland's trade affected by the weakness of sterling is greater than at first estimated because of the pricing in sterling of many transactions with the Middle East, Africa and the Far East. Around 31 per cent of Ireland's exports go to the UK. Despite such difficulties, the board says Ireland has continued to gain share in most of its main markets during 1992.</p>

Russia Thinks it Already Has Peacekeeping Mandate"]    [Text] Commenting on his rumored appointment as Russian  ambassador to the United Nations, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey  Lavrov was concise: rumors are there, the decision is not.  Even so, his contacts with the United Nations remain close, and  Mr. Lavrov agreed yesterday to present to KOMMERSANT-DAILY his  view of Russia's relationship with this organization. The  deputy minister began by denying mass media reports about  Russia's soliciting UN permission for peacekeeping missions in  the CIS.    According to Mr. Lavrov, being a foreign policy tool, the  United Nations cannot be important in itself. UN decisions are  always a compromise, hence proposals, in particular from Russia,  do not go through every time. Making use of the United Nations,  Lavrov said, is important for Russia for two reasons. First,  because Russia's interests are recognized on an international  scale; second, because countries elaborating a decision are  invited for joint actions. By way of examples where Moscow's  stance is recognized and implemented, Mr. Lavrov referred to UN  resolutions on the human rights situation in Latvia and Estonia,  and on the withdrawal of troops from there, as well as the  decision to create the position of high commissioner for human  rights.    Touching on peacekeeping in the CIS, Mr. Lavrov stated that  protecting its interests, Russia needs no UN or CSCE permission  for such an activity because it does not contravene  international law and the UN Charter (which contains no  corresponding provisions). Saying this, Sergey Lavrov pointed  out that the United Nations should be more active in the zones  of conflicts and share the burden of Russia's expenses. Mr.  Lavrov sees no sensation in Shevardnadze's call for bringing UN  forces into Georgia -- Kozyrev and Aleksandr Chikvaidze, head of  the Georgian Foreign Ministry, came forward with such a call  last summer. But the United Nations is dragging its feet on the  decision, which is why the responsibility for disrupting the  Sochi accords rests on it, Mr. Lavrov thinks. The deputy  minister announced that this problem will be discussed during a  visit by Butros Butros-Ghali.    On the problem of sanctions, Mr. Lavrov said that in  Moscow's  opinion there is no longer any need to press them against  Yugoslavia because Belgrade has meet all the conditions imposed  on it. But Moscow's proposals on humanitarian supplies, Lavrov  said, are being blocked by the United States. This is also true  about Iraq -- the United Nations is now discussing the question  of revising the sanctions. Baghdad, Lavrov thinks, has also met  the UN demand for disarmament and opening its defense program to  monitoring which is, incidentally, the condition for lifting the  embargo on exports of its oil. Mr. Lavrov detailed the opinion  of the Foreign Ministry, where they think that a six-month  monitoring period could be imposed following which the  oil-export embargo could be lifted (Paris agrees with Moscow on  that). Libya is a more difficult case. Al-Qadhdhafi has not so  far extradited the terrorists, and Russia will have to work on  that yet, Mr. Lavrov concluded.    [International Life Desk commentary] The most striking thing  in the deputy foreign minister's interview is that his words on  peacekeeping in the CIS echo the provisions in Boris Yeltsin's  message to the Federal Assembly. As many people know, the  United Nations and the CSCE still will not recognize the Russian  troops' status as peacekeeping forces, or finance their part in  settling conflicts in the CIS. Now Moscow states straight out  that it is not going to solicit permission for protecting its  own interests. Yet another point -- the deputy minister's words  about sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and  Iraq having lost their usefulness. It is not for nothing that  the United States opposes their lifting, having in mind the  presence of Russian interests in these countries. Moscow's  stance in regard to the sanctions (despite its support by a  number of European countries) may spark tension in its relations  with the United States and the West as a whole.</p>

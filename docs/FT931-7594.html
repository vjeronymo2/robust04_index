			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Boutros Ghali agrees on US air-drops to Bosnia A US plan to drop relief supplies into blockaded areas of eastern Bosnia-Hercegovina appears likely to go ahead by the end of this week after President Bill Clinton won the agreement of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general. Mr Boutros Ghali, who had earlier voiced doubts about the plan, said he was in complete agreement with Mr Clinton after a meeting yesterday at the White House. 'There is no problem. This will be done in complete co-operation,' Mr Boutros Ghali said. Asked if he believed there was a danger the relief mission could lead to escalated violence, Mr Boutros Ghali said: 'No. . . we will take all of the precautions to avoid any kind of an escalation.' President Clinton said that the operation he planned was 'purely humanitarian and quite limited,' with 'no combat connotations whatever'. His remarks appeared designed to soothe the Serbian commanders, who had warned yesterday that the move could escalate the fighting in the country. 'The airdrop would almost certainly pave the way to the massive use of military force and the spread of armed conflict with unforeseeable consequences,' General Milan Gvero, the deputy commander of the Bosnian Serb army, said. In a strongly-worded statement, Mr Iljija Djukic, the Yugoslav foreign minister, warned the US against violating its borders. While stressing that Yugoslavia, now comprised of Serbia and Montenegro, shared the humanitarian concern for besieged Moslems, Mr Djukic said: 'Yugoslavia will not hinder the realisation of the operation, but it will not tolerate the violation of Yugoslav territory and airspace.' He said the Yugoslav army was not involved in the civil war in Bosnia, but feared incidents in the republic could veer out of control. Meanwhile, the US has informed its Nato allies that it plans to go ahead with the air-drop towards the end of this week, following consultations between Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, and his Nato colleagues at a meeting in Brussels on Friday. The White House made clear the administration wanted allied backing for the relief effort. Though the plan has been welcomed by the UN Security Council and most of Washington's allies - and Turkey and Holland have offered to participate in the operation - it has caused misgivings in both the US and some allied defence establishments. Aviation experts warned that, if the aircraft were to fly high enough to reduce the risk of groundfire, they would be unable to target their drops accurately. 'You're going to get some material in the hands of good guys, and some of it, maybe most of it, in the hands of the bad guys,' said Rear Admiral Eugene Carroll, of the Center for Defence Information, a Washington defence policy research group. Pentagon officials privately acknowledge that they have themselves put forward this argument, but have been overruled because of the administration's desire to demonstrate support for the Bosnians, having failed to come up with a viable alternative peace plan to that presented by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. Britain has adopted an ambivalent attitude to the US plan. While formally welcoming it, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, yesterday said that the RAF would not participate in an operation to drop relief supplies. Downing Street described the US plan as 'complementary' to British humanitarian aid efforts, using ground convoys. 'What is important is that the US is getting into the aid operation in Bosnia,' the Foreign Office said. Yesterday the Bosnian Serb army said it would allow overland convoys to deliver emergency aid to besieged Moslems. An envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees reached Tuzla after being delayed by Serb troops, but Serb fighters yesterday stopped another UNHCR convoy in Podromanija, 38 miles north of the besieged enclave of Gorazde. Reuter adds from New York: Lt-Gen Satish Nambiar of India will shortly relinquish command of the 23,000-strong UN Protection Force in former Yugoslavia and is likely to be replaced by Lt-Gen Lars-Eric Wahlgren, of Sweden, UN sources said.

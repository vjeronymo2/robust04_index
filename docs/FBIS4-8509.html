			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Hamiz Deronjic report from Brcko] </F>   [Text] Suffering heavy losses in manpower and unable to  break through our defense lines, the aggressor called up his air  force for assistance this morning. At 0900 two enemy combat  helicopters from the direction of Sumari and (?Jelina Ravan)  attacked the defense positions in Vranovaca. After one of them  had fired its Maljutka missiles, our antiaircraft defenses  opened fire and the enemy helicopters were forced to withdraw.  Then, from the direction of (?Jelina Ravan), the chetnik  Gazelle helicopters carried out three bombing raids against the  defense lines in Boderiste. These air raids only increased the  tremendous pressure under which the aggressor's tanks and  artillery have been keeping the defense lines of the free Brcko  territory.    Almost 1,000 shells of all calibers have so far landed on  the  area of Omerbegovaca, Vranovaca, and Boderiste alone. On this  part of the front the aggressor this morning attempted five tank  and infantry breakthroughs. The fighters of the 108th Motorized  Brigade and the 108th Infantry Brigade successfully repulsed all  these chetnik attempts. The defense lines are unchanged.    During the chetnik attacks on Vranovaca, our artillery men  targeted a strong enemy infantry unit near (Miladici) and  destroyed the entire unit with pinpoint fire. There were some  officers of the aggressor's army among the dozens of killed and  wounded chetniks. Unfortunately the Serbian aggressor retaliated  against civilian targets. The population has been warned to  remain in their shelters by means of the general alarm, as the  sudden and intense shelling of the free territory has been under  way since early this morning.</p>

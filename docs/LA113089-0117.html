			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEEN-AGER ACCUSED OF DROWNING BABY BUT MAY BE FREED  </P> <P> A 15-year-old Garden Grove honor student accused of drowning her newborn baby  in a high school toilet may not have knowingly killed the child, an autopsy  revealed Wednesday.  </P> <P> Although the mother was booked on suspicion of murdering the full-term, 6-pound  boy after giving birth in a girls' restroom Tuesday morning, police and  prosecutors say it may take two weeks to decide whether to bring criminal  charges against the Vietnamese-American girl, whose culture frowns on unwed  mothers.  </P> <P> Contrary to early police reports that nobody at the school knew of her  pregnancy, some classmates at Santiago High School and a guidance counselor  said Wednesday that they knew she was pregnant. But they said her baggy clothes  and evasive answers led them to believe that the pregnancy was in its early  stages.  </P> <P> "She didn't look pregnant to me," said counselor Carolyn Rust, who called the  girl in a week before Thanksgiving after hearing rumors of the pregnancy. "I  thought, the way the conversation went, that she was newly pregnant, a month,  two months."  </P> <P> "She didn't tell nobody she was pregnant," said classmate Richard Pan, 17. "But  most of us knew."  </P> <P> The girl's parents did not know, however, and the girl apparently was too  terrified to tell them, police and classmates said.  </P> <P> The preliminary autopsy results confirmed that the baby died of drowning, said  Garden Grove Police Sgt. Kevin Raney. "There's no indication that she drowned  it," Raney said.  </P> <P> Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. John Conley said prosecutors had ruled out a  charge of first-degree murder because there is no evidence that the death was  premeditated. But he said they are considering whether to bring a lesser  charge, such as second-degree murder or manslaughter. Depending on whether the  girl knew that the baby would die, Conley added, there may be no criminal  charges at all.  </P> <P> Several other female students were in the restroom during the birth, but did  not know what was happening until they heard an infant's cry from behind a  closed stall door, Raney said.  </P> <P> The students ran to notify the school nurse, but by the time police and  paramedics arrived, Raney said, the baby was dead.  </P> <P> The girl was taken to UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange and was booked on  suspicion of murder. She remained in the hospital in stable condition Wednesday  and was to be transferred to Orange County Juvenile Hall later this week.  </P> <P> "It's actually to protect her from herself and from her family, because we  don't know what they will do," Garden Grove Police Lt. Chuck Gibbs said.  </P> <P> "It is taboo in our culture to talk about sex or errors or mistakes that you  made in your sexual relationships," said Long C. Le, a Vietnamese-born English  teacher at nearby Fountain Valley High School.  </P> <P> "According to the tradition of the culture of Vietnam, the parents  automatically cut off all relations with the girl if they find out she is  pregnant and not married," Le said. "They usually kick the girl out of the  house. It's that bad."  </P> <P> The girl this fall had taken the high school's required health education  course, which includes information on sex and reproduction, Principal Bob  O'Higgins said. And basic information about sex was taught in her junior high  school, he said.  </P> <P> But a Vietnamese-American classmate -- who had taken the same courses -- said  Wednesday that she did not know much about birth control, would not know how to  obtain it, and assumed that the young mother did not either.  </P> <P> "Our parents don't teach us about sex," said the 18-year-old senior. "All they  teach you is to be a good kid."  </P> <P> Counselor Rust said she urged the teen-ager to tell her parents.  </P> <P> "I said, 'You have to do that,' and I explained all the reasons," Rust said.  "If she couldn't do it, I said I would be happy to have her parents come in, or  go to her home with her. She never came back."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Matt Lait contributed to this story.  </P></p>

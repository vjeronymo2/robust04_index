			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. A. Chernyavskaya, Odessa Electrotechnical </F> Communications Institute; UDC 621.396.019.4]    [Abstract] The upper boundary of the average probability of  error is obtained with discrete-weight addition of an arbitrary  number of diverse signals, received in statistically non-uniform  channels with Nikagami fading. It is demonstrated that in the  presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-correlated  diversity reception channels, and also when there is energy  asymmetry, the discrete-weight addition is an effective method  of signal processing, including a situation when majority  addition is inefficient. This feature can be used as a criterion  for selecting the engineering solutions when designing the  addition devices. Figure 1; references 7: Russian</p>

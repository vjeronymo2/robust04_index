			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Clarke and George tackle rates conundrum Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, yesterday reviewed official interest rates as most City analysts predicted that they would stay unchanged for the time being. But the possibility of an eventual rise in base rates from their current 5.25 per cent was underlined by the Treasury's latest monthly monetary report. It said recent indicators pointed to a further strengthening of economic activity. The report, prepared for the meeting of the two men, highlighted the dilemma facing the Treasury and Bank. On the one hand underlying inflation was at its lowest for 27 years in July and the broadest inflation measure - the gross domestic product deflator - at its lowest for 31 years in the second quarter. But growth - revised up to 3.7 per cent in the year to the second quarter - was the strongest since the final quarter of 1988. The report said: 'Monthly indicators point to a further strengthening of activity.' It cited continuing growth in retail sales, manufacturing output, output expectations and falling unemployment. Yesterday Halifax Building Society, the UK's biggest mortgage lender, voiced its fears about the impact of an interest rate increase on the fragile recovery in the housing market. Announcing the society's interim results, Mr Jon Foulds, chairman, said that consumer confidence was lagging well behind the upturn shown in official statistics. He said: 'We are concerned that any rise in interest rates would damage a very delicately poised housing market recovery.' Mr David Gilchrist, corporate development manager, said the society was expecting some recovery in the autumn. But if interest rates and perhaps taxes rose at about Budget time in late November, the housing market could remain depressed through the start of next year. As usual, the Treasury report gave no insight into official thinking on interest rates while officials refused to comment on yesterday's meeting. But City analysts suggested that Mr Clarke would be unlikely to opt for a pre-emptive interest rate rise at this stage and might prefer to wait for November, when next month's Conservative party conference will be safely out of the way. The next Clarke/George monetary meeting will be on September 26. That will allow Mr Clarke to attend the Commonwealth finance ministers' meeting in Malta late this month and the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank soon after.

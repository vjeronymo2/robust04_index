			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / How Lamont's advisers would lead Britain out of recession ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE FREE MARKET EVANGELIST Patrick Minford Economics professor, Liverpool University  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTEREST RATES Wants to see base rates cut by 3 percentage points to 3 per cent by mid-March, and staying at around that rate until the end of year if there is no sign of clear revival.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TAX INCREASES Not in favour. Wants tax cuts in the medium term to help incentives. Believes high public sector borrowing requirement is largely due to the recession.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INFLATION TARGET Treasury's target of keeping underlying inflation below 4 per cent will 'quite probably' be breached this year, due to effects of devaluation.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ERM RE-ENTRY Opposes ERM re-entry at any time, on any terms.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PUBLIC SPENDING Favours cuts over next few years, together with reforms based on charging for specific services such as health and education.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ECONOMIC GROWTH On worst case, economy could contract by 0.5 per cent this year. At best, could expand by 0.5 per cent. Longer-term, he is optimistic about growth prospects.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FORECASTING RECORD Came 4th out of 41 forecasting groups in FT survey of accuracy of growth predictions during recession.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNEMPLOYMENT Thinks unemployment will peak in late 1993 at 3.25m, assuming further cuts in interest rates.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHALLENGE FOR THE 1990S Continuation of reforms started by Thatcher governments.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE CULTIVATED CASSANDRA Wynne Godley Professor of applied economics, Cambridge University  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTEREST RATES Unsure about whether more action is needed after last month's cut to 6 per cent. At end of last year called for immediate cut to 5 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TAX INCREASES Does not want to specify a view. He believes high government deficits may not necessarily be a problem.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INFLATION TARGET Inflation might 'nudge' government target this year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ERM RE-ENTRY Not unless system is reformed.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PUBLIC SPENDING Not willing to provide a view.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ECONOMIC GROWTH Last December projected 0.5 per cent growth this year, picking up to 1.5 per cent next year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FORECASTING RECORD Unranked in FT survey because insufficient forecasts; since early 1991 has had good record in predicting lengthy recession.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNEMPLOYMENT Generally gloomy about prospects. Thinks figures could climb above 3.4m in 1994.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHALLENGE FOR THE 1990S UK to sell goods and services on world markets more successfully than in the past.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE UNBENDING MONETARIST Tim Congdon Managing director, Lombard Street Research  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTEREST RATES In December he forecast a 6.5 per cent base rate by the end of 1993. Does not want to say where he thinks rates should be.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TAX INCREASES Wants a tax increase of about pounds 12bn announced in March 16 Budget, spread over income tax, National Insurance contributions and indirect taxes. 'Very worried' by rise in government deficit.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INFLATION TARGET Government target may be exceeded briefly this year, but he thinks inflation is on a downward trend in 1994 and 1995, assuming 'sensible' policies and use of broad-money targets.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ERM RE-ENTRY Never.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PUBLIC SPENDING Wants 'significant cuts' in next few years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ECONOMIC GROWTH 1 per cent growth likely this year. Thinks conditions for a lasting recovery are in place, though much depends on world economic conditions.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FORECASTING RECORD 8th in FT survey.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNEMPLOYMENT Likely to peak at 3.3m in the first half of next year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHALLENGE FOR THE 1990s To reconcile steady growth at trend rate without inflation. Over next year government must act to stop disintegration of financial system by debt inflation.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE ENTHUSIASTIC NUMBER-CRUNCHER Andrew Sentance Economics director, Confederation of British Industry  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTEREST RATES Wait and see before cutting again. Hopes for lower interest rates over the next few years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TAX INCREASES May be needed, especially if consumer spending looks like growing too quickly.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INFLATION TARGET Will not be exceeded 'in any serious way' this year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ERM RE-ENTRY Not until economy growing again and conditions in rest of Europe more settled.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PUBLIC SPENDING Cuts may be needed, especially if PSBR goes too high.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ECONOMIC GROWTH 0.7 per cent likely this year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FORECASTING RECORD 11th in FT survey.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNEMPLOYMENT Rise to 3.2m by end of 1994.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHALLENGE FOR THE 1990s To reduce unemployment and speed up growth without higher current account deficit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE MAN FOR ALL PARTIES Gavyn Davies Chief UK economist, Goldman Sachs  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTEREST RATES Hopes to see cut to 5 per cent by late spring, possibly 4 per cent later to boost recovery hopes.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TAX INCREASES Wants to see roughly pounds 12bn in tax increases, to take effect in 1994-95 rather than in 1993-94 so as not to stall recovery. Chancellor could announce tax rises in March 16 budget.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INFLATION TARGET Inflation not the key problem facing Britain.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ERM RE-ENTRY Premature to say, as system may not survive.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PUBLIC SPENDING Unwilling to specify views, but forecasts assume little change to government plans.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ECONOMIC GROWTH Growth of 1.5 per cent predicted for this year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FORECASTING RECORD 7th in FT survey.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNEMPLOYMENT Likely to rise to 3.25m and stay at this level for some years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHALLENGE FOR THE 1990s To tackle structural defects in UK economy, including quality of investment, labour market, training and education.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE BUSINESS GURU David Currie Head of economic forecasting, London Business School  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTEREST RATES In favour of generally lower base rates but thinks they might need to rise later this year if higher prices from devaluation start to feed through to wage claims.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TAX INCREASES May be needed due to high PSBR.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INFLATION TARGET May be breached over the next two years, though this is not of serious concern.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ERM RE-ENTRY Unlikely in immediate future.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PUBLIC SPENDING Large cuts unlikely in the near future, due to the pressure on priority areas.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FORECASTING RECORD 31st in FT survey.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNEMPLOYMENT Likely to remain high, falling only slightly below 3m in 1996.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHALLENGE FOR THE 1990s Not willing to specify.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE CONSENSUS-MINDED THEORIST Andrew Britton Director, National Institute of Economic and Social Research  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTEREST RATES After the recent cut, wants to wait for more signs of economic activity before further activity.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TAX INCREASES Not in favour of precipitate action. Thinks 'scare stories' about large PSBR may be overdone.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INFLATION TARGET A 'clear risk' of 1 to 4 per cent target being breached this year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ERM RE-ENTRY Decision should be postponed until view becomes clearer of how system will evolve.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PUBLIC SPENDING Thinks spending might overshoot government targets in coming years, in which case some tax increases might be needed.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ECONOMIC GROWTH Sticking to forecast of about 2 per cent growth this year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FORECASTING RECORD 36th in FT survey.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNEMPLOYMENT May rise to 3.2m and stay at this level for some years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHALLENGE FOR THE 1990s Reduce unemployment.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT interviews and questionnaire; FT survey of forecasts December 21 1992; FT survey of accuracy of growth projections in 1990-92, October 1992; speech by David Currie at Institute of Economic Affairs conference, January 21, 1993; The Consequences of Government's New Inflation Target, Gavyn Davies, January 20 1993.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULVER CITY TEACHERS ACCEPT 7% PAY RAISE, STILL TRAIL L.A.  </P> <P> Culver City teachers will get a 7% pay raise this year, but their new contract  still leaves them behind other Westside and Los Angeles teachers in salary.  </P> <P> Teachers ratified the one-year contract on a 137-88 vote Tuesday. It provides  for increases in the school district's contributions to health plans, and it  introduces a program of basic health coverage for future retirees. The Culver  City Unified School District board, which has declared its support, will  formally approve the agreement at its Dec. 5 meeting.  </P> <P> Under the contract, salaries for beginning teachers will rise from $23,420 a  year to $25,059. Teachers with 20 years' experience will see their pay go from  $44,140 to $47,230. The average teacher's pay will rise from $36,221 to  $38,756.  </P> <P> The district will increase its contribution by 8% for teachers who are under a  fee-for-service medical plan. But because the total costs will be higher,  teachers will also have to pay more. Employee contributions for individual  medical coverage will go up $9 a month, from $47 to $56, said Bess Doerr,  president of the Culver City Teachers Assn.  </P> <P> Taking advantage of a new state law that allows public employees previously not  enrolled in the Social Security system to obtain Medicare coverage after they  retire, the agreement gives teachers the option of paying 1.45% of their salary  to qualify for Medicare. Teachers who enroll will have their contribution  matched by the district.  </P> <P> The district also agreed to pay $1,250 a year for each future retiree 65 and  older to provide additional insurance to supplement Medicare.  </P> <P> Previous labor contracts had no medical coverage at all for retired teachers 65  and older.  </P> <P> Last month, teachers rejected an earlier tentative agreement that provided a 6%  pay increase. But the contract ratified this week provides an almost identical  amount of money, said Ralph Villani, assistant superintendent in charge of  negotiations.  </P> <P> The 7% pay hike in the approved contract was made retroactive only to Oct. 23.  The 6% increase in the first agreement would have been retroactive to the  beginning of the school year, said James Lively, the district's chief financial  officer.  </P> <P> Villani said the pay raise will also be funded from money saved by postponing  the date teachers are allowed to enter Medicare -- from Jan. 1, in the original  proposal, to July 1.  </P> <P> Doerr called the contract solid and said teachers realized that the district  has no more money to offer. She said the teachers also voted yes after seeing  that Bevelry Hills teachers, after a two-week strike, got only a 5% guaranteed  salary increase this year, plus a one-time bonus of 2% using money contributed  by parents.  </P> <P> But David Mielke, president of the Culver City Federation of Teachers, a rival  of Doerr's union that was ousted as the bargaining representative in 1988, said  the association had not fought hard enough.  </P> <P> Mielke said the "collective frustration" that led teachers to reject the first  agreement "could have been used and harnessed to get a much better settlement.  The negotiating team worked hard to sell (the second agreement), and I guess  the teachers bought it."  </P> <P> He said "the fact that Beverly Hills teachers struck and got hammered" may have  spurred some Culver City teachers to vote yes on the contract. "But we weren't  talking about a strike . . . just about turning up the heat a couple of  degrees."  </P> <P> Another vocal critic of the contract was Howard Bennett, a veteran Culver City  teacher who has campaigned for comprehensive lifetime health benefits.  </P> <P> "This contract is an insult," Bennett said, contending that any gain in buying  power from the 7% raise will be negated by the increase in teacher  contributions for health coverage, the later retroactive date for the pay  increase, the postponement of the Medicare provision and increases in the cost  of living.  </P> <P> But Doerr said the contract became a source of dispute only because of the  battling unions and other issues in the district.  </P> <P> "Howard Bennett wants (a particular system of lifetime health benefits); Dave  Mielke want to discredit CCTA," she said. "This is a good contract. Why  wouldn't people vote for it?"  </P> <P> Doerr and district officials agreed that the district, which has a  $16.5-million budget, has no money for a sweeter deal for teachers.  </P> <P> The new contract, which covers about 275 teachers, counselors, nurses and  librarians, will cost the district about $665,442 this year, Villani said.  </P> <P> The pay increases will still leave Culver City teachers behind Santa Monica,  Los Angeles and Beverly Hills teachers in pay. But Villani said Culver City  pays more than $5,200 a year per teacher in medical, dental and life insurance,  more than Santa Monica and Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District pays about $4,000 a year in  medical and dental benefits per teacher, according to Art Cohen, assistant  superintendent for fiscal services.  </P> <P> Villani said the Los Angeles Unified School District has higher salaries and  better fringe benefits than Culver City because it is much bigger and rapidly  growing in enrollment. "There's no way we can compete with their kind of  income," he said.  </P> <P> Mielke of the rival teachers union predicted that the pay gap will cause Culver  City teachers to defect to other districts. "Every day at lunch, teachers are  asking for salary schedules around Los Angeles County," he said. "Three blocks  away, a teacher is making $3,000 or $4,000 more."  </P> <P> Doerr said two teachers have left for the higher salaries in Los Angeles this  year. One, a bilingual teacher, is making $10,000 more than she did in Culver  City, in part because Los Angeles gives bonuses to bilingual teachers.  </P> <P> But Villani said four teachers from Los Angeles took pay cuts and came to  Culver City "because Culver City is a nice place to work."  </P> <P> "It's smaller," he said, "there's strong parent interest in our community, and  we dont have the drug problems, gang problems . . . to the extent L.A. has."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SALARY COMPARISONS  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.21IN:2.11IN:1.89IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW>

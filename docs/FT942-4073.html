			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / International Company News: Falconbridge raises CDollars 1.3bn Falconbridge, the western world's second-biggest nickel producer, has raised CDollars 1.3bn (USDollars 946m) through an initial public offering and an equity injection from Noranda, the Canadian resources group, which will become its biggest single shareholder. The public issue, which raised CDollars 751m, will be used mainly to reduce the stake of Trelleborg, the Swedish metals group, to 29 per cent from 50 per cent. Noranda, Falconbridge's joint owner since 1989, will reduce its interest slightly, to 47 per cent from 50 per cent. Trelleborg's and Noranda's stakes will be further diluted, to 28 per cent and 46 per cent respectively, if the underwriters, led by Wood Gundy, exercise an option to increase the size of the public offering over the next month. Demand for the issue has been strong, and the underwriters are expected to take up their option. The issue has been priced at CDollars 18.50 per share, towards the upper end of the range indicated by the underwriters. Noranda's contribution totalled CDollars 561m. The company earlier this week raised USDollars 300m in 10-year debentures to help finance its new investment in Falconbridge. Falconbridge will use the extra funds to reduce its CDollars 1.9bn debt. The improved balance sheet will facilitate efforts to increase its one-third stake in the USDollars 1bn Collahuasi copper project in Chile, and to finance the proposed Raglan nickel/copper mine in northern Quebec.</p>

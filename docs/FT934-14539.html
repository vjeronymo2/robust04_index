			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Bundesbank president rules out early return to tight ERM grid THE newly-flexible European Monetary System faces a long probation period before EC states can return their currencies to the old, tighter grid, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said yesterday. In his first foreign speech since becoming president of the the German central bank this month, Mr Tietmeyer said EC states should be 'prudent' in their monetary policy, while putting their prime focus on real convergence between their economies. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, who has just taken over as governor of the Bank of France, joined his German counterpart in a symbolic joint appearance at a Paris conference organised by Les Echos newspaper, to pledge the French central bank's dedication to 'a policy of credibility and internal and external stability' for the franc. Amid reports that the Bank of France intervened yesterday to prop up a franc affected by Franco-American tensions in the Gatt negotiations, Mr Trichet gave little encouragement to hopes for an early cut in French interest rates. He chose to stress that French long-term rates had fallen to German levels, so that over 10 years, in the markets' eyes, 'the French and German currencies are considered approximately the same'. The Bundesbank itself would continue 'a steady and clear, stability-oriented monetary policy', Mr Tietmeyer said. This did not exclude 'further cautious steps to cut our interest rates, when conditions are right'. But he stressed the Bundesbank view that his country's long-term rates were 'very low historically, at less than 2 per cent in real terms'. Both men supported the goal of European monetary union, underlining what seems to be a new Franco-German consensus on prudent monetary policy and on necessary economic convergence. But Mr Tietmeyer spelled out a number of caveats. He described as utopian any notion that the Maastricht timetable to monetary union should be accelerated because of this summer's upheaval in the EMS. Mr Tietmeyer also criticised recent suggestions from Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, that the EC might consider some form of controls on the movement of speculators' money, as a means of strengthening the EMS. Not only would such a plan not work in 'highly developed and fundamental liberal' economies, but free capital movements were essential to help necessary adjustments in industrialised economies. Mr Tietmeyer attacked recent suggestions in Brussels that the European Commission should set a new macro-economic framework with targets for interest rates, inflation and perhaps unemployment. 'Choosing this solution would only recreate the problems which provoked the crisis,' he said. On financial regulation, the German central bank chief urged stronger efforts to control derivatives trading and to prevent such assets inflating and then bursting like 'bubbles'. He suggested there should be an internationally agreed code of conduct on derivatives trading, along the lines of a recent Group of 30 study. Mr Tietmeyer complained that the EC had so far only reached 'an imperfect compromise' in its March 1993 directive, designed to introduce minimum capital requirements in derivatives trading from 1996.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the Slakyanka Radio studio of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Text] Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov  believes Russia has the potential to double its exports of  military equipment in 1994. In 1993, Russia's arms exports  amounted to $1.2 billion. The work that has been accomplished  has laid the foundation for future contracts, for example the  supply of MiG-29 fighters to Malaysia. New opportunities in  arms exports are opening up with the setting up of the  Rosvooruzheniye [Russian Armaments] company. Its task is to  amalgamate Russia's main exporters in military equipment and to  coordinate their activities.</p>

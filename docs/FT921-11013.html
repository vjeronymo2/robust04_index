			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Hard slog for Ireland WHOEVER succeeds Mr Charles Haughey as prime minister of the Irish Republic will have the daunting task of trying to run an economy which is geographically peripheral to mainstream Europe and where unemployment is about 15 per cent - much higher in some regions - and emigration is still a central problem. On the face of it, Mr Haughey's imminent departure may look like the passing of a generation which had its roots in the old Ireland. That is to underestimate, however, how much has been achieved in the years when he alternated in power with Dr Garret FitzGerald. Ireland now is a more or less contented member of the European Community: relations between Dublin and London have improved beyond recognition and it has become possible to contemplate dropping the formal Irish claim to the whole of Ireland. Although the Anglo-Irish agreement was negotiated on the Irish side by Dr FitzGerald, Mr Haughey has played his full part in sticking to it. Even on cross-border security, he has been reasonably helpful. On the economy, while he has been occasionally profligate, his government has moved to a more self-disciplined position, as last week's budget showed. Yet it is a gauge of the problems that Ireland faces that it has to run remarkably fast simply to stay in the same place. Old-style politician The customary charge against Mr Haughey is that he was an old-style politician who ran his party and the country like a Mafia: uno duce, una voce, as the Irish Times has commented. Yet you can only do that if the prevailing society allows. Ireland did allow it. It is notable that none of the candidates for the succession are putting forward very radical plans for change. Ms Mary O'Rourke, the health minister, for example, says that she is opposed to the repeal of Articles 2 and 3 of the constitution (which lay the claim to govern the whole of Ireland) on the grounds that 'for us and our party they are very important and we subscribe to them'. A more damaging charge against the outgoing prime minister is that, like other leaders in other countries, he stayed too long. The succession of scandals and accusations of croneyism were becoming embarrassing if not so much for Mr Haughey at home as for the image of Ireland abroad. Houdini had begun to give the country a bad name. Nevertheless, his departure will not necessarily produce a substantial change of policy. Challenges ahead The challenges for his successor are to establish a sustained economic growth rate way ahead of the European average, to reduce the level of unemployment, to attract inward investment and to encourage Irish entrepreneurs to stay at home. Again, however, it may be pointed out that that was precisely what last week's budget was designed to do. Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, acknowledged the debt to the financial transfers from the EC, which he described as 'our other homeland'. He outlined a considerable reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement  -down to just over 2 per cent of gross domestic product. Success in the battle against inflation - down to 3.2 per cent - compares favourably with that in other countries. But, he added, unemployment remains the biggest social and economic problem. Given modern communications, there is no definitive reason why a small, outlying economy should not be a success story. It is a matter of finding niche markets and, particularly in Ireland's case, further developing tourism. Yet there is one area where the Irish economy remains peculiarly distorted: that is the economic disunion between the two parts of the island. It is there - in the joint development of trade, agriculture and industry between north and south - that progress most needs to be made. A new prime minister may not be expected to change the constitution overnight, but he or she could take note of economic imperatives and resolve to embark upon a long hard slog.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Leopold Joseph profits ahead Leopold Joseph, the merchant banker, said that net profits for the half year to September 30 were 'somewhat higher' than in the comparable period. Mr Robin Herbert, chairman, said that was satisfactory when taking into account the uncertain background. The growth followed a 'useful increase' in activity, substantially derived from focused marketing initiatives. The interim dividend is held at 3.1p, payable on January 2.</p>

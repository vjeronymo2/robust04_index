			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / The incredible shrinking industrial base: Tony Jackson assesses whether services can compensate for the decline of manufacturing in Britain It is a fair rule of thumb that whenever the British start extolling the virtues of manufacturing, their economy is in trouble. It is thus a measure of the depths of the present recession that in recent weeks members of the government, from the prime minister down, have gone out of their way to insist that manufacturing is close to their hearts. As usual, there is corresponding contempt for the notion that the British can earn their living from services: 'dressing in smocks', as a chairman of ICI once put it, 'and showing tourists round medieval castles'. The British bias towards manufacturing is partly a matter of history. The UK economy was built on it, as the trade and industry secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, assured British industrialists last week. And as British manufacturing has lost ground in a world context, so too has the British economy. The experience of the 1980s has added an extra twist. In the last recession, the service industries of London and the south-east emerged relatively unscathed. This time they have taken a hammering. Services, in the popular imagination, now consist of yuppies in red braces, and estate agents. They are not real and solid like manufacturing. They cannot be relied on when the going gets rough. A refinement of this view, repeatedly advanced at last week's conference of the Confederation of British Industry at Harrogate, is that manufacturing has absolute priority because services depend on manufacturing for a living. A moment's reflection suggests this is nonsense. When Tesco decides to build a new superstore or Forte a new hotel, the construction industry is being driven by the demand for services. When the City of London went through its Big Bang in 1986, one immediate result was a huge increase in demand for computing equipment. Manufacturing and services, in short, depend on each other. They are also becoming increasingly difficult to unscramble. The point is neatly illustrated in a recent publication from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development*. Perhaps the archetypal manufacturing company is General Motors of the US. One of its biggest suppliers is not a steel or components company, but the health insurer Blue Cross-Blue Shield. One of GM's biggest products is financial services, in the form of loans and insurance to dealers and customers. It is also easy to exaggerate how far services have supplanted manufacturing as a source of British jobs. Granted, there has been a steady fall in the proportion of the workforce employed in manufacturing. But over the last decade the same is true of almost every country in the developed world, including Japan and Germany. Of the 24 industrialised countries included in the OECD, the UK ranks sixth - above the US or France - in the proportion of its workers employed in manufacturing. Unfortunately, this does not mean that the UK does not have a problem. It is one thing to produce the same amount of manufactured goods with fewer people. It is quite another to produce fewer goods than the population consumes. For at least 40 years, the UK's balance of trade in manufacturing has been in remorseless decline. In the early 1980s the balance slipped into deficit, and has been there ever since. Somehow or other the British appetite for imported goods has to be paid for. Can the export of services do the job? Judging by the historical record, the answer is definitely no. In 1990, the UK exported Pounds 5.2bn more of services than it imported. This sounds impressive, but in fact amounts to just under 1 per cent of national income. Twenty years before, the proportion was almost identical. It is very welcome that British services can hold their own in the world and contribute a consistent surplus. But the surplus seems in real terms to be static, while manufacturing continues to decline. This raises the obvious question of whether the performance in services can realistically be expected to improve. Judging by international comparisons, the answer once again seems to be no. Among the nations making up the OECD, it is a curious and revealing fact that the half-dozen showing the slowest growth over the past 30 years have all had faster growth in services than in manufacturing over the period. The fastest-growing countries have all been the other way round. The point is illustrated with particular starkness in the case of the UK. Its growth in services - technically, growth in added value in services, adjusted for inflation - was higher than in several other OECD countries, at 3.2 per cent a year over the 30-year period. Its growth in manufacturing, on the other hand, was the lowest in the OECD, at 1.4 per cent a year. It scarcely seems a coincidence that growth in its economy overall - 2.4 per cent a year - was the lowest in the OECD as well. This phenomenon is a little tricky to explain. But there may be a clue in the fact that the worst-performing countries in those 30 years - the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, the US - were mature economies in the first place, while the best performers - Japan, Turkey, Greece, Spain - were not. In other words, the countries which were poorest at the outset grew the fastest. As the phenomenal economic performance of China in the past decade suggests, growth is a lot easier to achieve when it starts from a low base. But it is also more readily achieved in manufacturing. The reason is a familiar one: that it is much easier to improve productivity in manufacturing than it is in services. The output of a shop-floor worker can be hugely increased by the introduction of machinery. It is not so easy to do the same with a lawyer or a hairdresser. The point is once more borne out by OECD statistics. In the period 1979-90, real added value per person employed in manufacturing in the OECD rose by an average 2.9 per cent a year. In services, the figure was just 0.7 per cent. The conclusion from all this is obvious and faintly depressing. The only solution to the decline in Britain's manufacturing performance lies in the reversal of that decline. But it would be wrong to suppose that Britain is in this respect unique. Just as the UK was to a large extent the birthplace of manufacturing, so its manufacturing base is the first to show signs of age. But many of the same signs are present in the US. They are also starting to appear in Germany. Some would even argue that they are detectable in Japan. The question of whether the UK can reverse its decline therefore has a wider relevance. Given the forces of history, the chances of such a reversal might seem negligible. But this is to reckon without the globalisation of world industry. Increasingly, manufacturing is becoming divorced from its country of origin. For a Japanese multinational, the relevant point about the UK is that it still possesses an industrial infrastructure and a tradition of industrial employment. Having forgotten how to make cars and consumer electronics, Britain is now being re-educated by others. As a recipe for revival it might seem something of a long shot. But it may be all there is. *Industrial Policy in OECD Countries: Annual Review 1992.</p>

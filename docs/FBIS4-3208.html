			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 18 Apr (XINHUA) -- The figures released  today by the State Statistical Bureau show that China's economy  continued to operate successfully in the first quarter of this  year, with the country's GDP reaching 862 billion yuan. This  represents an increase of 12.7 percent over the same period last  year calculated in accordance with comparable prices. However,  if adjustments for seasonal factors in the first quarter caused  by the low ratio of agriculture and the high ratio of industry  are made, and if the growth rate is converted into an annual  rate, the current economic growth rate is between 9 and 10  percent, the range sought after through the exercise of  macroeconomic regulation and control.    According to an authoritative analysis and appraisal, while  maintaining an appropriate growth rate, China's economy is  approaching the target sought after through macroeconomic  regulation and control. The economic operation indicator [ping  fen zhi 6097 0433 0237] has shifted from the border line between  the "green and yellow lights" at the end of 1992 to the border  line between the "yellow and green lights" at present. Judging  from the internal structure of the economy, production,  construction, and marketing, which have been growing at an  excessive rate, have slowed down somewhat.    The statistical data reveal that in industrial production,  the added value of industry in the first quarter was 533 billion  yuan, up 16 percent over the same period last year. Heavy  industry increased 15.3 percent, and light industry rose by 16.8  percent. Coastal areas in the east maintained their lead in  growth rates. Because of the fall in industrial production, the  strained situation in the supply of energy and raw and  semifinished materials and in transportation was alleviated to  varying degrees. In fixed asset investment, state-owned units  invested 81.5 billion yuan in the first quarter, up 36.2 percent  over the same period last year, but the growth rate is 34.5  percentage points lower than the same period last year. Judging  from the investment pattern: first, the growth of localized  investment items has slightly declined, while centralized items  maintained a quicker growth rate; second, transportation,  postal, and telecommunications projects were strengthened; and  third, as a result of efforts to streamline the real estate  industry, the chaotic situation in which development zones,  high-class villas, and vacation villages were recklessly  undertaken has been checked.    According to the statistics, as a whole, market sales in the  first quarter remained stable but declined slightly. The total  sales of consumer goods amounted to 352.2 billion yuan, up 25.2  percent over the same period last year -- or an actual increase  of 4.2 percent after allowing for price rises, a growth rate  lower than the average rate of a normal year by 3 to 4 percent  points. At present, except for a few agricultural and sideline  products whose supply is slightly short of demand, about 90  percent of the other commodities remain in a condition in which  supply and demand are basically balanced or supply surpasses  demand. At the same time, along with the development of the  rural and urban economy and the increase in the wages of the  workers of administrative departments and institutions, the  income and living conditions of the urban and rural population  have improved. In the first quarter of this year, the average  amount of per-capita income that city dwellers used for living  expenses increased 35.5 percent over the same period last year  and the average net cash income of the rural population rose by  31.1 percent, an actual increase of 9.3 percent and 13.1  percent, respectively, after allowing for price rises.    The operation of the economy shows that the reform of  finance, taxation, banking, and foreign trade which the state  introduced from the beginning of this year has advanced smoothly  and that the economy is basically normal. Export growth has  accelerated; the exchange rates have remained basically stable;  there has been an increase in the balance of the nation's spot  exchange; and more money has been withdrawn from circulation.  In the first quarter of this year, loans granted by banks to  support industrial and agricultural production and key state  construction projects amounted to 35.1 billion yuan. New bank  deposits totaled 207.2 billion yuan, of which 186.3 billion yuan  are savings deposits by urban and rural residents. The currency  issued prior to the Spring Festival was totally recovered from  circulation by the end of March. Revenue income increased  steadily, and expenditures were basically normal. In the first  quarter, revenues rose by 21.4 percent, while expenditures  increased 23.8 percent.</p>

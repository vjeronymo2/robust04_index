			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Xu Zhaorong (1176 0340 2837)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- Like the wind of spring  coming from the south, Mr. Ma Man-kei, vice chairman of the  Eighth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  [CPPCC] and president of Macao's Chinese Chamber of Commerce,  again punctually arrived here this year to attend the Second  Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee -- as he has done  in many past years. Although almost 70, the venerable Ma is  still full of vitality. He spoke of the National People's  Congress [NPC] and CPPCC sessions with profound feelings: "I  was involved in the CPPCC work in Guangdong for more than two  decades, and during the last 10 years and more, I have been  involved in NPC and CPPCC National Committee work. Overall, I  feel that our NPC and CPPCC work have become more and more  mature. The sessions' proceedings have improved with each  passing year. This year's sessions will further push forward  the reform to build a socialist market economic structure. I am  confident that the sessions will be successful." Speaking of  this, he stepped closer to the reporter and, with an amiable  smile, he said: "I am full of determination and confidence.  The reason is I have faith in the CPC's power."    Speaking of the recent termination of the Sino-British talks  on Hong Kong's political system, his already rosy face reddened:  "Colonialists will not resign themselves to withdrawing from the  stage of history. The British want to continue their colonial  rule in Hong Kong after 1997." At this time, he took this  reporter's notebook and pen and wrote: "The ghost of  imperialism refuses to leave."    He continued: "The British attempt will not succeed.  Whatever tricks it uses will be futile and end up hurting  itself, like lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet.  No force can stop China from regaining its sovereignty over  Hong Kong and achieving national reunification. This is because  China today is already `a completely different story!'"    Partly because of the excitement and partly as a result of  the cold he has had in the last few days, he felt a little tired  and was helped by family members to the bedroom to rest. Before  he left, he introduced his third son, Mao You-li -- who is a  member of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee -- to this  reporter. He said: "Please have more chats on the sessions."    Wearing a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, Ma You-li [you li  meaning courteous], like his name, was quite refined and  courteous and looked like a scholar. Speaking of the Hong Kong  issue, he was also full of just indignation: "The British are  guilty of wishful thinking, and nothing good will come of it for  the British. As Premier Li Peng stressed in the `Government  Work Report,' `British colonial rule in Hong Kong will soon end,  and cannot be stopped by any force.'"    Although born and brought up in Macao, Ma You-li, 46, was  quite familiar with the three components of Marxism. He  believed that the socialist market economy being practiced in  China is compatible with Marxist economics and that it is a road  suited to China's reality and essential to its development, a  road chosen by Comrade Deng Xiaoping by integrating China's  reality with Marxism.    Ma You-li graduated from Hong Kong's Chinese University,  where he studied economic management. He always came back to  what he learned when discussing the NPC and CPPCC sessions: "I  specialize in economics and am engaged in business. Therefore,  I set great store by economic efficiency. It was pointed out in  Premier Li Peng's government work report and General Secretary  Jiang Zemin's recent speech on new development ideas that we  must shift our approach to development to the path of raising  economic efficiency and that we must not continue to follow the  old path of blindly pursuing output value, high development  speed, and investment expansion. These ideas are quite suitable  to the reality of China's economic development." He said:  China has only limited resources and not enough funds. With a  weak economic foundation, it cannot afford to pour its limited  funds and human and material resources into construction  projects that have no or few economic benefits. We cannot  pursue output value if what is produced is worthless and does  not create economic benefits. We must rationally,  scientifically, and effectively distribute our limited  resources. Only by doing so can we push our economy along the  path of healthy development.    He smiled: "As a matter of fact, I already spoke about this  issue during the discussion held by the CPPCC's Macao group. I  also discussed my views on other issues, such as the tide of  migrating workers. I feel that as a CPPCC National Committee  member, I should do something concrete during this session.  Discussing state affairs is our power as well as our duty. The  government also takes our views seriously and tries its best to  improve its work. Therefore, we are confident that through  efforts during and after the sessions, we will achieve  reunification of the motherland and make our country strong and  prosperous."</p>

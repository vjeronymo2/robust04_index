			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: O&amp;Y likely to delay creditors' vote OLYMPIA &amp; York, the troubled Canadian property group, is expected to delay the most crucial vote in its restructuring process while it tries to resolve differences with a key group of unsecured lenders. The unsecured group, which consists mainly of North American, European and Japanese banks, will determine whether the ailing developer is able to emerge in a restructured form from the court bankruptcy protection which it sought last May. Unlike O&amp;Y's secured creditors, whose collateral consists of specific properties and shares in O&amp;Y-controlled companies, the unsecured lenders' claims, which total about CDollars 4bn, are against the company. A total of 33 creditor groups are voting this week on a restructuring plan covering about CDollars 8.5bn in debt. By midday yesterday, 11 groups had approved the company's proposals, while another eight had adjourned their meetings to consider minor amendments. Five meetings were scheduled for yesterday. The unsecured creditors are scheduled to vote on O&amp;Y's proposals on Friday afternoon, but the meeting is likely to be delayed until some time next week. A lawyer for one large unsecured lender said yesterday that one or two sticking points remained. The lawyer said that an agreement would probably be hammered out eventually. 'Everyone is in the same boat with the fundamental interest of making sure the company doesn't sink,' he said. Recoveries by unsecured lenders will depend largely on the course of the North American property market and O&amp;Y's ability to rebuild its property management and development business. One group of secured creditors, with claims on Fifth Avenue Place, a Calgary office building, yesterday rejected O&amp;Y's restructuring proposals. The lenders are thus entitled to seize the building immediately, but have indicated that they will appoint O&amp;Y to manage the property. Secured creditors who approve the reorganisation plan also have the right to take over their collateral, provided they give 30 days notice.</p>

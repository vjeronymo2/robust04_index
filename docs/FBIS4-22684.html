			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Vorobyev, press service of the St. Petersburg </F> Trade Unions Federation: "The Students and the Power: The  Process Has Started...: On the Eve of a Student Rally the St.  Petersburg Government Made Important Decisions"]    [Text] It would seem that the city government is  beginning to understand that the situation that has formed with  the social protection of the St. Petersburg student group is an  explosive one. (This newspaper has written about the student  rally that is planned for 12 April.) Today people are already  demanding the urgent interference of the executive authority in  order to prevent a French recurrence on the banks of the  Neva.    On 7 April the first session of the Commission on Problems  of  the Student Youth was held in the Department of Youth Policy, of  the St. Petersburg government. That commission was created on  the order of city mayor Anatoliy Sobchak. Sergey Prushchak was  appointed chairman of the commission, and Vyacheslav Ryabkov, a  consultant on youth affairs in the St. Petersburg and oblast  Trade Unions Federation, became his deputy. The commission  includes representatives of academy science, the council of  rectors, and tekhnikum directors, as well as the students  themselves and representatives of student trade unions. Now  there has appeared in the structure of the city's executive  authority an agency that has received the right to prepare  drafts of decrees for the St. Petersburg government with regard  to student youth problems.    According to tentative information, Vitaliy Mutko, deputy  chairman of the St. Petersburg government, is supposed to  allocate from the fund for the social protection of the city's  population more than 900 million rubles for 1994 in order to  render assistance to the most needy categories of students. At  the next commission session, on 27 April of this year, there  will be a discussion of the procedure for paying grants in aid  to the most unprotected categories of students.</p>

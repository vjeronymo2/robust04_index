			<p>940428 FT  28 APR 94 / Forging output starts to increase Production in the forging industry has started to increase after four years of decline, but profitability is still poor, the British Forging Industry Association said yesterday. Demand started to grow last October but Mr Brian Benton, association president, warned that exports are unlikely to rise significantly until there is a German economic recovery. The industry last year produced 152,751 tonnes of forgings, 3.8 per cent less than in 1992, reported the association. But production in 1989, before the recession took hold, was 271,452 tonnes.</p>

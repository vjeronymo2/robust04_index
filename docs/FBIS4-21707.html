			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Police Friday [1 April]  arrested two rightists and rescued two people who had been held  hostage for nearly six hours inside the ASAHI SHIMBUN newspaper  headquarters in Tokyo.    Police identified the rightists as Kuniyasu Uchiyama, 41,  and  Toshikazu Furusawa, 29, both from the Taihikai right-wing group.    The two were arrested at around 7:10 p.m. [1010 GMT]  Uchiyama  was carrying a sword at the time of the arrest and police said  they recovered four sticks of dynamite.    The two men had held Kei Aragaki, 57, an executive in charge  of the company's public relations department, and Mikinori  Yoshida, 51, the head of the secretarial department, in an  executive reception room on the 15th floor, police said.    Before breaking into the building, the two rightists,  carrying a sword, a handgun, and what they said were two sticks  of dynamite, threatened a security guard with the handgun,  police said.    Pamphlets distributed by the two men described the mass  media  as a ``class a war criminal'' and called on the ASAHI SHIMBUN to  ``amend the tone of its news coverage.''    The pamphlets also criticized Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa for his failure to retract a statement apologizing for  Japan's wartime activities in Asia which he said were ``a war of  aggression.''    Police said the rightists entered the building at about 1:30  p.m., told the security guard the gun they had was not a fake  and they wanted to meet the company's president.    Police said one of the men fired a shot when another  security  guard approached but no one was injured.    They then rode an elevator to the 15th floor where they used  desks and potted plants to barricade themselves inside the  executive reception room with the hostages.    Police said the two men arrested Friday told the security  guard they are ``disciples'' of [Taihikhai leader] Nomura.  Furusawa was Nomura's secretary and chauffeur.    He was present in the same room with Nomura and other ASAHI  SHIMBUN executives when Nomura shot himself [in October 1993],  police said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, April 28 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the  United States met behind closed doors Thursday [28 April] to  discuss a diplomatic solution to the dispute over Pyongyang's  nuclear program, sources here said.    Washington expressed its willingness to hold a third round  of  high-level talks with Pyongyang as well as suspend ``Team  Spirit,'' the annual joint South Korean-U.S. military exercise,  if North Korea permits additional outside nuclear inspections  and agrees to resume inter-Korean dialogue.    The United States said North Korea should allow the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to observe the  refueling of the 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon and satisfy the  IAEA's calls for collection of samples and other technical work,  informed sources said.    The State Department announced that at the working-level  contact Thursday, the U.S. side conveyed a letter from Robert  Gallucci, assistant secretary for political and military  affairs, in response to a written message from Kang Sok-chu,  North Korea's first vice foreign minister.    The State Department said it expects that North Korea will  answer the letter soon.    Gallucci reportedly said in the message the United States  will hold further high-level talks and suspend Team Spirit if  North Korea maintains the continuity of nuclear safeguards by  allowing additional inspections, the sources said.    North Korea did not present any new proposals, instead just  listening to the U.S. position, but will likely disclose its  stance at the next contact expected early next week, sources  said.    The meeting was made at the request of the U.S. side.    The State Department's North Korea desk officer, C. Kenneth  Quinones, led the Americans while the councilor at the North  Korean mission to the United Nations, Han Song-yol, headed the  other side.    The two nations agreed at their 25 February contact that  North Korea would accept IAEA inspections of seven declared  nuclear sites, that they would hold a third round of high-level  talks, that Team Spirit would be suspended this year, and that  South and North Korea would exchange special envoys.    But North Korea refused to exchange special envoys and did  not accept IAEA checks of a radiochemical laboratory, in effect  breaking the agreement.</p>

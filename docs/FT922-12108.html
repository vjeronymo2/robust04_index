			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: Aran buys N Sea oil stake ARAN ENERGY Exploration, the UK subsidiary of Aran Energy, the Dublin-based oil company, is paying Dollars 26.4m (Pounds 14.9m) for a one-third interest in North Sea Block 211/24a from the UK arm of Chevron. The acquisition includes Chevron's 14.38 per cent stake in the Dunlin oilfield and its associated share of the Brent pipeline system. Aran said the consideration may be reduced 'to take account of the resolution of outstanding commercial issues which may result in additional economic benefits' to the company, but that in any event the final price would be not less than Dollars 19m. Mr Michael Whelan, Aran's chief executive, said he could not detail what those benefits would be. However, the full price of Dollars 26.4m will be paid only if those benefits accrue to Aran. The acquisition gives Aran access to 11m barrels of oil in the Dunlin field from remaining proven recoverable reserves of 52.4m barrels at July 1 1992. Production from the field in the second half of 1992 is expected to be 22,500 barrels of oil per day, of which Aran will have 4,740 bpd. The field is operated by Shell UK and the platform facilities are also used by the nearby Osprey field on a tariff basis. The transaction is conditional on the waiving of pre-emption rights by the other participants in the block within 60 days and on regulatory clearance in the UK. Aran does not expect the transaction to be completed before June 26.</p>

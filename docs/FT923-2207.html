			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (10): Invoking the human factor  -The urban village, John Willman explores a princely concept 'I HAVE for many years been concerned about the harmful effect which a great deal of urban redevelopment has on the human spirit,' wrote the Prince of Wales in his introduction to the recently published report from the Urban Villages Group. The Prince was endorsing the group's advocacy of a new form of development, which would enhance the quality and vitality of urban life by creating living towns and cities. But publication of the report* has rekindled the debate over the nature of much of the UK's inner-city regeneration, and stimulated new interest in the urban-villages concept of small, mixed-use redevelopment. Certainly, concern over the nature of the 'one-dimensional, monocultural cities', created in the period of post-war reconstruction, is not confined to the Prince. His view that such development had created 'soulless inhuman environments', partly responsible for 'the horrendous social problems which have beset inner cities', is widely shared. But it remains to be seen whether there will be equally widespread consensus behind the Prince's alternative, sketched out in his 1989 book, A vision of Britain: 'I am hoping that we can encourage the development of 'urban villages' in order to reintroduce human scale intimacy and a vibrant street life. These factors can help to restore to people their sense of belonging and pride in their own surroundings.' Both regenerated areas and new developments should, wherever possible, include the basic ingredients of community life: places of employment, entertainment and public assembly, as well as housing. Areas such as London's Clerkenwell and Edinburgh New Town were identified by the Prince as embodying such characteristics, with Montparnasse in Paris and Charleston in the US as international exemplars. The Prince's challenge was taken up by a group of developers, builders, planners and architects who formed the Urban Villages Group under the aegis of Business in the Community. Chaired by Trevor Osborne, chairman of Speyhawk, it included such luminaries as David Goldstone of Regalian Properties, Martin Laing of builders John Laing, Tim Melville-Ross of Nationwide Building Society and Bob Williams of Grand Metropolitan Estates. Leon Krier, the Luxembourg architect and masterplanner behind many European public development projects, was a particularly influential member of the group. They spent two years visiting the urban areas commended by the Prince, and also some of the development blackspots. The aim was to refine the elements which created community spirit, pride of place and a sense of belonging, so that they could be applied more widely. At the heart of the urban-village project is the concept of 'mixity', an antidote to single-use development which divides towns and cities into large areas devoted solely to industry, commerce or housing. The ideal urban village creates a 'whole district', with 3,000 to 5,000 inhabitants; ideally it should include places to work, live and play over no more than 100 acres (40 hectares) - all, therefore, within easy walking distance. 'Mixity needs to be accepted in planning terminology as a form of sustainable development,' says Mr Osborne. He is urging the environment secretary to issue a planning guidance note, which would encourage local planning authorities to reflect the concept in their local plans. The group advocates a new planning category of Structured Planned Urban Development (or Spud for short), which would recognise the mixed-use approach and offer developers protection against piecemeal tinkering with the area. However, many planners are less sure about the practicality of such mixed-use development, where the needs of commerce and industry may conflict with the leisure and residential uses located cheek by jowl. David Hall, director of the Town and Country Planning Association, has reservations about how much of the housing that will be needed over the next 20 years can be provided through urban villages. 'It simply won't be possible to provide the 2.8m homes needed between now and 2011 in urban areas,' he says. Mr Hall also worries that too much is being expected of the built environment: 'There are other causes than the environment for riots on bleak post-war housing estates in Newcastle and Coventry, such as unemployment among young people or the lack of social support. Creating a good environment simply won't solve such problems.' Whatever the reservations, there is certainly support for a more humane approach to redevelopment in the European Commission, whose green paper The Urban Environment reflects much of the thinking of the Urban Villages report. The Commission has also been supportive financially, contributing Pounds 35,000 towards the cost of printing the group's glossy and lavishly illustrated report. In a glowing encomium, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the environment commissioner when the report was launched, described it as 'an important contribution to the ongoing debate on how our cities can be made liveable and environmentally friendly'. Mr di Meana went on to commend the 'special group of people who have come together to say it, (particularly) the construction and development industries'. That throws the ball neatly back into the court of those with the power to change the nature of much modern redevelopment. The Prince of Wales himself has already attempted to put his ideas into practice, with Poundbury, a new settlement on Duchy of Cornwall land at Dorchester, in Dorset. The experience has been salutary, he says, in demonstrating the 'complexity and stubbornness of the issues'. The Urban Villages Group has also tried to take the approach into the development stage, with the creation of the Urban Villages Company. A commercial joint venture between several builders and developers, it is investigating four sites in England and Wales, to select one for the location of an urban village. The group's report also has a role to play in disseminating ideas through conferences and training courses for architects and planners. Whether it can succeed in persuading builders and developers to abandon their predilection for the larger-scale projects, which are their bread and butter, remains to be seen. *Urban Villages.

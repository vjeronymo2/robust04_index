			<p>BFN     [Text] The Thai-Burmese regional border committee started  its ninth meeting in Bangkok yesterday with highlights of  discussions on illegal Burmese immigrants, disputed border areas  and fisheries problems.    First Army Region Commander Lt Gen Chetha Thanajaro said  representatives from both sides would first hold unofficial  talks to accelerate the negotiation process, and that the  meeting itself will discuss the agreed topics and details.    He said bilateral problems abound since the two countries  share an over 2,000-km-long border, but that previous meetings  had gradually helped resolve several thorny issues.    Many problems cannot be settled in one go, and both sides  have to hold several more rounds of negotiations to finalize  their agreement, he added.    "For example, on the question of illegal (Burmese)  immigrants, they (Burmese officials) have pledged to tighten up  their control, and thus the number has dr@pped from over 300,000  to about 200,000," he said.    Bangkok will be the venue of the first three-day meeting,  while both sides will meet on the fourth in Pattaya. The  Burmese team, headed by Southern Commander Maj Gen Khet Sein,  will on Friday pay a visit to the petrochemical industries in  Lam Chabang Eastern Seaboard.</p>

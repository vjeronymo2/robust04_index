			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with an ASAHI SHIMBUN correspondent  at a hotel near Narita Air Port on 14 April, the Dalai Lama, 58,  a paramount Tibetan religious and political leader, stated:  "China has trampled human rights in Tibet. I hope Japan and  other nations will put pressure on China to halt the  infringement of human rights in Tibet." The Tibetan religions  leader granted the interview during his brief half-day stopover  in Japan on his way to the United States for a meeting with  American scientists.    In the interview, the Dalai Lama stressed there is no change  in his position stressed in the 1988 Strasburg proposal that he  does not seek complete the independence of Tibet, and will allow  China to retain its power to handle Tibet's foreign and defense  policies. In the interview, he candidly admitted that the  Chinese Government has yet to make any positive response to his  proposal.    Asked who will succeed the Panchen Lama, the Buddhist leader  in Tibet who ranks 2nd only to the Dalai Lama in the Tibetan  Buddhist hierarchy, the Tibetan religious leader said he has a  list of candidates compiled by China and which contains five  candidates. During the interview, he disclosed that he asked the  Chinese Government to choose a successor to the Panchen Lama  based on traditional methods, not on political reasons. He also  proposed sending a survey team to that end, but the Chinese  Government has rejected his request.</p>

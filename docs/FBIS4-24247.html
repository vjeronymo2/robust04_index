			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of the Constitutional Conference have been  asked to evolve a system of government that would guarantee a  stable society and accommodate all shades of opinion without  oppressing or marginalizing any section or group. Inaugurating  the body in Abuja today, the head of state, General Sani Abacha,  explained that the virtues and disadvantages of both  parliamentary and presidential systems of government. [sentence  as heard] He also asked the conference to devise a system of  checking elected representatives to ensure that participation of  citizens was beyond mere casting of their ballots.    Gen. Abacha also called on the members not to regard their  appointment as another exercise of constitution making. He said  the problems facing the country were beyond mere acts of  constitution making. He lamented how the country spent most of  its 34 years of independence in the midst of crises of  legitimacy, secession, and that of national acceptable  leadership.    The head of state also spoke of the need to strengthen the  judiciary and ensure open scrutiny of the activities of law  enforcement agencies to enhance and protect fundamental rights  of citizens. Gen. Abacha told delegates to be cautious on the  issue of revenue allocation formula, adding that whatever  recommendation they may come up with must ensure that revenue  allocation complement rather than substitute revenue generation.    On the terminal date of his administration, Gen. Abacha said  government would fix such date only after making reference to  the decisions of the conference. He then gave assurance that  the conference would not only enjoy total freedom but its  decisions would also be set aside by the government. [sentence  as heard]</p>

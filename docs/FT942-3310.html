			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: BSS up 51% and sees more growth BSS Group, the heating, plumbing and process control supplier, ended four years of unchanged dividends after reporting a 51 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.54m to Pounds 9.86m for the year to March 31. A final dividend of 12p (11.5p) is recommended, bringing the total to 17.75p (17.25p) on earnings per share up 44 per cent from 16.7p to 24p. Operating profits rose from Pounds 7.84m to Pounds 10.8m on increased sales of Pounds 258.1m (Pounds 243.7m). The strongest contribution came from the industrial and commercial construction division where profits rose by 27 per cent to Pounds 12.7m on turnover of Pounds 154.4m (Pounds 149.8m). The domestic division, one of the top three distributors to the heating market in the UK, showed a turnround from losses of Pounds 712,000 to profits of Pounds 44,000 following the integration of three businesses, Heatek, Labone and Cadel, into a new company, Zenith Plumbpoint. Mr Alan Milne, finance director, said the turnround had been achieved now that the 'worst of the recession is behind us'. However, the upturn in the construction industry remained tentative. In the commercial sector new building work remained 40 per cent below the peak volumes of 1990. But, as a market leader he predicted that BSS would continue to take market share. He said the company was 'very positive about the next few years when we will see good growth in our performance'. To raise its competitive position and to improve stock availability, the company said it would establish a single national trunking and central warehousing system. Net borrowings were reduced from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 13.2m for gearing at the period end of 21.3 per cent (25.5 per cent). Interest charges fell from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 958,000.</p>

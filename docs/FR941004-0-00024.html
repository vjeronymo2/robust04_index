On February 16, 1994, a private citizen from Michigan submitted comments regarding Massachusetts' car and truck vehicle registrations, and the effect on the Massachusetts Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) program. EPA has found this comment not germane to approval of the Transit and HOV Facilities rules as a SIP Amendment. On February 18, 1994, The Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) submitted comments generally supporting approval of the Transit System Improvement and HOV rules into the SIP. Finally, on February 18, 1994, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MA DEP) submitted comments requesting that EPA consider delaying final action on the HOV/Transit SIP rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The region has responded fully to CLF and MA DEP comments in a memorandum attached to the Technical Support Document (TSD) available in the docket for this action. A brief summary of these comments and EPA's responses appears below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Conservation Law Foundation generally supported approval of the Transit System Improvement and HOV rules into the SIP, but also requested clarification of several aspects of EPA's proposed approval. In support of the transit system improvement rule, CLF noted that several of the transit measures provided for in the rule are mitigation measures responding to the potential air quality impacts of the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel. EPA agrees that completion of these measures, including the ``Old Colony'' rail line, are important transportation control measures that should help reduce VMT growth on the Central Artery. What follows is EPA's response to CLF's particular concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> 1.

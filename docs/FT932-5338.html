			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Toyota to boost output ahead of schedule TOYOTA, the Japanese carmaker, plans to produce 100,000 cars during 1994 at its Burnaston plant near Derby, a year ahead of its previously announced schedule. Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota, said the company was also considering producing a second model range at the Pounds 700m UK plant in addition to the Carina E large family car, which started production there last December. Toyota had previously said it was developing capacity to build 200,000 cars a year at the Burnaston plant, which will be officially opened today. Mr Toyoda said that output of the Carina E range was unlikely to exceed 140,000 to 150,000 a year. Toyota plans to produce 36,000 cars this year at Burnaston. Toyota has not yet decided what additional range should be produced in the UK, but Mr Toyoda said that smaller cars were winning an increasing share of the overall market for new cars in Europe. Toyota said that it had also advanced its local-content targets for the UK plant with the aim of reaching 80 per cent local European content by the end of 1994 rather than by mid-1995. The Japanese carmaker, which employs 1,350 at its UK car assembly and engine plants - including 100 at its Pounds 140m engine plant at Deeside, Clwyd - is planning to recruit a further 600 employees by the end of 1993. It expects to reach full production on a single shift by the end of the year and will begin two-shift working in January next year at Burnaston. The UK workforce is expected to reach 3,300 - including 300 at Deeside  - at a production level of 200,000 cars a year. Mr Toyoda said that the present strength of the Japanese yen favoured a more rapid build-up of production in Europe. He said, however, that the yen was 'overvalued' at present exchange rates. 'At Y110 to Dollars 1 Japanese labour rates are very high,' Mr Toyoda added. Toyota was not yet planning to export vehicles from the UK to markets outside Europe, but this was a possibility at a later stage, Mr Toyoda said. 'With an overvalued yen this becomes a possibility. We did not expect the yen to be this strong.' Toyota has not yet decided to invest in a fully-fledged research and development centre in Europe for new vehicle design and engineering, said Mr Toyoda, but this was under consideration. 'Within 10 years there is the possibility of having a technical centre in Europe with the capacity to develop new models,' he said. Toyota has a small technical centre in Zaventem, Belgium, which assists in the design and development of vehicles for the European market and carries out type approval work to meet European regulations. It also has a small design centre in Zaventem for studying European design trends. Volkswagen results, Page 21</p>

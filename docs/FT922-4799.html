			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Bonds that carry far more generous terms - The Battle for Midland THE BONDS offered to Midland shareholders under the revised offer from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation carry far more generous terms than under the initial offer. If the bid is approved, the subordinated bonds will be priced to yield 2.4 per cent more than UK government paper of the same maturity, compared with a spread of 1.6 per cent under the initial offer. The bonds have also been underwritten. Midland shareholders could sell bonds back to underwriters at this agreed level - the first time the Eurobond market has been used as a source of bid funding in this way. The issue will also be smaller than under the original offer. The maximum size of the issue is now Pounds 454m, reduced from Pounds 700m. Bankers said yesterday that the smaller size of the bond issue did not reflect a shortage of firms willing to underwrite paper on the new terms. 'At this level the underwriters will not have to work very hard for their fees,' commented a new issue manager at a leading sterling firm not involved in the transaction. Subordinated bonds issued by other banks trade at much lower yields in the secondary market. For example, 10-year subordinated bonds issued by Standard Chartered were yesterday trading on a yield spread of about 1.75 per cent over gilts. However, direct comparison with bonds issued by other banks is difficult: the paper would be issued by HSBC, the holding company for Hongkong Bank and Midland Bank, rather than an operating subsidiary. Since the main assets of the holding company are the shares of the operating banks, holders of subordinated bonds issued by HSBC would rank below all the creditors of both Hongkong Bank and Midland. Bankers said yesterday that this degree of subordination could be worth an additional 0.3 per cent in yield. the wide yield spread also reflects the need to offer underwriters a buffer against some potentially large risks. The firms have agreed to underwrite the paper at a fixed yield spread for an indeterminate period - possibly until August if the bid is delayed. This exposes them to the risk that yield spreads in the market as a whole will widen, leaving them owning bonds priced out of line with the market. Moreover, the underwriting agreement does not protect underwriters against either 'force majeure' or 'material adverse change' in the condition of HSBC during the underwriting period. The cost of underwriting a conventional 10-year subordinated bond issue in the Eurobond market is usually between 0.4 and 0.5 per cent of the amount raised - anything up to Pounds 2.25m for a deal of this size. HSBC is likely to be paying at least this amount in terms of both fees and the wide yield spread at which the bonds are underwritten. The underwriting syndicate assembled by HSBC contained no surprises: Schroder's and Cazenove are not known for underwriting capacity in the bond market but have relationships with HSBC and Midland. Warburg is both an adviser to HSBC and a leading sterling bond firm. Credit Suisse First Boston is one of the few main forces in the sterling market not allied to Lloyds, such as Baring Brothers, or owned by another UK clearing bank. A small number of other firms may be added to the underwriting syndicate today. At Pounds 454m the issue would not be the largest sterling bond issue made by a company. In April, Hanson launched a Pounds 500m Eurosterling bond issue lead managed by CSFB. However, earlier subordinated bond issues by banks have been far smaller in size - up to Pounds 150m. It is clear that the underwriters were only comfortable backing a Pounds 450m issue if the paper was priced to sell.</p>

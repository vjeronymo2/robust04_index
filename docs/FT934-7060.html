			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Many employers still losing sleep over EU work directive Mr Richard Roberts is typical of the 15 per cent of British manufacturing workers who regularly work a night shift. The 32-year-old chemical worker, a father of three, much prefers working four 10-hour shifts to doing five of eight hours. The European Union's controversial working time directive, which will be formally passed in Brussels tomorrow, will make it more difficult for him to do so. Both government and employers say that the sting has been drawn from the directive - especially in relation to the attention-grabbing 48-hour week limit. But there is still regulation in areas such as night work and statutory holidays which may bring fundamental changes in three years. By then the directive will have to be implemented in Britain, unless the British government's legal challenge to it should unexpectedly succeed. Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, head of the European employers' body Unice, says that thanks to sweeping revisions Europe's employers 'can now live with the directive'. Fundamental changes have indeed been achieved. For British employers alone there will be no 48-hour week limit for at least 10 years, although no employee can be forced to work more than 48 hours. Even for employers in the other 11 member states the 'reference period' within which the working week must not exceed an average of 48 hours will be a minimum of 4 months and, with union agreement, a maximum of 12. There is exemption for workers at sea, in transport industries, and doctors in training, in all 12 member states. Other groups with specific exemptions will have to be provided with 'appropriate' protection rather than 'equivalent' as planned. Attempts to establish Sunday as a statutory day of rest or to make all night work dependent on union agreement have been blocked. So what are British employers still worried about? 'There is still a lot of devil in the detail, but we will not know exactly how we will be hit until the directive has been translated into UK law,' says Mr Peter Reid of the Engineering Employers Federation. Privately, one employer also confided that he feared the legislation might 'change attitudes' and make people more reluctant to work the long hours that they do in Britain. A minimum rest period of 11 hours per 24 hours is not likely to pose a problem for many employers. But the entitlement to paid annual holidays of at least four weeks could have a big effect in Britain, where holiday provision, like much else, has no statutory underpinning. Another area of worry for British employers is night work. The ruling that night shifts must not exceed eight hours will require changes to many shift patterns. Night workers suffering from health problems will have the right to be transferred to day work, though that has been watered down to 'whenever possible'. Also, the fact that equivalent health and safety services must be available for night workers could mean plants with their own medical staff will have to have them on duty, not just on call, at night. Nonetheless, government officials say privately that the directive is now bearable, provided it is sensibly implemented. But Mr Reid of the EEF and many labour lawyers wonder how parliamentary draughtsmen will deal with parts of the directive - such as the requirement to 'take account' of the monotony of shift work. The working time directive, like other parts of the EU's social dimension, fits better with the tradition of regulations and codes of practice of continental Europe than with British common law. But the imposition of the directive on Britain, albeit in watered-down form, marks another small step toward UK convergence with those continental traditions.</p>

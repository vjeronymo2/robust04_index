			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Leader Umberto Bossi by </F> unidentified correspondent -- live]    [Excerpts] [Bossi] The figures are more or less what one  could have expected, at least what we expected. Now we have to  see how many seats we have, how many parliamentarians we have.  I think we can say that we can govern with the Freedom  Alliance, but bearing in mind that for years the League has  guaranteed democracy in the country, and it will have to assess  how to prevent the reactionary right from getting through, so we  want to understand things well. [sentence as heard] First, see  the programs, then undertstand with whom and how, in short, a  government can be formed. [passage omitted]    We have a general indication that the Freedom Alliance has  won, together with the MSI [Italian Social Movement], i.e., the  vote that comes from the south which will reopen the North's  wallet, in short. So, you will understand we have to understand  each other to assess whether there is space for an agreement for  government. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Do you see a reactionary right wing?    [Bossi] Yes, there it is with 12 percent given to the MSI.  [passage omitted]</p>

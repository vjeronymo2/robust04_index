			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Czech privatisation chief on graft charge The director of the Czech Republic's coupon privatisation programme has been arrested and charged with taking a bribe to manipulate a stock tender. Mr Jaroslav Lizner's arrest has reopened allegations of high-level corruption in the Czech Republic's privatisation programme, which has seen billions of dollars of state assets sold to private investors. Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, yesterday described Mr Lizner's arrest as 'a bolt from the blue' but denied that it would harm the privatisation programme, which is due to be completed early next year. Police arrested Mr Lizner after he accepted Kc8.33m (Pounds 188,000) to ensure the awarding of stock under the country's vouchers-for-shares scheme, a government spokesman said. Mr Lizner heads the Centre for Coupon Privatisation (CKP), which administers the programme that grants shares in privatised companies to citizens in exchange for government vouchers given for a nominal fee. Finance minister Mr Ivan Kocarnik said his deputy, Mr Vladimir Rudlovcak, would take over the directorate of the CKP until the graft case against Mr Lizner was resolved. Mr Kocarnik said Mr Rudlovcak would immediately take over the post and that the current wave of privatisations would proceed as planned. Mr Lizner is also the director of the Central Securities Registry (SCP), the central clearing house where all bond and share transactions in the Czech Republic must be registered. Police, acting on a tip, observed Mr Lizner as he met three people outside a Prague restaurant late on Monday, a government spokesman said. All four were apprehended after Mr Lizner accepted the money packed in a briefcase. Mr Lizner was charged with corruption and 'serious criminal economic activity'. The three other people involved were later released. The coupon programme has proved highly successful and has been held up as an example to other former communist countries trying to build a market economy, but allegations of corruption and favouritism have abounded. Mr Klaus has repeatedly dismissed any pitfalls in the privatisation system he helped design, saying that speed was more important than accuracy. Mr Klaus told a news conference yesterday the Lizner incident was 'lightning from a clear sky' and would not affect the future of the programme, which is due to release a wave of shares early next year. 'In view of its relationship to the continuation of coupon privatisation, this has nothing in common,' he said. The scheme is currently concluding its second wave by privatising 861 companies, after exchanging shares in nearly 1,000 companies in the first wave, which ended in 1992.</p>

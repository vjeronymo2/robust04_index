			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS FOR LOOKS: STYLISH GUIDE TO COLLECTING AN ART FORM  </P> <P> The Bakelite Jewelry Book, by Corinne A. Davidov and Ginny Redington Dawes  (Abbeville Press: $35).  </P> <P> This is a celebration of the cheeky plastic costume jewelry manufactured  primarily from 1933 to 1941. Like the jewelry itself, the book is direct,  colorful and stylish -- occasionally elegant and occasionally silly.  </P> <P> The authors, both of whom are serious Bakelite collectors, have managed to  convey their delight and appreciation for this funky art form in both their  words and photo choices.  </P> <P> They have assembled an impressive history of Bakelite jewelry as well as  numerous examples of both common and rare pieces. They have also included a  useful price guide for beginning collectors.  </P> <P> Heads-Up Advice on Care of the Skin  </P> <P> Smart Face: A Dermatologist's Guide to Saving Your Money and Saving Your Skin,  by Thomas Goodman MD and Stephanie Young (Prentice Hall Press: $9.95).  </P> <P> For those perlexed by all the emerging terms and claims describing today's  "advanced" skin-care products and treatment routines, this book provides  considerable help in making informed consumer choices.  </P> <P> It's particularly useful in that it provides extensive information in areas  usually treated only superficially in the mass media. An entire chapter is  devoted to the subject of sun damage and sun protection, for instance. And the  chapter on moisturizing not only gives the standard information on what  moisturizers can and cannot accomplish, it also describes the functions of the  new, so-called "super moisturizers," which contain such ingredients as  hyaluronic acid.  </P> <P> In addition, the authors (a Memphis dermatologist and a free-lance writer based  in New York City) have included a lengthy, though incomplete, list of popular  cosmetic products, with comments on their ingredients, price, skin-type  suitability and unique properties.

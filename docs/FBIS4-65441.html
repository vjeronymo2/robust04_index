			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`mes'-signed report: "Scharping Defends Himself Against </F> Criticism From Industry"]    [Text] Bonn -- A public row on future economic and  financial policy has suddenly deteriorated relations between  leading industrial associations and the Social Democratic Party  of Germany [SPD]. While SPD chairman Rudolf Scharping  criticized the German Confederation of Trade and Industry's  [DIHT] "biased support" for the ruling government coalition, the  Association of German Industry [BDI] criticized the SPD's  government plans, claiming that they are geared to a  redistribution of funds.    Industry's criticism of the SPD program coincides with the  publication of the results of new surveys showing that more  people think Helmut Kohl will win the October elections than  they did a few weeks ago. SPD general manager Guenter Verheugen  said that the SPD leadership rejects the industrial criticism,  based on false assumptions, as a "massive biased interference"  on Kohl's behalf. Vorheugen "urgently" called on the industrial  associations to be more restrained and "not interfere in the  election campaign in such a way."    Scharping revealed a five-page letter he had written to DIHT  Chairman Hans Peter Stihl, rejecting the criticism Stihl had  expressed one week ago and asking him "for the sake of future  cooperation to be so kind as to restrict his criticism of SPD  resolutions to those resolutions which the SPD has actually  adopted." Among other things, Stihl had said that Scharping's  appointment as chancellor would have a negative effect on  economic development and employment, as illustrated by the SPD's  plans for taxation and energy policy.    In his letter to Stihl, Scharping reminded him that during  mutual talks, the SPD leadership and the DIHT had agreed that  the only way to solve the economic difficulties was gradually to  overcome the problem of unemployment. The SPD, said Scharping,  has recognized this need and drawn clear conclusions. For  instance, it has resolved that taxation cannot exceed the level  planned for 1995. All the expenditures foreseen in the SPD  program are strictly dependent on the size of funds, said  Scharping, who also promised that the SPD would attach priority  to a reduction in wage-related costs on account of the  competitiveness of enterprises.    Further in this letter to Stihl, Scharping dismissed Stihl's  opinion that the SPD's plan to impose greater tax on family  firms and increase capital gains tax would lead to the  liquidation of entire businesses. He also rejected the claim  that the SPD was trying to impose the costs of German unity on  one-fifth of the population.    Apart from the DIHT, BDI General Manager Ludolf Georg von  Wartenberg and employers' confederation chief Klaus Murmann also  criticized the SPD plans. Wartenberg said the SPD was too  concerned about a redistribution of funds, and Murmann charged  the SPD with failing to explain how it intended to finance its  expenditures.</p>

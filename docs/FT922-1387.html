			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Ivory &amp; Sime jumps to Pounds 4.55m after restructuring IVORY &amp; SIME, the Edinburgh-based fund manager, announced a 55 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.55m for the year ended April 30, but opted not to increase dividends. The final was unchanged at 4.5p, making a same again total of 5.75p. Mr David Newbigging, chairman, said the decision had been made to restore dividend cover to a more prudent level. He added that it was now the directors' intention 'to recommend dividend increases in line with any increases in earnings per share'. Earnings jumped from 6.15p to 9p per share, leaving the dividend covered 1.56 times. It said that such fast growth in earnings per share was unlikely to be sustained. According Mr Allan Munro, managing director, the company's main aim was to restore funds under management, which rose 11 per cent to Pounds 2.9bn during the year, following a 16.5 per cent rise in the previous year. These had decreased substantially between 1985 and 1988 - pension funds alone dropped from more than Pounds 1bn to around Pounds 500m during the period - and confidence was initially damaged when new management was installed in April 1990, after the group's former managing director and four senior fund managers left abruptly. The company also restructured its marketing department last year to aim its investment trusts more directly at private investors via regular savings schemes and personal equity plans. The company intends continuing with this effort, as well as trying to find new institutional clients. The figures also take account of Ivory &amp; Sime's purchase of Argosy Asset Management with Pounds 420m of funds for Pounds 1.75m last April. Administrative expenses were held to Pounds 9.94m (Pounds 9.88m).</p>

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber traders see pressure on prices as Thais scale down official purchases Thai officials buying rubber on behalf of the government have been told to cool down their purchasing this week so as not to compete with private traders, according to an official of the central rubber market, reports Reuters from Bangkok. 'Our buyers, some 30 of them from the state Rubber Estate Organisation, will from now on not compete with the private sector for supplies,' Mr Chakarn Saengruksawong, director of the Rubber Research Institute said. In recent months Thai rubber prices have surged to around Bt24-25 (63p-65p) a kilogram in response to tightness of supplies and big government supply contracts, notably a contract with China that still has some 100,000 tonnes outstanding. 'Officials are negotiating with the Chinese to postpone deliveries for two to three months when rubber supplies are expected to get back to normal,' Mr Chakarn said. He explained that the government did not want to see traders going out of business because of losses sustained from honouring contracts that were concluded when prices were about Bt19 earlier in the year. Singapore rubber traders said the Thai news could send the market lower. 'This means that the government is not going to chase the market,' one senior broker said. 'The current upsurge in Tokyo and Singapore is mainly due to the Thai government competing with the locals for supplies.' With the latest Thai government's move, Singapore traders said they were not sure how the government could now meet its contracted rubber shipments.</p>

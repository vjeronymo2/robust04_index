			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Holiday price cuts continue MORE travel agents and tour operators yesterday announced discounts and price cuts for the 1994 season. Thomson, the UK's biggest tour operator, launched its new brochure including cuts worth Pounds 60m on next season's holidays. It said they would result in prices about 6 per cent lower than this year. Mr Charles Newbold, Thomson managing director, said further price cuts might follow if the group were undercut by its main rivals, Airtours and Owners Abroad. 'We will do whatever it takes to maintain market share,' he said. 'I would not say I would be happy with a price war, but you can't stay out of it.' However, a director of another leading tour operator said yesterday that he believed the price-cutting would be shortlived. 'It's a phoney war,' he said. 'None of us could exist in a permanent state of discounting.' The first shot in the pricing battle was fired on Monday, when travel agent Thomas Cook announced a 10 per cent discount on prices of all holidays in its 1994 brochure. That was immediately matched by Pickfords and Hogg Robinson, and yesterday AT Mays, the UK's largest independent travel agent chain, said it would offer 10 per cent discounts. Lunn Poly, which is owned by Thomson, said it would also announce discounts at the launch tomorrow of its new brochure. 'We will not be beaten for price,' the company warned. The biggest discounts are being offered to consumers who book early. Thomson saw its market share in the lucrative pre-Christmas booking period dip sharply for the 1993 season. This year it hopes to increase its share of the pre-Christmas market from 33 per cent to 50 per cent. 'We expect the pre-Christmas market to grow from 1.5m to 2m holidays this year, and Thomson wants the biggest share of that,' said Mr Newbold. Thomson is forecasting a big increase in tourists travelling to mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands. Overall, Thomson forecasts that the package holiday market should return to its 1988 level of about 10m holidaymakers against this year's 8.5m.</p>

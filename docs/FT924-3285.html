			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Amstrad group will appoint two non-executive directors AMSTRAD, the consumer electronics group whose shareholders meet tomorrow to decide the fate of Mr Alan Sugar's 30p-a-share buy-out bid, has bowed to pressure from investors and is to appoint two non-executive directors to its board. Yesterday, as the deadline for receipt of proxies for the group's extraordinary meeting passed, Amstrad acknowledged that Mr Sugar's Pounds 113m bid to take the company private again looks 'increasingly likely' to be defeated. In a tacit admission that the Amstrad chairman's proposals have met strong opposition, the company said it had asked Pro Ned, the independent organisation which promotes the role of non-executives, to draw up a shortlist of potential candidates for the Amstrad board. An advertisement to be published in the Financial Times tomorrow says the first applicant 'should have sufficiently senior experience to be able to appraise all financial aspects of the company'. It says the second applicant, 'should be an industrialist with a consumer product manufacturing background, or be highly experienced in the distribution of consumer products to trade customers'. An unusual accompanying statement says that although the advertisement has been placed by Amstrad, 'the board wish to demonstrate their independence in the appointment of two non- executive directors', and have therefore entrusted the selection of a short list to Pro Ned. Mr Sugar, Amstrad's chairman and founder who has a personal 35 per cent stake in the group, said at the group's annual meeting last month that if his bid failed he would appoint new non-executive directors to the board. Since Mr Sugar made his buy-back offer, institutional investors in particular have been extremely critical that there was no 'independent voice' on the Amstrad board looking after minority shareholder interests. Mr Tim Holland-Bosworth, a director at Kleinwort Benson, Amstrad's financial adviser, acknowledged yesterday that 'a number of institutional shareholders had made the point' that they wanted to see non-executive directors back on the six-member Amstrad board. Amstrad had two non-executive directors after it became a public company in 1980, but both have since left. Institutional investors, led by Prudential and Postel, have cited the lack of non-executive directors and the absence of financial forecasts and other information on Amstrad's prospects, as reasons for opposing the deal. Amstrad's share price, which dropped 4p to 24p on Monday after it became clear that the plan faced strong opposition, closed 1p up at 25p yesterday.</p>

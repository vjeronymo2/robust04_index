			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Talks over Azerbaijan oil return to square one SEVEN WEEKS after a coup undid a groundbreaking oil deal just before it was to be signed, western companies have resumed negotiations from scratch with the Caspian Sea republic of Azerbaijan. In meetings that began this week, the new Azeri government is reportedly talking tougher - sometimes with barely concealed hostility - than did the negotiating team of the toppled president, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey. According to western oil officials in the Azeri capital, the government has a range of demands, including that Azerbaijan receives up to 80 per cent of the profits from its estimated 4bn barrels of oil reserves. The government, now headed by a Brezhnev-era leader, Mr Heidar Aliyev, has also refused to refund Dollars 70m in signing bonuses that eight western companies advanced just a day before the government's suspension of the deal on June 23. The deal was supposed to be signed at the end of June in London, but it fell through when Mr Elchibey, under pressure from a rebel colonel, fled on June 18. That colonel, Mr Surat Husseinov, is now the Azeri prime minister. None of the eight companies has backed out of the negotiations, though they have spent this week with the frustrating task of explaining the basics of the complex deal to a mostly fresh Azeri team. The companies, some of whom have been negotiating with various Azeri governments for two years, are staying tight-lipped about the new talks, fearful of saying anything publicly that could kill the deal. 'They have their expectations, and we have our expectations. We'll just have to see how it comes out in the end,' one of the oil officials said. Mr Aliyev has taken a leading role in the new discussions. He has forced the resignation of the state oil chief, Mr Sabit Bagirov, whom western oil officials respected as a fair, apolitical technocrat. Mr Bagirov was replaced by a little-known geologist, Mr Natik Aliyev, who is not related to the Azeri president. Mr Aliyev then transferred the geologist's decision-making powers to parliament, which the Azeri leader heads. At a public meeting on Monday, Mr Aliyev made most of the oil officials believe that a deal would go through but he did not make clear what ultimate terms he was seeking. The companies are pushing for what they call a 'unitised' approach to developing Azerbaijan's three oilfields, something that had already been agreed upon by Mr Elchibey. The companies would take percentages of the deal and develop the three fields together as a consortium. In addition, the companies are discussing the construction of a Dollars 1.4 bn pipeline to carry 800,000 barrels of oil a day to the west. Under the leading plan, the pipeline would travel through Iran and Armenia before reaching Erzurum, Turkey, and connecting with an existing Iraqi pipeline that has been dry since the Gulf war. The companies are British Petroleum, Statoil, Amaco, Pennzoil, Union Oil of California, McDermott International, Ramco Energy and the Turkish Petroleum Company.</p>

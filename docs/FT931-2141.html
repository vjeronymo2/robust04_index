Sante will be acting as the financiers and developers for the project, which is estimated to cost USDollars 100m (Pounds 69m). The Middle East Trading Co, based in the Isle of Man, has already been appointed as financial consultants and Sante is currently negotiating with Bank Saderat, Tehran, Iran, to also appoint them as joint financial consultants for this project. Acer is the design and build project manager and full design consultant for the project. Four European contractors have been invited by Sante and Acer to take part in the project and interviews are currently being held. An Iranian contractor will also be appointed to work in joint venture with the selected European contractor.

Iran intends to convert Qeshm Island, which is about three times the size of Singapore and almost the size of Cyprus, into the commercial and tourist heart of the Gulf. Schemes for the island are already under way including; commercial buildings and housing developments; power generation and supply; and over 250,000 trees planted.</p>

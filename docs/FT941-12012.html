			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Strong international markets, combined with renewed hopes of a cut in interest rates in the UK, boosted derivatives and pushed the March Footsie future above 3,500, writes Joel Kibazo. On the first day of the new equity account the March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,477. But for a brief retreat which saw the contract dip to 3,475 in the first half-hour of trading, there was strong upward momentum for most of the session, with the big US houses making the running. Traders reflected on the overnight strength of the Tokyo market and the US market later in the day, but renewed talk on interest rates was also heard, bringing a large premium to March for most of the day. The advance in the market gave dealers the opportunity to arbitrage positions between the cash and the futures market. Further strength in the afternoon ensured that March broke through the 3,500 mark to finish at 3,502 in after-hours' dealing, around 18 points above its estimated fair value, which has fallen to zero this account. However, volume, at 8,994 lots, was below average. Traded options were active but the final volume of 47,110 was down from Friday's end of the account figure of 54,074 lots. Among the Index options, the FT-SE 100 option traded 11,984 contracts, while the Euro FT-SE 100 option attracted business of 4,854 lots. HSBC was the most active stock option with a total of 3,200 trades. This was followed by Hillsdown at 3,000 contracts. J. Sainsbury, BTR, and British Aerospace were also actively traded.</p>

He pointed out that it is necessary to pay attention to  equal  development of all regions of the Russian Federation, and  primarily, to the creation of a legal basis adequate to economic  reform to enable it to go ahead. Viktorov is against radical  changes and welcomes an evolutional development of society.    According to preliminary reports, Viktorov will be in  charge of economic issues in the upper chamber of the Russian  Parliament. He came out in support of principally new relations  expected to be established between the centre and the subjects  of the federation in the second quarter of 1994 when regions  begin to contribute a definite amount to the federal budget,  spending the remaining funds on their own needs.</p>

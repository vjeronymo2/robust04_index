			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, if the required examination reveals a fine equi-axed grain structure, replacing the spar cap will be required at a cost of approximately $100,000, parts and labor included. If the required examination reveals an unusual grain structure that was not a fine equi-axed structure, inspecting the spar cap for stress corrosion will be required at a cost of approximately $2,750 (50 workhours at $55 per hour). An airplane affected by this AD could have a compliance cost as low as $1,007 if the spar cap was found acceptable during the metallurgical examination, and as high as approximately $100,857 if the operator replaces the spar cap. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on an expected average remaining operating life of 30 years per affected airplane, the annualized compliance cost would be: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If only a metallurgical examination is necessary: $1,007^$150 (cost incurred by manufacturer)=$857&times;0.8145 (capital recovery factor at an interest rate of 7 percent)=$70 annualized cost; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If replacing the spar cap is necessary: approximately $100,857&times;0.8145 (capital recovery factor at an interest rate of 7 percent)=$8,215 annualized cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The required AD's from Dockets No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;38&hyph;AD (for Model 690B), No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;43&hyph;AD (for Model 500S), and 92&hyph;CE&hyph;58&hyph;AD (for both Models 500S and 690B) also affect certain airplanes included in this AD. The compliance costs of these other AD's add to the cost discussed above. However, replacing the spar cap is only required once, so the $100,000 replacement cost, if required, would be a one-time action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily or disproportionally burdened by government regulations.The RFA requires government agencies to determine whether rules would have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and, in cases where they would, conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with the RFA. Small entities are defined as small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated or airports operated by small governmental jurisdictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the 56 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by this AD that have not complied with Twin Commander SB No. 215, dated March 3, 1992, no owner owns more than one. Of these 56 different owners, 50 are businesses, not-for-profit enterprises, or state or local governments; and six are individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA cannot determine the sizes of all the 50 non-individual owner entities nor the relative significance of the costs estimated above. Because of these uncertainties, no cost thresholds for significant economic impact can be reasonably determined. Based on the possibility that this AD could have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, the FAA conducted a regulatory flexibility analysis. A copy of this analysis may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979) because of substantial public interest; and (3) may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The FAA has conducted an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Analysis and has considered alternatives to this action that could minimize the impact on small entities. A copy of this analysis may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . After careful consideration, the FAA has determined that the required action is the best course to achieve the safety objective of returning the airplane to its original certification level of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Adoption of the Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

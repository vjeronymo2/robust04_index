			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: M&amp;G Group seeks clients in the US M&amp;G Group, Britain's largest unit trust company, has reached agreement with Dreyfus Corporation, one of the US's largest mutual fund managers, to offer international equity and fixed interest products to American clients. The move is M&amp;G's first significant effort to seek clients abroad and Dreyfus's first foray into international products for its mutual fund and institutional clients. Competition for UK domestic unit trust clients generally has intensified with increasing numbers of firms offering the product while the number of unitholder accounts is still lower than it was at the end of the industry's peak year of 1987. 'We realised we were particularly sensitive to UK economic conditions,' said Mr David Morgan, managing director of M&amp;G Investment Management. M&amp;G's core mutual fund activities, like those of the rest of the industry, suffered during the recession as investors shunned the product generally in favor of safer building society deposits. M&amp;G began searching for a US partner more than 18 months ago in an effort to diversify its client base overseas. Mr Morgan said the company was hoping to capitalise on the growing interest of US pension funds for international fund management services. Dreyfus Corporation administers more than Pounds 56bn in more than 125 mutual funds around the country, much of it in fixed income products. It is roughly the fourth largest US mutual fund manager. M&amp;G will offer two international mutual funds for Dreyfus's clients, one for retail clients and one aimed at 401K personal pension accounts and co-mingled pension funds.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Poll called to end Bulgaria crisis: Six-week row over cabinet prompts president's action The Bulgarian president, Mr Zhelyu Zhelev, yesterday ended a six-week-long cabinet crisis by dissolving parliament and appointing Ms Reneta Indjova to lead an interim government until early general elections on December 18. Ms Indjova, a tough-minded, 41-year-old economist who helped to draw up the economic programme of the anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), is the first woman premier in this Balkan country's political history. Early elections were made inevitable by the refusal of the two biggest parliamentary groups, the Bulgarian Socialist party (BSP) and the UDF to try to form a government to replace the non-party government of technocrats headed by Mr Lyuben Berov. Mr Berov, who survived a severe heart attack in March and six no-confidence votes over the past 12 months, resigned on September 2 after successfully concluding negotiations for a reduction of Bulgaria's Dollars 9.3bn foreign debt and a strategically important oil pipeline deal with Russia. His government, which was supported by Socialist party votes and a handful of breakaway groups from the UDF, was never forgiven by the UDF which won the October 1991 elections but resigned and was replaced after only a year in office by Mr Berov. This followed a no-confidence vote in Mr Philip Dimitrov, the then UDF prime minister. The UDF saw the government as a front for the BSP with its roots in the communist past and continued to press for early elections. This is in spite of the fact that opinion polls indicate that the BSP is likely to emerge from elections as the largest party, albeit without an absolute majority. The government was also held responsible for the emergence of a new class of businessmen who made quick profits from the illegal, or so-called 'shadow', privatisation of state or municipally owned assets. Breaking the United Nations-imposed embargo on neighbouring Serbia and the Greek blockade of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia also made millionaires out of smugglers and led to widespread bribery of poorly paid officials and policemen, undermining public morale. Sensitive to such complaints, President Zhelev appealed to Ms Indjova to declare war on crime and to clear the administration of people with Mafia-type connections. Critics also blame the slow pace of privatisation for the lack of transparency which has encouraged the enrichment of former communist officials. The outcome of the elections will be closely watched both by potential western and Russian investors who are looking for a government capable of improving the bureaucratic system and creating the institutional and legal framework needed to sustain several planned large infrastructure and industrial projects. The most important is a Dollars 700m oil pipeline, to be financed largely by Russian oil companies and Greek banking and shipping companies. The pipeline will run from Burgas to the northern Greek port of Alexandroupolis, by-passing the congested Bosporus. It will strengthen the hand of Russia which is determined to maintain a stranglehold over future exports of oil and gas from the entire Caspian region by ensuring that future regional pipelines converge on its own Black Sea port of Novorossiysk before transshipment to Burgas and on to the Aegean sea.</p>

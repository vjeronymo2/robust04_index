			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Leasehold act becomes law - At a glance The Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act became law this week. The new law will mean that from November 1, some of the 750,000 owners of long leaseholds on flats in the UK will be able either to club together to buy the freehold of their block (enfranchise) or to extend their leases. Some owners of leasehold houses will also be able to buy their freeholds. Whether or not a block is eligible for enfranchisement will depend on: the number of flats in the block; whether the ground rent is classified as low; the amount of retail or commercial floorspace in the block; whether the landlord also lives in the block; whether at least half the leaseholders wishing to enfranchise occupy their flats as their principal residence, or have done for three of the past 10 years.</p>

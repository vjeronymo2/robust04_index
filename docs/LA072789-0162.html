			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SURF'S UP -- AND SO IS THE TENSION  </P> <P> Walking down the cliff at Ulu Watu, then maneuvering down a shaky bamboo ladder  with broken struts into a sea cave is not my idea of an easy water entry.  </P> <P> A week earlier, I was safe and secure inside my house in Orange County, poring  over past issues of Surfer and Surfing magazines as I prepared for my Bali  trip.  </P> <P> I've been obsessed with surfing since I was 19 when I learned to surf at  Huntington Beach on an old surfboard the size of a pier.  </P> <P> At 41, I found myself easing into foreign waters once again, this time at one  of the world's best surfing spots.  </P> <P> I went to Ulu with Ed Rhead, 34, a former master's competitor from Oceanside,  and Carolyn Krammer, 44, a former women's pro. They were officials of the  visiting U.S. surfing team.  </P> <P> Until now, each of us had only read about this prime spot, about 25 miles from  the hotel district in Kuta Beach. Now we were here. Rhead kept saying, "I don't  believe we're actually doing this." Krammer, who coaches the Vista High School  surf team, managed to remain a lot calmer and recorded most of the hilly  three-kilometer hike on videotape.  </P> <P> At the cave, I asked an Australian surfer, "How do I go out from here?" trying  to mask the concern I had about a large rock in the middle of the passage way.  </P> <P> He said it was easy, and I followed his instructions.  </P> <P> "It'll only be five to seven feet. No need to worry, boss," our guide had told  us. A seven-foot wave measured from the back could mean a 14-foot face, I told  myself.  </P> <P> Scared? Naaaah. My legs already had turned to Jell-O walking down into the  cave.  </P> <P> Once out in the water, I took off on a small, six-foot wave that was almost  twice my height overhead. Ulu is a classic left, meaning surfers who face the  shore travel to their left rather than right.  </P> <P> A set came up. I paddled into one of the first waves, but another surfer who  had position on me got it. As I turned my board around, I saw something I  didn't want to think about. A big, green mountain of water, the third of a  seven-wave set, now loomed in front of me. It jacked up, six feet, then eight,  then 10, and I looked down at my board. If I got scared now, I told myself,  I'll be fish bait.  </P> <P> Rhead had already taken one wave that left him dizzy after he fell off and went  airborne 20 feet before slamming into the water.  </P> <P> It was time. I faced toward shore and paddled mightily. The bottom of the hump  caught me and propelled me up its huge face like an elevator.  </P> <P> Then I stood up and slipped in and time stood still. I hurtled down the face,  adrenaline pumping and my mind racing as the salt spray slapped my face. Near  the bottom I got into a low crouch, knees bent, ready to absorb the G-force  when I turned left. Think of yourself falling down a mine shaft and turning  hard after a 12-foot drop.  </P> <P> I spent the speed I had accumulated coming down the wave onto the "flat," that  area in front of a breaking wave. A mistake at Ulu, I learned. The wave has a  natural tendency to push anything far out into the flat and regular footers  like myself, who surf with their left foot forward and their back to the wave  on a left, must fight the tendency to hit the flat long because you lose speed.  </P> <P> You with me? Caution: If you get behind the wave in the white stuff, the ride's  over. Caution No. 2: If you lose speed trying to come back into an Ulu lip  that's blasting over, you go airborne backward without a parachute.  </P> <P> At the bottom, I looked back into the wave and could see the shoulder, but by  this time I had lost the speed I needed and could only zip halfway up onto the  shoulder before turning to prepare for another ride down the wave face. After  that, another surfer had positioned himself to take off and shoulder-hopped me.  Wave traffic in paradise.  </P> <P> I lowered myself to the board and ended the ride with thundering white water  behind me. My knees were wobbly, but I felt exuberant.  </P> <P> I had survived Ulu.  </P></p>

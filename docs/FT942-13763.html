			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Ireland considers Bosnia role: International News Digest Ireland has moved a step closer to abandoning its traditional policy of military neutrality by announcing that it is prepared to consider sending troops to help UN efforts in eastern Bosnia. Mr Dick Spring, foreign minister, told reporters yesterday that the Irish government was prepared 'to consider any request' from the UN for the sending of troops to Bosnia. Last year Dublin was a leading proponent of 'safe areas' for isolated Moslem pockets in Bosnia. Ireland has no troops at present in the former Yugoslavia, but it has more than 1,000 of its 12,000-strong defence forces serving overseas on UN peacekeeping missions, most of them in southern Lebanon. In a significant departure from traditional policy, a decision was taken last year to send Irish troops in logistical operations under UN command to Somalia on a 'peace-enforcement' - as opposed to a 'peacekeeping'  -mission.</p>

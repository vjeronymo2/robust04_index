			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A relevant government official said on 11 March:  During the course of the nuclear inspection by the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] -- which started on 3  March -- North Korea has so far refused to allow the IAEA  inspection team to take samples from the "hot cell," which is a  facility to extract or process plutonium from the radiochemical  laboratory, one of the key objects of the nuclear inspections.  Therefore, North Korea has been in conflict with the IAEA.    Taking samples from the hot cell is an important means for  the nuclear inspection to check North Korea's plutonium  processing. Also, this is an important clue in determining the  differences between the amount of plutonium extracted as  declared by North Korea and the amount of plutonium North Korea  has really processed.    A relevant government official said that "the ongoing  conflict between North Korea and the IAEA regarding the nuclear  inspection is due to North Korea's refusal to allow the  extraction of the samples from the hot cell," and that "the IAEA  and the United States are very dissatisfied with its refusal."    He said that "despite its agreement with the IAEA in the  course of nuclear negotiations regarding the sample extraction  from the hot cell, necessary for guaranteeing nuclear safety,  North Korea had refused an actual inspection."    Concerning this, a relevant Foreign Ministry official said  that "whether the North Korean refusal to allow the inspectors  to obtain samples from hot cells has threatened the objective of  the inspection is a matter that the IAEA should decide on" and  that "we need to watch the other processes of the inspection  because there are some other means to check the plutonium  extraction without the extraction of samples from the hot cell."</p>

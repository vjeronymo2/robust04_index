			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: AAH improves 12% to Pounds 32.2m AAH HOLDINGS, the diversi-fied distribution group, reported a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 on the back of a strong performance from healthcare services. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 28.7m to Pounds 32.2m. Turnover rose from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 1.3bn. Sales benefited from the group's acquisition of two warehouses from Medicopharma, a significant competitor, which withdrew from the UK market in November. A subsequent inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission delayed integration of the acquired warehouses and recommended the divestment of a third warehouse in Aberdeen. The group is now rationalising the two new warehouses into its network. Healthcare services, which now account for 73 per cent of trading profit, reported increased profits of Pounds 26.7m (Pounds 22.4m). Environmental services also reported increased profits of Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 3.6m) helped by increased tenders for local authority land maintenance and waste management contracts. Three divisions continued to be affected by the recession: builders supplies saw its profits fall from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 2.6m, consumer products fell from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 2m and distribution services were down from Pounds 1m to Pounds 600,000. Mr Bill Pybus, chairman, said he was confident that all three would pick up once the economy improved. Their share of the overall trading profit, which increased to Pounds 36.2m (Pounds 32.9m), is likely to continue to fall. Increased working capital pushed up average borrow-ings to Pounds 39.8m (Pounds 28.3m) against shareholders' funds of Pounds 138.2m. A final dividend of 10.95p lifts the total to 16.35p (14.85p). Earnings per share rose to 31.8p (29.7p). COMMENT The group's mainstream healthcare businesses will be further boosted this year from the withdrawal of Medicopharma, which in the past has been regarded as one of its most significant competitors. With the MMC inquiry out of the way the group has started rationalising its warehouses, which is expected to lead to a reduction in the total number from 27 to 15. First time contributions from retail pharmacies acquired during the year should ensure that the division continues to report increased profits. More than 85 per cent of the profits are now generated by two divisions, healthcare and environ-mental services, in growing markets. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 38.5m put the shares, which yesterday rose 5p to close at 518p, on a prospec-tive multiple of 15. They look fairly priced at a premium to the market.</p>

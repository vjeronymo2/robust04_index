			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Russian ministers differ on energy SHARP differences have emerged among Russian ministers on funding for the energy industries and on privatisation, according to reports of yesterday's cabinet meeting by the Interfax news agency. A draft decree on the oil and gas industries, freeing them from the obligation to sell 50 per cent of their hard currency to the state and from customs tariffs, was struck off the agenda after objections that it was too 'soft' on the oil companies and contradicted earlier decisions to offer credits and benefits to companies only in return for specific programmes. At the same time, the demand from Mr Yuri Shafranik, energy minister, for extra money above the Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.05bn) set aside in 1993 for production equipment was turned over to a subcommittee. Mr Shafranik argues that the oil sector needs at least Dollars 4.5bn a year just to maintain its depressed output levels. A resolution to give all Russian citizens the right to use vouchers to buy shares in companies being privatised prompted objections from several ministers to the privatisation programme. Mr Georgy Khizha, a deputy prime minister, said that 'state structures' should run the privatised companies: while Mr Victor Yefimov, the transport minister, said he could not guarantee the safety levels of privatised transport enterprises.</p>

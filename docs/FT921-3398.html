			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Futures and options activity lifts volume RELIEF in decline was the keynote yesterday, as share prices closed above the 20,221.86 of October 1, 1990, having fallen briefly below that level on selling related to futures and options settlements, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei index closed 105.82 lower at 20,456.06, down 2.6 per cent on the week. The index firmed briefly after the opening, hitting the day's high of 20,590.74, but fell to a low of 20,168.15 in the afternoon. Bargain hunting, and late index-linked buying by investment trusts pushed up the Nikkei from the day's low. Volume swelled from 280m shares to 650m, of which 350m was generated by futures and options settlements. The market has not seen this level of activity since December 13 last year, when December futures contracts were settled. Declines exceeded advances by 648 to 315 with 164 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 8.21 to 1,464.00 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.99 to 1,118.79. A total of 239 issues fell to new lows since the beginning of last year, exceeding the 200 level for the fourth consecutive day. Fears that the Nikkei would fall below the critical 20,000 level prevailed. Traders expected tokkin, or specified money trusts, and fund trusts to step up selling on Monday, the last trading day for the fiscal year. Rumours that the authorities were considering implementing tighter rules on proprietary trading depressed sentiment. Traders said that tension between leading foreign houses and the authorities was rising due to extensive efforts by the authorities to reduce derivatives and proprietary trading. Most leading high-technology issues rose on bargain-hunting. Hitachi, the most active issue of the day, rose Y4 to Y765 and Sony rose Y20 to Y3,960. However, NTT, a benchmark for market sentiment, fell for the 12th consecutive day, by Y8,000 to a new all-time low of Y656,000. Financial issues were lower as companies and fund trusts continued to liquidate holdings. Mitsubishi Bank fell Y30 to Y2,330 and Sumitomo Bank lost Y20 to Y1,730. Bio-technology issues, which have been sought by short-term traders, fell on profit-taking. Nippon Zeon fell Y3 to Y702 and Okamoto lost Y40 to Y1,330. However, Daiichi Pharmaceutical surged Y110 to Y1,770 on reports of its joint development of an Aids cure. In Osaka, the OSE average 173.55 to 21,877.52 in volume of 72.7m shares. Roundup ONCE AGAIN, strength in Hong Kong was the region's main feature. HONG KONG closed at its third straight record high in spite of a strong wave of afternoon profit-taking. The Hang Seng index advanced 28.38 to 5,071.19, 3.3 per cent higher on the week, in turnover up from HKDollars 2.87bn to HKDollars 3.56bn. Once again dealers said that the strong dollar, to which the local currency is tied, has been drawing in foreign money. TAIWAN credited hopes of an agreement on the presidential election process with a recovery through 5,000 on the weighted index which rose 45.77 to 5,030.63, up 0.7 per cent on the week, in light trading. SEOUL saw bargain-hunting in Hyundai subsidiaries reversed on reports that the government had warned the group away from politics. The composite index fell 4.53 to 614.58, down 1.8 per cent on the week, as turnover stayed flat at Won203bn. AUSTRALIA showed little reaction to higher January retail sales. The All Ordinaries index fell 3.0 to 1,588.4, down 1 per cent on the week, in turnover up from ADollars 155m to ADollars 166m. Coles Myer, the country's biggest retailer, rose 4 cents to ADollars 11.06 following a 36-cent drop on Thursday, on flat profits and a surprise capital raising plan. SINGAPORE reported scattered buying interest as the Straits Times Industrial index closed 5.07 higher at 1,466.08, 1.4 per cent higher on the week. KUALA LUMPUR gained on last-minute buying as the composite index put on 2.80 to 595.22, a rise on the week of 0.7 per cent. BOMBAY was volatile as a bullish start to the new account triggered profit-taking. The BSE index fell from the day's high of 3,346.26 to close at 3,259.36, up 17.39.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDIANS PROTEST WATER SALE TO SANTA BARBARA;  </P> <P> DROUGHT: CANADIAN FIRM'S PLAN TO REMOVE WATER NEAR BRITISH COLUMBIA RESERVATION  WILL HARM THE ENVIRONMENT, NATIVES SAY. SANTA BARBARA CITY COUNCIL IS SET TO  VOTE ON THE PROPOSAL.  </P> <P> A Canadian company's proposal to export water by tanker to drought-stricken  Santa Barbara is being challenged by an Indian tribe in British Columbia that  claims the plan could damage the environment near its reservation.  </P> <P> Snowcap Waters Ltd. of British Columbia has proposed selling to Santa Barbara  water taken from a creek about 10 miles from the reservation of the Klahoose  Indian band. The Indians are concerned that their "traditional tribal lands  will be exploited," said Arlene Hope, chief of the band.  </P> <P> The Santa Barbara City Council is expected to vote Tuesday on whether to  approve the tanker water from Canada or desalination to supply the city with  emergency water supplies.  </P> <P> As the drought in California intensifies, an increasing number of Canadian  firms have applied for permits to export water. Seven companies in Western  Canada have received permits and 19 others have applied, government officials  said.  </P> <P> The increased interest in exporting water is creating a controversy in Canada  over whether its rivers and streams should be marketable commodities, said  Geraldine Irby, a board member of the Sierra Club of Western Canada. The Sierra  Club has questioned British Columbia's policy of granting licenses to  water-exporting companies without requiring environmental impact reports.  </P> <P> "You can't simply assume that removing all this water won't damage the  ecosystem," Irby said. "An environmental impact report is the very least that  should be required."  </P> <P> Snowcap has proposed supplying Santa Barbara with up to 15,000 acre-feet of  water each year from Tzela Creek, which feeds into the saltwater Toba Inlet,  about 75 miles northwest of Vancouver. One acre-foot is the equivalent of about  325,000 gallons.  </P> <P> "All we want to do is take some of this freshwater that just empties into the  ocean anyway," said Fred Paley, president of Snowcap. "More than 20 other  creeks and rivers empty into this inlet . . . so I see no need for any  environmental report."  </P> <P> The Toba Inlet is a major salmon spawning area, and any change in the water  flow could damage marine life, said Stan Guenther, a lawyer for the Klahoose  Indians. Taking water from the area could change the inlet's temperature and  its nutrient, oxygen and salt levels, he said. Also, the impact of frequent  tanker traffic in a pristine inlet needs to be assessed, he said .  </P> <P> "Nobody's ever taken great quantities of the water that normally spills into  the inlets," Guenther said. "Since it's unprecedented, nobody knows exactly  what the effects will be."  </P> <P> Guenther has sent letters expressing the Indians' concerns to British Columbian  officials. If water is exported without an environmental impact report, the  band could file a lawsuit, he said.  </P> <P> While environmental impact reports are not required, government officials will  order them "when they consider it necessary," said Jim Mattison, a manager for  the British Columbia Ministry of the Environment. To obtain an export permit,  the company would have to prove the water is "surplus to local requirements"  and meet other criteria, he said.  </P> <P> Snowcap has a permit to use Tzela Creek for bottled water and to export 200  acre-feet a year by tanker. Paley said he was assured by government officials  that the permit would be modified if the Santa Barbara proposal is approved.  </P> <P> A series of glacial lakes north of Vancouver cascade down sheer granite  mountainsides into Tzela Creek. The company is prepared to pump the creek water  into ocean-going tankers and, at Santa Barbara, pump the water through a  pipeline to a city reservoir.  </P> <P> Although no decision has been made, it appears unlikely that the Santa Barbara  City Council will vote to import water from Canada. A local committee appointed  to review proposals for emergency water supplies has recommended desalination  for Santa Barbara. Three Canadian companies had submitted proposals to the  city, and Snowcap made the lowest bid.  </P> <P> No Canadian company has exported water by tanker. Snowcap is having discussions  with other water agencies in Santa Barbara County and will soon make proposals  to several California cities.  </P> <P> "This whole issue of sending water to California will be attracting more and  more public interest," British Columbia's Mattison said. "Some argue that the  water goes into the ocean anyway so why shouldn't we support an industry that  provides jobs. Others say we shouldn't be selling off a natural resource. The  more California needs water, the bigger the issue will be in Canada."  </P></p>

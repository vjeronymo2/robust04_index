			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TWO PRO-CHOICE SOLDIERS WIN GROUP'S SALUTE  </P> <P> Santa Ana Heights resident Pat Cox described herself as a Republican and an  active member of the Presbyterian church.  </P> <P> Barbara Miles said, right off, "I have five children of my own, and my husband  has five children from a previous marriage. We're a big family."  </P> <P> These two might be considered unlikely foot soldiers in the war for women's  reproductive rights. "The stereotypes have gotta go," said Cox, briskly. "This  is about a woman's choice."  </P> <P> Cox and Miles were honored on Saturday by members and friends of the South  Coast Organization of Planned Parenthood -- a fund-raising group they founded  11 years ago.  </P> <P> Attending the benefit -- a Mexican-themed buffet dinner held in a banquet  building in Costa Mesa -- were 110 guests who paid $125 each. The evening  netted about $12,000 for the local chapter of Planned Parenthood, according to  event chairwoman Gloria Longley.  </P> <P> During cocktail hour, mariachis serenaded, margaritas flowed and waiters  bearing silver trays stacked with crispy goodies (chicken flautas, nachos,  empanadas) threaded through the casually attired crowd.  </P> <P> Among guests was Margie Fites Seigle, executive director of the local chapter  of Planned Parenthood. Seigle said that although the pro-choice movement had  suffered setbacks lately -- including an unfavorable Supreme Court decision and  the governor's recent budget cuts for family planning services -- she was  encouraged by the reaction of the community.  </P> <P> "The public support that has come out has been overwhelming," she said. "We've  gotten hundreds of calls: 'What can I do?' 'How can I help?' 'Can I stuff  envelopes for you?' 'Where do I send the check?' It's been phenomenal."  </P> <P> The same reaction was noted by Phyllis Wallace, president of the 106-member  fund-raising group founded by Cox and Miles. "We've had a lot of activity  lately," she said. "I think that many people feel that Roe vs. Wade (the 1973  Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion) is something they don't want to see  reversed."  </P> <P> Miles stressed the "many positive things about Planned Parenthood," such as its  fertility clinic, pregnancy counseling and prenatal care programs.  </P> <P> "And choice is positive," she added. "Sometimes, when people find out about my  big family, they say, 'Barbara! How can you -- of all people -- be involved  with Planned Parenthood?'  </P> <P> "And I say: 'Listen. I had five children because I love children. And I support  Planned Parenthood because I love children. Anyone who thinks this organization  is anti-child is wrong, wrong, wrong."  </P> <P> Fund raising for AIDS: The hills were alive with the sound of music. And  laughter. And a couple of dozen belly-flopped splashes!  </P> <P> By the time the sun blazed its last on Sunday, the back-yard party at Al  Roberts' and Ken Jillson's Laguna Beach digs had netted more than $120,000 for  the AIDS Services Foundation of Orange County.  </P> <P> Roberts' and Jillson's fourth annual "Big Splash" bash -- an afternoon  get-together highlighted by a stage show of Jillson's creation -- drew 400  guests at ticket prices ranging from $50 for general admission to $10,000 for  dinner and eight pool-side seats for the show.  </P> <P> This year's entertainment was a musical tribute to Hollywood, performed by a  cast of 35 amateurs who made up for their lack of talent or rehearsal time with  the sheer joy of their vamped-up abandon.  </P> <P> There were Mae West, with three-inch eyelashes, and Annette Funicello,  shimmying at her own Muscle Beach party. Carmen Miranda, Faye Wray, Esther  Williams and the Andrews Sisters were among the others making waves (some  literally, splashing the top-ticket donors) before the 50-minute spectacle was  through and guests made for the buffet tables.  </P> <P> "This is an incredible day because the community can be together in one place  and because everyone knows that all the money they spent (for tickets) is  actually going to help others," said Joel Miller, executive director of the  AIDS Services Foundation.  </P> <P> Miller said proceeds from the event -- which was completely underwritten by  Roberts and Jillson -- will be used for direct-assistance cash grants to cover  outstanding bills for AIDS patients in financial crisis, to fund ASF's food  bank and to cover costs at the two residences for AIDS patients run by the  foundation.  </P></p>

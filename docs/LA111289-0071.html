			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'IS PRIVATE JUSTICE FAIR?'  </P> <P> Your editorial recognizes a long-term problem in civil litigation, but seems to  attack one of the solutions instead of the problem itself.  </P> <P> In using the "rent-a-judge" method of settling civil disputes, the prudent (not  necessarily wealthy) litigant avoids possible heavy financial losses or  lingering family alienation that could result in lengthy waits for court dates.  The result of the method? Reducing the court load!  </P> <P> Robert Raven and Alan Rothenberg complain that this method of "private justice"  could reduce the will of our politicians to solve the civil court log jam. If  that's truly their concern, maybe they should spend their time and efforts  lobbying to see that doesn't happen.  </P> <P> I suspect Raven and Rothenberg, being presidents of the American and State Bar  Assns., respectively, have a more mundane motive. They would like to protect  the financial interests of their members who are seeing long-term cases  disappear along with the fees.  </P> <P> The Times' warning of a two-class court system comes too late. We presently  have such a system in the criminal court system where those who can afford them  have powerful, big-name attorneys, and the poor are relegated to using  well-meaning but overworked public defenders.  </P> <P> Another solution to help alleviate the overwhelmed civil system would be to  raise the limits of small claims courts even more to $5,000 or even $10,000 and  use more commissioners and experienced lawyers in that court.  </P> <P> But please, don't fault the prudent or wealthy for finding their own solution  to the problem, fix the problem!  </P> <P> T.C.

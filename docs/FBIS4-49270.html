			<p>BFN     [Text] Canberra, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Stephen Martin, speaker  of the House of Representatives of Australia, said this evening  that the mutual visits between parliamentarians of Australia and  China are conducive to the increase of understanding.    This would also contribute to the further development of  relations between the two countries, Martin said.    Martin made the remarks at a dinner entertained in honor of  visiting vice-chairman Tian Jiyun of the Chinese National  People's Congress (NPC), who is now leading a NPC delegation on  a week-long visit to the South Pacific nation.    The speaker stressed that both Australia and China as well  parliaments of the two countries have enjoyed close and friendly  relationship.    Tian said that although China and Australia have different  social system, ideology, view of value and development stage of  economy, the two countries have shared common interests in many  areas.    The two countries, situated in the Asia-Pacific region, have  common interests in safeguarding peace and stability in the  region, developing economy of their own nation, booming economy  in the region and improving the living standard of their own  people, Tian stressed.    He said that "the rapid economic development in China will  certainly create new opportunities for our bilateral economic  and trade cooperation."    The two-way trade between China and Australia reached three  billion U.S. dollars in 1993, representing an increase of 28  percent compared with the previous year, and is expected to  increase this year.    He also disclosed that in the coming seven years, China is  going to import commodities worth of 1,000 billion U.S. dollars.    Tian said that the economies of the two countries have  strong  compliments and the potential is great for furthering the  bilateral cooperation.    He hoped that the trade volume between the two countries  would have considerable share in the total sum of 1,000 billion  U.S. dollars.    Tian and the delegation he led arrived in Canberra this  afternoon. On his way from Sydney to Canberra, Tian had a  stop-over in Wollongong, south of Sydney, where he visited the  Port Kembla grain terminal.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italy Must Push a Bit More, </F> Christophersen Says"]    [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, May 25 -- Price and exchange rate  stability, achieved by reducing the inflation rate by no more  than 2-3 percent by 1996, were among the primary objectives  indicated by the European Commission to member states, including  Italy, in a program document outlined here today by Commissioner  Henning Christophersen.    While several countries have already reached the inflation  rates indicated by the Commission, Italy, Spain, Portugal and  Britain must do more to bring down inflation in their countries,  he said. However, Christophersen added that he expected both  Italy and Britain to be able to get their inflation rates  significantly closer to the limits indicated by the Commission  by next year.    The commissioner saw more rigid fiscal policies as the way  to  achieve that consolidation of national budgets called for in  convergence programs. Here again Italy must make an additional  effort to re-structure its tax system, finding alternative ways  to bring in revenue -- such as the eco-tax, for example, so as  to promote employment and not overburden the labor force, he  said.    Christophersen said it was "unacceptable" that unemployment  levels remained high even in the presence of economic recovery  like that observed in numerous European nations.    Given the recovery, he said it was "illogical" that  long-term  interest rates continue rising and he insisted that it was  necessary to combat this tendency through structural adjustments  and interventions on the job market so as to the raise the  growth rate from the present 1.6 percent to 2.5 percent in 1995.    Christophersen would not be drawn on the question of when  Italy might return to the European Monetary System but defined  as "ambitious" the Italian government's project to create one  million jobs. Although he admitted he did not know how the  Berlusconi government planned to achieve this goal,  Christophersen said that ambitious governments were a good thing  to have.</p>

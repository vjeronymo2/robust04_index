			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Glazing chief blames recession for failure THE CO-FOUNDER of the failed Surestyle double-glazing business has blamed paralysis of consumer spending caused by the general election for this week's failure of Surestyle which left nearly Pounds 3m debts. Mr Mark Sweeney and his brother Michael paid Pounds 3m for the business assets of Stormseal a month after it failed in January last year. They restarted as Surestyle, but the business was undercapitalised with no cash reserves and the Sweeneys say they discovered an unexpected Pounds 500,000 of current liabilities only after the deal had been done and they had fuller access to the books. Mr Mark Sweeney said orders almost dried up at the end of February as the election approached. When polls suggested a Labour victory, uncertainty deepened in an already depressed marketplace and people put off plans to buy big items. 'Things were not brilliant before, but we were at least surviving in January and February, in spite of the recession,' Mr Sweeney said. 'It was a struggle: the directors have put in a total of Pounds 300,000 of their own this year and I have not drawn any salary since January; but we would have got through if trade had not been stopped dead by the election.' Mr Sweeney said the Conservative victory did not bring quick enough relief because the dislocation of cashflow had already inflicted a mortal financial wound. He predicted that other companies hit similarly by national sales paralysis in March would fail during the summer if they did not have pre-March cash reserves to tide them over. About 300 people lost their jobs with the collapse of Surestyle. 'It has taken until the last few weeks to work its way through. We knew it was coming and devised a financial reconstruction,' he said. 'We had found Pounds 150,000 of new equity investment from outside, private sources, but we needed our bankers to match that to give us enough working capital and they decided not to.' This left Surestyle on the brink of insolvency without enough time to negotiate a deal with anyone else. 'We could only have gone on if we had been willing to trade illegally, so there was no choice but to call in the receivers.' Surestyle's bankers, Svenska Handelsbank, had also backed Stormseal, which failed with about Pounds 20m of debts. Grant Thornton, Stormseal's receiver, disclosed this week that virtually all monies recovered from the liquidation of Stormseal have gone to Svenska, which held debentures. Trade creditors received nothing. Mr Sweeney estimates that the direct-sales sector in Britain has been halved in terms of spending by the downturn. Not only have there been fewer customers, but the average sale in double-glazing business has dropped from a consistent Pounds 2,000 during the 1980s to around Pounds 1,400 or Pounds 1,500. He does not believe people were swayed much by bad publicity about some of the high-pressure sales techniques used by some of Surestyle's agents, who were paid on commission. One pair had to be evicted by police after refusing to leave a potential customer's house without an order. They were sacked. He denied newspaper allegations that he and his brother lived extravagantly while their companies failed. Personal assets were usually being used in some way or another to support entrepreneurship and there was nothing particularly exceptional about his lifestyle. 'But there always seem to be some people who think you're only honest if you live in a cave,' Mr Sweeny added. A mechanical engineer who did a Harvard Business School course in the mid-1980s, Mr Sweeney says he will be back.</p>

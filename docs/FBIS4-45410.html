			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>   [Text] Alma Ata [Almaty] June 9 TASS -- A large-scale  operation to spot and destroy illegally planted crops of  narcotic plants was launched in Kazakhstan. The operation, to  last till November 30, involves thousands of staffers of the  interior minister in virtually all regions of the country.    Special attention is given to putting a stop to the delivery  of the narcotics from the Chuya Valley. According to the  information published in the latest issue of the Kazakhstan  weekly PANORAMA with a reference to an official of the  Kazakhstan Interior Ministry, about 5,000 tonnes of marijuana is  manufactured every year out of hemp grown in the Chuya valley.  These narcotics then spread all over the world via Russia and  Kazakhstan's southern borders. In addition, Kazakhstan was  being turned of late into a link for narcotics traffic via China  from the so-called golden triangle to Europe.    Kazakhstan law enforcement bodies expect the hunting of  narcotics producers and narcotics dealers to be effective. Some  850 illegally planted plots of narcotic crops have been found  and destroyed during such operations last year. Over 27 tonnes  of marijuana and 16.5 tonnes of poppy straw were prevented from  entering trafficking. Also some 12 tonnes of narcotics were  apprehended. Their total value at black market prices of the  Kazakh capital make up about 6.3 million U.S. dollars.</p>

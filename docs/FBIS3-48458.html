President of the institute Angel Castro Labarello noted in  his report that last year the Korean people under the wise  guidance of the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song and the  dear leader Marshal Kim Chong-il smashed the provocations of the  imperialists, defended the sovereignty of the country and the  dignity of the nation and demonstrated to the world the  superiority of man-centred socialism, the validity of the  revolutionary line of independence and the might of the  single-hearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses.    This year the institute will expand its ranks and strengthen  diverse political and cultural activities and relations with  political parties and public organisations, he declared.    In his report, secretary of the Peruvian Committee for  Support to the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea  Felix N. Fernandez Torres vowed to conduct brisk solidarity  activities this year, denouncing the acts of aggression and  division on the part of the United States and the South Korean  authorities and supporting the reunification of Korea on the  three principles of national reunification and in the form of a  confederation.    Action programmes of the institute and the committee for  this  year were adopted at the meeting.</p>

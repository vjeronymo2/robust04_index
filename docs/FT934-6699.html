			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Riva fails to meet Ekostahl deadline Riva, the Italian steel group which is bidding to buy Ekostahl, eastern Germany's largest steel mill, yesterday failed to meet a deadline set by the Treuhand privatisation agency to clarify how it would modernise the plant. Treuhand officials said they were 'disappointed' because the agency, despite opposition from the Germany's Steel Federation, is anxious to speed up the sale of the mill so as to secure jobs, investment, and markets for the region. Riva, the Milan-based privately-owned company, obtained sole negotiating rights earlier this month from the Treuhand to buy Ekostahl, and had until yesterday to spell out its efficiency and production plans. The Italian company confirmed it had not responded to the Treuhand's request for more details, but declined to explain why it had missed the deadline. Riva is expected to buy 60 per cent of Ekostahl, while the Treuhand will hold the remaining 40 per cent stake. Together they will invest DM1.2bn (Pounds 470m) in building a hot rolling mill, the equivalent of a mini mill with an annual capacity of about 900,000 tones. Treuhand officials said it was unclear if the delay by Riva was caused by last week's opposition by Britain, France and the Netherlands to proposals put forward by the European Commission to restructure western Europe's steel sector. British officials yesterday confirmed that Mr Johannes Ludewig, a senior economics advisor in the Chancellor's office, last Friday called in Sir Nigel Broomfield, Britain's ambassador to Germany to discuss the UK's opposition to the Commission's plans. A British official said that opposition from Mr Tim Sainsbury, the UK industry minister, was not directed specifically at Ekostahl but at the steel industry in general.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirjana Kusmuk] </F>   [Text] After his meeting with Russian special envoy  Vitaliy Churkin, at which they discussed the situation in  Gorazde following NATO's air intervention, Radovan Karadzic,  president of the Srpska republic, visited Serbian fighters on  the Gorazde front. At the headquarters of the Serbian army in  Rogatica, general Ratko Mladic, commander of the general staff  of the army of Srpska republic, submitted a report to Karadzic  on the military situation on the ground.    The president of the Srpska republic then visited the  positions of the Serbian army and the command of the Gorazde  brigade. In conversations with the soldiers, Karadzic stressed  that the United Nations and General Rose bear the sole  responsibility for the bombing of the Serbian civilian targets  around Gorazde, and that they have taken sides with one side in  the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    We are constantly being threatened with bombing. They have  now played this card. The only thing left for them to do is to  send ground forces. You here are more superior. You are not  the bare- footed Somalians, but are currently the best army in  Europe, Karadzic said.    General Mladic expressed the view that there will be more  air  strikes. He said that the army's morale is exceptional and that  the general command of the Srpska republic has issued the order  to all soldiers to shoot down whatever flies toward them.    UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] has been providing logistics  support and giving advice to the Muslims and Croats for two  years. They have now removed their mask and placed themselves on  their side. Our only strategy is to defend our hearths, the  weak, and our territory, General Mladic said. The president and  the general also played a chess game on the first line of the  front.    The Rogatica part of the Gorazde front is quiet today. Owing  to poor weather, the Muslim soldiers have reduced their attacks.  NATO aircraft are also affected by fog and rain and are today  flying unusually high.</p>

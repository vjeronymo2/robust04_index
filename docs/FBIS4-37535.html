			<p>BFN     [Text] According to press reports, there was a meeting in  the British capital three days ago between David Late [name as  transliterated], an official in the U.S. Department of State,  and officials from the London headquarters of Unified Iraqi  National Congress [UINC] during which Late asked the UINC  officials to close the London headquarters and move it to  northern Iraq.    On this issue, Hani al-Fakiki, a prominent official in the  UINC who did not attend the meeting because he was out of  London, has made a statement to AL-SAFIR in which he expressed  surprise at this U.S. demand, if the press reports are accurate.  He said that the opening or closure of the UINC headquarters is  an internal affair which only the organizations, parties, and  political forces that are members of the UINC can decide upon.    Al-Fakiki said there is nothing new in the reported  assertions by the U.S. official that the Baghdad regime should  implement the UN resolutions, including Resolution 688, "because  we and the Iraqi people have heard of this for two years ago and  there is nothing new either in Late's statements or in his  administration's stand."    Al-Fakiki added: "Events have confirmed that the U.S.  administration and its Arab and non-Arab allies are only  interested in the implementation of the UN resolutions that deal  with the destruction of Iraq's military, economic, and political  resources, but have no interest in human rights and freedoms nor  any serious interest in implementing Resolution 688 or in  putting an end to the Iraqi people's sufferings in the north,  center, and south." He said: "Our people are tired and have  run out of patience with the sweet words, promises, and slogans  because they see what is in fact happening, their silence over  the crimes, and the normalization of ties, all of which mean an  Arab and regional siege of the Iraqi opposition."    The Iraqi opposition figure stressed that "the U.S.  administration and its Arab and non-Arab allies have complete  knowledge, documented by photographs and films, of the massacres  committed by the regime against Iraq's Arabs in the south and  the marshlands. A few weeks ago British MP Emma Nicholson  screened in the parliament some documentaries filmed by the  coalition forces' aircraft showing the burning of villages, the  drainage of the marshlands in the areas of al-Bashrah and  al-'Amarah, the diversion of river courses, the expulsion of  Arab tribes from their camps, the effects of all this on the  environment, the destruction of livestock, and the displacement  of hundreds of thousands of southern Arab tribesmen, who have  been pushed toward the Iranian-Iraqi borders."    He added: "The U.S. administration also has no lack of  information about the regime's violations of human rights and  its crushing of the Iraqi people's national determination to  coexist in a unified state. By this, I mean the use of poison  gas in the north and south. The regime is making daily  announcements on its official radio and in the government press  of executions, amputations of arms and legs, and unfair  sentences in Mosul, Baghdad, and al-Basrah."    Al-Fakiki went on to say: "The Kurds' sufferings and the  siege imposed on them, as well as the attacks on UN officials  and members of the international relief organizations, are not  unknown to the U.S. administration."    He warned the Iraqi opposition forces that "despite the  importance of dealing with international and regional factors  and exploiting them to serve the Iraqi people, this should not  give us political illusions. The West's oil interests and its  priorities of reaching a peaceful settlement, guaranteeing  Israel's security, and drawing up a map of a new Middle East,  plus the calculations of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, are not  necessarily compatible with human rights and freedoms in Iraq or  with the notion of bringing down tyranny and its backers."    Concluding his statement, al-Fakiki said: "Bringing down  repression and establishing a democratic alternative is a  national task; to achieve it we must be self-reliant. It is a  major historic task of great difficulty that goes beyond the  toppling of this or that regime, especially in an oil-producing  country such as Iraq, given its position and neighbors."</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (10): Imperial and tranquil - William Dawkins offers suggestions to tourists The chances are that most foreign tourists in Kansai will be business travellers, and will therefore need to be selective. The yen's inexorable rise makes a Japanese holiday prohibitively expensive for most foreign travellers, and for an increasing number of Japanese tourists too. For business tourists, inevitably short of time, the secret of getting the most out of Kansai is not to try to see too much at once. The most popular tourist spot in the region - and in the whole of provincial Japan, for that matter - is of course the former imperial capital, Kyoto, blessed with more than 1,000 Buddhist temples and 400 Shinto shrines. It received just over 38m visitors last year - 25 times its own population - of which less than 1.5 per cent were foreigners, mainly from North America, South Korea and Taiwan, according to the city's tourist office. The recession has ensured that numbers overall are down by about 15 per cent this year, despite the multiple series of festivals, concerts and exhibitions laid on for Kyoto's 1,200th anniversary. Mr Teiichi Aramaki, governor of Kyoto prefecture, is using the anniversary as an excuse to lean on central government for cash and planning permission to modernise the city's infrastructure. 'We were lucky not to have been bombed in the war, but this means we have to revitalise earlier than many other cities. Kyoto today is trying to regain its vitality,' he says. Not that Kyoto lacks vitality in its present condition. Crowds can be expected at most of the main sites, in and out of season. For most visitors, the first port of call is the the Kiyomizu Temple, propped on massive wooden pillars on a hillside, commanding a splendid view of the city. The next essential is the golden pavilion, a modern replica of the five-century old original, burned down in 1950. Nearby is Ryoanji temple, with its Zen Buddhist rock-and-gravel garden, which most foreigners and not a few Japanese find an aesthetic puzzle. If you have any energy left, visit Nijo castle, former residence of the all-powerful Tokugawa Shoguns, who held Japan under despotic rule for two and a half centuries, while puppet emperors lived in splendid confinement just down the road. The Shoguns, never sure from where the next traitor would spring, installed at Nijo what must be one of the world's earliest burglar alarms, floorboards designed to betray intruders by squeaking at every step. The real pleasure in visiting Kyoto, however, is being able to find your way off the beaten track. It would be a waste of an opportunity to stay in one of the many bland western-style hotels in the city centre, one of which recently annoyed the local monks by flouting a little-observed planning regulation against new buildings more than 40 metres tall. For visitors who want a flavour of traditional Japan, I recommend one of the old-style tatami room inns in the Higashimaya hills on the outskirts of Kyoto. The best of them have an atmosphere of courtly tranquillity. This is true of Yachiyo*, where I stayed, and which also happens to be three minutes' walk from the delightful Nanzenji temple. If you are lucky enough to have a second day's sightseeing, I suggest a visit to Nara, a short train ride from Kyoto. This was Japan's first imperial capital, before the emperor switched to Kyoto 1,200 years ago after a row with Nara's Buddhist monks. Parkland, stocked with hundreds of tame red deer, occupies about half of central Nara. Most of the main sites are situated in pleasant shady glades, from which traffic is banned. Some people - I am one of them - prefer green uncrowded Nara to Kyoto's urban bustle. It was here that Buddhism first flourished in Japan after being imported from China, from the sixth century. Fortunately Buddhism's most splendid early Japanese traces are still intact, and they are all here. The grandest of these is the eighth century Great Image of Buddha, said to be one of the largest bronze sculptures in the world. It is housed in the Todaiji Temple, claimed to be the world's largest wooden building, even after being burned down and rebuilt, at two-thirds of its original size, in the late 17th century. Most of Japan's ancient buildings are made of wood, so the fate of Todaiji temple, and Kyoto's golden pavilion is all too common. Turn left out of Todaiji's main entrance, and wander up stone steps into the wooded hills, which conceal a whole complex of lesser-known temples, repositories for some of Japan's finest religious art. I recommend two for special attention. The Nigatsu-do Hall, reached by a covered stairway, offers a magnificent view of Todaiji's monumental roof. Next to it is the Sangatsu-do Hall, which contains a remarkable collection of early Chinese sculptures of Buddhist deities. They are poorly lit, so take time to let your eyes get used to the gloom. For accommodation, I can suggest Nara Hotel*, a half-timbered 19th century-style edifice, habitually used by members of the Japanese imperial family when they revisit their ancestral roots. It is a short walk from there to the temples. Yachiyo Inn, Kyoto (tel 075 771 4148); Nara Hotel, Nara (tel 0742 26 3300).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "We Have a Word" column: "Foreign Investments"] </F>   [Text] I believe that the real value of Encouragement of  Investment Law No. 10 of 1991 lies in the fact that it is a  major turning point and a qualitative leap on the course of  development, and that it has opened the door wide for economic  activity by removing all the obstacles that have piled up with  time and deprived private enterprise of its creative role in the  service of the homeland.    Law No. 10 is a real pillar and solid foundation on which we  can build the economy -- hence its importance. This is how we  should understand and comprehend the reasons and motives which  underline the role and task of this law in drawing the features  of future economic development.    It is our right now, three years after the issuance of that  law, to reaffirm the very important role of this law and the  achievements it has made, especially the extremely important  role of attracting the investment of local and Arab capital in  projects which will help achieve the aims of development.    We have spoken a great deal in the past about the investment  climate in Syria. We said that it has many advantages, making  it an ideal climate. We also explained that due to this law and  this climate, scores of companies have set up businesses in  Syria under the provisions of this law and benefited from its  advantages. Now, however, we can also say with full confidence  that we are on the threshold of a new phase which will witness  an even greater flow of Arab and foreign investments.    We already have some important indicators. More and more  applications are being submitted by Arab and foreign investors  who want to set up major projects with the effective  participation of Syrian businessmen. This steady increase in  the number of applications and Arab and Foreign investors does  not only reflect the new suitable investment terms and climate,  but also the serious desire to expand the base of Arab and  foreign investment.    These excellent conditions have not come out of vacuum. All  indicators show that the Syrian economy, which is based on  economic diversification and has given an active role to private  enterprise, is now a strong and healthy economy. It has managed  to achieve self-sufficiency in most production fields. It has  increased production, especially agricultural production,  manifold, provided the necessary services, broadened the base of  production, and increased exports. All that was done in record  time.    The average growth, which ranged from 8 to 9 percent in  recent years; the stability of the Syrian pound against foreign  currencies; the drop in the rate of inflation which did not  exceed 8.5 percent last year are clearly significant indicators  of the high standard of Syrian economic performance.    All indicators show that the Syrian economy will continue to  be strong and healthy in the future. They also show that Arab  and foreign investments will continue to flow, now that it has  been decided to attach a special importance to this issue and to  give it every care and attention.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Chugai posts 16% advance to Y17bn Chugai, one of Japan's fastest growing drugs groups, yesterday said its pre-tax profits had increased 16 per cent to Y17bn (Dollars 157.4m) for the year to December 31. The improvement, in spite of slack growth of the Japanese domestic market, was achieved on sales up 5 per cent to Y151bn. The group expects to report full details in February. The profits growth was achieved through improved product mix, and in particular through increased sales of high-margin prescription products, said Chugai. The company predicted it would increase its dividend for the year by Y1 to Y10 per share. Pre-tax profits would increase 6 per cent to Y18bn during 1994 on sales up 6 per cent to Y160bn, it said. Although costs had risen, sales had increased faster, Chugai said. CS First Boston in Tokyo said this was part of a wider trend of margin improvement in the Japanese drugs sector. The introduction last year of rules limiting excessive promotion to doctors had reduced marketing costs, according to the broker. It predicted the leading 24 drugs groups would increase operating profits by 9.7 per cent a year over the next four years. The drugs group said two products had done particularly well last year. Epogin, a treatment for anaemia licensed from Genetics Institute of the US, and Neutrogin, a drug used to increase levels of white blood cells in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Mr John Wilson, pharmaceuticals analyst at James Capel in Tokyo, estimated Epogin generated sales last year of Y28.4bn, while sales of Neutrogin were about Y17.7bn. The group said sales of over-the-counter non-prescription products had fallen. According to analysts, sales of Gronsan, the tonic drink for fatigue, were likely to have fallen, while those of Alfarol, a vitamin product, had probably been flat.</p>

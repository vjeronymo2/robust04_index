			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has stated to the Yemeni News  Agency, SABA', that a number of news agencies and newspapers  have carried inaccurate reports on the proceedings of the  meetings that took place in the Omani city of Salalah between  brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential  Council chairman, and brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman  of the Presidential Council, in the presence of His Majesty  Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id of Oman, and the subsequent bilateral  meeting between the brother chairman of the Presidential Council  and his deputy. The source regretted the unjustified confusion  and anxiety that those incorrect reports have caused among the  public. The source indicated that although those meetings did  not emerge with the results that all Yemenis had looked forward  to, they did help stress the need to abide by the pledge and  accord document and to swiftly implement the decisions that the  Council of Ministers made during its meetings in the economic  and trade capital [Aden], especially regarding security and  military issues.</p>

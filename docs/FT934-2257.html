			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / World Trade News: US opts to bide time on audio-visual battle Mr Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association of America, nursed his disappointment with fortitude in Geneva yesterday over exclusion of the audio-visual sector from the Uruguay Round package, despite three days without sleep, and a day without food. 'The real losers are the people of Europe,' he said: 'They will have much less choice.' But in Paris there was little sign that locals appreciated their loss. France's ministers of culture and communication, echoed by the country's film industry, claimed they had won a famous victory in keeping audio-visual broadcasting out of the Gatt agreement with the US. 'We got what we wanted from the start, which is basically the cultural exception,' said Mr Alain Carignon, the communications minister. Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, will today put the EU's draft Gatt accord with the US before the French parliament, confident of winning approval. Mr Valenti was emphatic that the row of recent weeks had been much less about preservation of European culture than France and other EU protagonists claim: 'If you equate Europe's game shows and talk shows with Moliere and Racine, then that's about culture. But the culture issue is a transparent cloak, and I want to disrobe Europe on this.' He argues that the US has captured a rising share of film showings in Europe  -now estimated at 80 per cent - because of the poverty of offerings from European film-makers. He noted that the rise in the US share of the French film market was due not to rising US showings, but to falling audiences for French films. Between 1983 and 1992, audiences for French films in French theatres fell from 90m a year, to 48m a year, he said. US showings declined slightly, from 70m to 68m. For many Uruguay Round negotiators, the row over access to Europe's film and television markets has been a bemusing irrelevance, an essentially bilateral affair. As the dispute has dragged closer to today's Uruguay Round deadline, it has become a matter of increasing frustration and annoyance. Negotiators yesterday could not celebrate the outcome, but were at least happy with the fact that it was at last out of the way - with a bare 40 hours to go before the talks deadline. US negotiators have insisted that they have been immensely flexible in the audio-visual dispute, steadily relaxing demands as the past three months of talks dragged on. At 3am yesterday, the bottom-line US proposal included four components: The EU would be free to continue reserving 51 per cent of local television programming to European productions, but the US wanted this to apply to the 24-hour day as a whole. At present, for example, France bars non-European programmes from all prime time. For satellite, cable and other 'signals' of the future, where there may soon be as many as 300 signals, the US was willing for the EU to reserve 50-70 per cent of all channels, but was opposed to EU demands that each and every channel must carry 51 per cent European content. Among existing channels, this could bar the Comedy Channel, Nickelodeon, the Disney channel and the Discovery Channel, and create problems for Sky One and Sky Movies Plus. US artists and producers should be entitled to 'their fair share' of the levies raised on blank audio and video tapes, but would commit to invest the funds raised in Europe's film and television industries. Pay-per-view and video-on-demand channels should not be restricted, since consumers make a free choice to watch one film rather than another. What the EU finally offered in the early hours of yesterday was a standstill on existing legislation, providing a binding EU commitment that no more than 51 per cent of programming would be reserved; and a commitment to begin open-ended talks on how the audio-visual sector should be handled multilaterally. Left with the choice of rejecting the EU proposal, or accepting a deal which 'would have enshrined the principle of limiting viewers' rights to see what they wish ..and recognised a system which denies artists and producers the right to funds legally earned through royalties,' Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, opted to reject the deal. 'We have decided not to accept a meaningless fig-leaf,' he said. 'We can best advance the interests of our artists, performers and producers  - and the free flow of information around the world - by reserving all our legal rights to respond to policies that discriminate in these areas.' Mr Valenti last night was less focused on whether retaliation was possible. 'I'm flying home to get a good night's rest, and then we will try to sort out what the future holds,' he said.

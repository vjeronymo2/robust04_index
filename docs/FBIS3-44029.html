Residents huddled in  their homes and listened to sporadic gunfire, which started on  the outskirts of the city at 6AM.    In repeated broadcasts, the state-controlled Radio Lesotho  warned residents of several villages near army barracks at  Makoyane and Ratjomodise to stay indoors to avoid stray bullets.  One Radio Lesotho announcer told people to pray for peace.    Radio Lesotho also invited leaders of all political parties  to meet a high-powered organisation of African Unity Delegation  at the offices of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle in Maseru at noon  on Sunday. The OAU mission arrived in Maseru on Saturday as part  of an international mediatory attempt to defuse the situation.    The unrest began when a section of the army demanded a 100  per cent salary increase with a deadline on Monday. Many of  these dissatisfied men support the Basuto National Party which  lost last year's elections to the Basutholand Congress Party.    Political observers believe the salary increase demand was a  smokescreen and that the real cause of the army confrontation  was politically motivated.    Meanwhile, an international soccer match between Lesotho and  Reunion in the Africa series due to kick off at 3PM on Sunday  has been cancelled until further notice because of the unrest.</p>

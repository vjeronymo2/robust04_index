			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Shamir rejects formula to resolve Likud split MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, said last night the resignation announced by Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, was 'unnatural and unjustified'. But he offered no concession to bridge the cavernous split which has opened in the ruling Likud party three months before the June 23 general election. 'We are the owners of the same party. The same spirit guides us. There are no differences between us,' Mr Shamir insisted, adding: 'There is nothing to extort out of me.' Mr Levy, smarting over what he regards as the malicious subjugation within the Likud of himself and his supporters by Mr Shamir and his allies, declared on Sunday night that he would resign from the government. He larded a vituperative attack on Mr Shamir with assaults on the way some ministers, as he put it, have 'declared war' on the US. This was in line with his position as the Likud minister most supportive of the US-brokered Middle East peace process. But Mr Levy's main concern was clearly to recoup his recently damaged domestic political position. He was careful not to slam the door on either the government or the Likud party. Under government rules, he would not hand his resignation in until Sunday's cabinet meeting, leaving a week open for negotiations over his demand that his camp be granted one-third of all party appointments as the price for his retreat. Mr Shamir is anxious to avoid prolonging a dispute within the party that has already weakened its position in the neck-and-neck election battle with the opposition Labour party. If Mr Levy were to go so far as to leave the Likud and set up his own party, as many of his supporters are urging, it could tip the balance against the Likud in the finely balanced Knesset elections. Equally, Mr Shamir is under pressure from some in the Likud who feel it would be better in the long run to cut out what has become a festering wound in the party by forcing Mr Levy to set up on his own. Mr Shamir's inclination is to find a way to keep Mr Levy in the fold, but finding a formula may be difficult. He said yesterday Mr Levy's demand for a quota of party posts for his supporters was out of the question. He reiterated an assurance to make Mr Levy foreign minister and deputy premier if Likud wins the election. But he added: 'I don't want to hear about percentages . . . there is nothing to talk about.' The issue is made doubly sensitive for Mr Shamir because of the strong ethnic undertone underlying the row. Mr Levy is the champion of the Sephardi, or oriental Jews who came to Israel from North Africa and the Middle East. They resent what they see as the disciminatory attitude of the traditional Ashkenazi, or European establishment, to which Mr Shamir belongs. The danger of losing their loyalty was quickly and publicly recognised by Mr Binyamin Begin, son of the late prime minister Menachem Begin, whose careful gathering of the Sephardim into the Likud fold was the foundation of the party's accession to power in 1977. 'We are talking about an important group in the Likud, even very important,' Mr Begin said yesterday. 'Most of them have been activists for many years. I very much hope in the week that we have it will be possible to straighten things out. 'I hope that all the members will understand three months before the elections that there are things that are bigger and more important than ourselves . . . first of all to win the elections on the 23rd of June.' The US has suggested reconvening Middle East peace talks between Israel and its Arab neighbours in Washington on April 27, writes Tony Walker in Cairo. The Arabs have indicated they will attend. In Tunis, Mr Yasser Abed Rabbo, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation executive committee, said foreign ministers of Jordan, Syria and Lebanon would meet in Beirut tomorrow for co-ordination talks. Israel, which has been pressing for talks to be moved from Washington to a location closer to the Middle East, probably in Europe, has not yet signalled its acceptance of the date. The European Community, meanwhile, has indicated that it will invite Palestinians from outside the occupied territories to talks in Brussels in May on Middle East economic issues.</p>

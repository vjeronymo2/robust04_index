Passages  between slantlines published in boldface.    "I can agree with the following!!!    "Fellow South Africans    "1. The Freedom Front accepts that God-Three-in-One decides  over the future of peoples and nations, and that we pledge to  try to live in God's honor.    "2. We reject any form of communism. The Freedom Front will  fight it with all the power at its disposal.    "3. Law and order must be maintained in such a way so as to  guarantee peace and security, and to fight crime and violence  effectively.    "4. The Afrikaner nation's right to self-determination, that  is, the right to rule itself in its own homeland is a  nonnegotiable right. This also includes specific rights for  Afrikaners outside the homeland.    "5. Real freedom means a constitutional dispensation that  will render any form of domination impossible.    "6. We advocate a constitutional solution for southern  Africa  based on political independence but economical interdependence  and cooperation.    "Best wishes, Gen. Constand Viljoen"    Below the letter are the following statements: "YOUR  VOTE HOLDS THE KEY! VOTE FREEDOM FRONT."</p>

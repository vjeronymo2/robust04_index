			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S.J. DIAMOND: ON-TIME LAW LIMITED IN ITS APPLICATIONS  </P> <P> As proposed legislation, California Senate Bill 101 got so much attention last  year you'd think it cured cancer or unclogged courts. But it was much more  humble: As of Jan. 1, utilities, cable companies and certain retailers must  make deliveries or repair calls within four hours of a promised time or risk a  small claims court judgment awarding their customer up to $500 in damages.  </P> <P> The bill's impetus was the personal experience of state Sen. Bill Lockyer  (D-Hayward), who had sat in a new apartment waiting for furniture that didn't  come. His experience was unusual only in that he didn't ask an employee to do  his waiting for him, and that when he mutters, "there oughtta be a law," he can  start making one.  </P> <P> Lockyer's proposal -- originally applied to all retailers and allowing only a  two-hour time period -- provoked a lot of discussion, more angry than  technical. There were no statistics behind the bill (e.g., total wages lost  annually statewide). It was all anecdotal material gleaned from "stacks of  letters from constituents," Lockyer aide Patricia Wynne says. Lockyer's own  favorite story involved a woman who waited 4 1/2 days for a cable TV serviceman  after being promised each afternoon that he really would be there the next day.  </P> <P> To these tales were added the unsolicited testimony of many Sacramento  lobbyists, who appeared at hearings on the bill not to represent their  employers, but to share their own experiences. "Everyone," says Wynne, "has at  some point in their life been stuck waiting."  </P> <P> Opponents of the original bill were less anecdotal but no more analytic. The  California Retailers Assn. in Sacramento said its members can already meet a  four-hour time limit 96% to 98% of the time even though it hadn't actually  surveyed them. Pacific Bell said, like other utilities, it was already  well-regulated by the Public Utilities Commission and should be excluded  (although there's no regulation covering the keeping of appointments, according  to the PUC.)  </P> <P> Representatives of all three affected industries said that it's more often the  consumer who doesn't show up and that aggrieved customers could simply take  their business to another company. What's more, they argued, if they had to  guarantee a time, they'd have to put on more personnel, and it would end up  costing the consumer.  </P> <P> The purpose of the new law is obviously to give consumers more than promises to  rest on, but its applications seem very limited. Independent service people --  plumbers, electricians, painters -- aren't included at all. As for retailers,  only the delivery of goods is affected, not services or repairs, and only if  they have more than 25 employees.  </P> <P> Companies are allowed an out for delays "caused by unforeseen or unavoidable  occurrences," if the company made a "diligent effort" to notify the consumer --  "conditions which may be difficult to prove or disprove," says Herschel Elkins,  California assistant attorney general in charge of consumer protection.  Furthermore, they could make things worse by "rushing through repairs to make  their next appointment," Elkins says, or even refusing to make future  appointments at all, saying they'll call when they can make it.  </P> <P> The consumer's recourse under the law is also limited. He must take his case to  small claims court, thereby losing more time yet, and can recover only for  actual financial loss, including lost wages, up to $500.  </P> <P> Apparently it's just not easy to regulate such mundane personal arrangements.  Laws in other states that invite enforcement by government agencies may provide  no swifter surer justice. Massachusetts, for example, broadly rules it unfair  and deceptive to promise prompt delivery "where delivery is neither prompt nor  expeditious," or to fail to deliver merchandise on the date set unless there  were "circumstances beyond (one's) control."  </P> <P> New York City, by contrast, has a narrow rule, covering only new, ready-made  furniture and major appliances: If a delivery appointment isn't met and the  consumer wasn't informed ahead of time in writing, he can cancel the order, get  his money back and up to $100 in lost wages.  </P> <P> Still, in New York, where the consumer affairs department wields the law  "aggressively" because of the number of complaints (500-600 a year on furniture  alone, most concerning non-delivery), only 60 consumers a year on average have  collected money. And in Massachusetts, a consumer seeking damages for lost time  still has to sue the business -- probably a rare occurrence given the  relatively small amount of money involved, says Edgar Dworsky, spokesman for  the state's executive office of consumer affairs.  </P> <P> Given a state or municipal law, an enforcing agency could take stronger action  against an offending company, but only if multiple complaints indicate a  pattern of practice. Even then, enforcement is a matter of priorities, and  non-delivery of furniture is not a major crime. A legislature can "name a  government agency to enforce a law," says Richard Elbrecht, head of legal  services for California's consumer affairs department, "but unless they fund  people to do it, it's not very effective. Better to let small claims court do  it."  </P> <P> Even in small claims court, supposedly more Populist than higher courts, "most  judges would not take it seriously without a statute," says Elkins. Nor,  perhaps, would the general public. Such statutes have an "educative function,"  says Elbrecht, "with the practical effect of highlighting something -- that the  consumer should treat this arrangement a little more seriously. It's a rallying  cry to basic integrity in human relations."  </P> <P> More specifically, the law, whatever its limits, "provides guidance to what are  considered fair business practices," says Dworsky, "defining when enough is  enough. Business will know that if they sidestep these rules, they may be  subject to penalties, and it helps the consumer to argue if he can say, 'The  law says . . . ' "  </P></p>

Addressing a  news conference at Islamabad Airport today on her return from a  week-long tour of Davos, Geneva, Zagreb, and Sarajevo Ms.  Benazir Bhutto said the image of Pakistan in the international  community has been enhanced. We were able to project the  positive image of Pakistan on the question of investment  climate, our just stand on Kashmir, and on expression of  solidarity with the Bosnian Muslims. Pakistan has achieved the  objective of drawing world attention toward human rights  violations in occupied Kashmir and the plight of the Bosnian  Muslims.    The prime minister said according to her promise to the  people of Pakistan and Kashmir, she presented the Kashmir case  before the Human Rights Commission. It is Pakistan's basic  policy to repeatedly arouse the world conscience over Indian  atrocities in occupied Kashmir. Replying to questions on  threats from Indian leaders, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said no amount  of threats or intimidation can deter us from our principled  stand on Kashmir and support to the Kashmiri people's right of  self-determination. We are fully capable of defending our  integrity against any aggression, she added.    To another question, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said while agreeing  to the talks with India, we have sent a powerful signal to New  Delhi that Pakistan believes in talks. We also wanted to tell  the world that there is a government in Pakistan, which despite  strong domestic pressures, is capable of taking even unpopular  decisions in the larger interests of peace. Pakistan, she  added, cannot be expected to be engaged in talks with India in  an atmosphere where the Kashmiri people may feel that we are  colluding with Indian repressions. She said a resolution is  being moved in the Human Rights Commission for violations in  Kashmir. Pakistan has conveyed to the world that it is not a  matter of number to win maximum votes, but it is a matter of  principle. She said special envoys are being sent to various  countries to muster support.    On the investment climate, Ms. Benazir Bhutto was hopeful  for  a boost in foreign investment in Pakistan in the wake of the new  atmosphere of political and economic stability prevailing in the  country. She said foreign investors are also going to open a  Pakistan Trade Center in Zurich to get international market for  Pakistani products.    On her visit to Sarajevo, the prime minister said she and  Turkish Prime Minister Madam Tansu Ciller succeeded in diverting  world attention toward the plight of Bosnian people. Narrating  the woeful human rights situation in Bosnia, Ms. Benazir Bhutto  said people are getting sick and weak. They have no food, no  medicine, no water, and no electricity. We salute the brave  people of Bosnia who are living in a very difficult situation,  but are fighting for their independence and territorial  integrity.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Chemical Waste to cut jobs CHEMICAL Waste Manage-ment, the Illinois-based handler of hazardous waste, is to reduce its workforce by more than one-fifth. It also plans to take substantial asset write-downs, and restructure operations to slash costs, after a disappointing year. The measures will result in a Dollars 363m charge to earnings in the third quarter, the equivalent of Dollars 1.74 per share. WMX Technologies, the international rubbish hauler which owns 79 per cent of Chemical Waste, said the charge would reduce its third-quarter net income by Dollars 285.3m, or 59 cents a share. Analysts said the write-downs and cost-savings were larger than expected, and should provide short-term benefits to financial performance. However, with serious overcapacity in the waste-handling business in the US, 'their biggest challenge remains the need to generate revenue growth', said Mr Jim McDonald, analyst for Chicago Corporation. Chemical Waste said it intended to reduce its 5,000-strong payroll by 1,200 before the end of 1994. It hoped some of these job losses would come through the sale of some units. Most of the asset write-downs involve hazardous waste incinerators. The company has completely written off its troubled waste-burning plant in southern Chicago, and is to seek joint venture partners for an incinerator unit at Port Arthur, Texas. It said its would also consolidate its treatment and disposal operations throughout North America, and sell selected operations. Further savings are planned by switching the transport of some waste from its own trucking operations to road contractors and rail. Mr Pat Payne, president, said the group was depending on its international engineering, construction and consulting arm, Rust International, for growth. Rust is expected to contribute Dollars 1.6bn in revenues this year.</p>

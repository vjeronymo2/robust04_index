			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Design role for road builders ALL road schemes worth up to Pounds 40m are to be considered for a new form of contract making roadbuilders responsible for designing as well as constructing highways, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced yesterday. He said that the design-and-build contracts should ensure greater certainty over timings and costs of projects. Up to a third of all contracts would be awarded in this way within three or four years. They would replace arrangements by which consultants are commissioned to design a road before the construction contract is put out to tender. The move follows successful trials of two schemes, and a further four schemes, totalling Pounds 118m will also be built under the new contracts.</p>

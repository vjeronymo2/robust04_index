			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The widow of Sweden's assassinated Prime Minister Olof Palme identified  defendant Christer Pettersson in court as the man she saw seconds after her  husband was fatally shot and she was wounded more than three years ago. Lisbet  Palme, grazed by one of the bullets that killed her husband on the night of  Feb. 28, 1986, as they walked home from a movie in Stockholm, said Pettersson  stared at her and her husband with hostility after the shooting and then fled.  She did not see Pettersson carrying a gun, however, she said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Mozambique Liberal and Democratic Party, Palmo,  the Mozambique People's Progress Party, PPPM, and the Mozambican  National Union, Unamo, say they will boycott the October  elections if the funds pledged by the United Nations for  opposition activities are not disbursed. The three parties  issued a communique accusing UN Secretary General representative  Aldo Ajello of wanting democracy in Mozambique to depend solely  on the Mozambique Liberation Front and Mozambique National  Resistance. Palmo, PPPM, and Unamo say by permitting Aldo  Ajello to adopt incorrect attitudes, the United Nations does not  want free and fair elections to be held in Mozambique.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: IBM starts hunt for new axeman - The task facing the next chief executive THE new chief executive of IBM must be tough enough, many believe, to eliminate tens of thousands more jobs. This is in spite of the fact Mr John Akers, whom he or she will replace, has cut Big Blue's workforce by 100,000 over the past seven years. Industry observers and analysts have underlined that finding a replacement for Mr Akers, who is to relinquish his role as chief executive but stay on as chairman, would be a hard task. IBM announced Mr Akers' move on Tuesday. The task of finding the successor has fallen to Mr James Burke, an IBM director and former chairman of Johnson and Johnson, who will head a newly-created committee of outside directors. The newly-empowered 'nomination and executive compensation committee', comprising IBM's non-executive directors, has said it will look for candidates outside as well as within the company, and expects to make an appointment within the next three months. Having set a precedent by looking beyond IBM's own top management ranks, it appears likely an outsider will be chosen. 'There is a mood for change. To appoint an insider after making such a dramatic move would be a disappointment,' said one close observer. 'It will probably be an outsider,' agreed Mr Richard Shaffer, president of Technologic Partners, an industry consulting group. Most of IBM's senior managers have spent their entire careers at the company, he points out. 'IBM needs more outside directors, more outsiders in top management, and a lot more arguing among senior executives,' he suggests. 'They need somebody who is not as genteel as Akers, somebody who can be tough.' Yet the 'shock effect' of putting a new management team in place may be what is needed at IBM, says Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, chief executive of Compaq Computer who replaced Compaq's co-founder, Mr Rod Canion, in 1991 after a boardroom coup. 'A new team can start afresh with a clean sheet on what needs to be changed and how. If it is the same guys it is an evolutionary process, rather than a revolution. 'This will get IBM beyond the denial phase,' says Mr Pfeiffer, 'past the stage of responding to wishful thinking that everything is going to be OK when the economy improves.' A newcomer would also need to be given free rein by the board of directors, Mr Pfeiffer said. Whether IBM's new chief executive will have such freedom remains unclear. Also uncertain is how long Mr Akers will remain as chairman of IBM after a new chief executive is appointed. It will be up to IBM's directors to decide whether and when to elect a new chairman. Before this week's announcement, Mr Akers was expected to remain as chairman until the end of 1994 when he turns 60, IBM's traditional retirement age. From Mr Akers' statements on Tuesday, it appears IBM is seeking an executive who will execute the recovery strategy already in place. Mr Akers emphasised that the company remained strongly committed to its strategy to improve IBM's competitiveness and profitability. A new IBM chief executive might also reflect upon how quickly directors can lose confidence in top managers. Just a month ago, Mr Akers confidently told Wall Street analysts 'the IBM board support this management, the board supports me and I do not plan to step aside. I have not given it any thought.' Yet Mr Akers was evidently persuaded to give a great deal of thought to his role at IBM, and on Monday the company's board accepted his proposal that it begin looking for somebody to replace him. The degree to which IBM's directors encouraged Mr Akers to step aside remains unclear. 'We may never know what really happened,' said one IBM manager, 'but it is clear that he (Mr Akers) made an abrupt change, and it seems unlikely that he would do so without pressure from the board.'</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Sleaze goes to university after government reforms: Claims of financial impropriety in higher education Sleaze allegations have hit the government's reforms of further and higher education this month. Yesterday Portsmouth University, a former polytechnic which owes its independent status to government reforms, launched an investigation into claims that its vice-chancellor muddled his expense claims for foreign trips. The university said yesterday that it had given Professor Neil Merritt a 'formal warning' over the allegations, and said that a vote of no-confidence in him supported by 93 per cent of staff was 'hardly surprising, given the one-sided nature of the information' drip fed to them. The members and remit of the independent inquiry will be decided next week. This is only the latest of several allegations of dubious financial behaviour by university and college governors. One quango, the Further Education Funding Council for England, has recommended dismissal for the governing boards of two further education colleges, in Birmingham and Derby. Both were freed from local authority control and incorporated as independent institutions in April 1993. At St Philip's Roman Catholic Sixth Form College, Birmingham, the governors said they were determined to close the college in spite of opposition from parents and staff. At Derby College, Wilmorton, governors were asked to repay illegal payments of about Pounds 16,000. The most serious incident came at the end of October, when the funding council which covers higher education ordered Huddersfield University - which gained its current status in 1992 - not to pay a planned Pounds 400,000 golden handshake to its departing vice-chancellor, saying it was 'possibly illegal'. Higher education in particular is divided over how to respond to the problems. Universities are traditionally autonomous and are alarmed by any indications that they cannot use their autonomy responsibly. But lecturers' unions say that accountability in the sector has been weakened by the government's decision to incorporate colleges and universities as bodies run on the same lines as limited companies. Huddersfield has taken the most drastic action so far. It used powers given to it by the 1988 and 1992 education acts to remove the local authority, staff and student representatives from its governing body. Then it gave its vice-chancellor, Professor Kenneth Durrands, a pay rise of 45 per cent, backdated by four months, to be followed by a severance package of about Pounds 400,000 - out of a total annual turnover of about Pounds 55m. The total involved was only revealed after a National Audit Office investigation, which MPs from the Public Accounts Committee ordered to be made public. This had been agreed in spite of an overwhelming vote of no-confidence in the governing council by academic staff. The university agreed to set aside the package after the funding council's intervention. The funding council is anxious not to make incursions on university autonomy, however, and said that renegotiating a fresh package for Prof Durrands was 'a matter for the university'. It is now working on a guidance note for governors, although it stresses this will not include binding regulations. The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals, which represents the managers of all universities in the UK, wants to avoid any resort to legislation to solve the problems. It opposed Huddersfield's action in dismissing its local authority and staff representatives. 'Huddersfield was the only new university which used the powers it was given by the government,' it said.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'LEADERSHIP STYLE, PHILOSOPHY' CITED;  </P> <P> BOARD FIRES CHULA VISTA SCHOOLS CHIEF  </P> <P> The superintendent of the Chula Vista City School District has been fired by  the school board in a surprise move only two days before the traditional school  year begins, and only a year after he was hired to bring wide-ranging changes  to the South Bay district.  </P> <P> Robert J. McCarthy, selected in June, 1988, after a nationwide search, had been  praised as late as April for "having a background and philosophy similar to  that of the district." But, on Friday, board President Frank Tarantino said the  board acted Thursday night "because of differences in leadership style and  philosophy."  </P> <P> The rapidly growing district has almost 17,000 students in kindergarten through  sixth grade, spread through 33 elementary schools, with about a third on  year-round schedules. It is the largest elementary school district in San Diego  County.  </P> <P> Tarantino, a high school counselor with the Sweetwater high school district,  refused Friday to elaborate on the board's brief statement about McCarthy's  forced resignation, under which he will be paid through June, 1990.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Shocked, Disappointed'  </P> <P> McCarthy said he was "genuinely shocked and disappointed" at the action,  although he conceded that, in retrospect, his many initiatives during the past  year had generated substantial opposition.  </P> <P> Among other actions, McCarthy had hired several new administrators, revamped  the bilingual program and instituted teacher accountability measures to boost  student achievement. The district's scores on the California Assessment Program  standardized tests ranked among the county's lowest in reading and mathematics  during the past several years.  </P> <P> "There is no question that the teachers union was not enamored with what I was  trying to do, which is to gear efforts to helping kids learn rather than  keeping everyone happy," McCarthy said. "There is no doubt that the quality of  the teaching staff in Chula Vista is there to achieve the same results as  National City and South Bay Union (districts) have done. . . . I knew there  were some difficulties," but nothing to suggest his firing, he added. A  district teacher who asked not to be identified said that McCarthy "had hurt a  lot of people" with his aggressive style and that there was "a general  undercurrent of unrest, from the top to the bottom."  </P> <P> The teacher said that, after McCarthy would finish a school visit, the staff  would be upset at the way he had talked to them when outlining necessary  changes.  </P> <P> McCarthy, who came to Chula Vista after seven years as superintendent in San  Leandro, near San Francisco, said he will look for another school position.  </P> <P> "I hope that the much-needed change in Chula Vista will take place . . . and  that, with some of the things now put in place, the district will begin to turn  the corner," McCarthy said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MUSICAL INSIGHT OF PEOPLE  </P> <P> In re People magazine's "de facto ban" on articles about rap music, as reported  in the May 13 Pop Eye column:  </P> <P> Perhaps the lack of interest in rap articles is due in part to the fact that  90% of rap records have identical machine-generated robot rhythms, identical  percussive sounds, identical female shrieks, identical topics and identical  beats-per-minute.  </P> <P> And when it comes to the only genuine (non-synthesized) sound -- the rapper  himself -- we get the same inflections, the same cadence, the same number of  words and syllables per line.  </P> <P> In short, this is a very, very tired musical style, so if it's so boring to  listen to, who wants to read about it?  </P> <P> ELON JOHNSON  </P> <P> Compton  </P></p>

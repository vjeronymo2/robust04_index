			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LATINO LEADERS CALL FOR OUSTER OF  SUPERVISORS  </P> <P> Citing a federal finding that Los Angeles County's Health Services Department  discriminated against Latinos, community leaders Tuesday said on-the-job bias  will continue until the supervisors are voted out of office.  </P> <P> "About the only thing we can continue to do is to work to vote them (the  supervisors) out," said Raul Nunez of the Los Angeles County Chicano Employees  Assn.  </P> <P> Last week, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission accused the county  of job discrimination, singling out County-USC and Martin Luther King Jr./Drew  medical centers for failing to hire and promote Latinos. County officials have  said under-representation of Latinos in the county work force is the result of  slowed hirings due to budget cuts.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the supervisors called for a county study of Health Services  Department hiring practices.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town April 25 SAPA -- The terrorists  responsible for the spate of bombings over the past two days  would be ruthlessly hunted down, the deputy minister of law and  order, Mr Gert Myburgh, told a media conference here on Monday  [25 April]. The government had taken a number of major steps to  ensure the public would be able to vote as safely as possible  over the next three days    He said the government condemned the bombings in the  strongest possible terms. "It must be stated quite  categorically that, despite these evil acts of terrorism, South  Africans will vote on April 26, 27 and 28," he said. "I would  like to assure the public that the government, the SAP [South  African Police] and other security forces will not fail in their  duty to safeguard the transition to a democracy in South Africa."    The SAP had already offered R1 million [rand] for  information  leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.    Steps taken to promote voting safety included:     -  immediate nationwide cordon and search operations by the  SA Police and other security forces to reduce the chances of  further bomb blasts and other atrocities;    -  more than 100,000 police would be deployed to ensure the  safety  of polling booths and stations throughout South Africa;    -  in the largest peace-time call-up yet in South Africa  thousands  of SA Defence Force members would be deployed to assist the SAP  safeguard the election process; and    -  implementation of contingency planning to deal with the  situation.       Mr Myburgh said no police force in the world could guarantee  that acts of terrorism would not take place, "but I would like  to state quite clearly that the SAP and other security forces  can and will ensure that the election process as a whole is not  derailed".    "I therefore urge the public to stay calm and to fully  co-operate with the security forces in their task of ensuring  that the election process is not derailed."    Mr Myburgh said he would like to express his and the  government's condolences to the family and friends of the  victims of all the bomb blasts.    Answering questions, he said it seemed quite logical that  there was a pattern in the bombings, but he could not comment at  this stage on who police thought might be behind it. The police  had assigned their most competent detectives to the  investigation.    The explosive devices used in the blasts had been home-made,  but were professional in the sense that they "did detonate".  There was no indication that any grouping like a third force  had been involved.    On election precautions, he said ballots and voting  stations,  at which police would be deployed, would be closely guarded as  routes to them. Polling stations were to be checked out the day  before voting and closely guarded right until the last person  had left at the end of the voting. The same measures as in the  past were being taken to protect political personalities.</p>

Last year the local gross domestic product and total  industrial and agricultural output value reached 11.6 billion  yuan (about 1.33 billion U.S. dollars) and 22.9 billion yuan,  respectively, in this coastal special economic zone in south  China's Guangdong Province, both doubling the figures for 1990.    The city has set up a special industrial development  foundation to foster new and high-tech industries, backbone  enterprises and the production of quality products. In the  year, it completed 92 scientific and technological promotion  projects, which are expected to turn out an added output value  of two billion yuan.    With some 10,000 new township, foreign-funded, private and  individual enterprises starting business last year, the city's  total industrial output exceeded 20 billion yuan, up by 39  percent over the previous year.    As an ancestral home of overseas Chinese, the city approved  the setting up of 1,343 foreign-funded enterprises last year  involving a total of 1.37 billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds.    With nearly 40 percent of industrial products exported, the  city's export volume reached 1.687 billion U.S. dollars last  year.    Shantou also boosted three investment areas last year,  namely  the Shantou Free Trade Zone, the Shantou new and high-tech  industrial development zone and the Nanao Island experiment zone.    The high-tech zone introduced 65 projects involving a total  investment of 3.1 billion yuan.    The city also put three billion yuan last year into the  construction of infrastructure facilities covering airport  expansion, docks, railway lines, highways and bridges, electric  power, telephones and residential housing.    This year the city plans to put another 5.6 billion yuan  into  further improving its investment environment, the mayor said.</p>

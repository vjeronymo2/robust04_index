He discussed with them Lebanese developments and  bilateral relations.    'Alizadeh also met with scholar Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah.  He said that discussions "focused on the need to devote more  attention to Muslims in view of the serious conditions facing  them throughout the world."    On the U.S. Congress delegation's visit to the region and  its  interest in the fate of the missing Israeli solders, when  Israeli jails are full of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners, he  said: "Regrettably, this is one of the contradictions of the new  world order, and can be termed the double standards policy  pursued by the United States and international circles. While  the United States devotes special interest to the fate of the  missing Zionist occupation soldiers, no one talks about the fate  of the hundreds of Lebanese and Palestinians living in Zionist  detention centers and the al-Khiyam detention center. It is  really painful and regrettable."</p>

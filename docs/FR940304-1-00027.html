			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of NPRMs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93&hyph;NM&hyph;213&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Canadair Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 series airplanes. Transport Canada advises that the attitude and heading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference system (AHRS) could send conflicting input to the stall protection computer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (SPC) on these airplanes. When the AHRS sends input to the SPC, the left- and right- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand channels on the SPC receive and compare that input. The SPC has a built-in feature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that compares lateral acceleration from these channels. When the SPC recognizes unequal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lateral acceleration signals of 0.03g or higher, it will inhibit the stall horn, light, and stick  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> push command, and an ``SPS FAILURE'' caution message will display on the primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flight display. Due to a build-up effect of AHRS tolerances, these unequal signals may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detected within the SPC at a roll rate within the normal flight envelope. This condition, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not corrected, could result in the loss of stall warning protection on the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bombardier, Inc., has issued Regional Jet Canadair Alert Service Bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> S.B. A601R&hyph;34&hyph;028, Revision `A,' dated October 22, 1993, that describes procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification of the stall protection system (SPS) input wiring. The modification involves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removing the right channel input wires from the connection to the SPC, capping and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stowing the removed wires, installing splices from the left-hand channel input to the right- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand channel connection of the SPC, and installing a ground jumper wire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accomplishment of these wiring changes will prevent a build-up effect of AHRS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tolerances and unequal signals between the left- and right-hand SPC channels. Transport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Canada Aviation classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;93&hyph;27, dated October 26, 1993, in order to assure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require modification of the SPS input wiring. The modification would be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> This proposed AD would also require revising the Normal Procedures section of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to specify that a pre-flight check of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slip/skid indications must be conducted prior to engine start. Finally, this proposed AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require modification of the AHRS to restore the dual AHRS inputs to the SPC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This modification would be required to be accomplished in accordance with a method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved by the FAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> It should be noted that Canadian AD CF&hyph;93&hyph;27 requires that the flight crew be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advised of the possibility of an inadvertent inhibition of the stall horn, light, and stick push  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> command at a roll rate within the normal flight envelope, and that an ``SPS FAILURE''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caution message will be displayed on the primary flight display. The Canadian AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that when such a message is displayed, appropriate abnormal procedures in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AFM should be followed. However, the FAA's position in this regard is that it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to include a requirement in this proposed AD to direct the flight crew to follow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing AFM procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The FAA estimates that 9 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The cost for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required parts would be minimal. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $990, or $110 per airplane. This total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this AD action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act.

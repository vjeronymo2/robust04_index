			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Decision and Order <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In the Matter of: Carrier Corporation. (Case No. F&hyph;065)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94&hyph;163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95&hyph;619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100&hyph;12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA 1988), Public Law 100&hyph;357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776, which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 to create a waiver process. 45 FR 64108, September 26, 1980. Thereafter, DOE further amended its appliance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures. 51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily test procedures for a particular basic model when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according to the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is the subject of the waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Assistant Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Carrier filed a ``Petition for Waiver,'' dated October 13, 1993, in accordance with &sect;430.27 of 10 CFR part 430. The Department published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 27, 1993, Carrier's petition and solicited comments, data and information respecting the petition. 58 FR 68400. Carrier also filed an ``Application for Interim Waiver'' under section 430.27(g) which DOE granted on December 17, 1993. 58 FR 68400, December 27, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments were received concerning either the ``Petition for Waiver'' or the ``Interim Waiver.'' The Department consulted with The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the Carrier Petition. The FTC did not have any objections to the issuance of the waiver to Carrier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Assertions and Determinations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Carrier's Petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition of the burner and the starting of the circulating air blower. Carrier requests the allowance to test using a 45-second blower time delay when testing its 48HJ, 48HM, 48TJ/580D, 48SS/588A, and 48SX/589A induced draft roof-top furnaces. Carrier states that since the 45-second delay is indicative of how these models actually operate and since such a delay results in an improvement in efficiency of approximately 0.6 percent, the petition should be granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under specific circumstances, the DOE test procedure contains exceptions which allow testing with blower delay times of less than the prescribed 1.5 minute delay. Carrier indicates that it is unable to take advantage of any of these exceptions for its 48HJ, 48HM, 48TJ/580D, 48SS/588A, and 48SX/589A induced draft roof-top furnaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the blower controls incorporated on the Carrier 48HJ, 48HM, 48TJ/580D, 48SS/588A, and 48SX/589A induced draft roof-top furnaces are designed to impose a 45-second blower delay in every instance of start up, and since the current provisions do not specifically address this type of control, DOE agrees that a waiver should be granted to allow the 45-second blower time delay when testing the Carrier 48HJ, 48HM, 48TJ/580D, 48SS/588A, and 48SX/589A induced draft roof-top furnaces. Accordingly, with regard to testing the above induced draft roof-top furnaces, today's Decision and Order exempts Carrier from the existing provisions regarding blower controls and allows testing with the 45-second delay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is, therefore, ordered that:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by Carrier Corporation. (Case No. F&hyph;065) is hereby granted as set forth in paragraph (2) below, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Appendix N of 10 CFR part 430, Subpart B, Carrier Corporation, shall be permitted to test its 48HJ, 48HM, 48TJ/580D, 48SS/588A, and 48SX/589A induced draft roof-top furnaces on the basis of the test procedure specified in 10 CFR part 430, with modifications set forth below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

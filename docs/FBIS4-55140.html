			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA's 11 May "Press Review"] </F>   [Excerpt] Sofia, May 11 (BTA) -- The press provides  extensive comments on the forthcoming cabinet changes. Most  dailies say that Prime Minister Lyuben Berov can hardly be  expected to introduce the intended cabinet changes before  parliament today, as promised in an interview last Sunday.  DUMA, the daily of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), quotes  Socialists' parliamentary floor leader Nora Ananieva as saying  that the document which the prime minister gave to the  parliamentary forces contained just outlines. Interviewed for  TRUD, MP Osman Oktay of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights  and Freedoms (DPS) says that the prime minister has not  convinced the DPS that Rumen Genchev, Prof. Berov's nominee as  the third deputy prime minister, is competent for this office.  "DPS disapproves of Gechev's nomination as deputy prime  minister", STANDART NEWS says in a front-paged headline.  According to DUMA, in most probability the DPS position is a  bid for a deal involving influence in key departments. The DPS  MP's, who are expected to meet with the prime minister on  Thursday [12 May], oppose the BSP interference in the cabinet's  overhaul and advised the prime minister against introducing the  cabinet changes before parliament today, 24 CHASA writes.  Referring to what are described as well informed sources,  DEMOKRATSIYA cites former parliamentary DPS deputy floor leader  Sherife Mustafa as saying that she would not support the prime  minister's proposal for changes because "she does not want to go  to prison together with Ahmed Dogan (leader of the DPS)". DUMA  says that Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov is the likely  deputy prime minister, and MP Gospodin Atanasov of the New Union  for Democracy (expelees or breakaways from the Union of  Democratic Forces) will probably be nominated as the new  minister of justice. "The Socialists describe Stoyan  Aleksandrov's threat for some ministers resigning en bloc and  his claim he could cope with Bulgaria's foreign debt problem  alone as overdoing it," DUMA says. "They All Fell Out," reads  the headline of an article in DEMOKRATSIYA which says that the  BSP and the DPS will wait until the conference of the Union of  Democratic Forces (SDS) is held. According to KONTINENT, the  overhaul of the cabinet has been put off until May 18. "The  second overhaul of the cabinet stands a good chance of entering  the Guinness Book of Records as the most time- taking bargain  ever in world practice," a signed commentary in KONTINENT says.  An editorial commentary in 24 CHASA says that the tourist  season and the cabinet overhaul seem to have a common fate: both  ending before ever starting. DUMA writes in a commentary that  both the prime minister and the parliamentary forces will  benefit by protracting the overhaul. OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK quotes  President Zhelyu Zhelev as saying that he is skeptical about the  cabinet overhaul. STANDART NEWS writes that MP's have opened  negotiations on a new cabinet.

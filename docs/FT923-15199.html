			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Asda 'delighted' to realise Pounds 73m from sale of MFI shareholding ASDA, the UK's fourth biggest grocery chain, yesterday said it was 'delighted' to have realised Pounds 73m cash from selling its 25 per cent shareholding in MFI, having last year written down the value of the investment to just Pounds 2m. It also revealed that Mr Peter Monaghan, operations director of the B&amp;Q DIY chain, would join the company as retail director, succeeding Mr Richard Harker, who resigned earlier this week. The appointment provoked some controversy after Isosceles, struggling owner of the rival Gateway grocery chain, said it had already signed an employment contract with Mr Monaghan offering him the post of managing director of the Gateway stores business unit. Given his action in accepting Asda's later offer, however, Gateway said it no longer considered Mr Monaghan to be an 'appropriate' person to join its senior management team and would not try to hold him to his contract. Mr Archie Norman, Asda's chief executive, said he approached Mr Monaghan with a job offer immediately after he learnt of his resignation from B&amp;Q. The two men knew each other well during their time at Kingfisher. Asda's cash inflow from the MFI sale will be used to reduce its borrowings which analysts estimate still stand at about Pounds 700m in spite of an emergency Pounds 357m rights issue last year. The company will announce its full-year results on Monday, when it is expected to take a substantial write-down on its property portfolio but will outline a strategy for reinvigorating its business. Although Asda received less money from the 'MFI lottery ticket' than had been mooted in recent weeks, Mr Norman said it was still more than had been considered realistic earlier this year. 'When I arrived at Asda we were looking at getting only Pounds 25m from MFI,' he said.</p>

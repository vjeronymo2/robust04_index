			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Courtaulds shock Savaging of the chemicals sector continued yesterday as disappointing figures from Courtaulds, one of the sector leaders, sent the company's shares reeling on their highest turnover for more than 4 1/2 years. The stock dropped 44 to 432p, a level last seen more than a year ago, with 9.8m shares traded. The fall followed a sharp rerating for BOC the previous day. The headline interim profits from Courtaulds were up at Pounds 96.1m from Pounds 88.8m previously and market forecasts of around Pounds 87m. But the pre-tax figure contained an exceptional charge of Pounds 24.4m and once that was deducted the numbers were looking depressing. Furthermore, Courtaulds warned that conditions would continue to be difficult during the second half, traditionally the best period for the group. Analysts brought their forecasts for the full year down to around Pounds 150m from estimates of Pounds 180m to Pounds 190m previously. Mr David Ingles of agency broker James Capel maintained faith in the company, but said he saw the shares slipping to around 400p before they were worth buying again. Mr Martin Evans of securities house Hoare Govett said: 'Courtaulds is dead money for the time being - it is too late to sell and too early to buy.' BOC recovered 5 to 601p, with Hoare maintaining its buy stance.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Double find leads to about-turn  -The transformation of Freeport McMoRan FREEPORT McMoRan is not one of those companies nursing a hangover after the excesses of the 1980s. Although the US minerals group spent heavily on acquisitions in the last decade, since 1989 it has sold assets in order to raise cash - some Dollars 2bn so far. There are, however, good reasons for this abrupt about-face. As Mr James R. Moffett, chairman - known to his colleagues as Jim-Bob - points out, Freeport has had the good fortune to discover not one but two massive natural resource deposits. One discovery gives Freeport, in the same deposit, one of the world's five largest copper reserves as well as the largest economic gold reserve outside South Africa - at least 41m troy ounces. The find will enable Freeport's 74 per cent-owned subsidiary, Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold, to increase production at its mine in a remote area of Indonesia to 1bn lb of copper and 1m troy ounces of gold a year, making it the world's second-largest copper producer (accounting for about 5 per cent of western world output) and owner of one of the world's biggest gold mines. 'It has been suggested that we would be the equivalent of two major oil companies in one,' says Mr Moffett, never one to understate his case. 'Not only will we have a substantial outflow of copper and gold but we can sustain that from our present reserves for 23 years from 1996.' The copper-gold discovery was an extension to a deposit which Freeport has been mining for 20 years. The US group recently signed a 30-year contract with the Indonesian government giving Freeport exclusive mineral rights over 6.5m acres around its present mining area. This covers a major mineral 'trend', or zone, which already has yielded significant ore discoveries. Mr Moffett suggests: 'This deposit is an omen about what may be in the rest of the mountainside there (in Indonesia). It's like the first big discovery in the North Sea or the first big discovery in the Gulf of Mexico.' It was in the Gulf of Mexico, on the doorstep of Freeport's headquarters in New Orleans, that Freeport made its other important find - Main Pass, the first sulphur deposit discovered in 25 years and the largest in North America. Even at today's depressed prices, sulphur is eight times more valuable than oil, and Mr Moffett is confident that one day it will be worth much more. It took two years to bring Main Pass into production in 1992. As a bonus, the sulphur is below a layer of oil (albeit a high-sulphur crude, which is not highly-valued) and Main Pass has become one of the biggest oil producers in the Gulf of Mexico. Freeport's jubilation about the success of its exploration efforts was muted by the realisation that it would cost at least Dollars 1bn to develop the discoveries to a point where they would generate cash flow and profits. Mr Moffett points out: 'In a natural resource business you have to be reactive. We had to change our strategy. We had to sell assets if we wanted to avoid our debt going over Dollars 3bn. Those discoveries don't do anything for your cashflow until you've spent the money to get them into production. So we sold Dollars 2bn worth of assets.' This was a reversal of the policy the group had followed from 1981, when it was formed via the merger of Freeport Minerals with McMoRan Oil and Gas. Until 1988, when it made its two huge discoveries in the space of six months, Freeport was in a race against time to find acquisitions to provide it with Dollars 100m of annual cashflow about to disappear at the end of the 1980s, when its two 30-year-old sulphur mines were expected to be depleted. A five-year acquisition spree doubled Freeport's oil and gas reserves, more than doubled its agricultural minerals business and added the second-largest US producer of geothermal energy to its portfolio. Freeport also spun off parts of some subsidiaries and had them traded separately on the New York Stock Exchange so the outside world would have a clearer perception of the true value of previously 'hidden' assets. Today, Freeport owns only 74 per cent of Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold, and only 51.3 per cent of Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners, which in turn owns 58.3 per cent of Main Pass and is the operator. Mr Moffett explains: 'Our exploration-acquisition strategy in the early 1980s came about because we did not want to bet the company on finding big reserves. If someone had told me in 1982 that in 1988 we would find Main Pass and Grassberg (the new Indonesian copper-gold deposit), I would not have bought those companies. So we bought geothermal and Canadian oil and gas, both with 30-year cash flows. We couldn't bet that we would beat the system. We needed cash flow to replace those two sulphur mines which were going out of business.' Since the two discoveries, Freeport has sold the geothermal operations, its Canadian and US oil and gas businesses, its ammonium nitrate interests and its Nevada gold mining company. 'It was the right thing to do,' Mr Moffett insists. 'They were all great assets, all long-life assets, but small potatoes compared with what we had found.' He stresses that the discoveries should also provide low-cost resources. For example, Freeport Resource Partners is an integrated producer of phosphate-based fertilisers, using its sulphur to produce sulphuric acid which is reacted with the phosphate rock the company mines in Florida to produce phosphoric acid. This is further processed into three types of finished fertilisers. Mr Moffett suggests the company can produce the most important type - Dap, or diammonium phosphate - more cheaply than any of its main competitors. Mining in Indonesia is not cheap - Freeport is having to provide for a remote, mountainside town of 9,000 people - but the Ertzberg-Grasberg deposit is so rich that both its copper and gold are cheaper than 75 per cent of output in the rest of the world outside the former Soviet Union. Nevertheless, in spite of its obvious attractions, investors have tended to shy away from Freeport because of its debts - the 1991 annual report showed Dollars 1.9bn. The company's debt rating, in the double-B range, is below investment grade and Mr Moffett and his board consider the shares undervalued. So Freeport has avoided straight debt or equity offerings to raise cash in favour of other instruments, such as convertible debt and bond issues. Mr Moffett points out that Freeport's debt - all owed to the public, 'we don't owe any money to banks' - is down to Dollars 1.2bn and the company has Dollars 400m cash in the bank. He says Freeport will borrow another Dollars 150m so as to have the cash in hand ready before moving ahead with the Dollars 550m expansion in Indonesia.</p>

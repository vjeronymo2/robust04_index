			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Where there's a will . . . - . . . there's a way to appoint executors APPOINTING a friend as executor to your will might mean one friend less. So, considerate people often choose to give this onerous responsibility to a bank or solicitor. But they would be making a mistake according to Which?, the Consumer's Association's monthly magazine. Simon Hinde, the editor, says: 'Banks and solicitors can take years to administer a will and charge enormous sums for the privilege. Over-charging and incompetence can result in years of wrangling and cost thousands of pounds.' Which? quotes one case where the Midland bank mis-read a will and paid almost Pounds 50,000 too much in inheritance tax. A beneficiary spotted the mistake. It took two years to wind up the estate and the bank charged Pounds 11,000. One solicitor charged almost Pounds 6,000 and took nearly five years to deal with a Pounds 120,000 will. He also retained a further Pounds 4,673 against potential charges. In another case, Barclays bank charged more than Pounds 5,000 to close six bank accounts, wind up a pension and distribute the money among three people. It took seven months to do the work. Which? estimates total bank charges for administering a simple will as: Barclays Pounds 6,072, Lloyds Pounds 5,776, Midland Pounds 4,629 and National Westminster Pounds 6,497. It advises people to appoint a professional as executor only as a last resort. Anyone making a will has to appoint an executor to administer it after their death. The work involves paying taxes and debts, selling property, and ensuring that the beneficiaries receive their entitlements. It is common to appoint a spouse or trusted relative and it is often a good idea for two people to share the responsibility, particularly if one is a beneficiary. Lay executors can then appoint professionals to carry out the work and will be able to exert more control over them. Before appointing a friend or relative, their approval should be sought because there is little that beneficiaries can do if a lay executor does a bad job. They can be taken to court but negligence may be difficult to prove, quite apart from the expense. People who use the will-writing service of a bank will find that a condition of the service is that the bank be made executor. But if you have to appoint a professional, Which? advises people to avoid banks in favour of a good solicitor. The professional's charges should be established and there should be a clause in the will to arrange payment of these. If you have grounds for complaint against a bank as executor, you should write to the Banking Ombudsman, Citadel House, 5-10 Fetter Lane, London EC4 1BR. If your cause for grievance is a solicitor, write to the Solicitors' Complaints Bureau, Portland House, Stag Place, London SW1E 5BL. If you are dissatisfied with the outcome, you can take the matter further to the Legal Services Ombudsman, 22 Oxford Court, Oxford Street, Manchester M2 3WQ. Anyone who has made a will should make sure that it is kept up to date. Mintel, the market research group, found that one in six is out of date, often because of remarriage or having children.</p>

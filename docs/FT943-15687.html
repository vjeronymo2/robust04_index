			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Harsh words for German telecoms plan Germany's independent monopoly commission warned yesterday that plans for the reform and privatisation of the state telecommunications monopoly, Deutsche Telekom, will do nothing to improve competition in the industry. In an outspoken indictment of the bill, due to be given final approval today in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, the anti-monopoly watchdogs condemned it for failing to produce any benefits either for business users or private consumers. It accused the government and opposition, who negotiated the compromise reform, of 'political short-sightedness' in failing to speed the pace of competition in Germany's telecommunications market. Only thanks to the European Union will the main area of telecommunications - voice transmission  -be opened to free competition from 1998. A special section of the monopoly commission's annual report is devoted to an analysis of the reform of the telecommunications and postal services. It concludes that the reform has maintained the monopoly situation in the industry, distorting competition, restricting the range of services, and keeping costs unnecessarily high. 'It is true that Germany possesses a well-functioning and modern system of communications,' the report says. 'But as far as the range of services is concerned, the time taken to execute contracts, for example with orders for telephone and data-connections, and the cost of supplies, there is substantial room for improvement.' Precisely because telecommunications will soon achieve the same economic importance in Germany as the motor industry, the need for competition is urgent, it says. By postponing the opening of the market (until the EU deadline of 1998), the reform will mean fewer jobs will be created. The report, drawn up under the chairmanship of Professor Carl Christian von Weizsacker, also points to serious gaps in the legislation in preparing for privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, which is supposed to begin some time in 1996. One question concerns the continuing state control over the organisation, through a holding company set up to manage all three arms of the old post and telecommunications services - the postal service, post bank and the telecommunications monopoly. The commission suggests that the federal government must consider a capital replenishment to increase Deutsche Telekom's depressed equity ratio of barely 20 per cent, a result of the huge capital costs of rebuilding a telephone infrastructure in east Germany. It suggests that the unresolved question of how to finance Deutsche Telekom's DM36bn (Pounds 14.7bn) pensions' commitments could be an even greater problem for the privatisation process. Prof von Weizsacker said yesterday that, in spite of all its failings, he would not urge the Bundesrat to reject the reform just because it was inadequate. He called instead for the government to begin work immediately on a further phase, to open the whole telecommunications market to competition as urgently as possible.</p>

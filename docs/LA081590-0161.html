			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: SOME POSSIBLE REMEDIES FOR 'RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME'  </P> <P> Our readers are great. When we wrote recently that there is no sure-fire cure  for "restless leg syndrome," the letters poured in with suggestions to help  combat this common problem.  </P> <P> Judging from our mailbag, millions of people toss and turn because of muscle  cramps and pains in their legs at night when they go to bed. Others simply feel  compelled to get up and move their feet around because of an uncomfort-able  restlessness.  </P> <P> One woman recalls that her grandmother called this problem "nervous leg." She  also suffers from it and has discovered that "running cold water over my legs  or using a cold pack from the freezer would allow me to go back to sleep  without tossing and turning."  </P> <P> Another reader finds just the opposite works for her. She takes a warm bath,  though getting up at 1 a.m. is slightly inconvenient.  </P> <P> Many letter-writers praise dietary remedies. One man has had far more trouble  with nighttime leg cramps since starting the asthma medicine Bricanyl. He  admits to not being an athlete, but his son, a college football player,  suggested Gatorade. This electrolyte replacement drink has done the trick. He  has not had a single cramp since he started taking it.  </P> <P> Another couple also swears by Gatorade. In addition, they claim that getting  extra potassium from bananas works wonders to relieve them from painful leg and  foot cramps.  </P> <P> A 50-year-old man has had restless legs since childhood. "It was four years ago  that I found a way to deal with the problem. It was then that I began taking a  twice-daily dietary supplement of magnesium and calcium. The symptoms have  practically disappeared. My doctor suggested that this might be a placebo  effect, but the simultaneous and unexpected disappearance of my migraine  headaches argues against that," he said.  </P> <P> A vitamin and mineral enthusiast believes that calcium and vitamin C are both  necessary. "When I was pregnant I started taking this combination. Voila -- no  more leg cramps, and I had been plagued for 10 years."  </P> <P> Vitamin E has also been praised. "One capsule two nights in a row takes care of  my restless legs for a month or more."  </P></p>

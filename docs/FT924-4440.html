			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Hunters Armley seeks listing via placing Hunters Armley, the Leeds-based web offset printing company which was established in 1845, is seeking a full listing by way of a Pounds 10.8m private placing of 11.96m shares at 90p each. Based on the placing price, and its enlarged share capital base of 20.4m shares, the group will have a market capitalisation of Pounds 18.3m. Existing shareholders are selling 6.4m shares and 5.56m new shares are being sold to raise Pounds 4.6m net of expenses, which will be used to wipe out debt and fund continuing expansion. Early in 1990 a team led by Mr David Bird, chairman, and Mr Brian Sugden, managing director, backed by the Yorkshire Fund, organised a management buy-out from Parkway (now part of Wace.) Since then operating margins have risen from 6 per cent to 9 per cent and pre-tax profits have grown from Pounds 898,000 in 1990 to Pounds 2.05m in the year to September 30. Dealings in the shares are expected to begin on Monday.</p>

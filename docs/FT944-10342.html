			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Indonesian aircraft rolls out Indonesia's first aircraft to be designed and built by the state-owned PT Industry Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN) was rolled out yesterday in an elaborate ceremony presided over by President Suharto. Development of the N-250, a 70-seater turboprop aircraft 10 years in the making, has been criticised by the World Bank which is urging Indonesia to invest in industries where profitable returns are more certain. There are concerns that it will be difficult to sell the N-250 on the international market. However, Mr B J Habibie, Indonesia's research and technology minister, said yesterday that IPTN, in which Dollars 950m (Pounds 580m) has been invested over the past 18 years, had signed a letter of intent with Gulfstream International Airline of the US for an order of four N-250s and an option on six more. Press reports earlier this year said FFV, a Swedish leasing company, had signed a memorandum of understanding to buy 24 N-250s for delivery in early 1996. In addition, three domestic carriers, Sempati Air, Merpati Air and Bouraq Airlines, yesterday ordered 16 N-250s with an option for 162 more.</p>

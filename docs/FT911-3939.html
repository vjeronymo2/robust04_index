			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Tunisia counts the cost of the Gulf war: Loss of tourism has dealt a serious blow to the ailing economy THE GULF war has dealt a sharp blow to the economy of Tunisia. The loss of foreign income from tourism and decline in domestic employment come at a time when industrial growth had been resuming after three years of drought, locust plagues and severe austerity. President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has pushed through measures aimed at liberalising the management of Tunisia's economy, while maintaining austerity. A budget deficit equivalent to 8 per cent of gross domestic product in 1986 was turned into a surplus of 4 per cent last year but the Ministry of Planning forecasts no increase in the country's GDP this year. The government recognises that austerity is all the more necessary today and has gone ahead with plans to cut five days' pay from all salaried workers. The government expects exports of goods and services to suffer a shortfall of TD850m (Dollars 895m), a figure which rises to more than TD1bn if the loss of loans from Arab funds is included. This year could turn out to be the first since independence when the number of job losses is greater than the number of new jobs. The Ministry of Planning estimates that 51,600 jobs will be lost and 48,000 created - this at a time when 55,000 young Tunisians are entering the labour market every year. The social repercussions are grave. Ever more violent confrontations between the police and Islamic fundamentalist militants from the major opposition party, En Nahda (The Renaissance) has led to a climate in which the promises of greater freedom of expression which accompanied President Ben Ali's assumption of power have all but disappeared. The fallout from the war is expected to cost the balance of payments TD600m. The Tunisian government was quick to react and, three months ago, seized the opportunity of a routine IMF review of the country's position to activate the enlarged facility it had arranged with the Fund in 1988, but never drawn down. The IMF is expected to agree to Tunisia drawing SDR138m (Dollars 190m) - a sum equivalent to its quota with the Fund. Preliminary government estimates give loss of export income and suggest three sectors will be badly affected: Tourism and transport where half of Tunis Air's fleet is grounded - TD470m. This figure is predicated on a 50 per cent decline in foreign visitors during the first six months of the year; Exports of goods - TD330m of which one third is accounted for by textiles; Transfer payments - TD50m, the bulk of which are remittances from Tunisians working abroad. To these figures must be added the loss of TD200m worth of loans from Kuwaiti and Arab development funds which will lead to the delay of major projects. A lower volume of imported capital goods and the decline in local spending will cut the import bill by TD350m, but this will still add TD600m to initial estimates of the balance of payments deficit. The domestic economic consequences of the Gulf war will thus be severe, despite the fact that an exceptionally plentiful rainfall should deliver a very good crop, thus reducing the need to import cereals. This would be all the more welcome as US aid has been cut by three-quarters. The US Congress appeared somehat disgruntled at Tunisia's refusal to join the coalition against Iraq. The benefits Morocco drew from sending troops to the Gulf stand in sharp contrast - Saudi Arabia gave King Hassan Dollars 700m last autumn. Although most sectors of the economy have felt the repercussions of the Gulf war, tourism has been one of the immediate casualties. It accounts for one-fifth of foreign earnings and ensures the livelihood of 800,000 people. To a net loss of 13,500 jobs must be added the pressure on hotel owners to shed labour if the number of foreign visitors does not pick up fast. In the transport sector, job losses will amount to 2,700. The construction industry is also likely to be affected since many new hotels (Tunisia adds 5,000 beds every year) will not get the go-ahead. The manufacturing sector, where only a third of the 15,000 new jobs planned for 1991 will be created, could be further hit by an economic slowdown among major client countries such as France. The Tunisian government has been quick to draw up a list of capital expenditure cuts and increase the price of certain items such as petrol. If tourism picks up faster than expected, the government will be spared the worse. If public frustration grows, however, the risks of social and political unrest will be only too clear.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Eleventh-hour rescue for Expedier EXPEDIER, the floundering ticket and box office computer group, announced an eleventh- hour rescue package yesterday, based on a Pounds 4.5m share placing, capital restructuring, and management revamp. The deal will see Expedier, which has been living off extended bank facilities since 1991, pay Pounds 2.6m for the remaining 50 per cent stake in its ticket sales joint venture with Wembley, owners of the national stadium and box office. Wembley will receive 260m shares, equivalent to an 18 per cent stake, while Expedier will take on the joint venture's debts. Wembley also said yesterday it would not match first half pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.5m in the second half. The shares fell 2 1/2 p to 17p. Expedier's new-look business will be renamed The Ticketing Group, owning the First Call and Keith Prowse ticket agencies, and Space Time Systems, the computerised box office system (BOCS) supplier. Expedier will issue another 495m shares at 1p each on the basis of 18 new shares for every seven held. The cash raised will reduce borrowings - which stood at Pounds 10.5m on December 18 - by Pounds 1m. Mr Richard Templeton, of advisers Richard Fleming, said Expedier would not be able to stay in business without a capital injection. The deal amounted to 'a reconstruction with a severe health warning'. The group remained highly geared, reliant on another full year of non-demand facilities provided by its bankers to meet working capital requirements. It had to meet an outstanding preference dividend payment, and trading conditions, with sluggish West End ticket sales, were 'uncertain'. Expedier was yet to sell Medminster, its furniture hire subsidiary. The rescue package was put together by a consortium including Mr Karl Sydow and Mr Andrew Myers, directors of the former joint venture, now appointed deputy chairman and finance director. Mr Clive Ng, a director of entertainment and real estate companies in the US and Malaysia, provided finance and joined the board as non-executive director along with Wembley director Mr Alex McCrindle. Expedier reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 573,000 (Pounds 1.42m) in the half-year to June 30 on sharply lower turnover of Pounds 3.38m (Pounds 6.29m).</p>

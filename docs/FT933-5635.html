			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Lift taxing burden from companies Sir, I was interested to read the letter from Mr Malcolm Bacchus, 'Companies still weighed down by burden of tax regulations' (August 24). Mr Bacchus pointed out that the Manchester Business School has estimated that an average business spent 20 per cent of its pre-tax profits dealing with company and tax regulations. The question is, will the Treasury react in a positive way to the crusade against red tape which the Department of Trade and Industry, under the guidance of Mr Michael Heseltine, is conducting? From details of the recent Finance Act mentioned by Mr Bacchus this seems a remote possibility. The problem is that the Treasury does not pay for the consequences of its actions; business does. The way to overcome this problem is to give businesses tax rebates on the cost of collecting taxes, based on the results of surveys such as those mentioned above. It is unlikely that the response of the Treasury will be positive until it has to pay for the consequences of its own excesses in the production of red tape.

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Apprentices at BAe and R-R lose jobs pledge APPRENTICES with British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce are for the first time not being given jobs with the companies on completion of their training. New apprenticeships are also unlikely to be offered this autumn. The companies, which have already been reducing their intake of new apprentices, insist they are not turning their back on the apprenticeship system, saying their action is due to the heavy redundancies caused by the contraction of the aerospace and defence industries. BAe has told all 46 of its final-year craft apprentices in its Airbus division at Filton, north Bristol, that it does not expect to be able to offer them jobs. The company recently announced that it was seeking another 450 redundancies at Filton by the end of the year. It said yesterday it did not expect to take on any new apprentices this September at its UK plants. The Airbus division, which employs 5,300 people at Filton, is offering the redundant apprentices advice on job seeking and training credits to the value of Pounds 1,500. It says it will pay for a one-month trial with other companies where there is a realistic chance of a permanent post. Rolls-Royce said yesterday it had told 33 craft and technical apprentices at its Patchway plant in north Bristol that there would not be jobs for them on completion of their training - which in most cases takes three years. But it hoped to place 38 other final-year apprentices. The employment prospects of its apprentices at Derby are under review. The Patchway plant had 6,800 workers at the start of this year and is now down to 6,100 with 300 more jobs to be shed by the end of this year. Rolls-Royce said that because some of the redundancies were now compulsory, itcould not offer jobs to all its apprentices. Those made redundant would be given jobs advice. For the first time in its history, Rolls-Royce does not expect to take on any apprentices this autumn. But it said it was 'absolutely not' turning its back on the apprenticeship system. 'Apprentices are important to our future, but there is in the short term a need to reduce the size of the company to become more competitive in a reduced world market,' it said.</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Fears of over-supply - the new Murayama administration plans to cover income tax cuts with bond issues - are sapping investor confidence and outweighing the impact of the strong yen. Comments last week by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister, that the government will postpone raising the consumption tax to cover the decrease in state revenues following from income tax cuts, hit bond prices. Press reports of an additional fiscal spending package of around Y6,000bn to help the economy, to be covered by deficit covering bonds, have also depressed sentiment. However, the outlook for the economy remains weak, and although many market participants this week will be focusing on the aftermath of the Group of Seven meeting, the yen's strength and economic indicators are expected to point to low inflation and weak demand. According to DKB International, an average dollar/yen exchange rate of Y100 this business year would mean growth would remain at around 1 per cent, domestic wholesale prices would fall by 1 per cent and consumer prices by 0.6 per cent. Private machinery orders for May are expected to fall, indicating a poor outlook for investment, and bank lending for the year to June is also forecast to show a decline.</p>

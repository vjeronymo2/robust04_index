			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (5): Quickening pace of sales - Privatisation THE quickening pace of sales this year under Greece's privatisation programme has come as a relief to the government, but as one official puts it: 'Once you clear away the undergrowth of small disposals, the real dimensions of our task looms much larger.' Privatisation was launched two years ago with the initial aim of selling 27 debt-burdened companies nationalised under Socialist rule. But as the state-controlled banks - with assets that include shipyards, mines and quarries, hotels and insurance companies, joined in - the list of companies to be privatised grew to more than 200. The government also wants to sell minority stakes of up to 49 per cent in state-owned utilities and transport companies. Most post losses every year, the result of weak management and rising costs: administered prices were kept low while payrolls swelled with political appointees. But the most ambitious aspect of Greek privatisation is only now taking shape. Mr Andreas Andrianopoulos, the industry minister and a firm believer in unbundling the state, intends to dispose of about 300 public entities attached to different ministries in the next two years. These range from companies set up to manage industrial projects that never materialised to moribund trading organisations and farm co-operatives. They have managed to survive because, like the utilities, they were a convenient receptacle for patronage appointments. Mr Andrianopoulos has steered a new privatisation law through parliament which removes many hurdles to swift liquidation of non-viable companies. The law also provides a clear legal framework for sales and debt write-offs, which banks and other creditors were reluctant to attempt for fear of future lawsuits. 'It's really more a process of denationalisation than privatisation, because the state is an obstacle to growth,' he said recently. Opposition to Mr Andrianopoulos's scheme comes as much from cabinet colleagues as from boards of directors afraid of losing their jobs or customers anxious to maintain a cosy relationship with a state-controlled producer. Some ministers at first declined to provide lists of companies under their jurisdiction; others sent in a few names scrawled on a sheet of paper. For all the government's avowed commitment to privatising, it is clear that the old etatist mentality still persists. For example, Depa, a utility set up to supervise construction of a pipeline and liquified natural gas terminal for importing Russian and Algerian natural gas to Greece, is to remain state-owned. In theory, the next stage of the Dr250bn (Dollars 1.2bn) project, creating networks for distributing the gas in leading Greek cities, should be open to bids from private companies under the government's policy of making the energy sector more competitive. In practice, the absence of a regulatory framework for power generation rules out broader participation, for the time being. Elsewhere, privatisation is gaining momentum after a slow start. The 1991 budget forecast revenues of more than Dr150bn from sales of nationalised companies, but only Dr10bn was raised. 'Transparency was important, and it took time to get international procedures working in the bureaucratic Greek environment,' says one adviser. However, 22 of the 27 companies offered by the Industrial Reconstruction Organisation (IRO), the socialists' nationalisation umbrella, have now been sold. Buyers have mostly been local competitors rather than foreign investors. The exception was Heracles General Cement, Europe's biggest cement exporter, sold for Dr124bn to a joint venture between Calcestruzzi, the construction arm of Italy's Ferruzzi group, and National Bank of Greece. The participation of National Bank, the country's largest state-owned bank, was seen as essential in order to overcome legal problems caused by the capitalisation of Dr27bn in debt owed by Heracles. The capitalisation was in violation of European Community company law because shareholders were not consulted. If the capitalisation is eventually declared invalid, National Bank will revert to being the largest shareholder in Heracles. Calcestruzzi, with a 52.5 per cent stake in the joint venture, will be responsible for running the company. The state-owned banks between them have sold another 30 companies, again to local rather than foreign buyers. The biggest disposal was that of Eleusis Shipyards, sold by Commercial Bank for Dollars 60m to the Peraticos group, a London-based Greek shipping business. Another three loss-making shipyards, also controlled by state banks, must be sold or shut down over the next few months in order to meet an EC deadline for ending subsidies to the shipbuilding industry. The yards were taken over by the state after an older generation of Greek shipowners pulled out of onshore investment in Greece during the shipping crisis of the early 1980s. Despite a steady flow of repair work and some construction of small vessels for the Greek navy, the yards were kept going through cash infusions from the state banks, with little attention paid to improving productivity. The EC has agreed to the writing off of large amounts of debt; even so, the government is finding it difficult to attract offers. The most attractive target for buyers is the Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation (OTE), the state telecoms monopoly, which is to be partially privatised. A 49 per cent stake will be offered in two stages. With earnings in 1991 of Dr55bn, OTE is one of Greece's most profitable companies, despite operating little more than an old-fashioned telephone network with only a few digital exchanges and a chronic shortage of lines. A new regulatory framework, drawn up with assistance from the EC and international legal experts, will be in place later this year. The government intends to offer a 20-30 per cent stake in OTE to an international operator, who would also take over management, with the remaining percentage being sold through a public offering in Greece and abroad.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Letter: Not the right clock Sir, Now that so many people who contribute to the wealth of Britain by working in the City have to be at their desks by 7 am, is it not right that British Summer Time be abandoned? Previously it was light when I struggled out of bed. Now it is dark and the struggle is therefore even harder. Moreover, my internal clock kept telling me to go back to sleep. Why should the farmers have it all their own way? Martin Essex, 32 Bluebridge Road, Brookmans Park, Hatfield, Herts AL9 7SA</p>

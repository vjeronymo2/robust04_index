			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Paris, Bonn say union on track: Governments struggle to suppress monetary differences after exchange rate reform EUROPEAN Community governments struggled to suppress their economic and monetary disagreements yesterday after allowing their currencies to fluctuate widely in a bid to preserve a semblance of exchange rate co-operation. Despite differences over interest rate policy which brought on the currency crisis, the French and German governments led a number of others in insisting that the agreement by EC finance ministers early yesterday to reform the rules of the Community's tattered exchange rate mechanism would not derail plans for economic and monetary union. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said the next stage of European monetary union would start on schedule next January despite the decision to create fluctuation margins of 15 per cent either way for the eight ERM currencies - with the exception of the D-Mark-Dutch guilder link. 'The temporary widening of bands may appear to be a setback with regard to the high degree of exchange rate stability we are striving for,' he said at a joint press conference with Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president. 'But on the other hand it increases the credibility of the system. The Community must remain a zone of monetary stability in the future.' However, Mr Schlesinger warned that the degree of currency fluctuations would depend on the actions of EC governments, particularly on interest rates. 'The policy of participating countries will, in my view, continue to be geared to keeping the actual swings in exchange rates narrow,' he said. 'The more carefully individual countries use their possible scope for interest rate cuts, the more careful and more moderate the changes in exchange rates will be.' As the French franc and several other currencies came under fresh pressure within their newly widened ERM bands yesterday, a number of EC governments and central banks indicated divergent priorities. Tensions remained evident between France and Germany in particular over interest rate policy, with Mr Schlesinger again refusing to bow to pressure from Germany's EC partners for an early cut in German rates and reiterating his scepticism over progress towards Emu. Senior officials in Brussels and other capitals conceded that yesterday's compromise in Brussels had loosened the constraints of the European Monetary System to a point not far short of allowing all EC currencies to float. 'It is marginally better than floating,' said one Brussels official. Adding to the impression of disarray, the founding fathers of the EMS, former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing and former West German chancellor Helmut Schmidt, issued a joint statement saying the agreement was tantamount to suspending the EMS. 'This solution may offer some practical advantage only if it remains an adjustment phase of limited duration,' they said. 'We ask that this suspension be provisional and that normal functioning of the EMS resume as rapidly as possible.' In Paris, Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, explicitly blamed high German interest rates for the crisis that ended the strong link between the French franc and the D-Mark. But he put a brave face on the weekend compromise, saying it had prevented a devaluation of the franc and ensured the survival of the ERM. 'The European Monetary System remains in working order with a considerable loosening, but its founding principles remain in effect,' Mr Balladur said. The prime minister said he had favoured a temporary withdrawal of the D-Mark from the ERM to ease the strains on the currency system, but had agreed to a widening of the fluctuation bands to preserve the process of European integration. By contrast Mr Waigel said there had been no suggestion at the EC meeting that Germany should leave the EMS. At his Bonn press conference, Mr Waigel gave a strong hint that he expected further interest rate cuts from the Bundesbank after the results achieved in Brussels. 'With these decisions, the Bundesbank can continue its policy of step-by-step interest reductions without pressure from outside,' he said. However, Mr Schlesinger, who said the Bundesbank had had to cope with speculative inflows of some DM60bn (Pounds 23.5bn) in July - nearly half of this last Friday as the franc came under renewed pressure - said he could not forecast what the bank might do. Casting doubts on progress towards Emu, he said: 'We have to consider to what extent convergence exists in the EMS. As far as Germany is concerned, it doesn't' THE ERM: PICKING UP THE PIECES Pages 2 and 3 ERM bands produce sort of harmony British exporters take positive view Germany industry braces for stronger D-Mark Balladur blames crisis on high German rates Page 13 School of hard knocks Editorial Comment Observer Major on the ERM, Page 14; Lex, Page 14; Bonds, Page 21; Currencies, Page 23; World stocks, Page 29; London stocks, Page 32</p>

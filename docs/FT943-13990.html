			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: BT BT may retreat into its bunker following a survey showing that several of its largest shareholders have a poor opinion of its top management. The company may seek to comfort itself with the notion that the survey, conducted by its stockbroker Cazenove, was clumsily handled and so not a true reflection of opinion. Alternatively, it could lambast some shareholders' comments for being flippant or criticise those interviewed who did not know the names of top managers as ignorant. But such a reaction to the survey, which was conducted over the past fortnight, would be a mistake. BT has long suffered from a fortress mentality, in part because it is still making the long journey from state-owned monopoly to private-sector corporation. Indeed, one point made by some shareholders is that BT is aloof. The right reaction would be to lower its drawbridge and make a determined effort to address investors' concerns. Although the survey's results have not been published, those who took part have spoken about their views. One message is that some are confused over who is running the company. Sir Iain Vallance is both chairman and chief executive, but Mr Michael Hepher, group managing director, is seen by some investors as effectively the chief executive. BT is such a huge organisation that it will never be possible to say that a single person runs it. But its vastness is also a reason for allocating responsibilities as clearly as possible. If investors are confused, BT must enlighten them.</p>

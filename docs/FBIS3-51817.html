CARENA intends to gather together  about 100 participants in Port-au-Prince on 6 and 7 February,  including five representatives of the legally recognized  political parties, as well as representatives of the  socioprofessional and religious sectors.    The organizers' optimism is not dampened by the fact that  most institutions have not yet designated their official  representatives. According to Adyjeangardy, spokesman for the  organizing committee, the parliament is ready to legitimize the  resolutions of the CARENA conference on 6 and 7 February. He  asserts that some senators have already advised CARENA of their  intention to ratify all preparations for the conference, which  should attract more than 1,000 [as heard] participants. [passage  omitted].    CARENA also asserts that the countries called the Friends of  Haiti have welcomed its demand for postponement of reinforced  sanctions against Haiti. CARENA is satisfied with the decision  of the country's friends of the UN secretary general to  favorably answer its request to postpone reinforcement of the  sanctions against Haiti, while awaiting participation by all  sectors in the national conference in Haiti on 6 and 7 February.    Contacts at the highest level have been made with the United  States, France, Venezuela, Canada, the Vatican, the UN and OAS  secretaries general, and the current president of the Security  Council for this position to be adopted and maintained following  the efforts of CARENA, which will continue so that future  resolutions of the national conference can be executed at the  national and international level.</p>

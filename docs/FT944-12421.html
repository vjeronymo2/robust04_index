			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Japan and US miss glass pact deadline Japan and the US have failed to finalise an accord to give US manufacturers better access to the Japanese market for flat glass. Negotiators from the two sides met into the early hours of this morning but could not agree on details of an accord that was agreed in principle a month ago. They had set yesterday as the deadline for wrapping up the agreement. 'We made real progress, but there are still technical and practical problems to resolve,' said an official of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry. He indicated negotiations would be re-sumed though no date had yet been set for another round of talks. Lack of agreement by the deadline could prompt the US into taking unilateral trade action, possibly sanctions, against Japan's flat glass market. Negotiations had been going on since last Wednesday. Mr Hideaki Kumano, vice-minister for international trade and industry, voiced the hope yesterday that the two sides might still settle the glass talks by the deadline. The talks are a remnant of the bilateral framework negotiations in which Japan and the US reached a partial agreement a month ago. At that time, the issue of flat glass, as well as Japan's market for vehicles and vehicle parts, was postponed when Japan and the US announced they had reached agreement in four of the five sectors targeted in the negotiations. An accord on the glass market had been reached 'in principle,' the Japanese government said at the time, leaving only the details to be worked out within 30 days. Mr Steve Farrar, director of international business for Guardian Industries, a US glass maker, said yesterday most differences had been resolved. As with other US-Japan disputes, stalemate has emerged over US efforts to pin down specific criteria to measure progress. 'We want to avoid having a situation where importers could buy token amounts and never become serious customers,' he said. 'We want to be sure that what is being measured is substantial business relationships.' The US claims that Japan's flat glass market, which is the second largest in the world at Dollars 4.5bn a year, is closed to foreign suppliers. This is because of the dominance of three large domestic producers which have very tightly controlled distribution arrangements with the industry's wholesalers. US makers have only a 1 per cent share of the Japanese market, compared with more than 25 per cent in Europe and Latin America, the US says. Under these circumstances, the US would like to see more procurement of US-made glass for facilities owned by the government in addition to greater market access in the private sector. The Japanese side has claimed that its market, with imports amounting to 12 per cent, compares favourably to that in the US, where imports are a meagre 5 per cent and in Europe, where foreign-made flat glass accounts for 17 per cent of the market. The Japanese government has been reluctant to interfere in what it considers a matter for the private sector. The basic stance of the government is that if US companies want a larger share of the Japanese market they should raise their competitiveness.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Arts: Frederick Douglass - New Jersey State Opera Newark is a romantic and vital place, easily reached from New York by overground or underground train, architecturally explorable, ethnically diverse. The biggest Portuguese community outside Lisbon lives there. Italians abound. And opera in Newark is attended by an eager audience in which English is the last language overheard. The only big new opera to have been staged in or around New York this season is Ulysses Kay's Frederick Douglass, which was put on by the New Jersey State Opera for a single performance in Newark's Town Hall. It's a grand Roman theatre, seating 2,700. One of the company's specialities is verismo - Iris, Lodoletta, Zanetto, L'amico Fritz - performed under a conductor, Alfredo Silipigni, who knows the traditions. Another is loyalty to singers abandoned by the Met: it was in Newark that I heard Birgit Nilsson sing her last Turandot, with Licia Albanese as Liu; and an Attila with Jerome Hines. This season a Carmen with Fiorenza Cossotto was billed, but it fell through. So did the second performance of a star-cast Lombardi, Bergonzi the tenor; I made the trek to Newark only to find a 'Performance cancelled' sign on the door. Money had run out, as in this country it is running out for musical enterprise of all kinds. But Frederick Douglass reached the stage, if only for a single performance. The Mayor of Newark, Sharpe James,appeared as a super. I wish I could write that it was a triumph; instead, I can find nothing to praise. I thought it an incompetent opera. Douglass - a hundred years ago this identifying would not be necessary - was an escaped slave whose oratory and whose published Narrative (Penguin keeps it in print) stirred both the US and Europe. The Narrative tells of a youth whose free, active mind rejected the notion that he and his fellows should be lifelong a white man's owned chattels. William Garrison, the great abolitionist, wrote truly that 'he who can peruse it without a tearful eye, a heaving breast, an afflicted spirit, must have a flinty heart.' David Blake's Toussaint, Thea Musgrave's Harriet, and Anthony Davis's X have given differing examples of how such matter can be more worthily treated. By comparison with those operas, Frederick Douglass seems cheap and unworthy. Kay and his librettist, Donald Dorr, concocted a clumsy, long-winded drama - untrue to history, crudely and conventionally 'operatic', wholly unconvincing - about how Douglass in his last years, ambassador to Haiti, was brought low by a conspiracy of Washingtonians resentful of a black man's eminence. Donizetti and Verdi would had have rejected it as ineffectual. The libretto is poetastry, and Kay's music drones on and on in Puccinian arioso without Puccini's command of melodic gesture. Kevin Maynor sang the title role, and the veteran dramatic soprano Klara Barlow was Mrs Douglass. Should we hail the show as homage to an elderly black composer (Kay was born in 1917), or deplore it as time, money and talent spent on something artistically worthless and unworthy?</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Arts: Apres Gatt, the east moves in - Cannes Film Festival Gerard Depardieu is in the nude. Terence Stamp is in drag. And Catherine Deneuve is in a million-franc dress on the Palais steps. Who says that Europe cannot put on a show without Hollywood's help? This is the first Cannes Film Festival since the notorious Gatt round when the French told Hollywood that they did not want its celluloid. Would the Americans, having lost that important game in world movie diplomacy, refuse to turn up for the 'friendly' on the Cote d'Azur? At first, entente-watchers were hopeful. Clint Eastwood signed on as jury president. US films would open and close the festival: the Coen brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy and John Waters' Serial Mom respectively. And the popular if costly American Pavilion - risk debt for a Coca-Cola, file for Chapter Eleven if you have a hamburger and fries - would be back in place on the sunny Croisette. Then the bad news dribbled in. All but two major studios were staying away. The only megastar who might come was Bruce Willis for something called Pulp Fiction. And the only other American film in competition would be Alan Rudolph's Mrs Parker And The Vicious Circle. With Hudsucker this last has formed a pair of ornately empty folies de style for the first days, with Jennifer Jason Leigh twice bidding to be the most tiresome actress in Cannes. In the Coens' film she does a feature-length Katharine Hepburn imitation, while Tim Robbins and Paul Newman search for their chalk-marks in the vast Deco-style sets. From the makers of Barton Fink  - which cleaned up major awards at Cannes two years ago - here is another gaudy, eccentric period piece. But this one has no inner life. The get-rich fairy tale, a pastiche of the New Deal cinema of Capra and Sturges, has whizz-kid Robbins wooing tycoon Newman by inventing the hoola-hoop. (All resemblances to real history . . .) But Fate has some nasty tricks in store, for both movie and audience: not least Miss Leigh's arrival to disrupt potential hoop-la with her grating party-piece. In Mrs Parker Leigh is Mrs Parker, alias Dorothy, and she has studied the recordings. The voice is an acidic back-of-the-nose drawl and soon becomes, like the film, deeply wearing. The famed wits of the Algonquin Round Table come on like a pack of smart alecks dressed by Cecil Beaton. And the script is in a well-known bio-pic mould, that of the 'Dorothy, have you met Alexander (Woollcott) and Charles (McArthur) and Heywood (Broun)?' variety. Only Campbell Scott as Robert (Benchley) beats the odds, offering a quietly brilliant facsimile complete with funny monologues. So. Is sulking Hollywood deliberately sending its underlings to the party? If so, what better chance for Europe to answer back with quality? But there lies the rub. Apres Gatt, is there a European cinema worth protecting, let alone showcasing? Or have it and Cannes become a series of rituals in search of a meaning? The annual Gerard Depardieu event has been Giuseppe Tornatore's gaunt and gimmicky A Simple Formality, a Borgesian fable of the after-life with the usual scenes of Gerard in the nude. The annual French costume epic is Patrice Chereau's lumbering La Reine Margot. And the annual European star emigrates in despair event is Priscilla Queen Of The Desert, an Australian drag comedy with our own Terence Stamp drowning his sorrows in mascara. The good news at Cannes so far comes from neither Europe nor the US. It comes from Canada with Exotica and Taiwan with Eat Drink Man Woman. The first is a wonderful puzzle-picture from Atom Egoyan, the young mage of Family Viewing and Calendar. A plot initially as baffling as a Rubik cube - what can link the destinies of a widowed accountant, a strip-club owner and an immigrant gay petshop assistant? - is snapped piece by piece into shape and lucidity. Egoyan's camera has the slyest grace in modern cinema, but its arabesques are never vapid. They follow the curves of a plot about identity, passion, and voyeurism. And they give the metaphorical settings - nightclub like a jungle, petshop like an aquarium of the mind - their own life and sensuality. Ang Lee made the popular A Wedding Banquet, that AC/DC comedy of sexual errors. Now he follows it with another masterpiece of misadventure. Eat Drink Man Woman has a plot as simple as its title. A retired master chef; his three daughters; and the attempts of all four to find life and love outside the family circle. The running gag is the 'Sunday dinner torture ritual,' as one girl dubs Dad's weekly delirium of kitchenwork which ends in a table groaning with carp, squid, ducks, noodles and enough Won Ton Soup to nourish all of Taipei. Can one madman's wooden spoon keep a family together? It could have a soap opera - or in this case soup opera - but it is much better. The three sisters are picked out with a compassionate humour worthy (almost) of Chekhov and the father is an indelible portrait of vocation ageing into monomania. But then the east has virtually taken over film festivals in this decade. Already those who have seen it in advance are tipping Zhang Yimou's Live] for Golden Palm. And Mr Zhang can also lay claim to the most startling and resonant sight on the Cannes seafront. Towering over the Croisette is the poster for the film he is now shooting - Shanghai Triad - which features a ten-foot-long opium pipe blowing real smoke. Is this image telling us festival goers to go on dreaming our beautiful dreams? Or is it telling America that the new world order is 'east is best' and that Hollywood may soon have to insert that in its pipe ane smoke it?</p>

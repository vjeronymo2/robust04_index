			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: GE's finance arm expands through Dollars 525m GNA buy GE CAPITAL, the fast-growing financial services arm of General Electric, is to expand into the wholesale annuity and mutual fund business through the purchase of GNA Corporation from forest products group Weyerhaeuser for Dollars 525m in cash. Weyerhaeuser will assume GNA's outstanding Dollars 225m of borrowings. GNA writes and markets tax-deferred annuities and wholesales proprietary and third-party mutual funds through financial services companies, such as commercial banks and savings and loans. Mr Gary Wendt, chief executive of GE Capital, said that GNA was a leader in 'one of the fastest-growing segments of financial services - pre-retirement savings plans. As ageing baby-boomers augment their retirement savings, this market could more than double in size before the year 2000.' For Tacoma-based Weyerhaeuser, the deal is a further stage in the refocusing of the company. It instituted a wide-ranging 'business improvement plan' in 1989, which involved shedding peripheral assets and raising the financial returns of its core businesses. GNA, founded in 1980 and bought by Weyerhaeuser three years later, sold products last year with a gross value of Dollars 3.2bn. It contributed Dollars 421m, or about 5 per cent, of Weyerhaeuser's 1991 group revenues. Weyerhaeuser said yesterday it had not been offering the business around, but was willing to sell because GE Capital would provide the financial resources GNA needed to take advantage of its market position. Weyerhaeuser was not planning to sell its remaining financial services operations, in mortgage lending and real estate development. With assets of more than Dollars 80bn, GE Capital is the second-largest non-bank finance company in the US, with 20 businesses ranging from aircraft leasing to third-party credit card services. Over the past two years it has begun a significant expansion into the European and Asian markets. Mr Patrick Welch, chief executive of GNA, will continue to manage the company. He said yesterday GE Capital had assured him that the business would remain an independent, stand-alone operation. GE Capital declined to comment yesterday on market rumours that it is also negotiating to buy the loan portfolio of Westinghouse Electric's troubled financial services arm. Westinghouse announced plans to quit financial services last November.</p>

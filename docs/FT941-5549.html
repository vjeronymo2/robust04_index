			<p>940305 FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Conflicting information on house prices - At a Glance House prices increased by 2.2 per cent last month, the biggest monthly gain since September 1988, according to Halifax, the largest mortgage lender. The figures conflict with Nationwide, the country's second largest building society, which said that UK house prices on average fell by 0.6 per cent in February compared with January. Prices are still well below their 1989 peak. The societies are in closer agreement on the annual rate of increase, with Nationwide reporting 3.2 per cent and Halifax 3.8 per cent. Both are forecasting an increase in house prices of 5 per cent by the end of the year.</p>

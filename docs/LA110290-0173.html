			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CELLULAR FIRM SET TO MARKET NEW PRODUCT  </P> <P> Universal Cellular Inc., a start-up cellular equipment manufacturer, plans to  introduce a new product designed to compete with pocket-sized portable phone  technology offered by several U.S. and Japanese companies.  </P> <P> Universal Cellular said Thursday that it has awarded a $5-million advertising  account to a Minneapolis ad agency, McElligott Wright Morrison White, which was  founded recently by several former top executives at the Chiat/Day/Mojo agency  in New York.  </P> <P> Peter McCoy, vice president of marketing for Universal Cellular, said the  company has also signed a joint-venture agreement with a "major" Japanese  company to distribute the unidentified product outside North America. Motorola  Inc., NEC Corp. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. are the major manufacturers of  pocket-size mobile phones.  </P> <P> "We're ecstatic that MWMW has agreed to handle this account," McCoy said. "The  amount shows that we're serious about the market."  </P> <P> McCoy said the cellular product is a pocket-sized device "that is more than a  phone." He said the company has been developing the proprietary cellular  product for 18 months, but he declined to reveal more details about the  product.  </P> <P> Universal Cellular's chief executive is James Wohl, a cable television industry  veteran and former president of West Hawaii Cable Vision Inc.  </P> <P> "This is a tremendously exciting project for us," said Tony Wright, president  of MWMW and an ad veteran who worked on the Energizer's popular Bunny  advertising campaign.  </P> <P> Wright said the Universal portable phones would compete with products in the  emerging personal communications network market, a cellular technology that  would enable cordless office phones to be taken outside the office.  </P> <P> Such pocket phones could allow workers to travel large distances, such as to  and from home, and be in constant contact with a telephone.  </P> <P> The Anaheim firm said the product will be sold internationally and displayed at  an industry trade show in January in Las Vegas. The product's introduction date  has not been set.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lech Walesa, president of the Republic of Poland,  met Latvia's Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs today. After the  talks the Latvian prime minister told reporters about what was  discussed during the meeting with the Polish president.    [Begin Birkavs recording] The Polish president's visit is a  new stage in Latvian-Polish relations. There is a mutual desire  to make our relations considerably more active in two main  spheres -- security and economy. In the security sphere, a  deeper military cooperation is meant. We have agreements which  have already been concluded between the ministries of defense.  Deeper military cooperation means cooperation within the  framework of the Union of Baltic Sea Countries, cooperation  between the Baltic region and the (Wyszogrod) region, and, of  course, the development of bilateral relations between Latvia  and Poland in the security context.    We also discussed the problem of the Kaliningrad region  where  there an is extremely large concentration of armed forces, and  about which the world knows practically very little at the  moment.    In the sphere of the economy we discussed our opportunities.  So then, we are waiting for a Polish trade visit, an  exhibition. We are waiting for the Polish prime minister's  visit to Latvia. We discussed development of a transport  corridor which is extremely necessary, including reciprocal  ferry transport between Liepaja and Szczecin or Liepaja and  other ports, Polish ports.    Very good foundations have been created for Latvian-Polish  relations, both legal foundations and also personal foundations  in relations between the heads of the states.    Mr. Walesa said: If I were once again to make a revolution,  I would not make a mistake which I made in Poland. I would  begin privatization much sooner, I would carry out it much more  vigorously, and I would begin with large rather than small  enterprises.    I think Mr. Walesa answered precisely the question of  whether  the Latvian government is acting correctly when it is beginning  a vigorous privatization process, or not. I think that this is  Polish support for the Latvian Government. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARIZONA'S CHAOTIC POLITICS: BLACK EYES, DEAD BURROS AND AUDACITY;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: IMPEACHED FORMER GOV. EVAN MECHAM IS RUNNING AGAIN. AT THE SAME  TIME, A NEW WAVE OF ISSUE-ORIENTED POLITICIANS IS EMERGING.  </P> <P> It is politics as usual in Arizona.  </P> <P> Bob Barnes, a conservative Republican running for governor, has challenged his  counterparts to submit to lie-detector tests on a variety of unsubstantiated  items he regularly alleges -- ties to organized crime and dishonesty the most  discreet among them. He offered to recommend good polygraph examiners.  </P> <P> Sam Steiger, a one-time horse-trader and five-time congressman with a fondness  for red suspenders, is billing his gubernatorial campaign as "old Sam's last  roundup" and seriously downplaying his past, which includes an overturned  conviction for theft by extortion and the controversial shooting of two burros.  </P> <P> Former Gov. Evan Mecham, impeached in 1988 halfway through his first term, is  running again, still blaming unnamed "power brokers" for his unprecedented fall  from office and vowing that 10,000 members of a conservative "Mecham Militia"  will march him to the governor's chair.  </P> <P> And Fife Symington, a wealthy real estate developer, has dispensed with party  unity and declared war on Mecham -- with the approval of former Sen. Barry  Goldwater Sr., the legendary conservative who by today's Arizona standards  would be a pretty fair moderate.  </P> <P> With a flair that is becoming almost predictable, Arizona Republicans are  celebrating what they call diversity and what gleeful Democrats call  fratricide. In a state that is frequently -- and erroneously -- thought of as a  Republican stronghold, the 1990 elections are promising to be as subtle as a  shoot-out here on high-rise-lined Central Avenue.  </P> <P> "They're going to make us out as idiots and ready for the fruit farm," Mecham's  longtime aide Max Hawkins groused recently.  </P> <P> But if Arizona politics is in part an exercise in chaos, it is also a  demonstration of the changing interests of a maturing Sun Belt state.  </P> <P> A new generation of politicians is hoping to appeal to swarms of young  high-tech professionals. In contrast to the perception of conservatism and the  growth-at-any-cost imperative of past years, Arizonans are rallying around the  complex issues of the environment, transportation woes and struggling schools.  </P> <P> "We're starting to realize -- no offense -- that we don't want to be another  Los Angeles," said Michael C. Crusa, state director for U.S. Sen. Dennis  DeConcini (D-Ariz.)  </P> <P> There is also a bipartisan urge to salve the wounds of the last several years  -- and there are many.  </P> <P> A years-long economic slump has battered the state's ego and threatens to dry  up its bank accounts. A series of political misfortunes have tarnished its  image: There was Mecham's impeachment, and the nationally aired debate over his  cancellation of a paid holiday honoring civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther  King Jr. Then came the collapse of the savings and loan empire of Phoenix-based  Charles Keating and allegations that the state's two senators pressured federal  regulators to go easy on Keating.  </P> <P> "We have a black eye and a bloody nose," said pollster Earl de Berge, whose  surveys have found widespread dissatisfaction with the state's political  leadership. "Our image has gone right into the toilet."  </P> <P> While they rank well behind Republicans in voter registration, Democrats here  are more optimistic than they have been in years -- and the stakes this year  are higher than they have been in a decade. Arizona stands to gain one and  perhaps two congressional seats in 1992, and the party that emerges the victor  this year will be able to draw the boundary lines of those and other seats.  National party leaders from both sides have promised to make Arizona a  well-financed battleground.  </P> <P> Ask most Arizona politicians and they swear they would rather trudge through a  low-key contest. "The passion this year clearly is to stop having Arizona be a  subject for one-liners on the Carson show," said former Phoenix Mayor Terry  Goddard, the leading Democratic candidate for governor.  </P> <P> But spice appears to be a perennial ingredient in the mix, a reflection in part  of the independent streak the state has long cultivated. Where else could a man  who was impeached by a Legislature led by his own party run again and have a  better-than-long-shot chance of winning the nomination?  </P> <P> There is, regularly, an almost purposeful contrariness. For example, while  other states are clamping down on gun ownership, Arizona's Legislature is  considering loosening restrictions.  </P> <P> "The only thing that binds everyone in Arizona is independent Western thought  -- you can't tell me not to buy a gun, you can't tell me how to drive a car,"  said Crusa.  </P> <P> The recent right-wing bent to the state's politics, however, seems to have  arisen more because of the silence of more moderate voices than an actual  increase in conservatives. Pollster De Berge said that a recent survey  indicated that fewer Arizonans consider themselves ultra-conservative since the  Mecham tumult.  </P> <P> This year, following a pattern established throughout the 1980s, Arizona will  grow at a rate more than double that of the nation as a whole -- faster even  than California. According to statistics gathered by Arizona-based Valley  National Bank, more than 800,000 people moved to Arizona between 1980 and 1985;  by the end of this year, the population is expected to reach 3.7 million. Once  here, new residents have been extremely mobile and apolitical, denying  themselves roots and denying politicians any strong sense of where they want to  be led.  </P> <P> But many civic leaders argue that they see the hastening of a progressive  movement in the state, with the first signs an increased interest in the  environment and in activist neighborhood organizations. Hence, the candidates  for governor are playing to such attitudes and deliberately focusing on  Arizona's future, not its recent past.  </P> <P> All but one, that is -- Mecham, predictably. Hip-deep in the hubbub again,  making his sixth run at the governorship, the slightly built, bespectacled  former car dealer betrays no sense of calamity. Traveling from the piney  reaches of northern Arizona to the desert towns of the south, he is following  the same path he did four years ago when he won the governorship by mounting a  low-key campaign while other candidates slammed each other mercilessly.  </P> <P> Mecham was removed from office in April, 1988, on grounds of misusing public  funds and obstructing justice. Later, he was acquitted of a separate criminal  charge of failing to disclose a $350,000 campaign loan. His departure turned  the state over to then-Secretary of State Rose Mofford, a Democrat who earlier  this year decided not to run for a full term.  </P> <P> Most times, Mecham, 65, keeps to his major campaign themes -- no new taxes,  cuts in state spending, strict anti-drug laws, and an emphasis on conservative  "family issues." But his mix of bite and bitterness is never far from the  surface.  </P> <P> "Sure, I'm not a perfect candidate," he told several dozen Republicans the  other day at a noontime lunch forum. "I'm not perfect and when I was in the  ring with all of the detractors from the outside throwing rocks, it was easy to  see that Mecham wasn't perfect.  </P> <P> "But golly, it's fun now," he said, his face losing its smile. "It's just real,  real comfortable to have half a dozen more people in the ring now, and guess  what? There are no perfect candidates! And I'll be darned if the majority isn't  going to say, well, old Mecham is perfecter than the others and I'm going to  win this election."  </P> <P> Despite his efforts, the kinds of comments that marked his abbreviated tenure  as governor occasionally arise -- most recently when a small Phoenix newspaper  quoted Mecham as saying that the state's attorney general and a long-time  nemesis, Bob Corbin, was "one of" Arizona's drug lords. Though Mecham denied  using those words, Corbin threatened to sue. "A font of endless shame and  embarrassment," the Arizona Republic called Mecham.  </P> <P> But Mecham has continued to find some success running as a populist against  insiders and, at least for the primary in September, Mecham is not out of the  race by any means. Polls show him with the support of 12% to 14% of the  electorate, but most experts believe him to be twice as strong. And with five  Republican candidates running, it might not take much more to win.  </P> <P> "He has a good hold on 20%," said pollster De Berge. "There are enough people  in the Republican primary that 20% to 25% can win."  </P> <P> But few other than Mecham and his supporters give the former governor any  chance of winning a general election.  </P> <P> Republican Symington and Democrat Goddard are two candidates in the race  reflective of the new breed of politicians rising here. Generationally and  stylistically, they are far removed from the Mecham-inspired image of the last  several years.  </P> <P> Symington, 44, is a political novice and ideological moderate whose career as a  developer is already being used against him by Democrats playing to  environmentally conscious voters. He has been running for a year, has won the  endorsement of Goldwater and wants to help Republican Party politics recover  from what he calls "a total loss of dignity."  </P> <P> Goddard, a year younger, won election to his fourth term as mayor of largely  Republican Phoenix last October and is running in the first partisan race of  his career. In a state where rural and urban friction is widespread, his  challenge will be to overturn suspicions about him in areas outside his Phoenix  base, political experts say.  </P> <P> Rather than enunciate specifics, Goddard has spent much of his time traveling  areas of the state where he is not well known, seeking advice from local  representatives. It is not always successful; at a recent Flagstaff forum he  appeared unfamiliar with two of the first issues brought up by questioners.  </P> <P> Both candidates have struck moderate tones, decrying the controversies of the  Mecham years.  </P> <P> Goddard, at present, has no serious opposition. But besides Mecham, Symington  faces a troublesome challenge from Steiger, whose curmudgeonly image is far  from Symington's slick and upper-class persona.  </P> <P> Steiger, who ran for governor in 1982 as a Libertarian, has vulnerabilities  that in a less-forgiving state would have knocked him from contention. While  serving as a congressman in 1975, for example, he shot and killed two burros he  claimed had attacked him. More than a few eyebrows were raised when it was  learned he had shot the animals in the rear.  </P> <P> He was convicted seven years later for abusive language toward a patrolman who  stopped him for speeding twice in three days. And, most recently, a conviction  for theft by extortion -- arising from an alleged threat to a parole board  member -- was overturned by the Arizona Court of Appeals.  </P> <P> "Colorful is the kindest adjective," he said of himself.  </P> <P> But he remains a winsome and witty campaigner who says his motivation is to run  against the political consultants and image-makers who have come to dominate  politics, an approach that some politicians believe could be attractive.  </P> <P> The two other Republican candidates, longtime Maricopa County Supervisor Fred  Koory and state legislator Bob Barnes, have been less successful to date.  </P> <P> With divisive issues such as abortion yet to be thoroughly debated, Republicans  are openly worried that the primary may so damage their nominee that Goddard  will win by default. But no one here is taking bets on anything.  </P> <P> "If we've learned anything in the past half-dozen years," said Goddard,  shrugging off optimism, "it's that we've got one of the most volatile political  situations in the nation."  </P></p>

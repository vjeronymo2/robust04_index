			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 12 (BTA) -- A protocol on the 21st  session which the Mixed Intergovernmental Bulgarian-Iraqi  Commission on Economic, Industrial and Trade Cooperation  completed in Sofia was signed here today by Finance Minister  Stoyan Aleksandrov and Iraq's Agriculture Minister Dr. Bashir  'Alwan Hammadi. The commission considered the state of  bilateral economic, commercial and industrial and research  cooperation and the prospects for its development in a way  consistent with the UN Security Council resolutions.    The document insists that Bulgaria be included among the  first recipients of Iraqi repayments on state and corporate  loans after the embargo is lifted, with compensation for the  losses and the right to complete unfinished construction and  other projects. It is insisted that the debt be repaid in  convertible currency or through the delivery of crude oil at  international market prices.    Iraq does not contest Bulgaria's receivables. The Iraqis  suggested a draft agreement on trade, economic, research and  technological cooperation to replace the bilateral agreement on  economic and technological cooperation which was signed on  February 12, 1986 and expired on February 13, 1991.    After the signing of the document, Mr. Aleksandrov expressed  the wish that the embargo against Iraq be lifted as soon as  possible so that contacts between the two countries could be  normalized. He said that in compliance with Article 50 of the  UN Charter, Bulgarian diplomacy has consulted the Security  Council with regard to a solution of its special economic  problems arising from the world body's resolution, but the  request has not been granted. "Turkey and Jordan have already  received such facilitations, but we will keep trying," Mr.  Aleksandrov said. "All the more so since Bulgaria has the moral  right (to such facilitation), being a country which suffered  substantial losses from the observance of the embargo at a  period of economic hardship."</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Tapie in courtroom battle Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French businessman and politician, yesterday renewed his legal battle against Credit Lyonnais, the troubled state-owned bank to which he owes an estimated FFr1.2bn (Pounds 140m). In a packed courtroom of the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris, Mr Tapie's lawyers argued that Credit Lyonnais should be forced to stick by the terms of a deal it reached with him in March this year to repay his loans over five years. Credit Lyonnais argues the agreement is void because he did not supply the necessary expert opinions in time to support the high value he claimed for the assets against which the accord was secured. The bank already has custody of many of Mr Tapie's assets, including shares, his furniture collection, his yacht and his house in Paris. Valuations suggest they may be worth substantially less than his debts, with one putting them at FFr300m. Judgment is expected in several weeks.</p>

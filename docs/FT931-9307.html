			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Arts: Weston and Petrucciani - Jazz Randy Weston was once the beatnik's dream musician. A cohort of Art Blakey's during the ferment of the 1950s New York hard bop scene, he moved to Tangiers in the early 1960s where he opened a nightclub. Here, presumably in a fug of kif, dark tobacco and stream of consciousness, Burroughs and Bowles would settle in to listen to the lanky American pianist in the company of bluesmen, Congolese singers, jamming with Moroccan percussionists. Now that world music is finding a more popular place in jazz, a UK tour from one of the most colourful crossover pioneers is something of a treat. Supplemented by three Gnaoua musicians of Morocco, who appear in a national dress of dreadlocks, mitre-style headgear and multi-coloured aprons, Weston's similarly exotic quintet of reeds, trombone, bass and African percussion, is a feast for the eyes and ears. Though the line-up changes throughout the set, the pattern of swaying rhythm set up by the sonorous string bass of Stafford James and Neil Clarke's African congas is constant. On to this lapping wave of sound Talib Kibwe engraves a melody with searing soprano and a rhythmically intense alto, Benny Powell pushing in, ostinato, with a rumbling trombone. Weston, directing proceedings from the stool, looks on beneficently, altering the dynamics of the ensemble with percussive phrases and cross rhythm runs. The Gnaouas, seated and somewhat bemused by the Queen Elizabeth Hall's enthusiasm for their chanted prayers to ancestral saints, belt out a song form that builds in impetus to the sound of castanets and African bass (or hajouj). Joined by Weston's singular technique, which takes the piano far away from its European roots, it makes a heady concoction, concluding in the Gnaoua's traditional folk tunes Sidi Moussa and Lalla Mira, the Moroccans charmed to their feet by Kibwe's seductive soprano. In stark contrast to the animated exoticism of one of music's tallest pianists, the previous night at the QEH saw Michel Petrucciani, less than a third Weston's size, improvising on an entirely American theme. Promenade with Duke (Blue Note CDP 7805902) is the new solo outing with the Frenchman putting his stamp on Strayhorn/Ellington standards such as 'Take the A Train', 'Lush Life' and 'In A Sentimental Mood'. Precariously balanced on the very edge of his stool, two tiny crutches cast on the floor behind, Petrucciani ought to appear vulnerable alone on the stand. He doesn't, but if the sight of him still makes for compulsive viewing so too does his sound, which teems off the right hand side of the keyboard in cheeky quotes and clever cadenzas which never quite run out of notes. His thick distinctive lines are embroidered with a deft right hand on to a close weave of chords laid down by the left. Intricate squiggles are drawn across a strongly independent rhythm and blue notes smeared in. 'Caravan' veered dangerously from the exotic to jolly showtime before neatly moving into 'Satin Doll' and finally closing with an impromptu stop-time, finger clicking audience participation piece. The Randy Weston African Rhythms tour continues to Leeds (Feb 18), Manchester (Feb 19), Birmingham (Feb 20) and Bradford (Feb 21). Spon- sored by the Arts Council's Contemporary Music Network</p>

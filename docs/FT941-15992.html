			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Storehouse and Laura Ashley sales increase Further evidence that retailers enjoyed a good Christmas came yesterday from Storehouse, which announced a 13 per cent sales increase on the year before, and Laura Ashley, which said sales were up 18 per cent. Mr Keith Edelman, chief executive of Storehouse, said its BHS, Mothercare and Blazer chains all achieved strong sales increases in the six weeks to Christmas, leading to an overall like-for-like increase - excluding the effect of store openings and closures - of 13 per cent. Sales in BHS's Christmas shop, of children's clothing and of lingerie were particularly strong. But he admitted gross margins were down slightly as a result of 'additional promotional activity', although 'profitability over the period was fully in line with expectations'. The like-for-like sales increase for the year to date was now ahead of the 5 per cent reported in November, he added. Laura Ashley, the clothing and furnishings retailer and manufacturer, said like-for-like sales in the UK and Ireland for the eight weeks to Christmas were up 17.6 per cent. Like-for-like sales in North America increased 17.5 per cent. Continental European sales however, were down 2.5 per cent. Mr Jim Maxmin, chief executive, said the UK rise was in line with expectations, and achieved with little discounting. The increase in North America was flattered by a poor performance in 1992, but provided evidence of 'substantial recovery' in the business.</p>

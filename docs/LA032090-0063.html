			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: LAWSUIT AGAINST OPERATOR OF TRADE SCHOOL DROPPED  </P> <P> United Education &amp; Software, the embattled Encino trade school operator  that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December, said a shareholder  class-action lawsuit against it has been dismissed by a federal district court  in Los Angeles. UES said the shareholders indicated that the Chapter 11 filing  was a factor in their decision to drop the case.  </P> <P> The lawsuit was filed in September, 1988, after a foul-up at UES' former  student loan processing subsidiary was uncovered by a government probe. The  problems at the unit, which included failure to notify delinquent borrowers,  led to a collapse in UES' stock price.  </P> <P> UES also got into trouble last year after a federal audit found widespread  problems at its National Technical Schools, a Los Angeles-based home study  computer program. The company filed for bankruptcy protection after the  California Student Aid Commission, the state agency that administers the  federal student loan program, said National Technical Schools should be banned  from the program.  </P> <P> The company is still a defendant in suits filed by several banks, which stand  to lose up to $650 million because of the loan-serving errors, and a  $24-million suit filed by the state of California in connection with National  Technical Schools' problems.  </P></p>

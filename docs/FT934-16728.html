			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Stuck in the same old rut It is too easy. Over the past fortnight the Liberal Democrats and Labour have prepared themselves for co-habitation. The repositioning of the left-centre has begun. Victory is assured. The Conservatives are wrung out, testy, ingloriously led. They have lost an ideology and are searching for a role. Worse, they are tired - tired of squabbling, tired of polemics, tired of office. Just watch them fall apart at their conference in Blackpool this week. All that remains is a wait of one, two or at a push three years and the new thinking of the 1990s will take over from the burnt-out remnants of the 1980s. Mr John Smith will be in Downing Street and Mr Paddy Ashdown, a controlling vote in his hands, in seventh heaven. There is a case to be made for this somewhat unlikely story. It starts with the prime minister. Mr John Major's strategy for reunifying his party is that of a former whip. He wants to give something to his loudest opponents, who are on the right. Thus he confesses, more or less, that there can be no return to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System while the party is in its present schismatic state. Meanwhile he plods along the Thatcher trail, unaware of where the lady might have turned off, and carries on privatising and market-testing everything that moves. This approach is out of date. Most of us are turning away from the anarchy that blinkered libertarians of the new right failed to foresee when they sought to create a minimalist state. Middle-class unemployment has ensured that. To take one example, when nobody can get academic tenure but everyone must accept short-term contracts and find their own funding, bang goes the support of intellectuals. Crime has rammed the point home: when everyone is a customer, and nobody a citizen, those who cannot pay smash windows. Society cannot work if every action within it is based on a cash transaction. People need a sense of security, continuity, civic comfort. There must be room for duty, responsibility, charity, professional pride, enduring institutions, structure. One straw in this wind is the recent publication by the Institute of Economic Affairs of Dr David Green's Reinventing Civil Society, in which the author argues for a restoration of civic society, based primarily on voluntary welfare associations. That is a subject all of its own. My point today is that the IEA, the think-tank that led the way towards 1980s market thinking, is now publishing an argument to the effect that Thatcherism over-stressed the market economy at the expense of community. Another straw is Mrs Virginia Bottomley's attempt to delete the word 'market' as applied to the NHS reforms. Yet another is the message put out by Labour's Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary. The interests of the community and of individuals are intertwined, he says, and few of us forebear to cheer. Perhaps the most articulate exponent of this change in the political terms of trade is Mr John Gray, a Conservative philosopher and fellow of Jesus College, Oxford. I discussed his book, Beyond the New Right, earlier in the year. Yesterday he wrote in The Guardian that 'the Conservatives have no coherent view of the functions and limits of market institutions'. The 'stagnant corporatism' of the 1970s was, he implies, rightly discarded. The result of this, plus seeing 'government as the problem and markets as the all-purpose solution', is that 'British conservatism today has nothing to say about the political task of the age, which is reconciling the subversive dynamism of market institutions with the human need for local rootedness and strong and deep forms of common life'. I would disagree with his characterisation of British conservatism as anything nearly so coherent. There is the market-besotted right, and there are the rest. The fault-line lies a millimetre to the left of Mr Michael Portillo, who spoke up recently in favour of the Judeo-Christian ethic of helping individuals help themselves. That line bundles a great many Tories into the territory inhabited by everyone else: in favour of markets, but worried about unemployment, social disintegration, the latter-day destructiveness of the Thatcher-initiated revolution. Former Conservative voters are turning to the Liberal Democrats, while Labour becomes less frightening, less obviously subservient to unions. The latter are more popular. It may become safe to vote Lib Dem, even if it puts Labour in. So runs my likely story. It may be a fairy story. The Tories have time to pull themselves together before the next general election. The current cry in Blackpool is that this is the week in which to support the party and cheer its leader. It may not last the week, but over the weekend the mood began to turn against dissidence. It may become less chic to be a destructive complainer. What the party managers want us to believe is that this is a turning point for Mr John Major. Perhaps it is. He can hardly sink much lower in the opinion polls; nor can the Conservatives. There is nowhere to go but up - isn't there? Technically speaking, the election can be postponed until April 1997. That is an exceedingly long time in politics. Anyhow, the Lib-Labs are not exactly close to perfection. The Liberal Democrats have been exposed as rampant opportunists. Labour has been seen to be clinging in ever closer embrace to its trade union parents. Do not misunderstand me. Mr John Smith deserves the applause he received for risking his authority on a vote in favour of reducing the influence of trade unions in parliamentary selection procedures. He was brave, and he got a good press for it. He did, however, pay a high price, partly in promises of legislation that will protect employees but discourage employers from taking them on, and partly by demonstrating that the horse-trading of union votes is still what Labour is about. In a hung parliament, if there is one, Labour might be accepted as the only possible match for desperate Liberal Democrats. Yet what happened at Brighton was a setback for Labour's modernisers. The cry for 'strong and deep forms of common life' will not be stilled by the lullabies of the 1960s and 1970s. Lab-Lib must do better if it is to be sure of defeating even the pathetic bunch of dispirited Tories gathering here in Blackpool.</p>

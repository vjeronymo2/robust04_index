			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEACE DIVIDEND  </P> <P> Congress is making a big issue of the "peace dividend."  </P> <P> However, there is a parallel between Shakespeare ("Merchant of Venice") whose  character, Portia said: "Take ye your pound of flesh but take ye not one drop  of blood" and congressmen who say: "Cut billions from the defense budget but  cut not one dollar from my district." Until we can overcome this provincialism,  there will not be a meaningful peace dividend.  </P> <P> GARY A. ROBB  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

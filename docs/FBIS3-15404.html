It was alleged that the Russian party had demanded the  postponement.    Head of the Moldovan military experts, Nikolay Turturyanu,  told INTERFAX that several supplementary provisions to the  Moldovan-Russian general agreement on the 14th Army had been  worked out during the consultations of the military experts.    "The 8th round of the negotiations is to take place in the  near future. It will focus on the issue concerning the 14th  Russian Army," Turturyanu added.    He stressed that Russia had, as yet, put forward no more  demands. He reminded that the negotiations were held at the  state level and the position of the Moldovan Defense Ministry  reflected the position of Moldova in general. The position of  Moldova has remained the same, he said.    Head of the Moldovan delegation, Moldovan Ambassador to  Russia, Anatol Taranu confirmed that Moldova had insisted on  unconditional withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army before 1 July,  1994.    Turturyanu refuted the allegations that the 14th Army might  be reorganized into a Russian military base on Moldovan  territory.    "These allegations have no grounds. Those who circulate the  allegations proceed from the example of when Russia transformed  its military formations on Georgian territory into military  bases. However, Russia has not even raised this issue at the  negotiations with Moldova," he pointed out.</p>

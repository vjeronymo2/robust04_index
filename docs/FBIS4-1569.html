			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 31 (CNS) -- Deputy Director of the  Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under the State Council, Mr.  Chen Ziying, today met a senior delegation from the American  Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong led by its chairman Mr. Gerald  Murdock. Mr. Chen said that the Chinese government hoped that  the British Hong Kong authorities would take effective measure  to control high inflation and soaring housing prices there.    With regard to the leasing of land, Mr. Chen said that the  Sino-British Land Group had been getting on well with their work  on the leasing of more than 50 hectares of land in recent years  as set out in Annex 3 of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.  This amount did not include the leasing of land for public  housing. The leasing of land approved for this year was  expected to be no less than 100 hectares.    The construction of the railway to serve the new airport,  Mr.  Chen said, involved both the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group  and the Land Commission, and this therefore needed consultation  between the two parties. He said he hoped that the core project  for the new airport would be completed as far as possible in  view of the approach of 1997. [sentence as received]    Mr. Murdock said that the American Chamber of Commerce in  Hong Kong would contribute to encouraging the American  government to renew China's MFN status without preconditions.  Mr. Chen expressed his appreciation, saying that MFN was  reciprocal and if the American government took away China's MFN  status, both sides would suffer losses and Hong Kong and Taiwan  would be particularly hurt. Looking into the future, America  would be the biggest loser, Mr. Chen added.    In a 70-minute meeting, Mr. Chen repeatedly stressed that  the  Chinese government would unquestionably uphold Hong Kong's  international financial and trade centre status. He said that  China did not know how far the British side would go in  breaching cooperation. Hong Kong's future was ultimately  decided by the people of Hong Kong. After 1997, he said, the  Chinese government would implement the policy of "one China, two  systems" and "Hong Kong run by Hong Kong people" to the letter.  To maintain Hong Kong's status as an international financial  and trade centre and its stability and prosperity was the only  aim of the Chinese government.</p>

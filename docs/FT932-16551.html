Other hotel work currently under way includes the design and construction of the Pounds 20m Hotel Continental Plaza and Centro Commercial in Veracruz, Mexico's largest port. The complex will consist of an eight-storey hotel containing 240 bedrooms and a seven-storey office and banking block, and a single-storey restaurant and discotheque above a semi-basement car park. On the country's western seaboard, Grupo Sitra has two design and construct contracts worth Pounds 7m for residential and tourist developments. At Guaymas, work on the Condominios Plaza Las Glorias involves building 44 apartments in several six-storey blocks, while further down the coast a group of villas are being built as part of a marina complex at Puerto Vallarta. In the north east, near the United States' border, the company has a Pounds 7m contract at Mexicali for the civil engineering works connected with a new water treatment plant and steel rolling mill.</p>

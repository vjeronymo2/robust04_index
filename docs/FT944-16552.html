			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Asian airlines cut fares Several airlines in Asia are following Singapore Airlines (SIA) and cutting first and business class fares on regional routes. At the weekend SIA announced it would reduce first and business class fares by between 10 and 20 per cent to 33 destinations in Asia, the south-west Pacific and South Africa. Cathay Pacific, Thai Airways International and Qantas have now announced similar reductions on flights out of Singapore. Malaysia Airlines and other regional carriers are also likely to announce fare reductions. SIA, consistently one of the world's most profitable carriers, has been hit by growing competition from other airlines in the region and the steep appreciation of the Singapore dollar against other regional currencies. About 35 per cent of SIA's revenues comes from sales of first and business class tickets. A spokesman for Qantas said that the Australian carrier had to follow SIA in making fare reductions in order to remain competitive, particularly on routes from Singapore to Australia.</p>

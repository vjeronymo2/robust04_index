			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Hamburg ARD Television Network in  German at 1915 GMT on 18 November in its ``Monitor'' program  carries a 14-minute report by West German Radio and Television  (WDR) journalists Herbert Blondiau and Ekkehard Sieker claiming  that the 41 barrels containing poisonous Dioxin from the  disaster in the Italian city of Seveso in 1976 were buried in a  waste dump in the Mecklenburg Western Pomeranian city of  Schoenberg, in the former GDR, and, subsequently, a five-minute  live interview with the environment minister of Mecklenburg  Western Pomerania, Frieder Jelen.    The two journalists claim that, on the basis of documents,  ``we know today that dioxin was actually produced in Seveso''  and that it was not the result of an accident there, as claimed  by the responsible Swiss company, Hoffmann-La Roche. The 41  highly poisonous barrels were ``secretly'' shipped to France for  provisional storage after the accident, from where they later  disappeared. Several months after that, barrels were found in  northern France and publicly incinerated in Basel, Switzerland.    Sergio Angeletti, an official from Milan who was responsible  for monitoring the removal of the barrels from Seveso at the  time, has now ``broken his silence'' and said that the barrels  that were incinerated in Basel were not those that contained the  hazardous dioxin. Angeletti states that he and the ``special  authorities'' knew even at the time that the barrels were to be  shipped to ``a communist country in Eastern Europe,'' the GDR.    The journalists state that documents that were made  available  to them prove that the dioxin-containing barrels were sent to  the waste dump at Schoenberg, between Luebeck and Schwerin, in  the GDR. Sieker and Blondiau note that a ``government commission  in Milan is currently reexamining the inconsistencies of  Seveso.''    A Schoenberg butcher, identified as Mr. Zander, tells the  journalists that an ``absolutely trustworthy'' informer, who  witnessed the arrival of the barrels at the Schoenberg dump,  told him details of the burying of the barrels. Names of  ``high-ranking'' officials of the Schoenberg dump are also  mentioned. Another witness states that he knows the exact spot  where the 41 barrels were buried at the Schoenberg dump.  Responsible officials of the administration of the Schoenberg  dump refused to comment on these charges and only produced  documents that show that a request for dumping the Seveso  barrels there was rejected.    The journalists claim that all the documents passed on to  Mecklenburg Western Pomeranian Environment Minister Frieder  Jelen have been ``manipulated.''    Sieker and Blondiau conclude their report by stating that  their investigations prove ``that what was incinerated in Basel  in 1983 was not the ominous 41 barrels from Seveso but  duplicates. The original barrels were taken to the refuse dump  at Schoenberg, where they have probably remained to this today.  Seveso is not over yet.''    In the ensuing live interview with the environment minister  of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, Frieder Jelen, by Klaus  Bednarz, the minister says that he will try to ``get in touch  with the committee investigating the case in Lombardy.'' He  adds that it will also be necessary to ``get access'' to all the  documents that were made available to journalists Sieker and  Blondiau. Scientists will have to examine whether one can dig  out the barrels at Schoenberg. Jelen notes that it will ``not  be possible'' to remove the barrels secretly from the dump now,  because the case has been handed over to the state prosecutor  and the Schwerin police authorities.</p>

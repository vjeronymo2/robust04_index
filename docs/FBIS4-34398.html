			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Colombian Defense Minister Rafael </F> Pardo Rueda in Santa Fe de Bogota by station director Dario  Arizmendi and unidentified station announcer in Emisoras  Caracol's Santa Fe de Bogota studios; from "Caracol's 0600 to  0900" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Announcer] Good morning, Mr. Minister. Our  respects from Caracol. We would like you to speak with our  director, Dario Arizmendi, who is in the station's master  control room, regarding the status of public order in the  country today, as Colombia is electing a new president.    [Pardo] The reports on the public security situation that  are  available to us thus far do not reveal any incidents that could  delay the elections. The Defense Ministry is going to provide  related information and official public order reports on a  regular basis. However, at this time, we do not have any  reports from any place saying that, because of public order  problems, elections will be delayed.    [Arizmendi] Mr. Minister, our respects from Caracol's  central  master control room. Do you believe soldiers should be able to  vote in the elections? In Colombia, legal regulations and the  Constitution stipulate that soldiers cannot vote.    [Pardo] No, I do not believe soldiers should vote. I believe  that, in light of the current situation Colombia faces, the  circumstances, and the role played by the military forces in  Colombia, it is not appropriate for soldiers to vote. I believe  so because the Colombian Armed Forces play the fundamental role  of guaranteeing the elections. For instance, the public forces  are guarding over 90 percent of the 47,000 voting tables. The  parties themselves have asked for the public forces to be  present at the voting tables and sites, lending their support  for the electoral organization. This entails an absolute and  total neutrality and a lack of party allegiance on the part of  public forces members. This is why I deem it appropriate to  maintain this legal prohibition that dates back to 1930 and has  been part of Colombian traditions.    [Arizmendi] Judging from your experience, do you believe our  next president, whom we will be electing today, should appoint a  civilian to the Defense Ministry?    [Pardo] This is normal in a democracy. I believe that all  Colombians must begin to get used to this situation and that it  should be usual within the Defense Ministry.    [Arizmendi] At this juncture, do you believe all generals  nationwide are happy and satisfied and consider having a  civilian as defense minister a pleasant experience?    [Pardo] As for myself, the task I have fulfilled has been,  rather than pleasant, very constructive and significant. On  behalf of democracy, it is crucial that the defense minister  have the capacity to answer politically and assume political  responsibilities. I deem this appropriate for any democracy,  and for the Colombian democracy, in particular, I believe it  should be the rule in the future.    [Arizmendi] Would you like to remain in your post as defense  minister if you are confirmed by the president-elect?    [Pardo] I have a term, which will end on 7 August.    [Arizmendi] Are you planning to go overseas or stay in  Colombia?    [Pardo] I am trying to get a scholarship to study abroad.    [Arizmendi] Where would you like to study?    [Pardo] I do not know yet, any place abroad. I have a few  possibilities in mind, have sent several applications, and hope  something will come through.    [Arizmendi] What would you like to study?    [Pardo] Basically, I am interested in reflecting on all I  have done in the public arena all these years. I would like to  further my knowledge regarding that area. There are many new  trends, international situations, and I have great interest in  learning more about issues of this sort.    [Arizmendi] In order to participate actively in Colombian  politics later on?    [Pardo] [Words indistinct] to study.    [Arizmendi] It is time to make assessments. [Words  indistinct] What is your assessment on the war against the  guerrillas?    [Pardo] I believe there is a basic factor in this situation.  Three or four years ago, the guerrillas constituted a necessary  player [referencia obligatoria] in Colombian politics. Any  issue being debated required to some extent -- in order to be  thoroughly examined -- the opinion of the guerrillas. The  guerrillas gave their views and issued communiques on every  subject. They constituted a permanent player in the entire  political process and the national situation. This situation  has changed dramatically. Today's guerrillas might continue  causing harm and might be able to perpetrate crimes, but they do  not constitute a key player in Colombian politics anymore.  Today's guerrillas are a criminal element that remains on the  sidelines. We are all concerned about the guerrillas and would  like to see the problem resolved promptly, preferably in a  negotiated manner, but the truth is that they do not constitute  a leading player in Colombian politics anymore.    [Arizmendi] However, how many soldiers have been deployed  nationwide today to guarantee peace and keep the order?    [Pardo] There are between 130,000 and 140,000 soldiers  directly involved in the electoral process.</p>

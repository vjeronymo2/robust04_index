			<p>BFN     [Text] Since the beginning of this year, Dong Nai Province  has spent nearly 12 billion dong on three 15-kilovolt  electricity projects to provide electricity service to isolated  villages. The first project, at a cost of 4 billion dong,  consists of a 15-kilovolt medium voltage line more than 15 km  long, connecting Tan Phu District to the boundary of Lam Dong  Province and a 0.4 kilovolt electricity line. The other two  projects include a power line to Xuan Binh village, a heroic  village in Nam Khanh District, with a total cost of more than 5  billion dong, and a low voltage line, at a cost of more than 2  billion dong, to Bao Han Mot village, a former revolution base  in Thong Nhat District.    With local funding and public contributions, Dong Nai is  trying to provide electricity to all villages in the province by  1995.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 25 KYODO -- GATT chief Peter  Sutherland, the most likely candidate for the first head of the  proposed more powerful world trade body, said Monday [25 April]  he wants to step down, several diplomatic sources said.    Sutherland revealed his intention at an informal meeting of  the heads of delegations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), citing "personal" matters as the reason for his  possible resignation.    The GATT director general, however, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE  that he will not officially express his desire to resign soon.    "I cannot say anything now," he said.    Sutherland succeeded his predecessor Arthur Dunkel in July  last year and helped lead the Uruguay Round of global trade  talks to a successful conclusion last December. His term will  continue until the end of June next year.    There have been talks in the last few months that Sutherland  may leave GATT halfway through his term to land positions at  bigger international bodies such as the European Union.    An Asian diplomatic source said Sutherland said he wants to  quit after the preparatory work for the World Trade Organization  [WTO], scheduled to be formed on January 1 next year to replace  GATT, is completed.    Analysts said Sutherland's remarks will soon prompt  countries  planning to participate in the WTO to search for other  candidates for the chief of the new trade body.</p>

No small entities have been identified as being affected. The economic affect on all entities will be minimal. No U.S. vessels have been identified as being subject to the proposed regulations. The total cost per vessel has been determined to be $35 per visit for each vessel with a total annual cost in 1995 to $4,200 for all vessels. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you think that your business or organization qualifies as a small entity and that this proposal will have a significant economic impact on your business or organization, please submit a comment (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) explaining why you think it qualifies and in what way and to what degree this proposal will economically affect it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Collection of Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each proposed rule that contains a collection-of-information requirement to determine whether the practical value of the information is worth the burden imposed by its collection. Collection-of-information requirements include reporting, recordkeeping, notification, and other, similar requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal contains collection-of-information requirements in the following sections: &sect;151.1516.

Standardizing the minimum requirements for these vessels is necessary to effectively prevent further introductions of nonindigenous species. Therefore, if the rule becomes final, the Coast Guard intends it to preempt state and local regulations that are inconsistent with the requirements of this proposed rule. These regulations were developed in consultation with the Task Force which is charged with coordinating among, and providing technical assistance to, regional, State, and local entities regarding environmentally sound approaches to prevention and control of aquatic nuisance species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is not necessary. An Environmental Assessment and a draft Finding of No Significant Impact are available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The exchange of ballast water in open ocean would benefit the Hudson River environment and the Great Lakes environment by helping to prevent potential infestations of nonindigenous species through ballast water emptied into the Hudson River north of the George Washington Bridge and transferred through the Hudson River and into the Great Lakes. Introduction of nonindigenous nuisance species through the ballast water of vessels has caused millions of dollars of damage to date in the Great Lakes area. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

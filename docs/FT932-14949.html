			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International group in Vietnam oil deal A CONSORTIUM of companies led by Australia's BHP Petroleum signed contracts yesterday to exploit Vietnam's Dai Hung (Big Bear) offshore oil field, the biggest undeveloped field in Asia, Reuter reports from Hanoi. The contract, calling for total investment of about Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 966m) over more than 20 years, is one of the biggest business deals in communist Vietnam since it started building a market economy in the late 1980s. BHP Petroleum is the operator for the field, about 250 km (155 miles) off the coast of southern Vietnam, with a 43.75 per cent stake. Its partners are Malaysia's state-owned Petronas, with 20 per cent, VietsovPetro, a Vietnamese-Russian joint venture, with 15 per cent, and Total of France and Sumitomo of Japan with 10.625 per cent each. Bringing the Big Bear field on stream in mid-1994 will boost Vietnam's oil exports, currently coming from the Bach Ho (White Tiger) field further north. VietsovPetro pumped about 5m tonnes of crude from Bach Ho last year.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / IMF Moscow talks show conflicts over reform TALKS between the Russian government and the International Monetary Fund in Moscow on the implementation of economic reform are going slowly and show numerous points of conflict. No agreement is thought likely before President Boris Yeltsin meets the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries in Munich on July 8, after the G7 summit. The fund wants assurances that the Russian central bank has firm agreements with the central banks of the other 14 former Soviet republics on the use of the rouble (still their common curency) before it releases Dollars 6bn to stablise the Russian currency. The Russian government wants to make the rouble internally convertible next month. Other former Soviet republics, including Estonia and Ukraine, say they will introduce their own currencies soon. The IMF also wants a firm commitment on the repayment of the former Soviet debt, for which Russia is now responsible. Russia is paying neither principal nor interest on the Dollars 60bn-plus debt to Western countries.</p>

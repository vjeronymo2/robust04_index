			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (1): Exploiting the differences - The success of offshore centres has been their ability to provide financial services that offer generous tax advantages. But the older centres now face competition from ambitious new rivals eager to attract their traditonal clients IN SPITE of the increasing harmonisation between European states, there is still much scope for the financial services industry to capitalise on differences in tax and regulation. The march towards synchronisation of regulation has given additional impetus to businesses seeking a more liberal environment. Moreover, the lack of a standard tax structure has allowed some European states to export their more favourable laws to other parts of Europe. 'Offshore centres fall into three main camps,' said Mr Robert Ash, vice - president in charge of marketing offshore centres products for Chase Investment Bank. 'First, there are the well-regulated onshore centres of Luxembourg and Dublin. Second, there are the offshore specialist markets which provide particular products. Then there are the unregulated markets of the Caribbean which cater for the sophisticated investor who is not concerned about risk.' But the unspoken charm of offshore centres, particularly for the various sectors of the financial services industry which have made them their home, lies in the tax advantages which providers can attach to products originating there. That has been the secret of their attraction for decades and is likely to remain so for some time to come. The success of Luxembourg in establishing itself as the offshore centre for retail investment products sold into Europe - or of the Channel Islands, for similar products sold into the UK - has not escaped the notice of other centres and competition for similar business has become fierce. The question is whether the newer centres, with their liberal tax regimes and obliging regulatory bodies eager to cut bureaucratic red tape, can successfully challenge the dominance of the older centres. By all accounts, Dublin has done a creditable job of establishing itself as an alternative to Luxembourg, with its relatively higher costs, as an offshore centre for retail investment products. The investment bank of Singer and Friedlander, for instance, recently recruited the highly successful unit trust division of Morgan Grenfell with the idea of basing a new division in Dublin, which would market Ucits (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) in Europe. Japanese and other European banks have recently been selecting Dublin in preference to Luxembourg, although Luxembourg is continuing to grow. GT Management has also just shifted six of its unit trusts to Dublin, intending to market them as pan-European Ucits. The ability of Dublin to attract business which would once have headed for Luxembourg demonstrates the vulnerability of offshore centres to determined rivals. Still, Luxembourg has signalled its determination to hang on to its status as the offshore centre in the heart of Europe. It has moved to strengthen its bank regulatory structures in the aftermath of the collapse of the Bank for Commerce and Credit International, in an effort to buttress its reputation as Europe's banking sector. Among other things, it has put in place a compensation scheme covering the first Lfl500,000 in deposits. It also has put in place a fiscal regime for the sale of pan-European life insurance and pensions products which rivals that available anywhere else on the Continent. And its financial regulatory body, the IML, has moved swiftly to cut the red tape associated with the establishment of new offshore funds, so that it now takes no more than four weeks to launch a new product - down from six months three years ago. Also, approved investment vehicles now include the latest innovations in derivatives, real estate funds, and so-called 'funds of funds' which allow diversification of investment. However, the attraction of an offshore centre in the heart of the EC could well be undermined by moves to standardise tax regimes. The Belgians, who will take over the chairmanship of the EC in June, have said they wish to place the issue of minimum withholding taxes back on the agenda. While Luxembourg successfully fought off the issue several years ago, the move would certainly remove some of the relative attractions of Luxembourg-based retail investment products which do not require withholding tax on interest and dividend payments to non-residents. Meanwhile, the Channel Islands, which have noted the defection of some of their offshore products to Luxembourg and Dublin, have moved with considerable energy to replace lost funds with wholesale deposits from investors in places such as Japan who want access to UK investment opportunities but wish to remain outside its tax structure. Also, a series of financial scandals since the late 1980s has forced a rethink about the liberal regulatory regimes which once characterised some offshore centres. Gibraltar and the Isle of Man have both been badly hit by the collapse of financial institutions based there in the 1980s and both have moved to put effective investor compensation schemes and regulatory structures in place. Jersey and Guernsey have enacted some of the world's toughest money laundering rules for banks based there, and tiny Liechtenstein is taking a hard look at its own secretive trust system. Liechtenstein has come under scrutiny from British MPs since it became known that the late Robert Maxwell had used a series of secretive trusts based there to carry out transactions using funds stolen from pension schemes he controlled. Meanwhile, the Caribbean has raised its profile as an offshore centre for European businesses, building on its strengths as the home of the captive insurance industry for American companies. But Bermuda, with its well-entrenched regulatory framework and networks of insurance experts, is now also attracting the captive insurance subsidiaries of European companies. Among the island's biggest European captives are Grand Metropolitan, Hanson Group and British Airways. Because the infrastructure is already in place, European companies are finding Bermuda more attractive as a home for captive insurance subsidiaries than offshore centres closer to home, such as Gibraltar or Dublin. Meanwhile, Bermuda is also attracting a portion of the reinsurance market which would once have been based at Lloyd's of London. Late last year, Britain's Commercial Union insurance company joined a number of US-based investors to form a company to reinsure risks underwritten in London. Bermuda is also taking advantage of the interest of European financial companies to expand its own mutual fund business. A new trust law which allows a limited number of overseas companies to manage Bermuda-based trust companies has been used to run mutual funds aimed at wealthy private clients. The message from the newer offshore centres is that the traditional hubs of business face continual competition from hungry and ambitious rivals eager to draw away their traditional clients. The question is whether the established offshore centres are up to the challenge.</p>

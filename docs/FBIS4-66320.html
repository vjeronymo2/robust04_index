This breakthrough in  domestic research on nuclear-pumped lasers also realized a  thermal neutron injection rate of 6 x 10[.sup]14[/]  n/cm[.sup]2[/]-s after polyethylene moderation. Based on the  moderator structure, we designed an internal gas-filled  amplifier tube assembly with the following pressure proportional  mix: [.sup]3[/]He:Ar:Xe = 3.47 x 10[.sup]4[/]:3.47 x  10[.sup]4[/]:2.67 x 10[.sup]2[/] (Pa); tube length is  600mm and diameter is 34mm. With about 1.4 x 10[.sup]16[/]  fissions per pulse, using a plano-concave cavity stabilizer, we  did a total of eight shots in the experiment and the results of  all eight firings are essentially in agreement. The observed  waveform is shown below in Figure 2 [Fig. 1, not reproduced,  shows a photograph of the experimental apparatus].   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-008-10A>      Figure 2: Laser Waveform </FIG></p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / US readies at home and at sea to invade Haiti The US government yesterday took fresh steps to pave the way for an invasion of Haiti. The defence department readied two aircraft-carriers for duty off Haiti and sent its two most senior defence officials to Congress to try to quell domestic opposition. The military and media preparations are exciting speculation in Washington that, after weeks of vacillation, the administration has reluctantly committed itself to an invasion as early as next week, if the Haitian military leaders do not step down within a few days. President Bill Clinton will make a national televised address about his Haiti policy on Thursday night, the White House announced late yesterday. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, has appeared frequently on television in the past few days, explaining the reasons for an invasion and giving US credibility worldwide as the primary justification. Mr Anthony Lake, the president's national security adviser, yesterday echoed Mr Christopher, saying: 'Our action in Haiti will send a message far beyond our region.' On the Senate floor, however, leading Republicans warned President Bill Clinton against invading Haiti. 'It is time, Mr President, to put an end to gunboat liberalism,' said Mr Dan Coats, a Republican on the Senate armed services committee. 'There is no US national security interest at stake in Haiti and there is no reason to risk even one American life.' The strident attacks followed a letter to the Democratic congressional leaders, from prominent Republicans in the House and the Senate on Monday, demanding 'an immediate opportunity to debate and vote on a resolution authorising the employment of US armed forces in Haiti'. Mr Thomas Foley, Speaker of the House, yesterday said: 'It is possible there will be a vote - next week at the earliest.' However, the administration is understood to oppose a vote for fear of finding its foreign policy stymied by overwhelming opposition in Congress. Instead, it intends to explain the reasons and plans for an invasion so as to win, if not the support, at least the acquiescence of Republican leaders. Mr William Perry, defence secretary, and Gen John Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, have gone to the offices of Senator Bob Dole, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, for closed talks on the prospective military operation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Li Jiasheng: "India, U.S. Promote </F> Economic Ties"]    [Text] New Delhi, May 20 (XINHUA) -- Indian Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao's six-day official working visit to the United  States has shown that despite political differences between  them, both sides attached greater importance to their economic  ties.    During his stay in the United States, Rao met chief  executives of major corporations and had talks with them about  Indian economic reforms and mutual economic cooperation, seeking  to convince everyone that the change in India was irreversible.    Despite the fact that Rao and U.S. President Bill Clinton's  summit involved some political differences, they did not allow  them to shadow their intention to strengthen economic ties.    Clinton recently has called for a pragmatic approach towards  the strain in Indo-U.S. relations over the situation in Kashmir  and human right standards in India. He said that political  differences ought not to color the gamut of Indo-U.S. ties.    He said India's on-going economic reforms offered exciting  possibilities for "our bilateral trade and economic relations."    For the U.S. companies, a major attraction in India is its  large untapped market of 200 middle-class consumers and a  growing industrial sector with an insatiable appetite for modern  technology and infrastructure.    In the short span of two years, multinational giants like  General Motors, IBM, and Coca Cola have already invested over  800 million U.S. dollars in India.    Since 1991 when Rao came to power and pursued an economic  reform policy, Indo-U.S. economic ties had made a great leap  forward despite their differences on Kashmir, human rights,  nuclear non- proliferation, etc. The U.S. exports to India had  risen from 1.9 billion U.S. dollars in 1992 to 2.4 billion in  1993, a 38 percent increase over the same period in 1992.  India's exports to the U.S. had increased from 3.8 billion in  1992 to 4.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1993.    And the U.S. investment also made big progress in the past  few years with an increase of more than 1.1 billion U.S. dollars  in 1993 from less than 20 million U.S. dollars in 1990. Nearly  half of all investment approvals by the Indian Government last  year were from the U.S. companies while the value of the U.S.  investment last year exceeded the total of all previous years'  since India's independence in 1947.    After the disintegration of the former Soviet Union and the  end of Cold War, India shifted its foreign policy from  dependence on the Soviet Union to dimensional one. Rao's  economic reform in 1991 had made India to stress economic  diplomacy which focused on the Western countries, especially the  United States.    As India needs American investment and modern technology,  Rao  has time and again said that political differences should not  prevent India and the U.S. from developing friendly relations.    When all is said and done, both India and the U.S. are  optimistic about their future economic relations and agreed to  continue dialogue over their differences.</p>

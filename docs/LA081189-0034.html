			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: KUDOS?  </P> <P> NBC's "The Golden Girls" and the film "Mississippi Burning" have been given  Golden Pit Awards for negative stereotyping by a coalition of ethnic groups in  New York City. "We want the producers of this material to be more sensitive. In  their quest to entertain, they often contribute to negative stereotyping," said  William Fugazy, honorary chairman of the National Ethnic Coalition of  Organizations. "Mississippi Burning," a drama about the 1964 slayings of three  civil rights workers, was cited for "downplaying the role of blacks . . . and  portraying them as helpless during the civil rights struggle." "The Golden  Girls" was selected for the "constant barrage of negative Italian and Sicilian  diatribes" spoken by the Italian character Sofia Petrillo. Spike Lee's "Do the  Right Thing" received a special Platinum Pit Award for "advocating violence as  a way to resolve conflict".ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

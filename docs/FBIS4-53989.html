			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 23 (YONHAP) -- South Korea cautiously  asked Indonesia Monday to persuade the Non-Aligned Movement  (NAM) to take a balanced view of South and North Korea,  especially in the nuclear dispute, as NAM foreign ministers  prepare to meet in Cairo next week.    Visiting Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, meeting his  counterpart Ali Alatas in morning talks, explained North Korea's  obligation to accept International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspections, South Korean officials said.    Indonesia chairs the Non-Aligned Movement and is the subject  of heavy diplomatic lobbying by North Korea, which keeps its  third largest mission here with a staff of 25 to serve as a base  camp for Southeast Asia.    NAM foreign ministers meet on May 31 in Cairo, with the  North  Korean nuclear problem on the agenda for the first time for  inclusion in the ministerial statement due at the meeting.    Han requested Indonesian support for South Korea's first bid  for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 1996-97,  the officials said. Their discussions included an exchange of  views on overall revisions to the security council makeup, they  said.    The two foreign ministers also swapped views on the upcoming  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November, to  be hosted by Indonesia.    South Korean officials expect a major difference from last  year's APEC summit in Seattle, Washington, which was mostly  dominated by the United States and other advanced countries.    This year, the home advantage and participation of Malaysian  Premier Mohamad Mahathir are likely to change the tone and  direction in favor of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN), according to the officials.    South Korean President Kim Yong-sam plans to attend the APEC  summit.    The foreign ministers touched base on bilateral trade  issues,  expressing satisfaction at the steady increase in volume and at  active investment by the South Korean side.    Two-way trade is predicted to reach 5.1 billion U.S. dollars  this year with Seoul actually ending up about 500 million  dollars in the red.    Han asked for Jakarta's cooperation in ensuring a steady  supply of petroleum and liquefied natural gas (LNG) to South  Korea, the officials said.    South Korea imports most of its LNG from Indonesia. This  year, 3.7 million tons of LNG out of the expected 4.7 million  tons in demand should come from Indonesia.    The South Korean foreign minister winds up his visit to  Indonesia on Tuesday after paying a courtesy call on President  Suharto.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hiroshi Saito, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel  Federation, attended the international steel trade conference  held in Washington in late February. On his return home, he  held a news conference on 1 March, and, speaking in fairly high  spirits, Saito said: "In front of American manufacturers, I  denounced in strong terms their inappropriate law suits against  Japan for dumping iron and steel products."    On the issue of setting macroeconomic targets to help reduce  the trade surplus -- which the Japanese Government rejected --  Saito reiterated that "he, personally, thought such targets  should be presented."    Saito seemed to be satisfied with the results of the  meeting,  which was attended by senior executives of American and European  steel makers.    He said: "Some of the participants from Europe and the  United States supported our assertion." Saito reportedly handed  out copies of his draft speech to the U.S. Commerce Department  and other agencies in an effort to win the understanding of U.S.  Government officials on the stand taken by Japanese makers.    Since an antidumping tax is imposed on surface-treated steel  plates, one of the main Japanese steel plate products, such  plates are no longer exported to the United States. At the  Washington conference, Saito said: "Since the United States  itself decided that Japan was doing nothing wrong in its export  of heat-stretched and cold-drawn steel plates, we have resumed  the export of these products. Although the market conditions  for these products is on the advance now, slow changes have been  seen in the prices of surface-treated steel plates."    Saito's comments revealed that he believes the charges  against Japanese makers of dumping are simply groundless.    It is questionable, however, as to how far Saito's arguments  have affected the American steel industry. And Chairman Saito  himself was not so sure about the effects, because he appeared  to be trying to convince himself when he said: "Without giving  up our hopes, we must take advantage of such opportunities to  speak out."</p>

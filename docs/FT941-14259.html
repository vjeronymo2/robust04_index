			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / PM writes to Scott about ministerial responsibility Mr John Major has told Lord Justice Scott that ministers are responsible for the acts of civil servants, although they are not accountable for actions of 'which the minister disapproves and has no prior knowledge'. This view would seem to underline that in some circumstances ministers involved in the arms-to-Iraq affair could be held responsible if their officials failed to disseminate intelligence information or drafted parliamentary answers that deliberately misled parliament. The prime minister's views on ministerial responsibility are spelt out in a letter to the judge presiding over the arms-to-Iraq inquiry. It cites a keynote constitutional statement given to the House of Commons in 1954 by Winston Churchill's home secretary Sir David Maxwell Fyfe. He identified in which circumstances ministers were constitutionally responsible to parliament 'for the fact that something had gone wrong'. This followed the resignation of Sir Thomas Dugdale, Churchill's minister of agriculture, after an inquiry by a leading QC had publicly criticised the conduct of his officials. Although often held up as a locus classicus of ministerial responsibility, some Whitehall historians have concluded that it was the hounding from his backbenchers that drove the minister from office. Mr Major's constitutional statement is broadly in line with a set of guidance notes prepared by the inquiry. His views are contained in a letter signed by Mr Alex Allan, his principal private secretary. The letter also names Mr Stephen Wall, now ambassador to Portugal, as the civil servant who deleted a reference to a 'minor modification' in government arms sales guidelines in a briefing note to Mr Major when he was his private secretary. Meanwhile it emerged last night that Lord Trefgarne, the former trade and defence minister, has agreed to give evidence to the Scott inquiry on condition that he can be accompanied by a lawyer, although he will not be represented by the lawyer. Lord Trefgarne said last night that although he had supported Lord Howe's attack on the inquiry's procedures, he was now satisfied. He added: 'I am confident I will be adequately protected when I give evidence to the inquiry.' The inquiry will today take evidence in public from Mr Nicolas Bevan, a former cabinet official at the centre of the Iraqi supergun controversy.</p>

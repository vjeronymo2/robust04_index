			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Suffering a saturated market - The tough conditions facing the DIY retailers An increase in operating profits from Pounds 41.6m to Pounds 44.5m at B&amp;Q, the UK's largest DIY chain, was one of the few bright spots in Tuesday's results from Kingfisher group. Elsewhere, however, there is little joy among DIY retailers. The fierce discounting battles that broke out in 1992 after the slump in the housing market are over. B&amp;Q moved last year from 'high-low' pricing towards an everyday low pricing strategy, bringing to an end the weekends when DIY operators battled to outdo one another on special offers. But conditions remain tough. Little market growth is forecast, and analysts agree there is too much capacity - with more being added as operators such as Wickes, Great Mills and Sainsbury's Homebase step up expansion. Little capacity is likely to be taken out. Do It All, the lossmaking joint venture between Boots and WH Smith, did sell 100 stores this year  - reducing the chain to 140 - but 10 of those went to Focus, the privately-owned DIY chain preparing for flotation. On the horizon is another threat: Home Depot, the US 'category killer' which sells a vast range from giant stores at low prices, is planning to expand into Europe. It has hired Mr Jim Hodkinson, former managing director of B&amp;Q, to seek out opportunities. The outlook is very different from a decade ago. In the 1980s, DIY operators, like the big food retailers, enjoyed the double whammy of rapid expansion and ever-increasing gross profit margins. The number of DIY superstores almost doubled from 560 to 1,019 between 1985 and 1990, according to Verdict, the retail research group. At the same time, according to the Central Statistical Office's Retailing Inquiry, DIY retailers' gross margins increased from 30 per cent to 34.5 per cent. But, again like the big grocers, DIY retailers ran into saturation problems just as the growth in the market slowed. To prosper in the new environment, DIY operators are seeking ways of being distinctive, often choosing to specialise in the 'soft' end of the market - decorative and gardening products - or the 'hard' end - hardware, tools and construction products. B&amp;Q aims to be a broad-based retailer, and is adopting a 'twin-track' expansion approach. It has sought to pre-empt the arrival of Home Depot by launching a lookalike format, originally called Depot but now known as B&amp;Q Warehouse. B&amp;Q has 14 Warehouse stores of 80,000 to 100,000 sq ft, and plans at least 50. Mr Alan Smith, Kingfisher chairman, said this week the two newest Warehouses are already on track to achieve sales of between Pounds 14m and Pounds 15m in their first year. At the same time it is refurbishing its existing 40,000 sq ft 'supercentres', based on a successful trial at Fareham, Hampshire. Analysts' favourite stock in the sector is Wickes, which, like B&amp;Q Warehouse, is targeted partly at trade customers. Wickes also took advantage of signs of recovery in the housing market at the end of last year to reduce prices indefinitely on 1,000 product lines. Interim profits more than doubled from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 8.76m. Unlike B&amp;Q, however, which sells mainly proprietary brands, Wickes sells mainly own-label products, which have earned a strong reputation for quality. Own-label is an important component in the strategy of Sainsbury's Homebase, another format favoured by analysts. Homebase has an upmarket image, and 'softer' range. The remaining two of the biggest five chains are finding life more difficult. First-half profits at Texas Homecare fell from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds 2m. Texas, which had become a specialist in home adornment, is testing a 'harder' format. Do It All faces the most difficulties, although co-parent WH Smith last month announced that interim losses had fallen from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 10.5m following the chain's rationalisation. What was supposed to be the way ahead for Do It All, its New Trading Concept format, did not meet expectations, and is being replaced by the Project Focus Store. This has a 'softer' feel and does not group products so rigidly into DIY project categories as the NTC format. WH Smith and Boots say Do It All should return to profits in the next financial year. It would be helped - as would all DIY chains - by a substantial upturn in the housing market. For the moment, there seems little sign of that.</p>

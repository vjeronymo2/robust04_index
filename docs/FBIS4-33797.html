			<p>BFN     [Text] A member of the Diosmedes Jimenez volunteer  cane-cutting brigade from Niquero Municipality in Granma, sent a  letter to Army General Raul Castro, minister of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], informing him that they had  concluded the sugar harvest with a total of 3.2 million arrobas  of sugarcane. This is the only collective from Cuban Workers  Federation's forces to reach the aforementioned figure as was  announced during a ceremony chaired by Alfredo Enriquez Pina,  first secretary of the party in Granma Province, where the  collective was awarded the three-million arroba banner. The  newspaper GRANMA reports that this achievement is considered a  heroic deed, considering the material difficulties of the  current harvest. The most outstanding members of the brigade --  with more than 100,000 arrobas -- were Victor Rodriguez and  Benigno Hidalgo, and the most outstanding youth was Julio Guerra.</p>

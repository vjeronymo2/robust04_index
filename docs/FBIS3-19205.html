			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Following the defeat of the Social Democratic Party  of Austria [SPOe] in the diet elections in Carinthia, the  expected reshuffle was decided today: Health Minister Michael  Ausserwinkler will replace the unfortunate SPOe Chairman Peter  Ambrozy. Ambrozy will resign from all political functions.    Ausserwinkler immediately announced his claim to the  position  of provincial governor. It is logical that the representative  of the party that got the most votes should become governor.  The goal of the negotiations with the Austrian People's Party  is a functioning government, he said.</p>

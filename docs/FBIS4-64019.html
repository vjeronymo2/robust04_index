			<p>BFN     [Text] None of the five candidates to sit on the  Constitutional Court, nominated by Duma factions, collected the  required majority of votes (225) in a vote in the parliament's  lower house on Wednesday.    Lawyer Oleg Mironov from the Russian Communist Party's  faction fared best of all with over 41 percent of the votes.    As the Duma Legislative Committee's Chairman Vladimir Isakov  has reported, factions are entitled to put forward their own  candidates to the president.    When a Constitutional Court bill was debated, the lower  house  insisted on its right to put forward its candidates to that  judicial body and amended the law's wording appropriately.    In keeping with Russia's Constitution, the president is to  make the final selection of candidates to sit on the  Constitutional Court and the Federation Council is to appoint  them.    The Constitutional Court is made up of 19 judges, 6 posts in  it are currently vacant.</p>

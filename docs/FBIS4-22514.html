			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gennadiy Shilin: "The Nonpayments Crisis. Nerves </F> of Energy Sector Workers Like Taut Wires"]    [Text] "Close to critical" is what the president of  the RAO [Russian Joint-Stock Company] YeES Rossii, Anatoliy  Dyakov, called the condition of the Russian energy sector last  Saturday when speaking at a conference of directors of regional  energy systems and representatives of industrial enterprises.  Also attending the conference were officials from the Ministry  of Finance and the Ministry of Economics of the Russian  Federation.    The nonpayments crisis, which by 19 March 1993 had exceeded  4.5 trillion rubles [R], the decline in the volumes of repair  and construction work because of the lack of financing, which is  unprecedented in the history of the branch, the catastrophic  reduction of fuel reserves, and the chronic interruptions in  their deliveries because of those same nonpayments have led to a  situation where, as the RAO president stated, "Unless extreme  measures are taken within five months at most, a cataclysmic  destruction of Russia's electric energy sector will begin."    These and other problems touched upon during the course of  the conference are not new--the press and television have  devoted enough attention to them recently. There have been  serious attempts to figure out the real state of affairs and,  unfortunately, there has also been a desire on the part of  certain politicians and journalists to present energy sector  workers in the eyes of the republic as being almost to blame for  the crisis that has gripped the country's economy. And in this  context the conference in the Ministry of Fuel and Energy had an  extraordinary task. Perhaps it could be considered to be the  first serious attempt on the part of professionals of diverse  but interconnected branches of our economy to find not the  "extreme" but a way out of a difficult situation.    "Of course the energy sector is profitable, as is the entire  fuel and energy complex of which it is a part," stated Fuel and  Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik. "After all, 62 percent of the  revenue side of the state budget is provided by the fuel and  energy complex. The crisis of the energy sector is a result of  the overall decline of production. But there are a number of  circumstances that exacerbate the situation that has developed."    Among the main ones the minister mentioned the problem of  nonpayments and the absence of a strict approach on the part of  the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economics toward  industrial consumers of electric energy who violate financial  discipline, the poorly developed system of rates, the tax  policy, which so far does nothing to encourage production, and  the imperfect legislative base regulating processes in the  branch.    "We are working hard on these problems," said Deputy Finance  Minister of Russia Aleksandr Samusef in his speech. "In order to  solve the nonpayments problem it is extremely necessary even in  the near future to work out a mechanism whereby the enterprises  will receive money for the products they release. To do this we  must expand their rights and capabilities of collecting debts."    As we know, during the years of perestroyka and the  "post-perestroyka period" there was no shortage of attempts to  "cure" the Russian economy through the implementation of various  "programs," "concepts," and "models." The electric energy sector  got its share as well. The press, and particularly RABOCHAYA  TRIBUNA, has already written about the fact that the Ministry of  Finance distributed to the local regions a document which  originated from within it (as a draft edict from the president  of Russia), according to which it was planned to redistribute a  block of shares of the recently created joint-stock company YeES  Rossii. In essence they were planning an illegal revision of a  joint-stock company that had already been created, directly in  violation the edicts of the president of the Russian Federation  Nos. 923 and 1334 on the creation of joint-stock companies,  which would lead to fragmentation of the country's unique  consolidated energy complex into small regional systems.    "Why does everything have to be divided up?" asked General  Director of the Dalenergo Joint-Stock Company Yuriy Basharov in  his speech. "We do not need fragments today, let us complete the  work on the mechanism we have been creating for two years." One  can question the acceptability of various viewpoints--of the  Ministry of Finance or of the energy sector workers--but one  cannot but agree with the reply of the Minister Yuriy Shafranik  regarding the proposals of the Ministry of Finance:    "When the position of the Ministry of Finance is clear to  itself but incomprehensible to thousands of practical  specialists--this is dangerous, and it is worth thinking about.  The effectiveness of the energy sector comes not from the  creation of joint-stock companies but from other mechanisms.    "During the long years of existence and continuous operation  of the branch, all of us, including energy sector workers  themselves, have failed to think about such categories as  energy-intensiveness of industrial production or the proportion  of electric energy in the price of the final product; problems  of economizing on energy basically amounted to sanctimonious  appeals: `When you are through working--turn off your knife  switch' or `When leaving, turn off the lights.'    "Why, for example, do we use 400 kilowatt-hours of electric  energy to produce a tonne of ammonia while in the West this  takes 30-80?    "Why is the proportion of electric energy in the price of a  tonne of aluminum only 15 percent here, but the branch is blamed  for the sharp increase in prices of metal and, ultimately, for  the loss of the positions of Russian producers of aluminum in  the world market?"    "Energy sector workers are prepared to work and carry out  their task under the condition that their primary immediate  problems are solved," emphasized Anatoliy Dyakov, president of  the RAO YeES Rossii, in his final statement. "This is necessary  for Russia. The internal reserves of the energy sector are  exhausted. Today we must, not in words but in deeds, document  and carry out priority development of the electric energy  sector."</p>

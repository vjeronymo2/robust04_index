			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Icarus Flies: Artist Jim Morphesis has withdrawn a painting commissioned by the  John Wayne Airport's arts committee after airport officials rejected a poster  of the work.  </P> <P> His painting of the partially nude legendary Greek figure Icarus was originally  to appear in a show at the airport opening Friday. In a statement, the New  York-based artist said the airport administration "reflects a distrust and  fundamental disrespect for artists." He accused the airport of going along with  the prevailing mood of arts censorship in this country. Said airport  commissioner Robert Cashman: "It's a quality art piece, but the timing is not  right for it." BETH KLEID  </P></p>

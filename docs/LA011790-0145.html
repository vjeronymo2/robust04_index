			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS PEDDLE INFLUENCE AS WELL AS PILLS  </P> <P> Is your doctor on the take? Is his office filled with drug company calendars,  note pads, pens and other mementos labeled with brand names?  </P> <P> We're not talking about big-time bribery here, but pharmaceutical promotion may  have as much effect on people's health as outright influence peddling.  </P> <P> In the highly competitive world of pharmaceuticals, the difference between one  high blood pressure medicine and another may be slight. Arthritis remedies and  antibiotics have proliferated, but true advances are few and far between.  </P> <P> To get doctors to prescribe one brand over another, companies spend over $5,000  per doctor on drug promotion -- over $2 billion a year. This drives up the  price of prescription medicines.  </P> <P> Starting in medical school, doctors in training receive stethoscopes, books and  little black bags from company representatives. Meetings and parties for  medical students and residents may be underwritten by pharmaceutical  manufacturers.  </P> <P> Once in practice, doctors are invited to dinners or sporting events. Some are  given consulting fees merely for attending meetings at which the merits of a  particular drug are extolled. Occasionally, doctors are invited to take  expense-paid vacations in exotic resorts for "continuing medical education."  </P> <P> Some companies have actually paid doctors outright for recruiting patients into  pseudo-scientific studies -- run not by the research wing of the company, but  supervised by the sales and marketing department.  </P> <P> As federal spending on basic research has dwindled, the pharmaceutical industry  has increasing power over research funding. And this power of the purse strings  gives them other leverage.  </P> <P> It is time American physicians adopted an ethical code similar to that in  England. British doctors see pharmaceutical reps only on the condition that no  gift or financial inducement is offered.  </P> <P> At a time when congressmen and government officials have come under increasing  scrutiny for bribery, doctors need to examine their own ethics.  </P></p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / S&amp;N buys GrandMet's Chef &amp; Brewer pubs for Pounds 703m SCOTTISH &amp; NEWCASTLE, the brewing, retailing and leisure group, has agreed to buy Grand Metropolitan's Chef &amp; Brewer estate of 1,654 pubs for Pounds 703m. GrandMet is also selling property interests in 235 of the pubs, owned by Inntrepreneur Estates (IEL), its joint venture with Courage, for Pounds 94m. The pubs are believed to have attracted interest from Whitbread and Allied-Lyons, two of Britain's largest pub operators, during GrandMet's long-running search for a buyer. GrandMet's shares, after an initial rise, closed 2p easier at 416p and S&amp;N were 11p off at 459p. Whitbread, which the market now expects to turn its attention to Forte's Harvester chain, closed 12p down at 529p. The deal with S&amp;N, agreed after 10 months' negotiations, will give the group a national chain of 2,700 pubs and provide greater opportunities to expand sales of its McEwan's, Theakston and Beck's beer brands from its base in Scotland and northern England into the south. Mr Brian Stewart, the group's chief executive, said yesterday: 'The Chef &amp; Brewer estate consists almost entirely of high-quality, managed outlets and has considerable unexploited potential.' S&amp;N will pay Pounds 622m in cash for Chef &amp; Brewer, which on completion of the deal is expected to have Pounds 81.5m worth of debentures in issue. The group is raising Pounds 405m in a one-for-four rights issue and will meet the balance of the cash payment from its resources. The new stock will be issued at 390p, payable in two instalments. Because of the government limits imposed on the national brewers' ownership of pubs, S&amp;N, which already operates about 1,800 pubs, will have to dispose of 748 outlets from its enlarged estate. It intends to sell 462 of the Chef &amp; Brewer houses and dispose of the rest from among its present, smaller outlets. The disposal process will be helped by a newly-formed subsidiary of Morgan Grenfell, S&amp;N's financial adviser, which will acquire for Pounds 94m the interests of IEL in 235 pubs leased to Chef &amp; Brewer, and will later pay S&amp;N Pounds 22m for another 227 houses. It intends to sell the pubs as quickly as possible, and S&amp;N and GrandMet have agreed to share any profits or losses from the sales. Chef &amp; Brewer, according to S&amp;N estimates, is expected to make profits this year of at least Pounds 66m, and the acquisition should not dilute earnings in the first full year after completion. For GrandMet, which on a different accounting basis values the total deal at Pounds 830m, the disposal underlines its intentions of developing the group as an international branded business in food, drinks and retailing. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman, said: 'There is no doubt that this is the correct strategic move.' Brewer fills its cup Page 21 Lex Page 20</p>

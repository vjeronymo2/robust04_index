			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, 26 Apr -- Urgent measures are needed to  establish a clearcut definition of the borders and  characteristics of the UN-declared safe areas in  Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to bring about their  demilitarization. This point of view was expressed at a  briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the information  and press department of the Russian Foreign Ministry. Such  measures, he stressed, can only be drafted within the framework  of the UN Security Council. "Unilateral decisions in this  respect will be counterproductive," the Russian Foreign Ministry  spokesman stated.    In his view, the normalization of the situation around  Gorazde creates conditions for the resumption of efforts to  achieve a political settlement of the Bosnian problem. As G.  Karasin pointed out, this was the purpose of the contacts made  by Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's deputy foreign minister, in London,  today's meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and other  Russian diplomatic moves toward the implementation of the  Russian president's initiative.    According to the Russian diplomat, it was noted at  yesterday's consultative meeting of the UN Security Council that  "the Muslims were responsible for a provocation in the Gorazde  area, but the Serbs did not respond to it." In this connection  Russia again called on the UN leadership and the countries  involved in the Bosnian settlement process to take all measures  necessary to prevent provocations.</p>

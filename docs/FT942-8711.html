			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Tequila refines its image - Mexico's distillers are divided over whether to take their drink upmarket A battle is raging in Mexico over how to make and market tequila, the potent cactus-based spirit which Mexicans take neat and often, and with which Americans make margaritas and other cocktails. The quarrel is between those who want to produce a high-cost tequila and market it as a luxury drink akin to cognac or malt whisky, and those who want to sell it cheaply in bulk around the world. At stake is not just the future of Mexico's national drink, but an increasingly lucrative export market. Tequila was first fermented from the sugar of the blue agave plant that grows in the valley of Tequila, near the city of Guadalajara, and until recently was consumed almost entirely in Mexico. But in the last decade exports have grown healthily, rising from 28.5m litres in 1983 to 47.3m litres in 1993. Now more than two-thirds of production is exported. The sudden popularity has led to growing international interest in the industry. In 1991, International Distillers &amp; Vintners, part of Grand Metropolitan, took a 45 per cent interest in Grupo Cuervo, the industry leader. In March Allied-Lyons took control of Sauza Tequila, the second largest tequila company, when it bought Domecq of Spain. United Distillers, part of Guinness, has marketing rights with Herradura, a niche producer. The quarrel in the industry centres on whether sugar cane or equivalents can be substituted for agave in the fermentation of tequila. Agave takes about 10 years to ripen and must be picked by hand, making it an increasingly expensive raw material. Bulk producers generally sell tequila fermented from a mixture of sugar cane (or an equivalent) and agave. Government regulations currently allow producers to use 51 per cent agave and 49 per cent sugar cane. Some of the lesser-known low-cost producers do not meet even this requirement, according to the Tequila chamber of commerce. These bandit producers sell their tequila to intermediaries, usually in the United States, who bottle and brand the drink. Guillermo Romo, the combative head of Herradura, is leading the fight against cheap tequila. His tequila is made exclusively from agave, uses natural rather than artificial yeast, and does not use chemicals that speed up fermentation. Its premium image has made it one of the fastest-growing tequilas in Mexico, although it exports little. Romo wants laws - or enforcement of existing ones - that would require tequila to be made with 100 per cent agave, and that would prohibit tequila being sold on to intermediaries who bottle and brand the product. In the long run, he says, branding and bottling on site is the only way Mexico can make money out of tequila, and guarantee quality standards. 'Nature's most precious gift to Mexico is the agave,' he says. 'Our inferiority to the Europeans made us believe we could not produce a superior product, which is not true.' Romo successfully blocked all tequila exports in February, after he claimed that existing law, when interpreted correctly, prohibits unbranded tequila exports. Since then, exports have been permitted, while Romo's case works its way through Mexico's courts. Romo took control of the Tequila chamber of commerce this year, which is broadly backing his case. Mr Luis Margain, the head of the chamber and legal director at Herradura, says low-quality unbranded tequila 'will threaten the rule of national origin of tequila (which makes production exclusive to the region of Tequila) as it becomes a cheap, commodity product'. He says the fact that Spain and the Philippines are now making tequila show the dangers. The industry heavyweights, Jose Cuervo and Sauza, which together account for the majority of production, say that any abrupt change to the current regulations would be extremely costly. They argue there is not enough agave to meet current tequila demand, and prices would rocket if the regulations were changed. Furthermore, Sauza and Jose Cuervo believe cheaper tequilas do not damage the drink's image. Both have several tequila brands and distinguish between 100 per cent and mixed agave products, and between tequilas of different ages. 'What we have to have is two tequilas living side by side. One for mixers like margarita and one for high-quality neat products,' says Jorge Berrueta of Sauza. There are also powerful interests in favour of non-branded exports. Jorge Camacho, former head of the Tequila chamber and a Jose Cuervo employer, says outlawing unbranded exports unilaterally would be unfair to American companies that have invested heavily in marketing their own brands. But Romo's fierce attack on the adulteraters of tequila is shaking up the industry. The large producers appear to favour an eventual prohibition of non-branded exports, and have set up a regulatory council to verify whether tequila meets the 51 per cent agave requirement and whether tequila described as a certain age is indeed that age. Camacho, who heads the regulatory council, believes that as much as 30 per cent of commercial tequila does not meet the 51 per cent agave requirement. He admits that 'if the industry does not respect the norms, then we could lose our claim as a distinctive product and all of us would suffer'.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: US groups agree breast implant deal Three US healthcare groups have agreed to provide more than Dollars 3bn between them for a proposed world-wide compensation fund for women who have suffered ill health as a result of silicon breast implants. The companies announced last year that they were seeking to negotiate such a deal. Dow Corning, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Baxter International said they had now reached agreement between themselves, and with representatives of claimants, that would lead to the three bearing 80 per cent of the Dollars 4bn settlement costs over the next 30 years. The settlement is intended to benefit women around the world who have already suffered illnesses, or who become ill in future. However, lawyers in the US said that the bulk of the settlement would go to women in that country. 'Like all settlements, this is a political solution - these companies are based in the US and have most of their business here,' said Ms Lori Henkel, a lawyer in Rochester, New York, who represents around 150 claimants. All women with implants will be included in the deal automatically, and will lose their right to sue the implant manufacturers, unless they actively opt out. This aspect of the arrangement is likely to come under particular scrutiny by the district court in Birmingham, Alabama, where all the implant cases have been consolidated. The court must approve the terms of the settlement for it to take effect. The settlement would be threatened if a large number of women decided to opt out. In that case, Bristol-Myers said it would withdraw from the deal. Women who have suffered cosmetically from implants are believed to fare worst under the deal, and so are the most likely to reject the offer. All three companies reported one-off charges in the final quarter of 1993 in anticipation of the settlement. Bristol-Myers said yesterday the present value of the future payments it expected to make under the settlement was Dollars 1.15bn, out of a total Dollars 1.5bn costs associated with implant claims. Of this, at least Dollars 1bn was covered by insurance, it said. Dow Corning put its total contributions to the fund at Dollars 2bn over the next 30 years. It announced a pre-tax charge of Dollars 640m for the fourth quarter, after expected recoveries under insurance policies. Baxter said the settlement would cost it Dollars 556m, of which Dollars 426m would be covered by insurance.</p>

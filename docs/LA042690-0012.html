			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW LEGISLATION TO DEAL WITH HATE CRIMES IN UNITED STATES  </P> <P> George Roche ("Is America Truly a Society of Hate?" Op-Ed Page, April 8) needs  to come out from behind the protective walls of his "private, liberal arts  institution" and view the world as it really is. Roche seems bent on  establishing different levels of prejudice that warrant varying degrees of  outrage (or tolerance).  </P> <P> Society should be repulsed at the senseless beating of any individual  regardless of whether that person is black, Jewish or gay.  </P> <P> Does Roche really believe that racism is passe because a black has advanced to  become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff? That's like saying a black family  who comes home to find a cross burning on their lawn should brush it off  because Bill Cosby is rich and has one of the most popular shows on television.  </P> <P> The purpose of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act is not to flood the court system.  This legislation is needed to wipe away the mask of denial that most Americans  have about the true level of bigotry in this country. After all, Gov. George  Deukmejian was able to veto the landmark bill (outlawing discrimination in  housing and employment based on sexual orientation) because he claimed there  was no evidence that such discrimination existed. This in a society where the  Supreme Court has legally sanctioned second-class status for homosexuals and a  Texas judge hands out a lesser sentence to two young men because their murder  victim was gay. Where is the justice in that?  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER HARTLEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Stop squabbles, Major tells warring Tories MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday ended a tumultuous week for the government by urging Conservatives to stop squabbling and to rebuild British voters' trust with a message based on ordinary people's aspirations - particularly on jobs. As the Tory hierarchy tried, with partial success, to restore calm after Mr Norman Lamont's bitter resignation speech, the prime minister marked a further shift away from Thatcherism. He told the Welsh Conservative party conference that Tories should 'put aside the great designs and philosophies'. They had to go 'into the living-room of the three-bed, semi-detached house' to 'understand what it is the people actually want'. In the 1980s, he said, 'we were just a touch too laissez-faire'. Mr Major buttressed his proclaimed commitment to enduring Tory party values  -and to rebuff the former chancellor's complaints about short-termism - by stressing the importance of sound money and low inflation and hinting that he is keen to avoid tax rises. Britain, he said, would not become a high-tech, high investment economy 'if we pile on taxes and pile on social costs'. Public spending had to be cut, but some radical proposals would be discarded as unfair, he predicted. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will next week reinforce the emphasis on public spending restraint by telling the cabinet that there can be no question of breaching the ceilings set for the next two years. Despite bids running several billions of pounds above the figures agreed last autumn, Mr Clarke will ask for a remit from the cabinet to seek a settlement this summer below the Pounds 253.6bn and Pounds 263.3bn cash ceilings for 1994-95 and 1995-96. The political difficulties of achieving such a result were underlined again yesterday, with a renewed row over the prospects of billions of pounds in savings on the social security budget by the end of the century. Mr Clarke, who this week emphasised his commitment to nurturing the recovery, will also use an important speech in the City to reaffirm the Treasury's commitment to its 1 to 4 per cent inflation target. Separately, Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, said that he wanted to 'draw a line' under his deeply personalised row this week with Mr Lamont. That emphasis on unity and loyalty was echoed by senior ministers, including Mr Douglas Hurd. Speaking In Gloucestershire, the foreign secretary urged Conservatives to reject the option of 'flap and scrap, posture and panic' and to focus on the realities. Mr Hurd last night ruled himself out as a possible challenger for the Tory party leadership. The foreign secretary, a candidate in the last leadership election, told BBC 2's Newsnight programme: 'I had my one and only go and I don't regret that but I am not going to be in that business again.'

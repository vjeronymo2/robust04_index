Gropyanov, All- Union Institute of Refractories; UDC  666.762.62.046.44]    [Abstract] A new lime refractory production process that  utilizes titanium oxide as the sintering additive was proposed.  TiO[.sub]2[/] was selected because the eutectic temperature  of CaO-TiO[.sub]2[/] is 2010 K and because calcium titanates  are resistant to atmospheric hydrolysis. The refractory is made  by pulverizing pure or esp. pure calcium carbonate to a particle  size of 100-150 m and adding 2-6% TiO[.sub]2[/] or 2-4%   titanium ferrite. (Optimum additive percentage was determined  empirically.) A 5-% aqueous solution of sulfite waste  liquor  with a density of 1.15 g/sq cm is used as the binder. The green  mass is then pressed into briquets and fired at 2020 K. The lime  refractory material has an apparent density of 2.75-3.03 g/cu  cm, apparent porosity of 3.4-9.8%, compressive strength of  60-140 N/sq mm, and a loaded deformation temperature of 1610 to  1700C or higher.

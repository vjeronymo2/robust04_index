			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (37): U-turn on curbs after 40 years - Exports get the all-clear / Sara Webb looks at the most important step yet taken to liberalise the agricultural sector THE government's decision to encourage Indian farmers to export mainstream agricultural products in April this year reverses India's post-Independence policy of restraining food exports and is the most significant step taken so far to liberalise the highly-regulated agricultural sector. Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the commerce minister, has said it was necessary to promote agriculture exports to boost investment in agriculture, raise incomes in the rural parts of India, and thereby ensure that all parts of the country felt the benefit of export-led growth. In the past, India's agricultural exports have been predominantly the internationally traded commodity crops such as tea, coffee, high-grade rice, nuts and spices, while the export of staple crops has been either restricted or prohibited. However, the government now hopes that by scrapping duties on the import of machinery and raw materials used in export-oriented farms or food-processing plants, it will encourage people to set up export-oriented units in agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and fish-farming. Export-oriented projects will be obliged to export only half of their output, and are free to sell the remainder domestically. The export of agricultural products reached an all-time high in the year to March 1993 of Rs73.08bn (about Dollars 2.5bn), up from R60.68bn in the previous year and representing 13.7 per cent of India's total exports in value. These export figures include rice, marine products, fruit, vegetables and meat, but exclude tea, coffee and other traditional plantation crops. By encouraging farmers and businessmen to set up export-oriented schemes, the government hopes to increase agricultural exports to Dollars 5-6bn in 1996-97. 'Our export policy should be permanent, not stop-and-start: we must be pragmatic and consistent in our ideas for reliable export promotion,' said Mr Balram Jakhar, India's agriculture minister. There is clearly plenty of potential for developing export-oriented agriculture especially in the more fertile parts of the country, such as the Punjab, where there are two harvests a year. India produces 70m tonnes of vegetables and fruit, but only about 1 per cent of it is processed, and an estimated 25-30 per cent is wasted through poor harvesting and the lack of adequate storage and transport facilities. The agriculture ministry is keen to encourage investment - possibly through joint ventures - in cold storage, processing and packaging plants in the rural areas as this would help to reduce the scale of wastage in agriculture and raise the volume of products available for export. Farmers will face greater pressure to grow export-quality produce, while efforts to market it, both abroad and in other parts of India now that restrictions on inter-state movement of agricultural commodities have been removed, will have to be stepped up. The challenges are not insurmountable, though the development of agricultural exports may take some time, given the need for investment in infrastructure and storage facilities.</p>

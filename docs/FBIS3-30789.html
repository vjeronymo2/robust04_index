			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Radovan Kovacevic and Radovan Pavlovic article: "A Mortar </F> Could Have Not Caused Such a Tragedy"]    [Text] The massacre that took place at a Sarajevo market  was not the work of an insane mind but of a cool and calculated  criminal who is exceptionally knowledgeable about combat  techniques. This was stated by Colonel Milan Rundic, a  long-serving member of the research team at the  Military-Technical Institute. He has been carefully analyzing  the horrific effects of the explosion. He intends to inform the  public and experts of his conclusions.    "I claim that such a destructive effect could have not been  caused by any bomb fired from our mortars, regardless of their  caliber," he said.    "According to the information to which I have had access, I  think that this was an antipersonnel mine that produces a  circular, splinter effect [kruzno parcadno dejstvo]. This mine  was developed in our institute, but has never become part of the  Yugoslav People's Army's equipment.    "The final development stage of this mine, which was carried  out in total secrecy, was entrusted to the Slavko Rodic military  factory in Bugojno. The head of the team there was Isak Asim.  Bugojno is predominantly a Muslim town, in which the accounts  with the Serbs had been settled quickly, and then with the  Croats. The factory has been bombed, but, judging by  everything, production was quickly resumed according to the  blueprints, which survived, and the highly developed  technology...."    The mine that Colonel Rundic claims was used in Sarajevo was  certainly much more powerful than those that appeared in the  naught series [nultna serija] in Bugojno, but, as he stresses,  what was important in the production of this explosive device  was its operating principle.  <H5>  Balls and Plastic Explosive </H5>   He drew a picture depicting a plastic cylinder, filled with  up to 5,000 small metal balls 4-5 mm in diameter. The explosion  is initiated from inside in such a way that it simultaneously  triggers plastic explosive at the top and the bottom of the  cylinder. The two detonation waves thus caused drive the balls  with immense force toward the middle, and are then released  horizontally at incredible speeds. The spread is deadly and  does not scatter itself, but in fact kills anything within a  60-80 meter radius.    Colonel Rundic refutes the report, that is, the hypothesis  of  AFP, that the mortar hit a market stall and exploded in a  relatively confined area, resulting in what is claimed to be the  "world record" in this kind of killing. Our interviewee  rejected this. Only a mine with a circular effect, judging by  the traces and other details, could have killed so many people.    The mine was brought to the market by someone. Considering  its small dimensions and can-like shape (like a can of beans),  it was planted in a certain place in advance. The mine has a  fuse that can be set to activate the mine at any time from five  minutes to several days.... The list of suspects excludes the  Serbs, because they are in Grbavica. In reply to the question  why such a large number of people were there at that time, the  colonel said that he was not an expert on that, but that one  should investigate whether anyone had started distributing food  at that spot unannounced at the very time when the detonator was  activated.    Replying to why anyone in the Muslim part of Sarajevo would  want to kill people in such a cruel way, Colonel Rundic asked:  "Did not something similar happen in Vaso Miskina Street [where  a Serbian shell killed civilians in a bread queue]?"   <H5>    Why Is the Market Intact? </H5>   Other experts of the Yugoslav Army also claim that it was  impossible for one 120-mm mortar to kill 68 and wound nearly 200  people, as stated by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] the day  before yesterday.    An artillery expert in the General Staff of the Yugoslav  Army  told us yesterday that all analyses show that one bomb could  have not caused such a large number of casualties, and that it  was probably an improvised, remote-controlled, explosive device  planted at the Merkale market.    The anonymous colonel from the Artillery Department of the  General Staff of the Yugoslav Army said that the tragedy in the  Sarajevo market was caused by an improvised mine, the so-called  camouflet [fugasa], and that it could have not been a projectile  fired from a mortar or any other artillery piece.    This deadly mine can be "made" very easily: Plastic  explosive of destructive power could be put into a sack of  potatoes or some other market commodity, reinforced with steel  pellets, placed under a market stall, and then detonated. Only  such a device or something similar could have caused such a  large number of tragic casualties.    However, to avoid speculations and guessing, everything  could  be precisely established with an investigation and autopsies of  the bodies of those killed, which must have contained fragments  of the projectile.    What artillery experts unequivocally claim is that this  tragedy was not caused by a mortar. Judging by what the  television pictures have shown so far (information about the  tragedy is certainly selective and strictly censored), a similar  effect could be caused by six to nine mortar bombs. If this  were the case, the Sarajevo market would have been almost  destroyed. The reports on the tragedy have so far mentioned  only one bomb. The public was shown only a small crater.    Our interviewee said that the effect of mortars is not so  devastating if people are in a group, as was the case at the  market when people were waiting for the distribution of  humanitarian aid. "Every person in the group acts as a kind of  shelter to another person, because shrapnel does not travel  through a human body as bullets do," the colonel from the  General Staff of the Yugoslav Army said.    However, such a number of people could have been killed by  several bombs of a higher caliber, such as 120-mm, 160-mm, and  240-mm (none of the sides in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina  uses the last of these), but these bombs would have to explode  simultaneously and would certainly destroy a good part of the  market.    The origin and type of explosive in the bomb could be  established precisely, if it was fired at all, because traces of  artillery fragments would remain on the concrete ground.  Craters show a real "picture" for experienced artillery  experts. On the basis of craters they can determine who fired a  shell and from what weapon, the military expert said.</p>

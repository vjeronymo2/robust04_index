			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds Bank rises to Pounds 801m - 28% advance despite sharp fall in UK retail banking profits LLOYDS BANK yesterday disclosed a 28 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 801m, despite a sharp fall in UK retail bank profits from Pounds 105m to Pounds 5m. This was partly caused by losses on small and medium-sized business lending. The bank announced a 10 per cent increase in its dividend to 18.4p (16.7p), payable May 5. This was criticised by Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, who said it reinforced the case for an inquiry into banking practices. Lloyds' profits were at the top end of expectations. The shares opened at 528p and rose to 543p on the announcement, closing at 534p. The results were helped by a net release of Pounds 122m (Pounds 40m) of problem country debt, and increased profits on foreign exchange trading income of Pounds 136m (Pounds 72m) because of currency volatility. Pre-tax profits were raised Pounds 153m because Lloyds decided not to attribute this portion of a Pounds 203m cut in the valuation of its British premises to profit and loss. Directors decided that only Pounds 50m of the deficit would be permanent. Sir Robin Ibbs, Lloyds' chairman, said the figures for UK retail banking were disappointing, but losses on small and medium-sized lending showed that criticism of banks' behaviour in the sector had been 'enormously exaggerated'. Sir Robin said he would not comment on speculation that Lloyds might bid for another bank. But he said Lloyds remained 'convinced that sooner or later substantial restructuring of the industry will have to take place.' The bank's operating profit before provisions rose 2 per cent to Pounds 1.54bn (Pounds 1.5bn). Operating income remained virtually unchanged at Pounds 3.99bn (Pounds 3.98bn), while operating expenses fell by 1 per cent to Pounds 2.46bn (Pounds 2.48bn). Overall net interest income dropped 5 per cent to Pounds 2.23bn. The volume of domestic loans fell 11 per cent to Pounds 1.82bn, and the net interest margin on domestic loans narrowed to 5.01 per cent (5.33 per cent). Shareholders' funds rose 10 per cent to Pounds 2.73bn (Pounds 2.48bn), and total assets rose to Pounds 61bn (Pounds 56.1bn). The bank's total risk asset ratio strengthened to 10.5 per cent (9.7 per cent), while tier 1 capital rose to 6.5 per cent (6.2 per cent). Dividend cover was 1.9 times (1.7 times), and net asset value per share rose 9 per cent to 215p (197p). Earnings increased by 26 per cent to 35p (27.7p). Pre-tax return on shareholders' equity advanced to 26.1 per cent (21 per cent). Post-tax return on average shareholders' equity rose to 16.9 per cent (14.5 per cent). Pre-tax return on average assets improved to 1.5 per cent (1.15 per cent). Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said that small businesses would view the figures 'with great suspicion. It seemed unfair that banks were raising prices just as small businesses were cutting theirs to stay afloat.'</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: Italgas has steady first half ITALGAS, the listed gas and water distribution group which is widely held abroad, raised first-half gross operating profit by 9.9 per cent to L420bn (Pounds 195.3m). Earnings before depreciation and tax rose by 13.4 per cent to L398bn, boosted by a 31 per cent jump in interest and other financial income. Turnover rose by 5.7 per cent to L1,961bn, thanks to higher sales of natural gas, in spite of a relatively mild winter. The figure was also boosted by the expansion of the group's growing water distribution activities, with 45 new concessions in the first half of this year. CIR, the industrial holding company controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, reported a first-half group loss of L18bn against net profits of L60.5bn in the same period last year. The plunge into the red stemmed from increased losses at Olivetti, the computers group controlled by CIR, which was partly offset by strong profits at the group's other industrial subsidiaries such as Valeo in France and Sasib and Sogefi in Italy. Earnings were additionally burdened by special provisions made by Banque Dumenil Leble, CIR's French bank, and by a sharp fall in extraordinary items, which amounted to L67bn in the first half of this year against L220bn in the corresponding period last year.</p>

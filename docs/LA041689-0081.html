			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAP  </P> <P> The problem with the white, mainstream rock generation is intolerance toward  other tastes in music, particularly when that genre happens to be dominated by  artists who are not white.  </P> <P> It is futile to believe that rap, reggae or any other form that differs in any  way from the mainstream will not suffer the same fate as disco. The sad fact of  American life still is intolerance and racism, in the music industry and  elsewhere.  </P> <P> CHRIS ELLIS  </P> <P> San Bernardino  </P></p>

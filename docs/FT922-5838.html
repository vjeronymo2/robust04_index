			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Sales optimism reported OPTIMISM about sales among small businesses has risen markedly in the past three months, according to the latest NatWest Quarterly Survey of Small Business. A rise in sales is expected by 20 per cent more small business owners in the present quarter - April to June - than expect sales to fall. In the previous survey, 10 per cent more businesses expected sales to fall. Ms Jane Bradford, head of small-business services, said: 'The position is better than at any time since early 1991, suggesting the bottom of the cycle has passed.' Such optimism contrasted with actual sales performance, with 4 per cent more businesses reporting lower sales, unchanged on the percentage for the previous quarter. Most businesses still expect to reduce employment levels and cut investments in the present quarter, but the percentages involved are smaller. On balance, 4 per cent more businesses expect to cut jobs compared with 17 per cent in the previous quarter, while 6 per cent will cut investment compared with 14 per cent.</p>

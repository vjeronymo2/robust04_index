			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Victorian paintings sale flops: Saleroom SOTHEBY'S has decided to change the way it sells Victorian pictures because of a very disappointing sale of such paintings yesterday. A few years ago, Sotheby's placed British 19th-century art in the same auctions as Continental 19th-century art, in the hope of building up an international market. That has not materialised, and yesterday a whole series of paintings and drawings by Rossetti, Burne-Jones, Millais, Lord Leighton and others failed to sell. In future such works will be removed from 19th-century European auctions and returned to their own specialist catalogue. Top price yesterday, in a sale that totalled Pounds 1.325m, with 33 per cent unsold, in the morning session, was Pounds 473,000 for 'Inferno 1901' by August Strindberg. A work by another Swedish artist, Anders Zorn, 'Dalaro 1892', showing a nude dipping her toe in the sea, sold for Pounds 165,000. A good example of the distance between the 1988 art market highs and the 1992 art market lows was provided at Phillips on Tuesday by two George II chimneypieces which had been removed from Northumberland House in the Strand when it was demolished in 1874. Four years ago they sold for Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 115,000 respectively at Christie's. This week they sold at Phillips for Pounds 71,520 and Pounds 38,775. The buyer in 1988 had been the now bankrupt Asil Nadir; the sellers on Tuesday were the administrators of Polly Peck International, the conglomerate of which Mr Nadir was chairman.</p>

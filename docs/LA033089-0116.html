			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: JUST PUT A WARNING LABEL ON EVERYTHING  </P> <P> I woke up this morning and thought I'd eat an orange.  </P> <P> "Are you sure you want to do that?" my wife asked.  </P> <P> "Why not?"  </P> <P> "They could be from Chile. Somebody from Chile wants to kill us."  </P> <P> "You're right. I think I'll have an apple instead."  </P> <P> She threw herself down on her knees. "Please don't eat an apple. What will  happen to all of us if you eat an apple?"  </P> <P> "How selfish of me," I said. "I have no right to consume an apple when so many  people depend on me. Any late bulletins on shredded wheat?"  </P> <P> "None so far, but that doesn't mean the milk doesn't have pesticides in it. I  read an article the other day that cows were ingesting all kinds of poisons in  their foods. You'd be a fool to take a chance."  </P> <P> "Then I'll have a slice of bread and a cup of coffee."  </P> <P> My wife told me, "Marie Hawke says coffee causes cancer in rats."  </P> <P> "Has she ever seen a rat with cancer?"  </P> <P> "No, but Geraldo Rivera has, and he showed the rat on TV the other night."  </P> <P> "So much for breakfast. I guess I'll be off to work."  </P> <P> "You're not going to drive on the beltway?" she gasped.  </P> <P> "What's wrong with that?"  </P> <P> "There is 10 times as much hazardous waste being transported on the highway now  as there was two years ago. One trailer spill and you'll be in cruise control  with the angels."  </P> <P> "That's not a very comforting thought. But we can't be intimidated by hazardous  waste trucks. They would like nothing more than for us to stay home so that  they can have the highways to themselves."  </P> <P> I put on my driving gloves.  </P> <P> "Suppose you get shot," she cried, blocking the door with her body.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to get shot," I assured her. "Nobody wants to shoot me."  </P> <P> "It's happening to people in Washington every day. Don't you ever watch Dan  Rather on television?"  </P> <P> "The odds are still in my favor. I'm going to stay out of the neighborhoods  where the shooting takes place."  </P> <P> "So let's say you make it to the office. What about the asbestos in your  ceiling?" she asked. "Doesn't that make you think twice about going to work?"  </P> <P> "I'm in a new building. It's been inspected."  </P> <P> "What are your plans for the lunch hour?"  </P> <P> "I'm not sure yet, why?"  </P> <P> "Whatever you do don't take a flight to Europe. The PLO is threatening to  hijack a plane."  </P> <P> "I'm glad you warned me. I probably would have flown to Shannon for corned beef  and cabbage. Anything else I should be on the lookout for?"  </P> <P> "The air is supposed to be foul today. I wouldn't go jogging if I were you, and  don't stare at your computer screen too long or you'll go blind."  </P> <P> "Was that on the 'Today' show?"  </P> <P> "No, '60 Minutes.' "  </P> <P> "I got it. So what aren't we going to have for dinner tonight?"  </P> <P> "We're not eating any fish until they stop spawning in acid rain."  </P> <P> "Enough chitchat. Give me my construction worker's helmet and a kiss and I'll  be off."  </P> <P> She hugged me as June Allyson always does in her pictures and whispered, "Have  a nice day."  </P></p>

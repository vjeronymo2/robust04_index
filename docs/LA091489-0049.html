			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARVARD AT BEVERLY HILLS  </P> <P> In its opener, Beverly Hills showed little defense against Lompoc and none  against tailback Napoleon Kaufman, who led the Braves to a 45-24 rout of the  Normans. Kaufman scored four touchdowns, including one on a 95-yard kickoff  return and another on a 73-yard interception. He rushed for more than 140 yards  as well.  </P> <P> Harvard lost in its debut, to Blair, 10-8, but the Saracens received a standout  performance from junior defensive back-wide receiver Iheanyi Uwaezuoke , who  was born in Nigeria. Uwaezuoke, who presents difficulties not only to opponents  but also to game announcers, was particularly effective on defense, making 10  solo tackles, forcing a fumble and knocking down a pass.  </P> <P> The Normans will play host to the Saracens at 3 p.m. Friday.  </P></p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Books: The black hill and beyond - Anthony Curtis reviews the work of a Welsh poet who found inspiration both inside and outside his native country COLLECTED POEMS 1945-1990 by R S Thomas Dent Pounds 25, 548 pages CYMRU OR WALES? by R S Thomas Gomer Pounds 3.75, 32 pages HENRY VAUGHAN, David Jones, Vernon Watkins, Dylan Thomas, R S Thomas - there is a continuing tradition of Welsh poets who write in English, and English poetry would be much impoverished without them. Sometimes their work has its origin in native Welsh experience, like Watkins's Ballad of the Mari Lwyd; at others it stems from the poet's sense of being a part of a European tradition with roots in classical Greece and Rome, as may be seen in the many fine translations that Watkins made into English verse from Homer, Dante, Ronsard, Baudelaire, Goethe, Rilke. There is a similar double-vision in the work of R S Thomas, who celebrated his 80th birthday on March 29 with a massive volume containing his poetic output over the best part of half a century. In many of the poems Thomas appears as the poet of rural Wales, portraying individually named farm-workers, their wives and children, the inhabitants of his parish, seen against a sharply etched background. One figure constantly recurs - Iago Prytherch, the labourer, a Welsh Piers Plowman, whose harsh life Thomas never tires of describing. Yet there are also many poems in the R S Thomas canon that transport the reader far from Welsh concerns. Kierkegaard and Wallace Stevens are two non-Welshmen who ignite Thomas's muse; so do many French painters. One of his recent books, Ingrowing Thoughts (1985) was entirely devoted to poems based on modern art, starting with Picasso and Matisse, concluding with Magritte, Max Ernst and Roland Penrose. Whether he is writing about a Welsh milkmaid or Matisse's 'Portrait of a Girl in a Yellow Dress', Thomas's approach remains the same. He stands back from the object of his contemplation, recreating its appearance in carefully structured words, and letting it serve, by the close, as a general reflection on the human condition. The language is austere, the rhymes sparse, the mood often bitter. For much of his life Thomas wrote his poetry while serving as a minister of the Church, in 1936 at Chirk on the Welsh border, and then among the hill farmers of Montgomeryshire; but the reader who expects a God-centred lyricism, hymning the Welsh countryside, will be disappointed. It was that other Thomas - Dylan - who composed odes in praise of innocence and sunshine at harvest-time, who sang of 'the round Zion of the waterbead and the synagogue of the ear of corn', not this one. By contrast Rev Thomas watches his parishioner Evans, 'On his way to the fields, where he hoes/ up one roe of mangolds and down/ The next one' and just in case we should be so foolish as to think that the poet is glorifying Evans as some kind of latter-day Wordsworthian solitary, he adds: 'You needn't wonder/ What goes on in his mind, there is nothing/ Going on there . . . ' To find Thomas's sense of a connection between his two careers, the Church and literature, one needs to consult the introduction he made in 1967 to his selection from the poetry of George Herbert. He speaks there of: 'The possibility of a fruitful relationship between Christianity and poetry. The bridge between the two latter is the Incarnation. If poetry is concerned with the concrete and the particular, then Christianity aims at their redemption and consecration. The poet invents the metaphor, and the Christian lives it'. These complementary approaches to human suffering act together in his own work and underlie a dialogue that runs right through it. Thomas finds it difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile himself to the miserable and often futile lives of the ordinary men and women in his pastoral care. 'The great problems,' he writes in one characteristically short laconic poem, 'Remain, stubborn, unsolved'. One of the saddest tasks a priest has to perform is to be present at the deathbed of one of his flock whom he has known and loved. Father Gerard Manley Hopkins watched the farrier Felix Randall 'pining, pining' until, wasted with disease, he died. But then, miraculously, that poem did end on a redemptive note, as Hopkins remembered Felix as he was formerly, full of health and strength, and making for 'the great grey drayhorse his bright and battering sandal]' In Thomas's poem 'The Mill' he describes how he would pay regular visits to a miller confined to his bed for nine years before he died. The poem ends with no spark of redemption: 'The great frame rotted/ While the past's slow stream,/ Flowing through his head,/ Kept the rusty mill/ Of the mind turning  / It was I it ground'. Thomas deals with the condition of Wales in several of his poems in the same spirit of ruthless candour. He is a passionately committed nationalist appalled by much that he sees going on around him. He was 30 before he learnt to speak Welsh but he wishes that he and the other Welsh poets I mention had written in their own indigenous language. He deeply resents, as he says in his outspoken pamphlet Cymru or Wales?, 'the effects of an English life-style, English thought processes and the English vocabulary . . . ' However, as I hope I have indicated, this resentment has not prevented Thomas in his poetry from attaining to a great mastery over the English language.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (12): Falling output lies ahead - The sector's outlook is being coloured by a drop in new car sales in continental Europe / The motor industry UK CAR production for export markets has proved surprisingly resilient during the first eight months of 1993, but the industry fears a steep fall in output in the final months of the year. Several of the carmakers operating in the UK are being forced to reduce production in response to the continuing sharp fall in new car sales in continental Europe. Car output for export markets in the first eight months of the year at 347,479 was 4.8 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago, as rising output from the three Japanese carmakers, Nissan, Toyota and Honda offset lower production from Ford, Vauxhall and Peugeot. Nissan too is being forced to reduce production sharply in November and December, however, as its reacts to the weakness of continental European demand. It exports around 80 per cent of the output of its Pounds 900m Sunderland car plant. 'It now appears likely that following a number of production cutbacks the British-based industry will this year produce no more than it did in 1992,' Geoffrey Whalen, president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, warned recently. The benefit of higher car sales in the UK was being neutralised by the fall in exports to continental Europe. Car production still outperformed many other sectors of manufacturing during the UK recession, however, as exports compensated for the sharp fall in domestic sales. UK car output in 1992 at 1.29m was less than 1 per cent below the 1.3m level of 1989, despite the 31 per cent fall in UK new car sales in the same period. Car output for export markets accounted for 45.6 per cent of total UK car production in 1992 and for 48.9 per cent in 1991 compared with only 21.6 per cent in 1989. In the longer-term exports are again expected to be the force behind rising UK car output in the second half of the 1990s, as production builds up at car plants being developed by Toyota and Honda. Ford and General Motors (Vauxhall), the US carmakers, have both integrated their UK assembly plants into their European production networks. Both had started to export a significant share of their UK car output, until the recession in continental Europe forced them to apply the brakes to the export effort this year. Rover Group, the motor vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, is bucking the trend. It is performing well in continental European markets despite the steep decline in overall European new car sales. In the first six months of the year Rover and Land Rover worldwide vehicle sales increased by 13 per cent to 202,100. Rover is starting to reap the benefits of a concentrated effort to build up its dealer networks in France, Germany and Italy, and it is enjoying particular success with its Land Rover Discovery four-wheel drive leisure/utility vehicle. But for now the overall outlook for UK production and exports is being coloured by the sharp downturn in new car sales in continental Europe. In the first eight months of the year sales were 16 per cent lower than in the same period a year earlier.  ---------------------------------------------              MOTOR INDUSTRY  --------------------------------------------- Rank   Motor             Exports     % chng 1992   companies            1992      on 91  --------------------------------------------- 4      Ford Motor        2,195.6      -18.9        Rover Group       1,159.0       -3.2 13     Nissan              911.4       33.7 15     Vauxhall            754.2       21.6 23     Jaguar              506.4       -5.6 32     Lucas               365.8       -4.9 33     New Holland Ford    351.4       30.0 34     Peugeot Talbot      337.7       -7.5 43     Cummins UK          284.6       11.6 48     T &amp; N               256.0       -1.2 62     Michelin            199.3        0.5 68     Goodyear            169.0        9.0 81     Pirelli             125.3       24.9 88     BBA                 110.2       -2.0 96     GKN                  94.0        3.3  --------------------------------------------- Total                    7,819.9       -1.4  ---------------------------------------------</p>

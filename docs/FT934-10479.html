			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Leyland Daf announces Pounds 30m modernisation plan LEYLAND Daf Vans is operating profitably nine months after its management buy-out from administrative receivership. It will be able to fund a Pounds 30m product modernisation programme from earnings, Mr Allan Amey, chief executive, said yesterday. Gradual recovery in the UK commercial vehicle market and the revival of exports to continental Europe has put the Birmingham-based company on course to achieve its output target of 12,000 units and a Pounds 150m turnover next year, said Mr Amey. This compares with 5,000 vehicles built since the buy-out in April. Until February the company had been part of the Anglo-Dutch Daf commercial vehicles group, which absorbed the formerly UK state-owned Leyland Vehicles in 1987. The group collapsed at the beginning of this year. Mr Amey, who projected output of a further 2,000 vans between now and the end of the year, said the company could operate profitably at a volume of 10,000 units a year, including provision for the Pounds 30m product programme, which is to be completed within the next two to three years. He said the company had signed a contract with design consultancy Hawtal Whiting to update the existing 200 and 400 model van ranges. The company is discussing the revival of sales through some Daf dealers in continental Europe, following the rescue of the Dutch truckmaker. Export sales should reach 2,000-3,000 next year. The company also plans a substantial restructuring of its operations to more than halve the number of its component suppliers to fewer than 200. Mr Amey was speaking as Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders statistics showed that the UK market for panel vans, the sector in which the company competes, jumped by about 18 per cent in October compared with the same month a year ago.</p>

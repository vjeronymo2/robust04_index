			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- Some 100,000 billion rubles  will be enlisted to finance investment projects in Russia. Such  a chance will appear thanks to several measures taken by the  Russian Government to step up investment activities, Russian  Deputy Economics Minister Andrey Shapovalyants said here on  Thursday. The deputy minister spoke at the international  conference on oil and gas in Moscow, which was organised in  connection with the international Neftegaz-94 exhibition.    As a result of these measures, the government plans to  retain  the volume of investments in 1994 at least at the level of last  year. However, the share of federal investments will drop by  15-20 per cent.    Shapovalyants called the emerging transition from state to  project financing of all investment programmes a key measure  capable of stepping up sharply investment processes. According  to the deputy minister, this means the state's departure from  monopoly participation in these programmes and transition to  share investments.    The practice of funds' distribution which took place in the  past, will be replaced with enlistment of various resources,  apart from state funds, from local budgets as well as  participation of private and foreign investments. Priority will  be given to projects whose share of non-federal funds will total  at least 50 per cent.    In the deputy minister's opinion, the decision to re-assess  fixed industrial assets and their regular indexation will also  help to boost the volume of investments. Apart from this, tax  privileges will be given to any form of investments, including  acquisition of securities and creation of authorised capital.  The purpose-oriented enlistment of credits for investment will  be also stimulated with tax privileges. In 1994, Shapovalyants  continued, the government will preserve easy-term investment  crediting for projects launched in 1992. The government is now  reviewing the procedure of forming extra-budgetary funds. In  future, they will be converted into insurance funds to protect  investments from all types of risks. It is planned to establish  such a fund at first in the gas industry and then to start their  creation in other fuel and energy industries.</p>

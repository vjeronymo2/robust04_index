			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Ex-Spring Ram chiefs to launch new venture A GROUP of ex-Spring Ram executives, led by co-founder Mr Bob Murray, has got together to launch a home products company that will include kitchens and bathrooms - the territories where their former employer has flourished. Mr Murray, who resigned from Spring Ram Corporation in 1990, has gathered four of his former colleagues in a company called Omega. They are: Mr Francis Galvin, who was the main board director responsible for kitchens; Mr Martin Croxen, ex-managing director of the property subsidiary Ramfield; Mr Henry Johnston, ex-production director at Spring Bathrooms; and Mr Newton Winfield, ex-managing director of Ram Bathrooms. The four, who left between October last year and February this year, say their departures were unrelated to problems that have since emerged at another Spring Ram subsidiary, Balterley Bathrooms, causing considerable damage to the group's share price in the past few weeks. Because a dispute developed last winter over whether some of them should serve out two years' notice, Mr Galvin and the others concerned are legally bound not to sell products competing with Spring Ram until May 7 next year. Meanwhile they are about to move from Leeds to an industrial park off the M62 to continue planning the launch of various consumer products. The portfolio of brand names acquired so far includes Hepplewhite Kitchens, Taps UK, Thomas Hope, Thomas Sheraton and Leeds Pottery Company. As with Spring Ram, building factories on greenfield sites will be part of the formula. But they say Omega will be more diversified than Spring Ram and 'pan-European'. Factory building is due to start next year and the first products are expected to come to market in 1994.</p>

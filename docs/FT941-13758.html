			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: France After the 22 per cent rise in the CAC 40 last year, the French bourse has started 1994 in more subdued mood. As elsewhere, the worry is whether the economy can deliver the performance the market's rating now demands. The French government's obsession with a strong franc at the cost of high real interest rates has squeezed the economy hard. Unemployment remains above 12 per cent. Consumer confidence is fragile. Official statistics suggest the French economy is on a slight upward track. But there could be a sharper rebound in corporate earnings this year. The high levels of provisioning, which caused corporate earnings to undershoot expectations last year, could produce a suspiciously strong recovery in 1994. The other great hope is that continuing interest rate cuts will cause an avalanche of cash to slide from money market funds into equities. That, though, will be at least partially absorbed by new equity issues. Quite apart from the FFr55bn of privatisation sales pencilled in for this year, the corporate sector will continue to launch rights issues to ease strained balance sheets. The market will thus probably remain jumpy until the economic uncertainties are resolved. The savage treatment handed out to Alcatel-Alsthom after issuing a profits warnings suggests it will be unforgiving of any disappointment. That makes privatisation of Elf Aquitaine a particularly delicate task. Its payment of an uncovered dividend shows how keen it is to underpin the shares. But the French government cannot afford to be over-ambitious about the sale price.</p>

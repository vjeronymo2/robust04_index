			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IPPOLITO HANGS IN, HELIX BEATS EL CAPITAN  </P> <P> The seventh-ranked El Capitan baseball team looked as if it had everything it  would need Wednesday when it played host to No. 8 Helix in a Grossmont 3-A  League baseball game.  </P> <P> For starters, the Vaqueros had won six consecutive games and nine of their past  10. El Capitan also had a team ERA of 1.87.  </P> <P> For inspiration, the Vaqueros had center fielder Jeremy Ellis, who two weeks  ago underwent an emergency appendectomy.  </P> <P> But what El Capitan did not have on its side was pitcher Rob Ippolito and  history.  </P> <P> Ippolito struck out four of the last five batters he faced to lead Helix to a  5-1 victory -- its 16th in the past 18 meetings between the two teams.  </P> <P> The victory was doubly important for Helix (13-4, 3-0), which took over sole  possession of first place over El Capitan (11-5, 2-1). First, the Highlanders  came back after having their 21-game winning streak over Grossmont Conference  teams halted by Grossmont, 12-1, Friday. And, perhaps more important, Ippolito  pitched a strong sixth and seventh innings.  </P> <P> The book on Ippolito was that he had been tiring after the fifth this season.  </P> <P> "We knew he'd tire after five innings," said Steve Vickery, El Capitan coach.  "I told the guys that it's a 21-out game, and we just have to hang in there."  </P> <P> Jerry Schniepp, the Helix coach, was also keeping a close eye on his starter.  </P> <P> "He'd kind of run on empty after the fifth," Schniepp said. "He was tired in  the sixth and seventh, but he just sucked it up."  </P> <P> With one out in the sixth and runners on first and second thanks to a walk and  an error, Ippolito struck out the No. 4 and 5 batters to end the inning.  </P> <P> In the seventh, Ippolito (6-1) struck out the first two batters and got Mike  Farrell to pop up to the catcher to end the game.  </P></p>

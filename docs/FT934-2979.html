			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Litton subsidiary buys back shares for Dollars 558m Litton Industries' oil services subsidiary, Western Atlas, is to pay Dollars 558m to buy back a block of its own shares as part of a series of measures to shape it as a free-standing company. Western Atlas will pay Dollars 358m in cash and Dollars 200m in seven-year notes to buy the 29.5 per cent of its shares held by Dresser, another oil services company. Western Atlas, which derives 60 per cent of its annual Dollars 2bn sales from oil services and the rest from industrial automation, is expected to be spun off before the end of the year. Litton shareholders will receive one share in the new company for each Litton share they own. Litton added that it would take an after-tax charge of Dollars 172m in the current quarter to reflect the accelerated depreciation of some of Western Atlas' assets. The subsidiary specialises in the use of information technology in exploration and drilling operations and demand for the newest technology had been stronger than expected, forcing the accelerated write-downs of older equipment. Mr Alton Brann, president and chief executive, said the purchase would allow both Litton and Dresser to concentrate on their core businesses.</p>

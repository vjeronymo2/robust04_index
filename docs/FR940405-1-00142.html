			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comment stated that comparison of test products indicated that the mean UVA-PF of the vehicle (1.7), the 7-percent padimate O product (1.8), and the 2-percent oxybenzone product (1.8) were similar. The 5-percent oxybenzone product (2.1) and the 4-percent titanium dioxide product (3.0) were both significantly greater than the other three products. The titanium dioxide product was significantly greater than the 5-percent oxybenzone product. Although overall statistical analysis detected significant site-by-product interaction, the individual results indicate that this was primarily a quantitative interaction effect. The comment maintained that the consistency of the results was encouraging, considering that this was the first experience in reading the IPD response for most of the participating sites. The comment stated that these data indicate that the IPD procedure can reliably discriminate among products that provide meaningful long wavelength UVA protection. The comment proposed using a base size of 20 subjects per test and a 4-percent titanium dioxide product as a control to be run concurrently with each subject. The comment proposed that the UVA-PF be the lower 95 percent confidence interval subtracted from the mean.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three comments recommended using an IPD test based upon two recent publications (Refs. 22 and 23). One study (Ref. 22) used a Xenon lamp equipped with a dichroic mirror filtered with 1-mm WG345, 1-mm WG320, and 1-mm UG11 filters. The exposure increments were programmed in arithmetic increments of 2 Joules per square centimeter (J/cm2). On protected skin, the increments were 3 or 4 J/cm2. Application density of the test sunscreen products was 2 milligrams per cm2. Visual assessment of pigmentation was done immediately after exposure and was performed on the basis of a homogenous pigmentation with well-defined borders as endpoints. The UVA-PF is determined as the ratio of minimal IPD dose with protection to the minimal IPD dose without protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other study (Ref. 23) recommends the use of xenon or metal halide sources, or a xenon/metal halide combination, with continuous spectra restricted to the UVA spectrum (320 to 390 nm) with filters, such as 3-mm WG335 and 1-mm UG5. Six UVA doses ranging from 4 to about 30 J/cm2 are applied in 50 percent increments to subjects with skin types II, III, and IV. The study states that with potential free interpolation, this is actually a 25-percent progression. The doses applied on the protected skin are multiplied by the expected UVA-PF of the product under test. Observation of the responses are delayed for at least 1 hour, and typically 2 hours, after exposure. The study states that results are less variable if read at 2 hours. A simultaneous determination of the minimal IPD doses on protected and unprotected skin is done at the same time in standard room and illumination conditions. Other parameters concerning the test area, size of test sites, product application density, selection of volunteers, etc. follow the same current standards as for the SPF determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments objected to the use of the IPD testing method. One comment stated that the action spectrum for the IPD response is flat and quite dissimilar from the action spectrum for damage to the skin from ultraviolet light for erythema, skin cancer, or photoaging of the skin. The comment contended that the IPD response has not been demonstrated to be a direct or surrogate endpoint for biological damage and, therefore, there is no relationship between a product's ability to prevent IPD and to prevent damage to the skin. The comment added that IPD has been shown to be unstable, variable, and nonlinear. Another comment stated that the IPD reaction shows nonreciprocal behavior, i.e., the severity of the reaction depends upon the time taken to deliver a certain dose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment noted that there are two methods of assessing UVA protection that are referred to as IPD. The comment stated that these two methods differ in the amount of energy needed to produce a response and the time after irradiation at which the endpoint is read. In one method, the response is read at 45 seconds after exposure. This response is transient and has been shown to be highly variable and nonreproducible. The response is oxygen-dependent and can only be elicited in darker skin types. In the second method, the response is read at 2 to 4 hours after exposure and uses a much higher dose of UVA. The test causes a persistent pigment response in the skin that may last up to several hours. The comment maintained that the action spectrum for the persistent pigment endpoint has been neither determined nor published.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

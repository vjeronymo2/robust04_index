			<p>CSO     [Text] INTEC will be mutually linked through packet  switching networks operated by Sprint International, the  international division of Sprint, a U.S. long-distance telephone  company. Linkage of networks of the two companies will provide  for an integrated system offering international data  communications services. They will offer improved services  encompassing an expansion of service areas and increased  sophistication in services offered.    INTEC and Sprint signed an "International Communications  Mutual Linkage Contract." Based on this contract, INTEC's packet  switching net known as "Ace Telenet" will link up with and use  the "Sprint Net Service"--operated by Japan Sprint, Sprint  International's Japanese subsidiary--as a gateway. This  arrangement will enable INTEC to provide services without  changing its status as a domestic special class II operator.    INTEC's service area will expand to over 40 countries.  Currently, it services 10 countries, including the United  States, Great Britain and Southeast Asia, but the service areas  will be expanded geographically to include Australia, South  America, the European continent and the former Soviet republics.    Services offered will be expanded from the current rate  system based on volume of usage to fixed rate systems and rates  for circuit use which bypasses Japan. Companies with branches in  multiple overseas locations can utilize a variety of services  with options covering such aspects as purpose, data volume,  optimum linkage times as well as arrange direct communication  links between their overseas branches and billing and settlement  of service fees on a consolidated basis via their Japan  headquarters.    INTEC is scheduled to initiate the new services effective  the  first part of April. It claims that its fees will be 10 to 30  percent lower than those of other long-distance service  companies.</p>

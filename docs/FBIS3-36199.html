			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Timofeyev report: "I Fly Where I Want"] </F>   [Text] A report which has appeared in Turkey's HURRIYET is  worrying. It essentially says that Russian and Ukrainian civil  airliners are transporting arms from Syria to Armenia.    The conclusion was drawn on the basis that Turkish Air Force  technical devices have apparently registered the landing in  Yerevan of airplanes which have not stopped over in Odessa and  Sochi. But, as your KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent was told  at the Russian Federation Air Transportation Department, such  flights are scarcely possible without the sanction of official  aviation authorities.    Admittedly, a lot of private air companies have appeared  recently which do not come under the control of ministries or  departments. Once they have licenses for international  transportation, they practically cease to be supervised by state  organs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  met with visiting U.S. Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff  Friday morning to discuss joint Korea-U.S. action on the North  Korean nuclear row.    During the hour-plus meeting at Chongwadae, they shared the  view that a resolution on sanctions against North Korea will  inevitably be adopted by the United Nations Security Council    Senior Presidential Press Secretary Chu Ton-sik told  reporters that President Kim and Tarnoff agreed the firm  relations between Korea and the United States were easing  Koreans' anxiety over the nuclear wrangling.    Tarnoff said that "despite the escalating tension on the  Korean peninsula, Koreans are wisely coping with it and this is  impressive."    President Kim offered an explanation: "Korean people are now  mature enough to trust the government's security policies as the  government does not exploit security issues for political power  any more."    "Some Americans worry about the security of Korea, but they  will be relieved to see Koreans' firm security posture and  maturity," the undersecretary noted.    As to former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's planned visit to  Pyongyang, President Kim expressed some concern. "Kim Il-song is  likely to utilize Carter's visit as a tactic of dialogue and  smile toward the Western community," he said.    Tarnoff explained President Bill Clinton believes that  Carter's trip should not be an obstacle to UN Security Council  sanctions against North Korea.    Touching on North Korea's repeated call for direct talks  with  the United States, Kim and Tarnoff agreed it was a tactic  designed to secure the withdrawal of American troops from South  Korea.    Earlier in the day, Tarnoff held talks with Deputy Prime  Minister Yi Hong-ku on similar issues.</p>

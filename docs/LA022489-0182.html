			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> RAIDERS SIGN BILLS' HELLESTRAE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Raiders today signed free agent lineman Dale Hellestrae, who  finished the 1988 NFL season as a starting guard for the AFC East champion  Buffalo Bills. Hellestrae, 26, was left on the Bills' unprotected list when the  NFL's new free-agency system went into operation Feb. 1. Hellestrae, a 6-foot-5  285-pounder, was a fourth-round draft choice of the Bills in 1985 after he  completed his college career at Southern Methodist. He was a reserve interior  lineman and long snapper for Buffalo until earning a starting berth last  season. Among the games started by Hellestrae was one Dec. 11 when the Bills  beat the Raiders 37-21 at Buffalo.  </P></p>

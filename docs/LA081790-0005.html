			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DATA BANK TAKES ON DAY-LABORER PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Michael MacBeane of Santa Clarita says he may have found a way to get day  laborers off the streets and into regular jobs.  </P> <P> And all it will take, MacBeane says, is his personal computer, some volunteers  and some willing employers.  </P> <P> On Thursday morning MacBeane, 23, unveiled plans for a computerized job bank to  match employers with the scores of Latino laborers who gather at street corners  along San Fernando Road in Newhall each morning in search of a day's work.  Merchants up and down the street have complained in recent months that large  crowds of workers scare off customers and create a public nuisance.  </P> <P> MacBeane's idea is simple: Workers will enter their names in the job bank,  indicating what kind of work they can handle. When an employer needs workers,  the job bank will pass on the name of laborers and where they can be reached.  If the workers don't have telephones, the job bank will pass on messages.  </P> <P> "They won't have to sit on the street anymore," MacBeane said as he showed off  the bilingual computer program at The Mail Handler, a postal outlet MacBeane  owns along San Fernando Road.  </P> <P> MacBeane said he has enlisted the aid of Centro de Amor, a Latino religious  organization down the street, which will serve as headquarters for the program.  MacBeane has notified about 65 restaurants and construction companies that the  service is available and, beginning today, volunteers will help enter  information into the computer and distribute flyers announcing the new job  bank.  </P> <P> MacBeane said he launched the free program because he is concerned about the  impact the laborers are having on businesses, including his own, along San  Fernando Road. MacBeane said the job bank is a practical solution to a  frustrating problem. It also would treat the laborers with dignity.  </P> <P> "They're there for employment," he said in their defense. "They're not there to  loiter."  </P> <P> Jamie Sweezer, a legal clerk who helped MacBeane organize the job bank, said  some merchants complain about the laborers but do nothing constructive to solve  the problem. "Their solution is to call the police," Sweezer said.  </P> <P> MacBeane said he does not condone the hiring of undocumented workers but said  he will not ask the laborers for proof of citizenship. That's a matter for the  employers, not the job bank, he said.  </P> <P> Many Santa Clarita Valley residents mistakenly believe that all of the workers  are in the United States illegally, he added. "That is not the case," he said.  </P> <P> MacBeane said he hopes to win the backing of the Santa Clarita City Council,  which has asked its staff to develop possible solutions to the day-laborer  problem. The council is scheduled to hear staff proposals on the issue this  month.  </P> <P> Some Southern California cities have created hiring programs for day laborers,  but such an effort by a private citizen is virtually unheard of, said social  workers familiar with the laborers.  </P> <P> "It sounds like one of these unique individuals who says, 'Enough of this. I'm  going to do something,' " said Leo Guerra, who specializes in day-laborer  issues for Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, an immigrant rights group in North  Hollywood.  </P> <P> "I have to hand it to him," said Alfredo Vasquez, a Los Angeles County  community worker in Newhall. "There is no other merchant in the area offering  something like that."  </P> <P> A few laborers in Newhall seemed skeptical when told of the new job bank  Thursday.  </P> <P> When asked if they would use the service, they shrugged their shoulders and one  gave a noncommittal "maybe."  </P></p>

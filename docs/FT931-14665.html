			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Food: Lunch for a fiver - ready for take-off / The latest updates on the Weekend FT's eating out scheme AN INKLING that 'Lunch for a Fiver' was going to be a success occurred when my phone rang at 9.30am on Monday. It was the man who handles public relations for one of the best-known Park Lane hotels. 'Was it too late,' he wondered, 'for the hotel to be included in the scheme?' This year we had to disappoint, but such has been the response and interest that any future schemes which we plan will try to satisfy more restaurateurs and hoteliers and even more customers. This week's list of restaurants includes several small amendments to that which appeared last Saturday. Firstly, the FT's computer list omitted one restaurant entirely, 192 of 192 Kensington Park Road, London W11 2JF (071-229-0482), which is not open for lunch on Mondays. The omission was particularly ironic since a letter from 192's managing director, Tony Mackintosh, had been one of the first, enthusiastic responses. It read: 'Of course we are in for your scheme. Great idea. Hope it is a huge success.' Then the owners of Daphne's in Draycott Avenue, London SW3, phoned to say that builders who were working there would still be on the premises on January 18 and that, therefore, it would have to withdraw. So if you live in that area try instead Walton's or Turner's, both just around the corner in Walton Street. To keep the same number of participating restaurants, I am pleased to add Le Cafe des Amis du Vin, 11-14 Hanover Place, Covent Garden, London WC2, (tel 071-379-3444). One change of nationality over the New Year: the Machino Japanese Restaurant has become the Young Bin Kwan Korean restaurant. One Chelsea restaurateur, Tom Benham of Monkeys, SW3, reported that although bookings were excellent, some of his callers were asking whether bread rolls were included in the Pounds 5 and what was the price of his mineral water. Fortunately, this seems to be an isolated case of mean-mindedness. Overall, readers have responded with warm enthusiasm to the restaurant trade's answer to the January sales. Brian Clivaz, general manager of Simpson's in-the-Strand, reported that within three days he had received 365 bookings and that some of those booking 'Lunch for a Fiver' had at the same time booked tables for when the scheme was not running simply because they were on the phone. One restaurant in the City started its Pounds 5 lunch four days early to meet demand while Adlard's, in Norwich, Norfolk, was booked out for the entire two weeks by Thursday last week. Carlton Television, London's new regional station, is planning to feature the scheme and interview several participating restaurants during the coming week. And so far there has been only one disappointed customer. A friend, an excellent cook and a woman with a slim waist but a wonderful appetite, faxed me to say that with business lunches at Pounds 5, she felt she could justify the cost of the flight from Boston, in the US, to London. Sadly, she could not persuade the company president to let her come.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WANT TO GO WILD WEST IN HIGH STYLE? CALL NEIMAN MARCUS  </P> <P> Neiman Marcus is inviting its well-heeled clientele to put on a pair of spurs  and recapture the Wild West.  </P> <P> The Dallas-based retailer began delivery Tuesday of its Christmas catalogue,  the annual wish book of the wealthy. For one cowpoke with $108,000, Neiman's  will sell a hand-tooled saddle by Edward H. Bohlin Co., lavishly furnished with  sterling silver and 18-karat gold.  </P> <P> A cowboy ain't a cowboy without a horse, so for $4,000 and up Neiman Marcus is  offering a selection of champion-bloodline painted horses from the Real Ranch.  Those wishing to recreate the cattle drives of the Old West can reserve a pony  to ride herd for a weekend at a ranch.  </P> <P> "Texas is really in right now," Neiman spokeswoman Jan Roberts said. "From the  President to 'Lonesome Dove,' Texas and the West are in vogue. . . . We thought  we should get back to our roots."  </P></p>

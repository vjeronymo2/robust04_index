			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 18 May HOMMIKULEHT, RAHVA HAAL, p 3: "News Bulletin" </F> No. 95/94]    [Excerpts] There are no technical problems with the  dismantling of the reactors in Paldiski, Energy Minister Arvo  Niitenberg declared yesterday. He added that the Russian side  has overpoliticised the issue and is using it to exert pressure  on Estonia.    Niitenberg, who chairs a four-minister government  commission,  announced that another commission will be formed to coordinate  Estonia's general activities in the liquidation of the Paldiski  military base. Russia has not yet announced the starting date  and wants to conclude a single agreement on the dismantling and  the removal of nuclear fuel. [passage omitted]    Government representative Juri Tikk added that cases of  arson  have become frequent in Paldiski and three Russians suspected of  attempted arson had been stopped at the Russian submariners'  training centre last week. The arsonists generally attack  buildings turned over to the Estonian authorities, Tikk added.</p>

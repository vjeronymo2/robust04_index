			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: Italian bank raises dividend Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest banking group in terms of assets, is to pay a L360 a share dividend for 1993, compared with L300 for 1992, in spite of only a small improvement in net profits. Operating profits rose by 29.9 per cent to L2,257bn (Dollars 1.37bn), with falling interest rates reflecting favourably on bond dealings, but net profits rose by only 1.4 per cent to L636bn. Total assets, which were 6.3 per cent higher at L189,900bn, take into account the merger towards the end of the year with Banca Provinciale Lombarda and Banco Lariano. The bank said that careful cost control had allowed it to absorb the costs of the merger. However, the narrowing of interest rate differentials and debt restructuring of troubled industrial groups limited net interest income to L3,978bn, a rise of 1.9 per cent. Difficult economic conditions restricted loans, and provisions for bad debts totalled more than L700bn, of which L190bn is not fiscally deductible. A further L226bn of unpaid interest is unlikely to be recovered. The ratio of bad debts to the bank's overall loans has risen from 3.3 per cent to 4.3 per cent but is below the average for the banking system.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> PROTEST-SIGN PAINTER PLEADS NOT GUILTY  </P> <P> A Ventura County woman pleaded not guilty Wednesday to three counts of  violating zoning ordinances for painting signs on her fence and on the side of  her house to protest an oil-waste dump buried beneath her old neighborhood.  </P> <P> Lynda Paxton, a former resident of the Oxnard Dunes neighborhood, painted the  words "Our Home Toxic Dump" on her fence and "Our Own Love Canal" on her house.  </P> <P> Although Paxton moved from the neighborhood in June, 1989, she still owns the  property.  </P> <P> The city of Oxnard took action against Paxton last month because the signs  violate an ordinance that requires her to get approval from the city's planning  director before changing the exterior color, material and design of her  residence, said Assistant City Atty. Charles Wessler.  </P> <P> But Paxton called the situation ludicrous. "Innocent victims are being  prosecuted criminally . . . when people who defraud, I mean the developer, go  scot-free," she said.  </P> <P> Paxton's signs were designed to bring attention to the oil-waste dump that was  found in 1985 beneath the 100-parcel subdivision known as the Oxnard Dunes. She  is among 175 residents who filed a $3.5-million lawsuit in 1986 against 120  defendants, including developers, real estate agents, oil companies, previous  landowners and landfill operators.  </P> <P> The preliminary hearing on the zoning charges was scheduled Jan. 7. Paxton will  represent herself. VIVIAN LOUIE  </P></p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Northern Foods The market may fret about the death of the brand but Northern Foods, at least, shows that there can be life beyond the grave for food manufacturers. Acting as the hired hand for the big supermarket chains can be a healthy enough business as Northern's 21 per cent advance in annual pre-tax profits demonstrates. The company's extensive rationalisation programme may even enable trading margins to climb above 10 per cent this year. Few food manufacturers, branded or otherwise, can boast that. Such considerations make Northern's 16 per cent underperformance against the food manufacturing sector over the past year rather puzzling. The company's earnings growth may tend towards the respectable rather than racy, but a forward multiple of under 12 hardly demands a lot. Northern's rating has been depressed by the uncertainties in the dairy market ahead of the reform of the Milk Marketing Board. With half its profits flowing from its dairy businesses, Northern has a critical interest in the outcome. But although the industry's profitability may well decline over the long run, Northern should still be able to skim off a fair amount of cream. Unlike many commodity food businesses, milk may retain some premium for quality. The challenge facing Northern will be to recycle its cash flow quickly enough into higher margin businesses to ensure continued growth. The 51 per cent rise in operating profits from convenience foods suggests it could well be up to the mark.</p>

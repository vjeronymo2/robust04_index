			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMISSIONER ROXANI GILLESPIE AND PROPOSITION 103 ROLLBACKS  </P> <P> In response to your editorial on Proposition 103 ("Next Step for Proposition  103," Sept. 5) and granting the fact that editorial pages are repositories of  opinion rather than fact, nonetheless, I believe your editorial writer erred in  stating "Gillespie does not seem interested in making her former colleagues  abide by the new law."  </P> <P> As I understand it, Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie is abiding by the  law. The California Supreme Court decided that the companies were entitled to a  "fair and reasonable rate of return." The hearings being held are to determine  whether companies are to be granted exemptions from rollbacks or not. I believe  the hearings are entirely in keeping with due process.  </P> <P> It is interesting to me as an insurance broker that the coverage in your  editorial section is so heavily slanted with Harvey Rosenfield and Atty. Gen.  John Van De Kamp. It was Will Rogers who said, "A liberal is man who is willing  to spend somebody else's money." So, apparently, are the editors of The Times.  </P> <P> WILLIAM A.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] It has been a day of sensational developments on  the election front. The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] decided at  the eleventh hour to register conditionally for participation in  next month's election. The party's national chairman, Dr. Frank  Mdlalose, is on his way from Ulundi to Kempton Park by plane to  register the IFP. Over the next four hours -- at midnight -- it  will be all over for political parties that have not yet  registered for the election. [passage omitted]    At Ulundi, the Central Committee of the IFP made a  last-minute decision. For news from Ulundi we switch over live  to Gary Alfonso.    [Alfonso] Good evening from here in Ulundi, where it has  been  a very busy day. Inkatha's Central Committee eventually  decided, after a meeting of more than seven hours, to pass the  resolution that they would in fact register. Dr. Frank Mdlalose  is already on his way to Johannesburg where he will register the  IFP conditionally as a party to take part in the election. TV  News has just spoken to some of the members of the committee  after the meeting and they were all cautiously optimistic. I  have in my hand here the resolution and one of the significant  decisions is of course the first one -- that they will register  conditionally to take part in the election, but they also add  that the decision does not mean that the IFP supports the  current state of discussions or the transitional constitution.  There are two clauses that are perhaps very important at this  stage. The first is that mediation is also necessary to revise  the election process and that of course means that the mediation  can be employed and according to the IFP, to possibly postpone  the election date, and that is what the clause says here. The  role of the king must also be looked at by the mediators.    A little while ago we spoke to Chief Minister Mangosuthu  Buthelezi and this is what he had to say about this decision.    [Begin Buthelezi recording, in English] In the first place,  we don't want anyone to have any illusions that this means any  shift in our position as far as our rejection of the 1993  interim constitution is concerned because we still have those  reservations about that, and really, that is the reason why we  seek international mediation because all the negotiations have  flopped, they have come to naught. So therefore the very first  thing that should be done is mediation itself, and we are very  happy that the ANC [African National Congress] has endorsed this  resolution of the Central Committee passed on the 12th which,  after our discussions with Mr. Mandela, has also been accepted  in principle by the ANC. So Monday, I expect Dr. Mdlalose and a  committee to look at the question of terms of reference for such  a mediation and what kind of people can conduct the mediation  itself. So those are things that come first. So we would like  to make it clear that there can be no progress unless that goes  forward first before we go on to the other steps that we should  be taking in terms of the Electoral Act. And then also we would  like also to say that we expect the mediation also to include  mediation [as heard] -- it should not in any way undermine any  of the steps that his majesty the king has taken as far as the  kwaZulu kingdom is concerned, and we have of course also  informed members of the Freedom Alliance already this afternoon  what we have decided. We were together yesterday and they  endorsed my stand and the stand of the Central Committee at our  meeting in Cape Town, and we are informing them now, and we are  going to meet in that committee where Dr. Mdlalose is, members  of Central Committee present [as heard] as well as members of  the Freedom Alliance. So I hear that also...[interrupted by  announcer] [end recording]</p>

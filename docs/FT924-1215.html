			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Yeltsin's Start treaty claim startles White House RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin caused confusion yesterday by announcing in Beijing that he and outgoing US President George Bush would sign a treaty on the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons in January at a summit in Alaska. At the State Department and at the White House, officials said they were aware neither of a breakthrough on the issues that still divide Russia and the US in the Start II talks, nor of plans for a summit meeting in Alaska. 'We're getting closer. We're hopeful, but that's the best we can say,' said Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin settled the outlines of the Start II agreement at a Washington summit in June, but the details of implementation have been more difficult. Russia agreed to destroy its multiple warhead SS-18 missiles, but does not want the expense of destroying the silos that housed them. In addition, it wants to convert its SS-19 missiles to single warhead carriers, rather than destroying them outright. The third issue dividing the sides is the US's freedom to convert B-1 nuclear bombers to carry conventional weapons. The increasingly acrimonious dispute between the US and Ukraine over the nuclear weapons stationed on Ukrainian territory is also proving an obstacle to ratification of Start. Mr Anatoli Zlenko, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said yesterday that although Ukraine accepted the principles of the treaty and expected eventually to ratify, his government resented western efforts to strong-arm Ukraine into signing now. On Thursday Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, US secretary of state, said the US was 'not particularly happy' with the delay in Ukrainian ratification, and this would affect bilateral relations if it continued much longer.'</p>

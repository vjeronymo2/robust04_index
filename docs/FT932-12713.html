			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Farnell buoyed by acquisition FARNELL Electronics, the components and equipment manufacturer and distributor, reported a 12.5 per cent increase in operating profits reflecting organic growth and a maiden full-year contribution from ESD Distribution. Pre-tax profits in the year to January 31 increased 27 per cent to Pounds 41.6m (Pounds 32.7m) after the sale of a non-trading subsidiary which generated a Pounds 6.36m exceptional profit. Profits were also boosted by interest income of Pounds 1.03m compared to costs of Pounds 468,000 last time. Earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the exceptional item and prior years' tax credit, edged ahead to 17.2p (16.5p). A final dividend of 3.4p is recommended, making a total up 7 per cent to 6.2p (5.8p). Operating profits increased to Pounds 36.3m (Pounds 32.2m) on turnover ahead 24 per cent to Pounds 254.3m (Pounds 204.9m). ESD, which was acquired from STC for Pounds 61m in July 1991, contributed turnover of Pounds 95.8m (Pounds 55.9m) and an operating profit of Pounds 9m (Pounds 5m). However, Mr Richard Hanwell, chairman, emphasised that organic growth, including the expansion into continental Europe, was responsible for more than a quarter of the turnover increase. The core distribution division lifted operating profit to Pounds 36.2m (Pounds 30.5m) on turnover of Pounds 208.8m (Pounds 159.6m). The smaller manufacturing division has been restructured and split into three businesses: power supplies, components and instruments. It reported a reduced Pounds 1.04m (Pounds 2.52m) operating profit on turnover of Pounds 50.5m (Pounds 49.3m). Commenting on the outlook Mr Hanwell said group trading in the first quarter was 10 per cent higher than the comparable 1992 period on a like-for-like basis and said prospects were 'promising.' Farnell's strong cash flow enabled it to reduce debt by Pounds 14m and cut gearing from 17 per cent to nil while continuing to invest. During 1992 the group spent Pounds 9m on capital expenditure, including the completion of a new computerised warehousing centre in Leeds. In addition, having expanded into Germany in 1989, two more continental European operations were opened last year in the Netherlands and France. COMMENT The results were as expected but nevertheless serve to underline that ESD was a shrewd acquisition. However, Farnell's proven ability to achieve organic growth despite recession should not be overlooked. The expansion into continental Europe should help fuel growth with the German operations expected to break-even this year. The additional good news is that after a nine-month interregnum a new but as-yet unnamed chief executive has been chosen. The improving economic backdrop in the UK should help the group lift pre-tax profits to about Pounds 40m this year, equivalent to earnings of 19.8p. The shares gained 9p to 387p and are trading on a deserved prospective p/e of 19.5.</p>

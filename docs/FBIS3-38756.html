In an interview granted to  Onda Cero, Aznar asserted that following last week's trade union  protest he hopes to convince the Spanish people that the best  thing is "the complete government alternative" that he  represents.    Aznar emphasized that the government of Felipe Gonzalez is  "a  victim of its deceptions," which are causing it "a great lack of  credibility among the Spanish people." "This country cannot be  brought through like this," he said. In the opinion of the  People's Party leader, many of Spain's problems depend "on that  political change occurring" -- but, he specified, "when it can.  In the meantime," he added, "we must seek to ensure that the  country does not deteriorate."    Aznar emphasized the need to analyze, discuss, and debate  the  situation "where the country's political solutions must be  found, which is in the Congress of Deputies." For this reason,  he explained, the People's Party has demanded that the state of  the nation debate be held in February. The party is opposed to  postponing it until after the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers  Party] congress in March. "If it is not held now, in this very  grave crisis situation, when will it be held?" he asked.    The People's Party chairman maintained his support for the  labor reform measures promoted by the government, but at some  distance and without forgoing specific criticisms. For  instance, he supported the apprenticeship contracts because, he  specified, "a cheap contract is preferable to (a young person's)  having no job."    He criticized, however, the regulation of the apprenticeship  contracts. "It seems to me absolutely wrong," he said, "that a  28-year-old person can be defined as an apprentice." The  alternatives would be work experience contracts for young people  who have failed in their education or vocational training.    Aznar accused Gonzalez' government of reducing the  purchasing  power of pensioners, maintained that the state welfare system  could become financially unviable if the economic situation  deteriorates, and called for a parliamentary committee to  oversee the process of refloating Banesto [Credit Bank of  Spain], which will cost every Spanish family 14,000 pesetas, he  said.    Finally, Aznar proposed a reflection on the nationalists'  role. "If a policy, as a result of which the only thing that  concerns a certain territory of a certain community is its own  interest, becomes general," he explained, "we will then be  making Spain impossible."

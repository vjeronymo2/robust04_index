			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Arts: Forged in the face of Nature - Susan Moore admires the work of the Barbizon school Outdoor painting in oil began long before Monet shocked the art establishment with 'Impression, Sunrise'. The biographers of Claude claim that this revered master of the classical landscape was making oil sketches direct from nature in the mid 17th century. The practice was revived in France by Desportes early the following century, and continued in Italy, with the Welshman Thomas Jones, Claude-Joseph Vernet, Valenciennes and Corot all following in the great man's footsteps. The broadly painted oil sketch 'made in haste, in order to seize Nature as she is' was a well-established element in a young artist's training by the time a group of French naturalist painters began to converge on the small town of Barbizon, at the edge of the Forest of Fontainebleu, in the 1830s. Barbizon &amp; l'Ecole de la Nature, organised by Agnew's in association with Brame &amp; Lorenceau of Paris and the Artemis group, is a delightful show bringing together over 40 paintings and pastels, plus a staircase of drawings, by the now unfashionable and unjustly neglected precursors of Impressionism. The exhibits are witness to the fresh, responsive and highly expressive techniques forged in the face of nature by the open-air painters  -and to the extent to which the informal lessons of the field were applied to the finished studio pictures destined for public exhibition. Corot, like his English near-contemporary John Constable, remained a keen outdoor painter long after his student years, frequently working with the Barbizon painter Daubigny after 1852. His view of M. Wallet's park at Voisinlieu on a chill, bright winter's day in 1866, is ample proof that he, like Constable, kept faith with the idea of the natural landscape. The bare trees in the middle distance are well observed and show great sensitivity to infinitely subtle nuances of tone. Nonetheless, the mood he evokes is essentially poetical and romantic, the muzzy technique typical of his later works. There is none of the directness of touch and tonal clarity that characterises the small oil sketches. A similar distinction between the experimental, private sketch and the finished work of art seems to have been drawn by Rousseau who, like Diaz, sought absolute fidelity to nature. The sombre, rugged and untamed nature he found so close to Paris in the Forest of Fontainebleu provided endless motifs. His major canvases bring to mind Baudelaire's description of him as 'a naturalist ceaselessly swept towards the ideal'. They are in marked contrast to the series of deliciously fresh and fluid oil sketches here. To our eyes these are works of art in their own right, and highly covetable. I doubt Rousseau would have agreed. A handful of sun-dappled forest glades, presumably painted at Fontainebleu, come from the hand of Diaz. In their rich tone and impasted paint they recall the robust realism of Rubens's landscapes, and serve as a reminder of the Barbizon painters' enthusiasm for 17th century Dutch and Netherlandish landscape art. The influence of contemporary British art in stimulating a fresh approach to nature is also apparent. A number of British pictures - Constable's 'Hay-Wain' among them - had taken the 1824 Paris Salon by storm. Constable's animated touch and unaffected response to the natural world, the light and breadth of Turner and Bonnington, and the general high-key colour of the British school, seem to have left their mark. Landscape was not the primary concern of all the Barbizon painters and their associates. Millet, represented here by pastels and drawings, was more concerned with recording rural life rather than scenery. His depictions of the peasantry at work are radically different from the sentimentalised rustics portrayed by George Morland - the artist, along with Constable, whom Dupre most wanted to study in England. 'Scottish Deerhounds' is an impressive piece by Constant Troyon who was responsible for re-establishing the genre of animal painting in France. The outdoor painting of Daubigny and Harpignies, both disciples of Corot, provide the link between the Barbizon painters and the Impressionists. Particularly notable is Harpignies' depiction of the immense aqueduct at Briare, designed by Eiffel; and the breadth and boldness of Huet's romantic description of the play of light on the surface of the sea, seems only a step away from Monet's infamous 'Impression'. The crucial difference between them is that Monet signed and dated his 'sketch' and sent it for public exhibition. Pissarro, another protege of Corot, takes pride of place in Oeuvres Choisies, an exhibition of Impressionist and Post Impressionist art at JPL Fine Arts, 26 Davies Street, W1, until January 29. On show are paintings, pastels, watercolours and drawings by Pissarro, Degas, Sisley, Berthe Morisot, Guillaumin, Cross, Luce, Signac, Roussel, Bonnard, Vuillard and Denis. 'Barbizon &amp; l'Ecole de la Nature' continues at Agnew's, 43 Old Bond Street, London W1, until December 18.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Concluding part of two-part article by Vasiliy Krivokhizha, </F> deputy director of the Russian Institute for Strategic Research:  "Future of the Russian Nuclear Potential"]    [Text] When it comes to discussing the necessary number of  nuclear munitions in the strategic force structure, most Russian  military specialists (and this is confirmed, incidentally, by  very numerous research models of the new strategic situation)  agree that the number of 3,000-3,500 warheads set by the START  II Treaty is enough for Russia to deter any aggressor with a  retaliatory strike, even more so with a counterstrike. As for  the counterforce potential of Russia's strategic nuclear forces,  at 3,000-3,500 warheads, as previously at 10,000-13,000 warheads  (initial level) or 5,000-6,000 warheads (START I Treaty), it is  indeed far less than that of the U.S. strategic nuclear forces.    The change in the structure of Russia's strategic nuclear  "triad" is a most important aspect of the START II Treaty and  has far-reaching consequences. At a time of strategic offensive  arms cuts, the question of shaping the optimum structure for the  nuclear "triad" that Russia will have at its disposal in the  early 21st century acquires particular significance.    Approximately 60 percent of Russia's nuclear might (number  of  warheads) is currently concentrated in silo-based  ground-launched or road- and rail-mobile ICBM's, 30 percent is  on missile-carrying submarines, and 10 percent is carried by  strategic aviation. The U.S. nuclear "triad" currently looks as  follows: 25 percent ground-launched ICBM's (silos only), 55  percent submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and 20 percent  free-fall bombs and all types of cruise missiles. In accordance  with the average figures laid down by the START II Treaty, by  the year 2003 both sides will have approximately the following  structure in their strategic nuclear forces -- 15-30 percent  ground-launched ICBM's, 50-55 percent on submarines, and 15-35  percent on aircraft. As, for instance, Academician R.A. Golosov  of the Russian Federation Academy of Natural Sciences and  certain other specialists claim, the United States will in  practice retain the existing correlation of strategic nuclear  forces within the "triad" framework, whereas Russia will be  forced to sharply alter the structure of its nuclear "triad,"  weakening its main component -- ground-launched strategic  weapons. In R.A. Golosov's opinion, implementation of the  treaty will damage the country's interests from both the  military-strategic and economic viewpoints. From these  standpoints the START II Treaty can be seen as inequitable and  as failing to ensure equality in counterforce potential, thereby  not promoting the maintenance of strategic stability in  relations between Russia and the United States.    It is no secret that implementation of the START II Treaty  will indeed leave the U.S. side with a number of advantages --  specifically in counterforce potential. But this situation also  existed in the past, and has not been eliminated by any of the  previous treaties, including START I. A positive aspect of the  new treaty is that it creates conditions under which the U.S.  interest in building up its counterforce potential is  significantly diminished both by reducing the number of U.S.  warheads capable of hitting defended precision targets, and by  Russia's reducing the number of targets on its territory which  would have been most attractive to a counterforce strike --  primarily, heavy ICBM's. The Russian side is also reducing its  counterforce potential, since it too will pledge to eliminate a  certain number of missiles with the ability to strike defended  targets and with the possible ability, in the U.S. side's  opinion, to be used in a first strike.  From the standpoint of the prospects for the nuclear  disarmament process there is a clear possibility in the very  near future for a further change to the structure of the nuclear  "triad" which could be initiated -- for various reasons -- by  both the U.S. and Russian sides. Leading Russian specialists in  the strategic stability sphere and experienced military  diplomats are, in particular, not ruling out the emergence of a  U.S. proposal for a further stage of disarmament, comprising  further cuts in or the total elimination of ground-launched  missiles. This proposal has some attractive reasoning behind  it. We understand, for instance, that first counterstrike  missiles would be targeted exclusively on naval and air bases  and other important military installations and would pose less  of a threat (by excluding the Strategic Rocket Forces) of  destroying civilians and land ecosystems. But this step is  unacceptable to Russia because of the qualitative superiority of  the U.S. naval component over the Russian naval component (as  already mentioned above). Consequently, Russia needs to retain  its land-based component -- that is, the Strategic Rocket  Forces. With a view to equalizing the combat survivability  [ustoychivost] of Russian and U.S. strategic submarines -- which  would enhance overall strategic stability -- it would be  expedient for Russia to propose to conclude an agreement with  the United States to restrict ASW systems along the lines of the  ABM Treaty.    In connection with a number of articles in recent months it  would be a good idea to talk separately about the need to  preserve such a component of the Strategic Rocket Forces'  ground-based grouping as mobile missile systems. Since Russia  is allowed to increase the number of these installations under  the START II Treaty, these are the systems that have been  particularly "under fire" from the media.    The concern felt by the people writing these critical  articles for the fate of Russia's strategic nuclear arms is  entirely understandable. Nonetheless, I would like to object to  many of the points raised in these articles.    The usual argument cited in disputes by supporters of the  complete retention of silo-based ICBM's is the claim that a  missile in a silo that can be prepared for firing in the space  of one minute and has protection up to 100 kg per square  centimeter is a more reliable weapon than a mobile missile that  takes on average around an hour to prepare for firing and is  protected up to 1 kg per square centimeter.    We should dwell on these figures. The accuracy of modern  missile systems is such that a silo-based missile with a  protection level of 100 kg per square centimeter (the silo's  coordinates will be known) is guaranteed (with a probability of  close to 100 percent) to be hit by a single megaton-class  nuclear munition. According to the research done by relevant  Russian Federation Defense Ministry organizations (arguments in  the newspapers never usually worry about checking if their  results were correct or their methodology appropriate), in order  to hit a single road-mobile missile system an enemy would have  to use more than 10 such nuclear munitions to cover the entire  potential deployment region (position area). A mobile system's  survivability is ensured not only by the size of the position  area, but also by choosing terrain with the requisite camouflage  and protective qualities, and by camouflaging the system itself  -- something that people often forget to take into account.  Modern mobile systems can travel over roadless terrain and not  merely, as is often claimed, on metaled roads -- in other words,  they are not just "road"-mobile. Road-mobile systems are only  "vulnerable" to a surprise "nuclear strike" by U.S. submarines  when the mobile systems are at their garrisons, as U.S.  President George Bush insisted during the negotiations. But  even in this instance, if there were a rise in tension in the  world -- and much more so if there were a threat of nuclear  attack -- road-mobile systems could be moved out of their  garrisons into their combat position areas. Consequently, the  survivability of mobile systems is not lower but actually  considerably higher than that of silo-based systems.    In this connection it would seem logical to give up  silo-based missiles. But if the launch command (for a  counterstrike on our part) were given in good time, the  silo-based missiles would escape an enemy strike thanks to their  high level of combat readiness -- in other words, the missiles  would leave the silos before the impact of the nuclear explosion  of enemy warheads came into play. This, needless to say, is if  it proved possible to carry out a counterstrike. If not, then  this is yet another argument in favor of mobile systems.  Moreover, mobile systems allow for different basing modes  [formiruyut mnogovariantnost], which strengthens deterrence.  Admittedly, silo-based missiles require less expenditure than  mobile missiles -- they are more resistant to sabotage and to  the use of precision nonnuclear weapons. But why do we need to  view one basing mode as an alternative to another? The optimum  structure for the Strategic Rocket Forces, ensuring reliable  deterrence under different strategic situations with different  amounts of economic and material expenditure, is to combine  silo-based and road-mobile missile systems, which it is planned  to preserve within the Strategic Rocket Forces after 2003 --  provided, of course, that financial considerations do not alter  the situation.  The view that "it is not difficult to knock out a mobile  system" and that it would take overpressure of only 4-5  kilopascals to topple one over is known to be incorrect.  Overpressure of 4-5 kilopascals (0.04-0.05 kg per square  centimeter) in a nuclear shock wave propagated through the air  merely corresponds to a mass airflow velocity of around 40  km/hour. Such a small level of overpressure poses a threat only  to glass windows. Overpressure an order of magnitude (more than  10 times) greater would be needed in the nuclear shock wave  propagated through the air in order to topple a road-mobile  transporter-erector-launcher and its missile, and then only if  the nuclear munition exploded precisely at right-angles to the  launcher, rather than at an acute target angle [tochno na  traverze ustanovki, a ne na ostrykh kursovykh uglakh]. This  pressure in the shock wave corresponds to a gas flow velocity of  more than 300 km/hour.    It is interesting to note that in the late eighties the  official U.S. position at the START talks boiled down to a  bilateral ban on the deployment of mobile land-based strategic  missile systems. This was due to the U.S. side's doubts about  the ability of national means of verification to detect the  deployment of these missiles and by the special approach taken  by Congress -- for a whole host of reasons -- toward approval of  the program for the development [sozdaniye] of mobile missile  systems in the United States. But, first and foremost, the U.S.  position was due to the U.S. reluctance to see an overall  improvement in the combat survivability of the USSR's strategic  nuclear forces (this was not a major problem for the United  States itself because of the existence of a powerful and, to all  intents and purposes, equally "mobile" sea-based component in  its strategic nuclear forces).    Ultimately, the U.S. position shifted in favor of an  agreement to the deployment of single-warhead road-mobile  missile systems, on condition that measures were implemented to  verify the number of deployed missiles in this class and, by  agreement, the number of such missiles by type -- which was to  all intents and purposes carried out under the START II Treaty.    Here we can note that criticism and a continual desire to  argue have become part and parcel of our political life. This  is natural for our life today, but we need -- at least in some  measure -- to retain our consistency and objectivity. Otherwise  we will find ourselves in a situation where a U.S. agreement to  mobile systems will cause justifiable suspicion about their  motives from some of our experts, while a failure to agree on  their part will produce no less justifiable doubts from other  experts as regards the competence of the Russian delegation to  the talks. We can also note the contradictory nature of the  approaches taken by the Americans. When the official U.S.  position was to ban road-mobile missile systems, a group of U.S.  experts drew up some very noteworthy recommendations for their  delegation members:    -- since mobility is the most effective means of enhancing  the survivability of strategic missiles during a nuclear first  strike, the negotiations with the Russians should not raise the  question of a total ban on them, leaving open the possibility of  the United States' developing this component for the land-based  grouping of its strategic nuclear forces;    -- under no circumstances should a situation be created in  which the combat survivability of road-mobile missile systems is  even slightly diminished as a result of demands to allow the  sides access to accurate information on their deployment and on  the observance of the treaty restrictions on the number of  land-based mobile missiles. It was thought sufficient to  stipulate merely the term, acceptable to both sides, of  "cautious" on-site inspections and the utilization of national  means of verification, provided that the side undergoing  inspection retains all the advantages relating to the difficulty  of determining the precise location of the missiles at any  specific time.    In conclusion, I would like to note that we can already make  a confident forecast about the existence of different approaches  to the way in which the treaty will be seen by deputies,  different factions, Defense Ministry representatives, and so  forth. Obviously, there is a desire on the part of many military  experts as a whole to assess the treaty as a relatively isolated  phenomenon in international life and to look only at its  military-strategic and military-political aspects. At the same  time, the attitude taken by the corps of deputies to the START  II Treaty will reveal a closer linkage with Russia's domestic  life and with the voters' direct interests -- and this attitude,  despite the extensive discussion of the treaty's provisions in  the press, has not yet been finally formulated. It is likely  that in the course of preparations for the START II ratification  hearings, the corps of deputies will demand that the problems  relating to the multifaceted and, perhaps, contradictory impact  of the START II Treaty's implementation on the development of  the political, economic, and social processes under way in  Russia be clarified.    Attention will most probably be fixed on issues such as the  reasons for the positive assessment of the treaty (and even, in  a number of cases, the lobbying for it) by representatives of  the military-industrial complex and the professional military;  the correlation between the treaty's provisions and the emergent  system of new state policy and our sphere of national interests;  the treaty's impact on the pace and direction of scientific and  technical progress in Russia, on the elaboration of new advanced  technology, on the implementation of our national space program,  and on the closure or adaptation [rasformirovaniye ili  pereprofilirovaniye] of existing military educational  establishments; the economic and environmental consequences for  specific regions, the cost of implementation, and so forth. The  corps of deputies will only take an objective view of the  ratification of the START II Treaty if issues of interest to a  wide range of the Russian population -- rather than just those  to which military specialists and diplomats are trying to  restrict themselves -- are discussed. Thus, the range of  problems which it will be necessary and sufficient to resolve in  order to reach a decision on the treaty remains very vague and  is tending to expand.    The emergent situation and the increased distrust of  "departmental" views which the new Duma may follow the Supreme  Soviet in expressing are in line with the realities of political  life in Russia, will be transient (as the experience of other  countries shows), and will focus attention yet again on the need  to improve expert assessment of the decisionmaking process  within the framework of the formation of our new democratic  institutions.    At the same time, in purely military terms it is clear that,  in order to reliably deter any aggressor, it will be necessary  to preserve the triad in the structure of Russia's strategic  nuclear forces (the Strategic Rocket Forces plus sea-launched  and air-launched strategic nuclear systems) and a rational  structure for the Strategic Rocket Forces -- silo-based and  road-mobile missile systems. Only this kind of structure will  be able to have the requisite combat readiness, survivability,  and military flexibility with the optimum financial expenditure  in the foreseeable future. The expenditure point is of no  little importance to Russia. The switch to a dyad (Strategic  Rocket Forces plus sea-launched strategic nuclear forces or some  other combination) is for Russia -- and this cannot be said of  the United States -- unjustifiable for economic and efficiency  reasons. Moreover, statements about a dyad are, as a rule,  restricted to the most general arguments and are not backed up  by any kind of serious calculations.    Russia's main task in the context of strategic offensive  arms  reduction is to further improve its strategic nuclear forces,  not least as regards enhancing the operational safety of  aviation missile systems. If the START II Treaty is ratified  and the structure and components of our strategic nuclear forces  are improved, Russia will have a sufficient deterrent potential  and will not be left "defenseless in the face of the threat of  nuclear blackmail." A necessary condition for this is the  implementation of an armaments and military hardware development  program that meets the demands of Russia's military doctrine,  the present-day political and strategic situation in the world,  and the real level of military danger to our country. Only in  this event will the Russian eagle be able to hang on to its  nuclear sword, which plays a key role in protecting Russia's  national interests and actual integrity -- at least until such  time as the economy and domestic stability become effective  components in our national might.</p>

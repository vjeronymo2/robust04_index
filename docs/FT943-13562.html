			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Observer: Brussels spout hacked off Who'd be a British hack in Brussels? Things could turn a shade unpleasant, now that Belgian prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene - vetoed by John Major as the man to succeed Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission - has publicly pinned the blame on an alleged British media conspiracy. Dehaene told the Belgian newspaper De Standaard yesterday that 'the British tabloid press turned me into a caricature'. Delors could have told him that, regrettable though it may be, such shabbiness went with the brief. More intriguingly, Dehaene also wagged a finger at that supposedly objective institution, the BBC, which he accused of depicting Belgians as 'some sort of European ayatollahs' when Belgium held the European Union's rotating presidency last year. To imply today's British media is somehow in cahoots with John Major does show remarkable imagination. Maybe Dehaene should have got the job, after all.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FEDERAL DAMAGE SURVEY OF EXXON VALDEZ BEGINS  </P> <P> The National Transportation Safety Board on Monday began a thorough survey to  determine the extent of damage done to the tanker Exxon Valdez when it ran  aground March 24 in Alaska's Prince William Sound.  </P> <P> The physical inspection marked the first time that investigators have set foot  on the ship that ran aground on a reef. The NTSB has been relying on  photographs taken by divers who surveyed the ship's damaged hull from the  outside.  </P> <P> But inspectors now will have the opportunity to step inside the Valdez and  physically inspect its damaged hull, its holding tanks and a complex system of  pipes and valves that load and unload oil.  </P> <P> The NTSB will be accompanied by representatives from the state of Alaska, Exxon  and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the oil-company consortium that operates the  trans-Alaskan pipeline. The investigation is being conducted at National Steel  &amp; Shipbuilding Co., where the crippled tanker is in dry dock.  </P> <P> "We're going to, in a quantitative way, determine the extent of damage," said  Lou Colucciello, chief of the NTSB's Washington, D.C.-based marine accident  division. "It's being done with the participation of parties and will take  several days."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Lot of Measurements  </P> <P> Crews will "make measurements to determine how deep the penetrations were, how  extensive the damage was," Colucciello said. The survey team "will do a lot of  photographing and measurements," Colucciello said. "We'll spend lots of time  collecting relevant facts on the accident."  </P> <P> The Valdez, which was built in San Diego by Nassco, is a single-hulled ship.  When the damage survey is completed, Nassco crews will repair an area 700 feet  long and 100 feet wide. They also will repair any holding tanks and piping that  are damaged.  </P> <P> The NTSB report might not be completed for about six months, Colucciello said.  The federal agency will analyze data gathered in the inspection and publish a  report that will include the probable cause of the accident and any  recommendations that might reduce the likelihood of a similar accident.  </P> <P> In a related development, the state Department of Fish and Game late last week  completed its involvement in the long-running saga of the Valdez by forwarding  results of a final ocean-water test to the Coast Guard.  </P> <P> The sample concluded that the Valdez was responsible for an oil slick that  appeared in the ocean July 10 as the ship awaited permission to enter San Diego  Bay, Reed Smith of the fish and game department said. A Coast Guard spokesman  was not available on Monday to comment on whether charges will be filed against  Exxon.  </P></p>

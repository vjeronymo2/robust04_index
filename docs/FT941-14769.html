			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Cabinet briefed on de-regulation No fewer than 14 cabinet ministers are to attend a de-regulation seminar at Downing Street this morning in a meeting that should assure the government's de-regulation bill of a high-profile send-off. The bill, to be published today, has been flagged as one of the main elements of a legislative programme designed to unite the Conservative party after last year's Maastricht-related traumas. Downing Street said last night that the high turnout of cabinet heavyweights  -headed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary - expected at today's meeting reflected the 'great importance' the government attached to de-regulation. The bill, which will run to just under 100 clauses, is expected to give the Department of Trade and Industry sweeping powers to repeal hundreds of regulatory measures without primary legislation. This has already led to controversy, with Mr Heseltine forced to reassure MPs that the measures would not undermine parliament's authority. There is expected to be provision for establishing some form of scrutiny procedure, probably by MPs. The DTI has said there are no plans to 'avoid public scrutiny' through the use of orders in crown procedures. Today's meeting, to be chaired by Mr John Major, the prime minister, will also be attended by the chairmen of the eight business task forces charged with identifying regulations that could be scrapped after the contents of the bill are published.

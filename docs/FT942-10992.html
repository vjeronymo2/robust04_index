			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie closes unchanged after erratic session - Market Report London's equity market survived the savage mauling of the Conservative party in the countrywide local elections and put up an impressively robust defensive performance in the face of a steep fall in US stocks and bonds. The latter reacted to a much higher than expected increase in US non-farm payrolls announced over the lunchtime period. After moving in a near 30-point range, the FT-SE 100 index fought the session to an honourable draw, closing exactly unchanged at 3,106.0. Even more impressive was the performance of the market's second-liners, which tended to ignore much of the anxiety surrounding bonds and the FT-SE 100 leaders. The FT-SE Mid 250 index closed a net 0.4 firmer at 3,771.0. Gilt-edged stocks, on the other hand, were always in negative territory, with the long-dated stocks down in the region of a half-point for much of the morning, before retreating further in the afternoon, trailing in the wake of marked weakness in US Treasury bonds. As London markets closed for the day the US 30-year long bond was down almost two full points, dragging long-dated gilts down by almost a point. Worries that the wholesale losses by the Conservatives in the UK local elections would trigger a big slide in the market proved unfounded. With no sign of any institutional selling, the FT-SE 100 began the session around five points higher and gradually improved to stand more than 15 points ahead minutes before the US non-farm payroll number was announced. The disclosure of an increase of 267,000 in the US employment numbers for April, against an expected top figure of 250,000, affected markets very quickly. Wall Street came in weak and quickly dropped more than 30 points on the Dow Jones Average, trailing a sickly bond market, as dealers on both sides of the Atlantic feared an imminent increase in US short term interest rates. Economists are said to have already factored in a further rise in US rates but the pace of the expansion in US jobs was said to have provided further evidence of a rapidly growing US economy with obvious implications of inflationary pressures. Although the Fed declined to increase rates yesterday observers said a rise to 4 per cent and possibly to 4.25 per cent and possibly a half-point rise in the Discount Rate is now viewed as almost a certainty some time next week and certainly before the next Federal Open Market Meeting scheduled for May 17. At its worst following the US news, the FT-SE 100-index dropped through the 3,100 level and showed a 13.7 decline at 3,092.2 before embarking on a slow but determined climb back through 3,100 to end the day at 3,106. Turnover in the market reached 657.8m shares. Some marketmakers were heartened by the equity market's resilience in the face of the two potentially depressing factors yesterday and forecast a modest technical bounce next week. Others, however, remain extremely cautious and expect further turbulence in international bonds, which they said would inevitably bring pressure to bear on equities. The oil sector delivered another exceptionally strong performance as crude oil prices moved above the Dollars 16 a barrel level and institutions responded to BP's scintillating profits and dividend news, announced on Thursday.</p>

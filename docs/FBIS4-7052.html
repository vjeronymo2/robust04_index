			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh will today start taking back nearly  1,000 Khmer refugees who crossed into Thailand last month to  flee the fighting between the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian forces,  head of the Thai-Cambodian Coordination Office (TCCO) Col Amnuai  Chanchirop said yesterday.    Col Amnuai said he was informed by Cambodian representatives  on the TCCO that their government had reinforced security and  troops to ensure the safety of the refugees, numbering 958, once  they return to their Beng Takuan village in Bantaey Meanchey  province of Cambodia.    During the battle between the Khmer Rouge and government  forces on April 21-22, Beng Takuan was the scene of heavy  fighting and the villagers fled their bomes and sought refuge in  Ta Phraya district of Sa Kaew province opposite the Cambodian  border.    Bantaey Meanchey officials told Col Amnuai that most of the  refugees wished to return to their homes and 7th Army commander  Gen Kho Chea, in charge of government troops in the province,  was prepared to guarantee their safety through additional  reinforcement of men and heavy artillery.    The Cambodian representative on TCCO also reiterated his  government's promise not to engage Khmer Rouge guerrillas near  the border to prevent endangering the lives of Thai people in  the area.    If Beng Takuan is attacked in the future, the villagers will  be moved 20 kilometres deeper into Cambodian territory, he said.    He also expressed gratitude to the Thai side "for having  been  a helping neighbour all along."    Meanwhile, active troop movement on both sides--the Khmer  Rouge and government forces--was seen aroun the area opposite Ta  Phraya and severa clashes were reported about five to ten  kilometres from the Thai border.    The fighting is expected to continue into the rainy season  which begins in June.    Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said his  Cambodian counterpart Prince Norodom Sirivut called him up  yesterday from Phnom Penh.    Sqn Ldr Prasong said he briefed the Prince about his border  inspection trip over the weekend and the Prince responded by  saying that he hoped from now on the problem of  misunderstandings between the two countries could be avoided.    "I told him that if he has anything to say he should say it  to us and not make allegations.    "After talking on the phone I think that the situation will  improve," Sqn Ldr Prasong said.    The Prince and other high-ranking Phnom Penh officials have  lately spoken to foreign news agencies accusing Thailand of  aiding the Khmer Rouge.    The Thai foreign minister denied the charge and filed a  formal protest letter with Phnom Penh.    The repeated accusations have soured relations between  Bangkok and Phnom Penh to the point where both countries are  talking about filing complaints with the United Nations.    Asked if the Cambodian situation would not cause further  confusion, Sqn Ldr Prasong said that this was true of all  politics be it domestic or foreign.    Asked about the Thai military's suggestion that Thailand  protest to Cambodia every time artillery shells land on Thai  territory from across the border, the Foreign Minister said  every protest should be backed by reasons and evidence.    The ministry has asked the military to gather information on  all shelling incidents and the damage they have caused.    Thailand could then pursue the matter throwgh diplomatic  channels and could even file a complaint with the UN.    Asked about peace talks between all the Khmer factions, Sqn  Ldr Prasong said Prince Sirivut confirmed that they will be held  on May 2 according to the wish of Prince Norodom Sihanouk.    "Prince Sirivudh said that whether or not the the talks  prove  successful will depend on the Khmer Rouge," Sqn Ldr Prasong said.</p>

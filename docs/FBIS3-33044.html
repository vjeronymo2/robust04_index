Most congressmen act as if they already are used to the U.S.  reaction that began way before the government sent the bill  governing the concession of patents in April 1991.    The bill has been handled for two years by the Chamber of  Deputies, where it was changed by three amendments, and has been  stuck in the Senate since it was received in July 1993.    Therefore, it is unlikely the bill will be approved by the  end of this month despite the fact that it has become a habit  for the Senate to approve issues -- in a plenary session and  very urgent discussions -- before the permanent committees  review them.  <H5>  Sovereignty </H5>   Senator Josaphat Marinho (PFL-BA [Liberal Front Party-Bahia  State]) noted: "It is an extremely complex and delicate issue  to be voted on under pressure by foreigners." In the senator's  opinion, civilized coexistence among nations does not allow  threats even if one of the nations has a major interest in the  handling of a bill. He said: "A nation may not impose  solutions that depend on the sovereignty of another nation."    Senator Antonio Mariz (PMDB-CE [Brazilian Democratic  Movement  Party-Ceara]), who replaced Senator Elcio Alvares (PFL-ES  [Liberal Front Party-Espirito Santo State]) as the Patents Law  rapporteur, is in the United States receiving medical care.  Last week, Mariz finally received the amendments submitted by  his colleagues for discussion by the Constitution and Justice  Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee.  <H5>  Protection </H5>   This is the phase in which the handling of a bill largely  depends on the national lobbies [preceding word in English].  The bill's text is under pressure from the church, which does  not admit the patenting of microorganisms, and various  industrial sectors, especially the pharmaceutical industry.    Itamaraty sources claim that the text approved by the  deputies was subject to long discussions and negotiations  between the government and entrepreneurs, thus making difficult  the introduction of any radical changes to liberalize the text  in the Senate. The bill approved in the Chamber of Deputies  protects any product introduced, through a copy, into the  domestic market before the new law.</p>

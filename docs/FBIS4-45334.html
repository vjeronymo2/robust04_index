Under discussion was  the issue of combatting drug smuggling. Giorgio Giacomelli said  new sovereign states that appeared on the world's map after the  break-up of the USSR are now turning into drug dealing centers.  They also discussed the UN policy with regard to this issue.  The vice president spoke about Kazakhstan's vision of its  participation in the UN programme. Yerik Asanbayev emphasized  that drug smuggling has to be addressed urgently. He said  Kazakhstan has turned into a drug trading center, but does not  have the equipment and experts to combat it. Therefore  Kazakhstan would be grateful for any assistance that could be  rendered to it by international organizations. This year  Kazakhstan plans to send its envoy to Vienna who will deal with  this issue. Kazakhstan is willing to cooperate with the United  Nations in tackling this issue.</p>

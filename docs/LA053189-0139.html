			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UTAH'S MALONE IS UNANIMOUS ALL-NBA PICK  </P> <P> Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone, the league's second-leading scorer this year,  was the lone unanimous choice on a 1989 All-NBA team that included perennial  choices Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, the league announced today.  </P> <P> Rounding out the starting five are center Akeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets  and forward Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers.  </P> <P> While Malone was the only player cited on all 85 ballots, Chicago's Jordan and  Los Angeles' Johnson were both named on all but one. Malone, the MVP at this  year's All-Star Game, was a second-teamer last year.  </P> <P> It marked the seventh straight All-NBA selection for Johnson and the third  straight for Jordan. Olajuwon was also picked for the third consecutive year,  while Barkley has been honored two years running.  </P> <P> Missing from the team for the first time this decade was Larry Bird of the  Boston Celtics, who played only six games this year due to ankle problems.  </P> <P> Named to the second team were forwards Tom Chambers of Phoenix and Chris Mullin  of Golden State; guards John Stockton of Utah and Kevin Johnson of Phoenix, and  center Patrick Ewing of New York.  </P> <P> Voting is done by a national panel of 85 media members.  </P></p>

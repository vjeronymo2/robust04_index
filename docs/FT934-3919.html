			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / People: Green light at Zochonis They are changing the family guard at Manchester's Paterson Zochonis, one of the last of Britain's overseas traders. John Zochonis, 64, great nephew of one of the two founders, has handed over the chairmanship to one of his three nephews in the family-controlled business - 43-year-old Anthony Green. Zochonis, an Oxford graduate, joined the family business of West African merchants in 1952, shortly after the death of his father, and got his early training serving behind the counter of the company's stores in West Africa. A shy man who does not seek publicity, he has headed the firm since 1970, during which time it has changed from being an overseas retailer and wholesaler to a manufacturer, although West Africa still accounts for the bulk of the business. In 1975 he masterminded the firm's first big diversification, the acquisition of Cussons - makers of Imperial Leather soap. Anthony Green, the deputy chairman, joined PZ in 1975 and served in East and West Africa and South East Asia. Zochonis retires from the board, and Thomas Harrison, the company secretary, joins it.</p>

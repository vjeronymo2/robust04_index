			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Yeltsin's supporters turn out in their biggest numbers since August 1991 THEY all showed up yesterday: the destitute pensioners, the flashy entrepreneurs, the impoverished intellectuals and professionals, and rough-skinned workers, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. Just as he was offering to give up the referendum he had called for April 25, President Boris Yeltsin's supporters turned out in their biggest numbers since the August 1991 coup to urge him to stop compromising with his conservative opponents. 'Enough Compromises with Communist Criminals,' said one of the banners attacking the Congress of People's Deputies. Equally numerous were attacks on its speaker, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, who was likened to Stalin and urged to return to Chechnya, the rebellious southern region which has declared independence from Russia and recalled him as its deputy. 'We may eat only bread, but we must be free of these Communists who choked Russia for 70 years,' said Klava, a retired metal worker and one of the millions of pensioners whose living standards have been ravaged by the reforms. 'We won't die, we will survive.' With pop music, snack stalls, and portable lavatories provided by the Moscow mayor's office, the lightly-policed event was in stark contrast to a rival demonstration at the other end of Red Square. There, some 300 baton-wielding police, including dozens on horseback, hemmed in a demonstration of a few thousand Communists and extreme nationalists who find so much in common in modern-day Russia.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA IS NOT READY TO RESPOND TO THE TARKANIAN COURT DECISION  </P> <P> The National Collegiate Athletic Assn. infractions committee will not consider  any response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision involving Nevada Las Vegas  basketball Coach Jerry Tarkanian until at least April, an NCAA spokesman said.  </P> <P> Members of the committee will be briefed on the decision at the NCAA convention  at San Francisco next week. But the committee will not be prepared to take any  action when it holds its next formal meeting at San Diego Feb. 3-5, NCAA  spokesman David Berst said.  </P> <P> The court ruled Dec. 12 that the NCAA was a private agency and did not have to  consider due process when ordering a member institution to suspend a coach.  </P> <P> The decision ended a legal battle that began in 1977 when Nevada Las Vegas was  placed on 2 years probation for basketball recruiting violations. The NCAA also  ordered Tarkanian suspended for 2 years.  </P> <P> Berst said the court decision still was being reviewed by NCAA attorneys.  </P> <P> "They are determining what our legal status is and what alternatives are open,"  Berst said.  </P> <P> Nevada Las Vegas Athletic Director Brad Rothermel said he would meet with NCAA  officials next week and discuss possible courses of action, both by the school  and the NCAA.  </P></p>

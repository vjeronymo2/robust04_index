			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): We can't go on meeting like this - Charles Batchelor offers advice on how to avoid the pitfalls when organising a conference You've probably been there too. The seminar where the presentations bore only a tenuous relationship to the advertised theme. The training session where the overhead projections were too detailed to read from the second row back. The hotel at the other end of town from the conference centre. Companies spend large sums of money on meetings, seminars and conferences and their executives and staff devote equally prodigious amounts of time to attending them. Some are in-house sessions designed to motivate the sales force or keep managers up to date; others are intended to promote the company's image to the outside world. How can they make sure they get value for their money, that they do not waste their time and they do not damage their image? It probably makes sense to call on professional help for the more elaborate event, although the conference field can be confusing. You will probably encounter four main types of adviser: production companies which will arrange the visuals and stage sets; venue search companies; convention bureaux which promote facilities in their town; and project managers who will run the whole show. Some production companies and venue finders have also attempted to move into project management. Companies frequently turn to conferences and seminars as part of their marketing effort, to boost their image. 'But the first thing to ask yourself is why you are doing it,' says Vanessa Cotton, managing director of the Event Organisation Company. 'The outside world will not be interested if a company just wants to say how good it is. People are even more time conscious than they are cash conscious. Put yourself in the delegate's place and ask if he will feel cheated.' Some of the most effective promotional conferences are those where the organiser picks a broader management theme of genuine interest to its target audience. Cotton recently organised a conference for a computer company on the subject of managing change within organisations. By sponsoring the debate, the company was able to project itself in a favourable light without appearing to be selling its own products. The current recession has made companies opt for simpler events - even if they can afford it, they may not wish to be seen to be putting on too lavish a show - but presentations must still be exciting if they are to be effective. 'We would dissuade a client from just putting on talking heads,' says Cotton. 'People won't be able to concentrate on them for long and you can't communicate with people who have fallen asleep.' Even if the meeting is low-key, people have become accustomed to high standards of presentation from television, pop concerts and opera and will expect the same at a business presentation. While most conference venues have skilled technicians who can help to ensure that the slide projector works, it is often harder to get the speakers themselves to perform effectively. Cotton says she insists on briefing speakers, however eminent, on the theme of the conference. She asks for a one-page synopsis of what they are going to say and later a copy of the complete speech. 'Speakers can shoot off in different directions. There has to be a progression in the speeches,' she says. If a speaker is unsure about his ability to speak in public, then he must be persuaded to go on a course of presentational skills. But for many companies planning a meeting or a conference, the venue is the first consideration. Venues may be functional or spectacular depending on whether the intention is a straightforward discussion of some aspect of business or to reward the sales team for a good performance, says Steven Foulkes-Murray, founder of Meeting Places, a conference organiser. Country house hotels, castles in Ireland and even cross-Channel ferries have been used for meetings with a 'reward' element to them. 'You can pay a lot of money for a prestigious hotel on Park Lane but you won't get value for money if you are holding a functional meeting. You might be better off in a more modest venue.' Whichever style of venue you choose make sure that it is accessible to the people who are coming. If the sales team will all be turning up in their company cars, do not choose a hotel or conference centre with no nearby parking. If people will be flying in from around the world, make it central. If most delegates will be using public transport, do not choose somewhere in the middle of the country. A hotel may be more convenient if the conference is to last longer than one day because delegates will not need to travel to their accommodation. But hotels, despite their attempts to improve the quality of their conference service in recent years are not always the best venues. Cotton says she prefers to use conference centres where the staff are specialists in organising meetings rather than hotels which often regard conference business as an adjunct to catering. An advantage of hotels is that they can often provide smaller rooms but they frequently do not have purpose-built facilities. 'You don't want to hold your meeting in a converted, L-shaped bedroom,' says Foulkes-Murray. If a company uses a professional events organiser, it may leave the details to them. But if it deals directly with a conference centre, the company must carry out its own checks. It is less common now but still not unknown for companies to book a venue without even visiting to see if it is suitable, says Jenny Lazell, conference manager at the Sedgwick Centre in east London. 'People still prepare their audio-visual aids without checking whether they are suitable for the venue,' she says. Whoever is responsible for organising the meeting should discuss all the details with the centre, she advises. 'What looks good on paper often doesn't work in practice.' It is unrealistic to expect delegates who have arrived from all over the country to pitch straight into the conference without a tea or a coffee or to sit through a morning of presentations without a break. Do not attempt to squeeze too much into a day, the experts advise. It is unlikely that 300 people will be able to eat lunch in an hour. Not only are they unlikely to taste their food, they will not have had time to chat to old friends and contacts or go to the lavatory, says Gill Price, business manager of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in Westminster. Dietary requirements have become increasingly complex and conference organisers need to take into account that some of their delegates may have medical, philosophical or religious reasons for not eating certain menus, says Price. The details of a conference are best dealt with by one person at the company, whether it is the managing director's secretary or a specialist meetings organiser, says Lazell. With the more ambitious conferences costing hundreds of thousands of pounds, the cost of getting it wrong can be very high. The damage to a company's image of a poorly handled event can also be considerable. 'There is a risk,' says Cotton. 'This is why you need to plan ahead rather than fight fires.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko] </F>   [Text] Seoul March 30 TASS -- South Korea has refused to  accept the terms for a deferment of the repayment of Russia's  debts on credits which the Seoul government had promised and  partially provided for the former Soviet Union. Such is the  outcome of Russian-South Korean talks which ended here on  Wednesday.    At the same time, Mikhail Fradkov, Russian first deputy  minister for foreign economic relations, who leads the Russian  delegation at the talks, told ITAR-TASS that "the normal  negotiating process is underway, and the negotiations will be  continued".    Upon signing an agreement with the "Paris Club" of creditor  countries in April last year on a rescheduling of the repayment  of debts to the club member-states, Russia found itself in a  situation in which it cannot settle with individual creditor  countries, even non-members of club, including the Republic of  Korea, on terms that would differ from those set by the Paris  Club.    The Russian side tried to convince the Seoul government of  the need to accept a debt repayment schedule comparable with the  Paris Club terms but South Korean financial agencies have not  agreed to that so far.    South Korea provided the Soviet Union with credits amounting  to 1,470 million U.S. dollars of the promised 3,000 million  dollars. Russia upon having confirmed the assumption of the  former Soviet Union's international obligations, paid interest  in cash and partially through the deliveries of aluminium ingots.    However, following the Paris Club's debt rescheduling  decision, the repayment of Russia's debts to South Korea was  suspended. The amount of overdue payments as of the end of  February was about 449 million U.S. dollars.</p>

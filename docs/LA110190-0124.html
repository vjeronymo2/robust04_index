			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEPLETED NUMBERS FORCE MAR VISTA TO FORFEIT GAME  </P> <P> Mar Vista High, which lost a number of football players this week because of  grades and is now down to fewer than 10 players, has forfeited its game Friday  against Chula Vista. And unless something drastic is done, Mar Vista likely  will not play its last game of the season the next week against Hilltop.  </P> <P> Mar Vista Coach Sam Coe said losing those players left his team without enough  players to safely compete against anyone, let alone Chula Vista, which is  leading the Metro Conference with a 5-0 record (6-2 overall).  </P> <P> Mar Vista (1-7, 1-4 in league) had only 24 players for its game Friday against  Castle Park, a 37-6 loss. When grades came out this week, Mar Vista was down to  fewer than 10 players. Coe refused to discuss individual circumstances or how  many players were ruled ineligible.  </P> <P> "We had some grade problems. We had a lot of grade problems," he said.  </P> <P> "Sam said last week, 'We might lose five, seven at the most. But we should be  OK,' " Chula Vista Coach George Ohnesorgen said. "When they lost 18, that just  blew everything out of the water."  </P> <P> Coe said a number of options were discussed with Mar Vista Principal Jaime  Mercado and ASB Director Stan Canaris, including bringing up some junior  varsity players, but the administration decided against that.  </P> <P> "We didn't feel it was in our best interest to pull up JV kids and throw them  to the wolves," Coe said.  </P> <P> The schools' junior varsity teams will play today as scheduled.  </P> <P> Chula Vista, which is having its homecoming Friday, had to scramble to get a  replacement opponent. It managed to get the Institute of Mexico, a private  school in Tijuana. Game time is 7:30 p.m. at Chula Vista.  </P> <P> Understandably, Ohnesorgen wasn't pleased with the ordeal.  </P> <P> "I don't blame Sam. It's not his fault," Ohnesorgen said. "When a school the  size of Mar Vista (approximately 1,700 students) can't run a football program  -- when there are other schools much smaller than them competing -- that's a  bad situation. I guess that shows what kind of support their administration  shows toward athletics. It's really an embarrassment to our district and our  league."  </P> <P> Section Commissioner Kendall Webb said he was informed of the incident by Chula  Vista. There is no ruling to be made by his office, though Chula Vista did  question whether it was all right to schedule another game. Under CIF rules,  forfeitures do not count toward the maximum number of contests permitted during  the season. In football, teams are allowed to play 10 regular-season games.  </P></p>

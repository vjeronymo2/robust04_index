As reported by Interfax, on February 8, FM Kozyrev accused  the Baltic States of "ethnic cleansing" and other serious human  rights violations, the statement says. In remarks to reporters,  he stated, "About one third of the residents are treated  differently based upon ethnicity. I have in mind the  Russian-speakers -- Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Jews and  even Finns -- who are not being given citizenship. They want  citizenship, but it is being denied for one reason: ethnicity.  If this is not `ethnic cleansing' what is it?"    "Since numerous UN, CSCE, Council of Europe and other  international delegations have all reaffirmed that the situation  in Estonia fully measures up to international human rights  standards, the question arises: Who is not telling the truth,  the international organizations or the politician who has  repeatedly declared Estonia to be part of Russia's sphere of  interest, the so- called near abroad?" the Foreign Ministry's  statement says.    The Foreign Ministry affirms that the laws of the Republic  of  Estonia "allow everyone to acquire citizenship regardless of  ethnicity".    There is a positive aspect to the Russian Foreign Minister's  comments on February 8, too, the statement continues. Namely,  he presented an important historical position which has caused  many bi-lateral disagreements due to differing interpretations.  FM Kozyrev said, "I admit the crimes of the Stalin regime, but  we cannot forget that these were carried out by political powers  -- on the one side Stalin, on the other Hitler -- who signed the  Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact."    "It is to be hoped that the Russian Foreign Minister will be  able to take the next step and to admit that the Baltic States  were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940," the Foreign  Ministry's statement concludes.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I'd like to thank CBS for its wonderful documentary, "The Moon Above, the Earth  Below." The program's computer simulations were informative while Dan Rather  and Charles Kuralt are also to be commended for their fine commentary. This is  the type of programming that we need to see more often.  </P> <P> Indi Trehan, Mission Viejo  </P></p>

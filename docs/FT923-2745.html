			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Watmoughs doubles to Pounds 5.1m WATMOUGHS (Holdings), one of the UK's largest printers, almost doubled pre-tax profits, from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 5.1m, for the half year to June 30 on the back of increased orders. In comparing the 96 per cent profit increase with last year Mr Patrick Walker, chairman, said account should be taken of the difficult trading conditions affecting the second quarter of 1991, which were largely related to the Gulf war. The group regained the printing contract for the Saturday Times Review, after losing it temporarily, and increased its mail order business. Mr Walker said the group has also won more one-off contracts than before because of its speed in processing pictures into magazines within less than 48 hours. Turnover increased to Pounds 55.5m (Pounds 48.6m). The group has continued to expand in continental Europe, opening a new plant in Hungary and winning contracts in Spain. Mr Walker said the group was on target to generate 30 per cent of turnover from Spain, Hungary and exports from the UK by 1994. This year's Pounds 22m rights issue, coupled with strong cash flow, enabled the group to reduce gearing by half to 15 per cent. Net assets stand at Pounds 90m. Capital expenditure is expected to have almost doubled by the year end to Pounds 33m. The shares rose 6p to close at 443p in a falling market. Earnings per share increased to 11.14p (6.17p). The interim dividend is raised to 2.7p against 2.5p.</p>

The last ferry back to Red Hook leaves Cruz Bay at 11:15 p.m.  </P> <P> In Cruz Bay, you can take an open-air safari bus to almost any point along  North Road (one of the two major roads), getting off and back on anywhere along  the route. Fares are reasonable and depend on how far you go. Or you can rent a  car or Jeep at any of several car rental agencies. Rates and required deposits  vary.

It's about three blocks  from the ferry dock. Paradisio, also at Mongoose Junction, is highly  recommended for its excellent food. Caneel Bay's Sugar Mill Restaurant is a  beautifully restored mill with a spectacular view of Pillsbury Sounds. It's  pleasant for lunch or dinner.

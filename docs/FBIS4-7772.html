			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Banja Luka, 5 Apr (TANJUG) -- Muslim forces have  resumed their offensive activities against Serb lines in the  zone of responsibility of the First Krajina Corps of the Srpska  republic army today, the information service of the corps said  in Banja Luka this evening. The strongest Muslim attacks have  been registered at the Ozren battlefield, particularly at its  southern part in the Vozuca area.    Reinforced by fresh units and with artillery backing, Muslim  forces attempted to break through the Serb lines at this part of  the front.    The Teslic battlefield was not peaceful today either because  of fierce attacks by the Muslim army on almost all parts of the  front in which 82-mm mortars, and antiaircraft and infantry  weapons were used. The fiercest attacks were launched northeast  of Teslic.    Muslim attacks were resumed west of Doboj and 82-mm mortars  were used. [passage omitted]</p>

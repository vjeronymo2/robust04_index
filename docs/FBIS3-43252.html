December 31 marked more than the end of just another year.  It also marked the end of an era, he said.    Next year South Africa would, for the first time, have a  multiparty government that would be truly representative of all  its people. "For the first time we will have a system where the  constitution and the bill of rights -- and not politicians in  Parliament -- will have the final say," Mr de Klerk said.    For the first time South Africa would have a constitutional  system containing effective checks and balances against the  misuse of power.    Important among these would be independent courts, including  an independent constitutional court with wide-ranging powers.    Equally important would be the establishment of strong and  autonomous provinces, with important powers and functions  effectively entrenched.    Mr de Klerk said South Africa faced three challenges in the  new year, the first being to let democracy succeed. "The second  challenge...will be to make our economy work to the benefit of  all our people. Success in the economic field will be as  important as success in the constitutional field."    Democracy and elections would not by themselves bring all  the  things that people needed, said the president. "We will not be  able to create jobs and build all of the houses, schools and  clinics that we need, unless there is money to pay for them.  And the only way that we can get this money is to ensure that  our economy grows as quickly and as strongly as possible."    This would require hard work, new investments and expanding  exports. "To achieve this, the new government of national unity  will have to follow the right policies -- policies that have  succeeded throughout the world."    "The third great challenge that we will face will be to  build  a new South African nation; to break out of the conflicts of the  past; to break through to reconciliation," said Mr de Klerk.</p>

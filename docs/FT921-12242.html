			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile plans Dollars 430m boost for copper production CODELCO, THE state-owned Chilean Copper Corporation, is raising its investment budget by 16 per cent to Dollars 430m this year to develop new ore bodies and reduce toxic emissions at its ageing smelters. The budget increase marks an important victory for Codelco, which lobbied a reluctant government for more funds to maintain its position as the world's biggest copper producer. 'The importance of this year's budget is that it sets a benchmark for future years,' Mr Ignacio Guerrero, Codelco's financial vice-president, said yesterday. Investment levels of the past two years - Dollars 330m in 1990 and Dollars 370m in 1991 - were not sufficient to combat falling output and declining ore grades at Codelco's ageing mines. About half of this year's investment budget would go towards prospecting and developing new ore bodies, Mr Guerrero said. Another 20 per cent would be channelled towards environmental protection. Chuquicamata, the vast copper complex in the Atacama desert, would get a new sulphuric acid plant that will absorb noxious sulphur dioxide emissions. Smelters at Potrerillos and Caletones were also scheduled for overhaul. Codelco plans to start exploiting low-grade copper sulphides at Chuquicamata and at two other mining divisions, Salvador and El Teniente. In the mid-1990s, a new mine to the north of Chuquicamata, recently christened Radomiro Tomic, is scheduled to come on stream. Productive capacity at Codelco's smallest division, Andina, is also being expanded. The company hopes that these new projects will reverse the trend of declining output of the past two years. It produced 1.12m tonnes of refined copper in 1991, down from a peak of 1.24m tonnes in 1989. However, most of Chile's increased copper production in the 1990s will come from large private sector projects under construction. The latest of these was announced yesterday by Rio Algom. The Canadian mining company said Chile's foreign investment committee had approved its plans to develop the Dollars 290m Cerro Colorado mine in the Atacama desert. Rio Algom plans to bring the mine into production by late-1994. Cerro Colorado's reserves of 79m tonnes, with an average ore grade of 1.39 per cent copper, will be sufficient to produce 40,000 tonnes a year of high quality copper cathodes over the mine's 23-year life.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Hattersley promise on incomes MR ROY HATTERSLEY yesterday promised to reverse the redistribution of income brought by 13 years of Conservative rule, as he rejected the notion that Labour has turned its back on its traditional beliefs. Addressing a star-studded London rally, the shadow home secretary played up the constancy of Labour's guiding principles over the years and said that the party would continue to fight for 'a more equal society'. The 'great divide' between the parties had neither narrowed nor changed, he said. He proclaimed Labour to be 'the party of the community.' Mr Hattersley pledged that Labour would implement radical constitutional reform, including replacement of the House of Lords by an elected second chamber, and would refer concentration of newspaper ownership to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Promising to bring integrity back to government, he said that all senior Labour appointees would appear before an all-party Commons select committee. 'We shall fight the election from the high ground of politics.' Mr Hattersley said that a freedom of information bill would be the first piece of proposed legislation presented by a future Labour government. Three weeks ago he unveiled a right-to-information bill - almost identical to a blueprint drawn up by the Campaign for Freedom of Information lobby group - designed to replace the Official Secrets Act with a general right of access to official records. Developing the main theme of his speech, Mr Hattersley said he had grown weary of hearing the Tories talk of freedom 'as if it were their invention which they have bottled, patented and marketed under their exclusive label'. He added that the Tories did not know what real freedom was. Labour would build 'the free society that equality brings'. The great choice faced by the country in future years would be how to spend its wealth once the economy has moved out of recession. 'We shall not spend it on tax cuts that most benefit the highest earners,' he said. 'We shall spend it on building a fairer and freer society, the more equal society that most in this room joined the party to create.' Ms Harriet Harman, shadow health minister, published figures showing that 16 per cent of National Health Service beds for elderly people needing long-term nursing care had been cut since 1986. 'Under a fourth term of the Tory government there would be no place in the NHS for the people needing long-term nursing care.' She hinted that Labour would 'change' current arrangements regarding public subsidies for private nursing homes. BESIDES the big names and razzamatazz, Labour unveiled a secret weapon at its lively weekend rally. Two Real People - one a commuter, one a doctor - were dragooned in to share the limelight. Set against the purple prose and set phrases of the various shadow cabinet members, the voice of personal experience that they represented left a deep impression and perhaps provided a pointer to future campaign initiatives. Coyly described as working for 'a major financial institution in the City', Mr Alan Bartlett (the commuter) detailed the horrors of the daily trek in by rail from suburban Chislehurst. 'My family are getting a bit fed up with the stories I tell them,' he said. Ms Iona Heath, a Kentish Town doctor, described her frustration at getting a recorded message on the 999 ambulance service, while with a seriously ill patient. She condemned fund holding for general practitioners for 'giving GPs an incentive to refer their patients privately for the first time in the history of the NHS.'</p>

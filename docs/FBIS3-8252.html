The person who was appointed is Iacob Zelenco,  who from September 1993 to 3 March 1994 was the prime minister's  counselor.    Iacob Zelenco worked for over 17 years at the Ministry of  Finance, where he used to coordinate the work of the state  budget income departments, while after the revolution [December  1989] he led the department for prices at the same ministry.  For a while he was the deputy of Nicolae Vacaroiu.    In a brief statement that he made yesterday exclusively for  our paper, Zelenco stressed: "I hope I can do some concrete  things to boost privatization. Over the past three years there  has been a great deal of talk about it, but we need to make  privatization become tangible for our citizens."</p>

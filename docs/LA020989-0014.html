			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHNEOUR ON ABORTION  </P> <P> Thank you, Elie Shneour. As the conservative Supreme Court considers the  Missouri case on abortion, I tremble at the thought of a Roe vs. Wade setback.  Will the court then listen to a minority faction that insists women and men  must not "murder" the egg and sperm every month? No birth control, but undue  procreation in an already overpopulated globe?  </P> <P> It is relatively easy to carry a sign saying "Stop the Murder of Babies" but  spending time to help the living survive is another matter.  </P> <P> As a schoolteacher, I see students every day who are abused in a home  environment. This to me is more of a sin than stopping an egg and sperm from  developing in the first trimester.  </P> <P> The Constitution was written with wisdom so that one religious group could not  impose its morals on others. So be it!  </P> <P> DOREEN V. KEEPERS  </P> <P> Pomona  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOTT IS HURT IN VICTORY;  </P> <P> LAKERS: INJURY TO HIS LEFT ANKLE IS CALLED A "MODERATE" SPRAIN, BUT X-RAYS WILL  BE TAKEN TODAY. L.A. DEFEATS TIMBERWOLVES, 113-89.  </P> <P> What the Lakers must have secretly feared most in these final, relatively  insignificant games of the NBA's regular season was an injury to a significant  player.  </P> <P> But that proved unavoidable in a 113-89 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves  on Thursday night, when guard Byron Scott sprained his left ankle less than two  minutes into the third quarter before 17,505 fans at the Forum.  </P> <P> The severity of Scott's injury and length of recovery has yet to be determined.  Gary Vitti, the Lakers' trainer, called it a "moderate" sprain and said Scott  probably will not play in the final two regular-season games. He is scheduled  to have X-rays this morning to determine the full extent of the injury.  </P> <P> "I'm shooting for having him practice on Tuesday," Vitti said. "If he can get  through (Thursday night) and control the swelling, I think we've got it  licked."  </P> <P> Scott, who missed three games earlier in the season with an aggravation of his  left hamstring injury, will have a week to nurse his ankle into playing shape.  The Lakers will open the first round of the playoffs against either Houston or  Seattle next Thursday or Friday.  </P> <P> Remaining injury-free may be the Lakers' goal going into the season's final  weekend. To that end, Coach Pat Riley sat his starters for nearly all of the  fourth quarter. Riley has said he does not want to rest his core players too  much for fear that they will lose their competitive edge.  </P> <P> Scott was injured when he and teammate Mychal Thompson jumped to rebound a  Timberwolves' shot. Scott grabbed the ball and, trying to avoid Thompson,  landed awkwardly on his left ankle. He had to be helped from the court, unable  to put much pressure on his left leg.  </P> <P> Scott, according to Laker spokesman John Black, declined to comment on how he  suffered the sprain or how his ankle feels.  </P> <P> With or without Scott, the Lakers breezed. Michael Cooper compensated for  Scott's loss by scoring 14 points -- including consecutive three-point baskets  in the third quarter -- and passing for a season-high 12 assists.  </P> <P> Orlando Woolridge led all Lakers with 23 points. Tony Campbell, a former Laker,  had 25 for the Timberwolves.  </P> <P> Riley said that, regardless of the outcome of today's X-rays, the Laker guard  will sit out the final two games.  </P> <P> Riley also said he will check with General Manager Jerry West about putting  Scott on the injured list and re-activating Steve Bucknall, a rookie swingman  waived by the club on March 5. "I would only do it if putting Byron on the  injured list would not carry over into the playoffs," Riley said.  </P> <P> Riley might need another player if he chooses to rest his starters more.  Johnson played 30 minutes Thursday, A.C. Green 31, Worthy 26 and Thompson 14.  </P> <P> Riley said it is counterproductive to sit players for fear of injury.  </P> <P> "It's OK, just a sprain," Riley said. "He'll be back probably by Tuesday's  practice. We can't walk on eggshells. You don't want (injuries) to happen at  this time of the year, but you can't not play people. As soon as you back off  to start avoiding injuries, that's what's going to happen.  </P> <P> "We want our starters to play about 25 to 30 (minutes per game). That's what  I'll play them the next two games. But without Byron, it forces us to play  Earvin (Johnson) more, unless we go out and bring in another player for the  final two games -- if we can do that."  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> Magic Johnson has been bothered for the past week with tendinitis in his left  Achilles' tendon because of a misplaced support lift in his new shoes. "Two  years ago, he had some tendinitis in his Achilles', so Converse put some lifts  in his shoes and he was all right," trainer Gary Vitti said. "When Magic got  his new shoes, the company put the lift in the sole instead of between the shoe  and the sole, where it was supposed to be." Johnson has had soreness and has  been receiving ice treatments. Vitti said the shoe company has corrected  Johnson's shoes. "The tendinitis wasn't as bad as it was a couple years ago,"  Vitti said. "When he started getting it, we immediately looked at the shoes." .  . . The Madison Square Garden Network, which broadcasts the New York Knicks  games, recently polled NBA coaches on the major awards. Twenty-two of the 27  coaches responded. Johnson beat out Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan for the  most valuable player award. Pat Riley was voted coach of the year by his peers.  </P></p>

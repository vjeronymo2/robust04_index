			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuwait City, 4 May, KUNA -- Nasir al-Rawdan, the  second deputy prime minister and finance minister, announced  today the government's intention to impose taxes "based on a  studied method that will not hurt the citizen"; and an intention  to reduce the level of tax exemptions enjoyed by some imported  goods.    Al-Rawdan explained that the aim behind this decision was to  increase the state's revenue and deal with the mounting budget  deficit. He indicated, at the same time, that the relative  reduction announced in the first chapter of next year's budget,  which is being discussed by the appropriate committee of the  National Assembly, will not affect the wages and salaries of  staff of the state sector.    This announcement was made during a session of the National  Assembly, which was chaired by Speaker Ahmad al-Sa'dun, during  which a draft-reply to the Amir's speech was submitted to the  Amir of Kuwait. The session also adopted three laws submitted  by the government.    During the session, Information Minister Shaykh Sa'ud  al-Nasir al-Sabah played down the importance of the statements  regarding Kuwait, which were recently attributed to a member of  the U.S. Congress.    Minister al-Sabah described these statements as "not  representative in any way of the opinion of the friendly U.S.  people, who support Kuwait's right in its legitimate demands  vis-a- vis the Iraqi regime."    In this connection, the members of the National Assembly  underlined the planned visit of a delegation from the National  Assembly to the United States in the middle of this month. They  are pinning great hopes on this visit to explain Kuwaiti  positions regarding the situation in the Gulf region, and  improve Kuwait's image abroad.</p>

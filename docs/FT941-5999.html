			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Rio Algom improves for quarter Canadian mining group Rio Algom's metals distribution business improved in the fourth quarter, but mining operations posted lower revenue, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Net profit was CDollars 11.2m (USDollars 8.3m), or 25 cents a share, against CDollars 10.1m, or 20 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 243m against CDollars 241m. The figure for 1993 was CDollars 33.9m, or 73 cents, against CDollars 39.4m, or 88 cents, on revenues of CDollars 955m against CDollars 905m. Mining operations are moving away from uranium to base metals. Production has started at the Cerro Colorado project in Chile, which will produce 90m pounds of high-quality cathode yearly.</p>

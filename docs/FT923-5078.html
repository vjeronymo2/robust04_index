			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Business Law: EC merger regime defies expectations of critics The European Communities Merger Regulation is almost two years old and the European Commission has received over 100 applications for clearance under its provisions. What lessons have been learned so far? The processes are working well. Before the Regulation came into operation, the business community and lawyers alike were highly sceptical as to whether the Commission could transform itself from the slow, bureaucratic body it was perceived to be into an organisation capable of dealing with the fast-moving timetable of a takeover or merger. The Merger Task Force - the newly created unit within the Competition Directorate (DGIV) dedicated to merger control - has confounded the critics. It has shown itself capable of adhering to the tight timetables laid down by the Regulation. The task force operates an open-door policy, encouraging parties to a proposed merger and their legal advisers to discuss their proposals with task force officials 'early and often'. Liaison between the Commission and the competition authorities of the member states appears to be working well. The Regulation is proving benevolent to mergers. They are being reviewed solely against competition criteria rather than wider social policy issues. Only nine of the clearance applications have gone to the full investigation stage and, of those, only one - Aerospatiale/De Havilland - has so far been blocked. While generalisations are difficult at this early stage, it is interesting to speculate about whether some of the results would have been the same if the transactions had been reviewed by the domestic competition authorities instead of by the Commission. All in all, few of the difficulties anticipated at the outset have materialised. While the task force has not been tested to the extent that it would have been if the Regulation had come into operation a couple of years earlier - at the height of the late 1980s' takeover boom - it is, nevertheless, interesting that its achievements are having a spin-off effect on the rest of the Competition Directorate. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, recently announced that he was considering the introduction of accelerated procedures for cases, particularly joint ventures, under Articles 85 and 86 of the Rome Treaty, similar to those under the Merger Regulation. But there are some difficulties. One relates to determining which types of joint venture are 'mergers' within the scope of the Regulation (for example, Thomson/Pilkington) and which are non-mergers coming within Articles 85 and 86 of the EEC Treaty (for example, Apollinaris/Schweppes). Knowing a merger when you see one may be an inevitable starting point, but revised guidelines from the Task Force would be helpful. Another difficulty relates to determining whether the Regulation applies to a particular transaction. Sir Leon has said that 'the Merger Regulation provides an excellent example of how subsidiarity can be put into practice . . . the allocation of jurisdiction between the Commission and the member states is clearly based on this principle'. Whatever the theory, answering the practical question of whether a transaction is above or below the relevant thresholds is often not easy. Sir Leon's suggestion that there should be one notification form which could be filed with either the Commission or member state authorities is, perhaps, recognition that identifying the correct 'shop' in which to 'stop' may never be entirely easy. Some generally applicable guidelines from the task force would also be appropriate. Reflecting the concept of subsidiarity, the thresholds are intended to bring within the ambit of the Regulation only those mergers which have Community-wide (or, at least, cross-border) effects, leaving those mergers which have an impact on only one member state to be scrutinised by the competition authority of that member state. Thus, the Office of Fair Trading examined Lloyds Bank's interest in Midland Bank while the Commission looked at Hong Kong and Shanghai's bid. The Regulation can also apply in some unexpected situations: It can apply even though neither of the parties to a transaction has headquarters in the EC. So long as the aggregate worldwide turnover of the parties to the merger exceeds Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.62bn) and the aggregate EC-wide turnover of each of at least two of the parties exceeds Ecu250m, the Regulation will apply to the transaction (unless each of the parties to the transaction achieves over two-thirds of its EC-wide turnover in the same member state). Thus, the Regulation applied to, for example, Mitsubishi's joint venture with Union Carbide, Matsushita's acquisition of MCA and AT&amp;T's bid for NCR. Conversely, the Regulation can apply even where both of the parties to a transaction are based in the same member state as in, for example, Steetley's proposed joint venture with Tarmac and Thorn EMI's acquisition of Virgin Music. The Steetley/Tarmac decision also illustrated another form of subsidiarity under the Regulation. If the Commission considers that the merger in question related to a 'distinct', rather than an EC-wide, market, it can 'refer' the transaction to the relevant member state's competition authority rather than examine it itself. Thus, there was a reference to the UK Office of Fair Trading and Monopolies and Mergers Commission in Steetley/Tarmac (bricks and clay tiles) but not in Thorn EMI/Virgin Music (music). The Regulation can also apply where only one of the parties to the transaction has its headquarters in the EC provided the thresholds summarised above are reached. Thus, the Regulation applied to Du Pont's acquisition of man-made fibre businesses from ICI and to Nestle's bid for Perrier (although both purchasers are Swiss companies). Nestle's bid for Perrier is likely to be remembered, however, for a different reason - recognition that the Regulation applies to oligopolistic (or collective) dominance as well as to single firm dominance. The Regulation does not expressly mention the concept - effectively, a presumption that competition is inhibited in a market with only a few players - although the concept is recognised, to varying extents, in German merger control law (Oligopolmarktbeherrschung) and in UK monopoly control law (complex monopoly). In Thorn EMI/Virgin Music, the presumption was rebutted. The Commission noted that, although the Thorn EMI/Virgin Music market share would be less than 25 per cent in nearly all member states and in the EC as a whole, the industry was highly concentrated with the top five companies (including Thorn EMI post-merger) having an 83 per cent EC market share. But, after an initial examination, the Commission cleared the transaction on the basis that the merger could not fundamentally change conditions of competition in the industry. In Nestle/Perrier, by contrast, the Commission concluded that the elimination, as a result of the merger, of Perrier as a competitor in the mineral water market in France and the resulting duopoly employed by Nestle and BSN would have significantly impeded competition. The conditions accepted by Nestle to secure clearance from the Commission are designed to create an independent third force in the market. With collective dominance firmly on the Merger Regulation map, there are likely to be implications for merger activity in a wide range of highly concentrated industries, not least recently privatised industries in the UK.

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Letter: Swings and roundabouts Sir, Ms Mary Campbell (Letters, July 27) claims that only rich (uncaring) parents would benefit from tax deductable child care. I am not rich but I can see the immediate benefit of paying less tax, or of being taxed only once. My salary is taxed, I pay the child minder and then she is taxed, so the money I earn is being taxed twice. A bit like VAT really, isn't it? And does Ms Campbell truly believe that the government would increase child benefit at a time when it is looking at ways to reduce its social security budget? Surely this argument is all swings and roundabouts anyway. Either the government loses/pays more money and working parents benefit or working parents continue to pay more money and the government benefits. Ann Thwaite, 11 Roden Gardens, Croydon CR0 2DQ</p>

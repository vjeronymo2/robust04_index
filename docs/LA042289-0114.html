			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEWS OF AFI FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of a selection of the screenings today and Sunday  at the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the  Cineplex Odeon Cenutry Plaza Cinemas.  </P> <P> SATURDAY  </P> <P> 'Prisoners of Inertia'  </P> <P> United States, 1989, 95 minutes  </P> <P> 9:10 p.m.  </P> <P>  Languid inertia grips newlyweds Amanda Plummer and Christopher Rich, faced  with almost too many ways to spend their New York Sunday afternoon. But before  this pleasant satiric comedy is over almost one of everything has happened. New  director Jeffrey Noyes Scher works with a pungent sense of what's new and  what's not in New York and his actors are cracklingly funny, although their  vehicle winds down around them.

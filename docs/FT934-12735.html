			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (17): Students' salad days are over - Cash warnings sound for Germany's over-crowded universities IN THE 1960s, a book called 'The Educational Crisis' pointed out that only 5 per cent of young Germans went to university. It sparked a national debate on reforming the country's elitist educational system. Today, politicians and the entire educational community are again locked in debate. But the situation has reversed: 30 per cent of young Germans, or 1.8m students, attend university, more than twice the number they can comfortably accommodate. And 40 per cent of them drop out after two or three years. Just as alarming, a third of all university students study for more than seven years, completing their courses well after the age of 28, the average age at which most German students leave university. The popularity of the universities is slowly undermining Germany's much envied Dual System, which provides vocational training as an alternative to higher education and has produced a body of highly skilled young workers. From the end of the war until three years ago, more young Germans preferred vocational training to university. The balance has since changed: there are now 1.8m university students compared with 1.7m vocational trainees. The trend has put financial pressure on the federal states, the Lander, which are responsible for all education costs other than buildings and infrastructure which are met by the federal government. For the first time since the 1960s, the German states last year were forced to cut education spending by DM1bn to DM29bn. To bring the rising costs of education under control and adapt it to the needs of a changing world economy, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has taken a personal interest in the issue. Later this year he will chair a meeting of all state premiers and members of the educational establishment to discuss ways of narrowing the widening gap between the universities and the market place. He spoke recently of 'a worrying academisation of our society' and an described the new balance between university students and vocational trainees as 'unhealthy' for the prosperity of German businesses. There is also pressure from the private sector to reform the educational system. Together with some members of the educational establishment, business associations are calling for a radical rethink of higher education in Germany, including the fact that it is state-controlled, free and accepts all students with a high school diploma. 'The whole system has to be changed if we want to remain competitive internationally,' says Mr Tyll Necker, chairman of the German industry federation, the BDI. The reforms long favoured by the private sector have now been taken up by the federal government which has outlined a series of measures to be discussed at Chancellor Kohl's roundtable this autumn. However, the influence of the federal government is limited to setting a general framework and educational policy is the responsibility of the Lander. To change the system coherently, a rare show of cross-party solidarity will be needed between Lander of different political colours. They are about to face a number of wide-ranging proposals from the federal government, including: Shorter study courses: Bonn wants secondary schooling to last 12 years rather than 13 as is now the practice in western Germany. Students should pass their Abitur, the comprehensive exam at the end of secondary school, when they are 18 rather than 19. This suggestion has been strongly criticised, especially by the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and the teachers' unions. In eastern Germany, where secondary schooling usually lasted 12 years before reunification, Brandenburg, now controlled by the SPD, recently changed to 13 years. There is also resistance on the right wing - from the Bavarian Christian Social Union a junior partner in the Bonn coalition, which fears that the quality of education would be diluted. The federal government also intends to discuss shortening the length of university studies. The idea is to charge students for spending more than the average time needed to complete a course. The SPD objects that this would discriminate against poorer students who interrupt their studies to finance their living expenses. More flexibility: The government suggests that university students who fail to graduate should be able to apply for jobs held by apprentices. In contrast, apprentices must be allowed to go to university at a later age. At the moment, the separation between the two systems remains too rigid, government officials say. Education must to be closer to the needs of the market place. Technical universities, or Fachhochschulen, will only qualify for new funds if they offer courses in areas of industry which have growth prospects, (such as recycling). But this is proving difficult to implement at a time when Lander are cutting their education budgets. Universities must be reformed. The government is proposing wideranging measures designed to make universities compete with one another. While some universities are better rated than others, students at present tend to go to their local ones. Now the government wants to introduce open entrance examinations and to give universities more financial say over courses and staff appointments. However, there is enormous resistance to such reforms from the educational establishment. Professors are public servants in Germany and enjoy special privileges and job security. 'There is nothing you can do to a professor unless he steals money,' says Mr Hermann Riehl, director of the Christian Democratic parliamentary group in charge of education. As a result, universities have tended simply to increase their courses without distinguishing between purely academic and applied subjects. Closer links between students and the working place. 'We need to make sure that students are prepared for specific concrete jobs and that they get corporate training in the work place,' explains Ms Anke Brunn, education minister in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. However, the private sector, already hit by recession, cannot easily devote more resources to education. Mr Necker, from the BDI, stresses that businesses want to be involved in formulating educational policy. But so far there is little private funding for new programmes. Private sponsorship of on-site training and university teaching fell for the first time last year. Some 3,000 companies will offer 12,000 such programmes in 1993/1994, as compared with 12,000 places the previous year, according to the German Economic Institute in Cologne, the IW. 'Our educational system is not oriented toward performances but toward diplomas,' says Mr Riehl. Government officials warn: without structural changes, long and expensive higher education will undermine the competitiveness of German companies.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: DOWNEY;  </P> <P> $43.9-MILLION BUDGET IS UP 6.3% FROM CURRENT YEAR  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday approved a $43.9-million operating budget for the  coming year, an increase of 6.3% in spending over the current year.  </P> <P> An aquatics program at the new community swimming pool at Downey High School is  the only major new program in the coming fiscal year, which begins July 1 and  runs through June 30, 1991, City Manager Gerald M. Caton said.  </P> <P> The pool opened Monday.  </P> <P> Otherwise, the budget largely duplicates the level of services that the city is  currently providing to residents, he said. Salary increases and the higher cost  of city employee benefits account for $1.5 million in additional spending, said  Lee Powell, assistant city manager.  </P> <P> The city's general fund, which pays for most daily operations including Police  and Fire Department salaries, is balanced. The fund is projected to have a  $3.6-million reserve at the start and end of the year.  </P> <P> In addition to the $43.9 million, the budget anticipates spending $12.4 million  on capital improvements such as a water main and renovation of Furman Park.  </P> <P> The City Council also improved increases in some service fees it charges  residents, including various planning fees for new construction. It also  approved a new fee for non-residents who use paramedic service in the city.  </P></p>

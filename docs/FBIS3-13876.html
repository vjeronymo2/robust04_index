			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>   [Text] The Fatah Central Committee began a series of  meeting in Tunis yesterday. The 18-man committee, chaired by  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, is discussing the political  situation and the developments in the occupied territory  following the issuance of the Security Council resolution on the  massacre of the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.    President 'Arafat called for the meeting the day before  yesterday. A number of the Fatah Central Committee members,  including Salim al-Za'nun, also known as Abu-al-Adib; 'Abbas  Zaki; and Muhammad Jihad, left Amman yesterday morning to attend  the meetings.    In a statement to AL-RA'Y one hour before leaving Amman for  the Tunisian capital, Salim al-Za'nun -- one of the founders of  Fatah in 1964 and acting speaker of the Palestine National  Council -- said: What has been achieved on the political level  and the [Palestinian-Israeli] talks will top the agenda of this  meeting, especially following the issuance of the recent  Security Council resolution.    Al-Za'nun said: There will be no going back on the  Palestinian participation in the coming Arab-Israeli talks, and  the Palestinian leadership has recently made a decision to  participate in the talks. He added: We should not be over  optimistic. Israel is trying to absorb the anger following the  blatant Hebron massacre; however, the Israelis will return to  their old methods. Therefore, it is necessary to hold a  quadripartite meeting comprising Syria, Jordan, Palestine, and  Lebanon as soon as possible to unify the stand of the countries  involved in the Arab-Israeli talks.    Al-Za'nun described U.S. reservation about the issue of  Jerusalem in the last Security Council resolution as a blow to  the Oslo accord. He added: I consider the U.S. reservation  about the paragraph related to Jerusalem and the occupied  territory a retreat on the part of Washington from its previous  stand vis-a-vis these two issues. This negativeness weakens the  Security Council resolution.    Al-Za'nun said: It is true that Security Council Resolution  904 on the massacre of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron is  positive with regard to the condemnation of the massacre, but  there is negativeness in it. The resolution exposed the U.S.  stand which has delayed the issuance of the resolution all this  time.    Salim al-Za'nun said: The U.S. reservation on the issue of  Jerusalem together with the statements made by Rabin and the  U.S. representative at the United Nations -- that Jerusalem is  the eternal capital of Israel and that it is not a subject to  discussion -- is a serious matter. This is considered a blow to  the Oslo accord which placed the issue of Jerusalem on the  agenda even if after two years.    Concluding his statement to AL-RA'Y, al-Za'nun said:  Jerusalem is of special importance to the Arabs and Muslims.  Therefore, an Arab and Islamic move is needed to discuss this  issue as an integral part of the Arab territory occupied in 1967.</p>

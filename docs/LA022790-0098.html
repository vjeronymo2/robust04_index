			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. FACES TOUGH CHALLENGE IN HELPING AILING ECONOMY;  </P> <P> FOREIGN AID: AMERICAN-INSPIRED SANCTIONS HAVE DEALT A SEVERE BLOW TO THE  COUNTRY. 'THERE IS NOTHING MUCH TO REBUILD,' SAYS ONE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration's efforts to nurse Nicaragua's sanctions-strangled  economy back to health are likely to be more modest -- and decidedly more  difficult -- than the U.S. rebuilding of Panama, government and private  analysts said Monday.  </P> <P> Not only have the U.S. trade restrictions on Nicaragua been broader and more  effective than those that Washington imposed on Panama, but Nicaragua had only  a rudimentary economy before the United States clamped on its embargo.  </P> <P> "As a result, there is nothing much to rebuild -- everything has to start just  about from scratch," said a U.S. official who is involved in the  Administration's review of the Nicaraguan economic situation.  </P> <P> Lance Taylor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who surveyed  Nicaragua's economy last year under a contract for Sweden's foreign aid agency,  reached the same conclusion.  </P> <P> Nicaragua's greatest need, he said, is cash to pay for the goods it has to  import "until the economy has a chance to recover. And that could take quite a  while."  </P> <P> The U.S. sanctions, imposed by former President Ronald Reagan on May 1, 1985,  include an embargo on virtually all trade between the two countries, a cut-off  of all commercial air traffic and refusal to allow Nicaraguan-flagged ships to  enter U.S. ports.  </P> <P> Washington has also blocked all lending to Nicaragua by international financial  institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the  Inter-American Development Bank.  </P> <P> Although the trade embargo has not left Nicaragua totally helpless, it has  crimped that country's exports and forced Nicaragua to hunt for substitute  markets abroad -- often at the price of having to pay higher shipping costs.  </P> <P> The trade restrictions are far more sweeping than those that the United States  imposed on Panama in March, 1988, as part of an effort to depose Gen. Manuel A.  Noriega, then the country's dictator. The United States lifted those  restrictions after its Dec. 20 invasion of Panama forced Noriega out of power.  Noriega is now in a Miami jail awaiting trial on drug-trafficking charges.  </P> <P> In Panama's case, the United States had also frozen the country's cash assets  in the United States, as well as tax payments from U.S. firms with branches in  Panama and fees that the U.S. government owed for the use of the Panama Canal.  But Nicaragua had none of these assets for the United States to freeze.  </P> <P> "It's a far cry from Panama," an Administration official said, referring to  possible lifting of the sanctions. "The jump-start rhetoric we've used in  Panama just doesn't apply."  </P> <P> Taylor's calculations show that the embargo has cost Nicaragua about $100  million a year in lost trade -- a sizable sum in an economy that totals only  $2.5 billion annually.  </P> <P> "It has been quite effective," he said. "Exports have fallen off sharply, while  imports have remained high."  </P> <P> The years of U.S. trade sanctions, combined with the Nicaraguan government's  prosecution of a civil war against the Contras, have left the country's economy  in tatters and in need of emergency help.  </P> <P> The economy is in a recession and is plagued by hyper-inflation. Export  earnings are down to less than half the $700 million to $800-million per year  that prevailed in the late 1970s. And Nicaragua is about $250 million in  arrears on loans to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.  </P> <P> "The economy there is in shambles," said Peter Hakim, director of the  Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank that specializes in  Latin American economic affairs. "They really are in serious trouble."  </P> <P> Analysts estimate that lifting of the U.S. sanctions and unblocking potential  loans from the World Bank and the development bank could help buoy Nicaragua's  economy until the new democratic government can begin to rebuild it.  </P> <P> The United States could also revive some old trade benefits, such as the  duty-free status for Nicaraguan imports here. It also could accept Nicaraguan  sugar.  </P> <P> But most experts see little that the United States can do to stimulate the  country's economy very quickly. Nicaragua's major exports include cotton,  shrimp, meat and coffee, and the world price of all four commodities is  falling.  </P> <P> In addition, U.S. foreign aid already is committed to the brim, and European  governments are more likely to be interested in investing their aid in the  emerging East European democracies.  </P> <P> "It's going to be pretty much up to the Nicaraguans themselves," Taylor said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. SANCTIONS ON NICARAGUA  </P> <P> The U.S. trade embargo against Nicaragua was imposed by former President Reagan  on May 1, 1985, and continued by President Bush last Oct. 25.  </P> <P> Bush said then that if Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega were to hold fair  elections and implement democratic reforms "the emergency that prompted the  imposition of the trade sanctions would largely be resolved."  </P> <P> The sanctions impose:  </P> <P> An embargo on all U.S. exports to or imports from Nicaragua of goods or  technical data;  </P> <P> A ban on all flights to and from the United States by Aeronica, the Nicaraguan  airline;  </P> <P> A ban on entry of Nicaraguan-registered ships into U.S. ports;  </P> <P> Termination of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation with  Nicaragua.  </P> <P> Exceptions to the trade ban include books and magazines, as well as medicine,  food and clothing "intended to be used to relieve human suffering."  </P> <P> Nicaragua, a poorly developed agricultural nation, exports mainly coffee,  cotton, bananas and other farm products; it imports machinery, equipment and  oil, among other items.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TRADE WITH U.S. AND SOVIET BLOC  </P> <P> The United States was once Nicaragua's biggest trading partner. But trade has  dwindled to virtually nothing since the 1979 revolution that brought leftist  Sandinistas to power. The Reagan Administration suspended economic aid in 1981  and imposed trade sanctions in 1985. Meanwhile Nicaragua's imports from Soviet  Bloc nations, mainly the Soviet Union and Cuba, have soared.  </P> <P> * 1983-88 figures provided by U.S. Latest data available.  </P> <P> Source: Direction of Trade Statistics Yearbook  </P></p>

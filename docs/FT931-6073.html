			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Arts: A night of purgatory - Television Every few years someone in the US writes a best selling book which blames one mass medium or another for the ills of society, particularly the violence. First horror comics, then movies, were the butt; then, about 30 years ago, television became the favourite target. Each focused so tightly upon one particular tree that the writer is incapable of observing the wood beyond: the whole span of human history with its wars, tribal conflicts and rape; horrible violence perpetrated in the name of everything from religion to political belief, from territorial greed to entertainment. The danger and sadness of such books is that they offer unthinking people an easy escape from unpleasant realities. Many jump at the opportunity to blame television for virtually anything: sexual abuse of children, juvenile delinquency, and inner city riots, even though all have been a part of human society for millennia. Repeatedly this column has pointed out the silliness of calling for the censorship of television as though that would somehow change human nature. The response 'Ah, but television makes it all so much worse and increases the numbers of abusers/delinquents/rioters' suggests a failure to read Mayhew, Dickens, or even old copies of Punch in order to understand how bad things used to be. However, the most recent book is couched in such reasonable terms, so willing to concede that the mass media alone are not responsible for all our ills, that it commands more attention than most. True, author Michael Medved is more concerned with the cinema than television, hence the title: Hollywood vs. America. But the chapter published this week in the Sunday Times is devoted to rock music, including the output on the cable and satellite channel MTV. As introduction Medved notes 'I do not claim that media messages cause destructive behaviour, but I do contend that they encourage it. At the same time, I never stress the pernicious power of one movie, or one TV show, or one hit song. What concerns me is the accumulated impact of irresponsible messages that are repeated hour after hour, year after year. The most significant problems of the popular culture stem from the pervasive presence of anti-social material, not from a few isolated examples of offensiveness.' He then gives an undeniably unpleasant catalogue of rock lyrics involving the subjection of women, necrophilia, sado-masochism, and mutilation of female genitals. Specifically he quotes the lines from a Guns 'n Roses number: 'Panties round your knees with your arse in debris . . . Tied up, tied down, up against the wall . . . Turn around bitch I got a use for you' and more. He quotes a research study by America's National Coalition on Television Violence from the winter of 1991 which examined 750 music videos from cable and broadcast television and discovered an average of 20 acts of violence per hour. On MTV, he reports, the situation was even more extreme: 29 instances of violent imagery in an average hour of programming. I still feel that television mimics people much more than people mimic television, but there were two things in this particular instance which hinted that there might be more reason than usual for concern. First, my own casual viewing of MTV via the Astra satellite suggested that unlike other channels, where a violent or otherwise objectionable programme will invariably be surrounded by different and mainly unobjectionable material, MTV, a channel dedicated pretty well exclusively to rock videos, might be producing abnormal concentrations of nasty material. Second, some parents seemed to use MTV as a sort of baby-sitter for bigger children, not merely allowing them to watch it on their own for hours on end but flatly refusing to watch with them on account of the ghastly noise. If such concentrations did exist, and if children were left to imbibe it for hours alone, might this not eventually have some effect? On Sunday evening, leaving the video to capture A Year In Provence, Prague in the 'Screen Two' series and the South Bank Show on Jean Genet, I switched to MTV and stayed with it for hour after hour. It was a deeply dispiriting experience, though not, chiefly, for the reasons advanced by Medved. No doubt he would have been appalled at the words of the song 'School For Fools' by Love Sex And Death, who have presumably been listening to Pink Floyd: 'Whaddya learn at school? School's for fools. Teacher tells yer what ter say, teacher tells yer when ter pray, whaddya learn in school? Nothing', and the lyrics to 'Razzmataz' by Pulp (or it could have been 'Pulp' by Razzmataz) which began 'The trouble with your brother is he's always sleeping with your mother . . .' But that sort of thing was just as rare as the remarkable (borrowed) words to 'Here Comes The War' from New Model Army: 'Put out the lights on the age of reason . . . the whirling dervish spinning faster and faster, the centre cannot hold . . . give us liberty or give us death'. Mostly on MTV the words  -when they could be heard by a normal person which was less than half the time - were like objets trouves: ill assorted and meaningless. Perhaps European MTV is different from the American version but, on this night in Britain, at any rate, the objection was more often tedium than corruption. Perhaps Medved would argue against this, claiming that there are as many examples here as in the US of what he calls 'a contemptuous attitude towards religion'. Certainly lots of bands seem to have followed Madonna and taken to using the trappings of religion in a profoundly irreverent way. Yet if you regard religious organisation as frequently one of the more pernicious aspects of human society this may not worry you, and if you are opposed to the overloading of violent imagery then presumably you will approve attempts to devitalise the most widespread violent image in the western world: the head and torso of a man, dripping blood from a crown of thorns. That familiar image certainly featured large on Sunday night. But a solid evening of Anglo-European MTV produces other worries. The sheer tedium of group after group offering nothing but guitar and drums with occasional keyboards has to be experienced to be believed. From Les Thugs to Man-O-War, from Distortion to Protect And Survive all they offer is an undifferentiated outpouring of rhythmical noise. Was I imagining it, or were things utterly different when I was 17? I checked the 1961 charts and found everything from Dave Brubeck to Nat King Cole and Petula Clark. True, there was rhythmical noise from The Shadows but there was also melody from the Everly Brothers and real tunes from Ray Charles. Perhaps European television still spares our children the worst excesses of its American counterpart, but the rock video seems to be killing the art of popular music and putting in its place a drearily meaningless sequence of unconnected images: fire, desert, motor cars and motorbikes, crucifixes, leather jeans, and back to fire. Watching it for more than five minutes must surely seem, to anyone with even a spark of intelligence, like purgatory.</p>

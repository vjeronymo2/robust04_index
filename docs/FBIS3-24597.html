Yakubov, Novosibirsk Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry,  Siberian Department, Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC 577.123]    [Abstract] A study examined the reaction of  oligonucleotides and their reactive derivatives carrying the  fragment 4'[N-2-chloroethyl-N-methyl)amino]benzylamine in their  5'-terminal phosphate group with the proteins of blood serum.  The desoxyribonucleotides p(T)[.sup]16[/] and  (pTGACCCTCTTCCCATT) used in the studies were synthesized by the  phosphotriester method in a solution. A [.sup]32[/]P  radioactive label was introduced into the oligonucleotides by  exchange of the 5'-terminal phosphate. Double-stranded DNA of  the plasmid pTZ18R and heparin were used as competitors to  determine the specificity of the reaction of the oligonucleotide  derivatives with the proteins. Murine monoclonal antibodies  specific for human myoglobin were used to study the interaction  of the oligonucleotides with the immunoglobins IgG and IgM.  During the experiments, whole human blood serum was incubated  with different concentrations of alkylating oligonucleotide  derivatives at 37 for 10 or 40 minutes. The modified  proteins were analyzed by DS-Na-electrophoresis in gradient  polyacrylamide gel in a Laemmli system. The experiments  demonstrated that incubation of whole human blood serum with  different concentrations of the alkylating derivative  p(T)[.sup]16[/] results in affine modification of several  proteins, including albumin and the immunoglobins M and G. The  dependence of the degree of modification of these three proteins  on oligonucleotide concentration was taken as evidence that the  oligonucleotides have a higher affinity to IgM than to IgG and  albumin. Binding of the reactive oligomer derivatives with the  proteins was inhibited in the presence of various polyanions,  i.e., oligomers of another composition, double-strand DNA, and  heparin. The fact that heparin had the greatest inhibiting  effect for the immunoglobins led to speculation regarding  relatively nonspecific ionic interaction in the formation of the  complex IgG-oligonucleotide. Reaction of the oligonucleotide  with monoclonal antibodies of the subclass G1 was inhibited in  the presence of a specific antigen. This finding was taken as an  indication that the oligonucleotides may react with the  immunoglobins either at or near the site where the antigen is  recognized by the antibody. The experiments performed thus  established that oligonucleotides bind with basic blood proteins  with a rather high affinity and revealed interacting features of  the reaction of immunoglobins with oligonucleotides that may be  used to study the effector functions of these molecules.

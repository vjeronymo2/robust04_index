			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / UK aim to speed up wideningof EC likely to be thwarted BRITAIN'S AIM to speed up enlargement of the European Community is likely to be thwarted by other member states which insist that the Maastricht treaty and the EC budget increase should be approved first. Britain would like a symbolic start to negotiations with Austria, Switzerland, Sweden and Finland - all members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) - before the end of its six-month presidency, which begins on July 1. It believes this would spur ratification of Maastricht. But a majority of foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Saturday to prepare next weekend's Lisbon summit decided that negotiations should not begin until the treaty's ratification was complete, and an acceptable financial package agreed. Both outcomes are still uncertain, in spite of relief among ministers that the Irish ignored Denmark's rejection of the treaty and voted Yes to Maastricht in last Thursday's referendum. Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, and his Spanish counterpart at the meeting, Mr Carlos Westendorp, cut through Saturday's euphoria over the Irish vote to reassert their conviction that the European Commission's 1993-97 budget proposals were the only acceptable way of encouraging economic convergence between rich and poor EC members. The poorer countries were unhappy about a possible compromise which would spread EC revenue increases over seven rather than five years. That has sown the seeds for a fierce debate between EC leaders in Lisbon, although foreign ministers confirmed that the final decision on funding the Community would not be taken until December's Edinburgh summit. They also outlined the likely outcome of summit discussions on other issues: Enlargement: EC leaders will probably ask the Commission to prepare a mandate for negotiation with the four Efta applicants and will issue a statement to soften the blow for those countries still on the waiting list - Turkey, Cyprus, Malta, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Subsidiarity - that is, the principle that the Community should only concern itself with issues which cannot be dealt with better at national level. Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, who was shaken by Danish citizens' implicit criticism three weeks ago of an over-centralised EC, told ministers there were areas where Community involvement could be scaled down, although he refused to disclose his ideas to journalists afterwards. The Lisbon summit is expected to produce a declaration reaffirming the EC's commitment to the principle. Ministers also rallied round a paper prepared by the Benelux countries which restated the smaller EC countries' fears that they might be pushed aside by changes in the management of an enlarged Community. Member states have agreed there should be no institutional changes before 1996. The Benelux countries said large member states would have to accept 'a certain over-representation' of smaller countries in the Commission, Council of Ministers and Parliament. Mr Delors denied after Saturday's meeting that little would be achieved in Lisbon. 'It will be possible to reach a global orientation, a good orientation, on the Delors II (budget) package and a broad consensus on the question of how to proceed with enlargement,' he said. British and German foreign ministers confirmed on Saturday that London and Frankfurt were still in the running as possible sites for the European Central Bank, despite rumours to the contrary. The issue is likely to be discussed at Lisbon. Editorial comment Page 14</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: State sells stake in Fletcher Challenge The New Zealand Government last night announced it had sold all its shares overnight in Fletcher Challenge and Fletcher Forests for NZDollars 418m. The government said it had broken even on the deal. The minister of finance Bill Birch said in an interview that it had never been the government's intention to profit from holding the shares. 'Our instructions to Treasury were that we were not in the business of trading shares in a public company, and that they were to be sold at a price which covered holding costs, and brokerage less dividends,' he said. Mr Birch said that the shares had been sold under a mandate by CS First Boston to international investors in the US and Australia. The parcels comprised 104m ordinary shares and 26m Forestry shares. Mr Birch said that the money would be used to repay foreign debt. The government had consistently said it was not a long term holder of the shares. He said that the reduction in debt would be positive for interest rates, which had already fallen sharply yesterday, when the New Zealand exchange rate hit a two-year high following the signing of the GATT agreement. The government acquired the shares at NZDollars 3.83 each last year, or a total cost of NZDollars 400m (USDollars 223.5m) under a put option arranged with Fletcher Challenge in 1988 when it acquired the Petrocorp group of companies. Fletcher Challenge shares rise 10 cents on Wednesday to NZDollars 3.43 on rumours that the sale was imminent. Last month Fletcher Challenge floated off Fletcher Forests as a separate company from the parent.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Heseltine woos Tory coal rebels MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will today launch a campaign to win support for his coal white paper, encouraged by the early reaction of potential Conservative rebels to the broad outline of his proposals. At least two of the 11 Tory MPs who failed to support the government when its pit closure programme was debated in October appeared to have been brought into line by reports that a package to save or mothball between 12 and 19 of the 31 threatened pits had been agreed. But there were still concerns that the government was putting in place what amounted to a short-term political fix, with some of last year's rebels continuing to pledge defiance. A meeting of 12 MPs in the coal group of Tory backbenchers was understood to have agreed to focus on improving the long-term prospects for coal if, as expected, the subsidies proposed by the government are limited to two years. As the coal and electricity industries continued their attempts to agree core contracts on coal supplies, Mr Heseltine was expected to back down from his previous insistence that these deals be signed before the white paper is published. The moment of truth for Mr Heseltine will come when MPs vote on the package next week. The government was last night considering rescheduling a previously announced debate on Maastricht to give it the option of accommodating the coal proposals next Monday. The white paper - to be called 'The Prospects for Coal' - will be published today and runs to more than 100 pages. It will be accompanied by an employment training package for the affected regions, worth up to Pounds 100m. Under the proposals, pits not earmarked for action could be transferred to the private sector. Others could be transferred to the private sector under a speeded-up privatisation programme. The government will offer a subsidy estimated at between Pounds 5 and Pounds 12 per tonne, as well as proposals for expanding the coal market by curbing imports. Officials were emphasising that ministers would not decide which pits survived. Pits scheduled for closure will still be subject to a statutory review. The six mothballed pits are likely to include at least some of the four originally earmarked for mothballing, but then reprieved, last October. There was scepticism among British Coal managers last night about whether the white paper would lead to many of the apparently reprieved pits staying open for as long as two years. The government won last October's vote with a majority of 13, aided by Ulster Unionist abstentions. Costs of mothballing, Page 8 Dark descent, Page 20 Lex, Page 22</p>

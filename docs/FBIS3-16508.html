			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Etibar Mamedov, leader of the Azerbaijani National  Independence Party, held a news conference today for the  Azerbaijani and foreign reporters.    [Unidentified reporter] Etibar Mamedov said that the news  conference was devoted to the results of his visit to the United  States. Speaking of his visit to the United States, Etibar  Mamedov said that he had received an invitation last year to  visit that country, but it was not until this year that the  visit became possible.    He said that during his contacts at Congress, the State  Department, and the Institute for International Strategic  Studies his delegation met high-ranking officials and discussed  a number of issues. He said his meetings with the U.S. National  Security Council official responsible for Russia, the Caucasus,  and Asia, as well as the active members of the Armenian lobby  were particularly important.    He said that following his contacts he came to the  conclusion  that the Americans were not well informed about Azerbaijan and  developments here, and that this situation was mostly due to the  influence of the Armenian lobby in the United States. The  Armenian lobby is organized and financed by Armenians living in  the United States. Regrettably, one cannot say the same for the  Azerbaijanis. Besides, there was no factual information on the  occupation of Azerbaijani territory and the tens of thousands of  refugees.    Speaking of the sociopolitical situation in the republic,  Etibar Mamedov referred particularly to the latest discovery of  illegally-held arms and to the discovery of a considerable  amount of arms at the headquarters of the Azerbaijani People's  Front.    He also expressed his views on the results of the meeting  between the leaders of the Armenian and Azerbaijani parliaments  on the peaceful resolution of the conflict.    At the end of the press conference, Etibar Mamedov also  replied to reporters' questions.</p>

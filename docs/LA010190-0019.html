			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEHIND PASADENA'S ROSE-COLORED GLASSES, A CITY OF DIVERSITY;  </P> <P> PARADE: COLORFUL FLOATS AND SPIRITED BANDS WILL TAKE A TOUR OF THE CITY'S HIGH  AND LOW POINTS.  </P> <P> There is a popular theory that views the Tournament of Roses as a prime reason  -- the prime reason -- for the population explosion in Southern California.  </P> <P> Every year on New Year's Day, millions of shivering Easterners and  Midwesterners tune their television sets to the festivities in Pasadena. What  they see is a compelling small-screen vision of balmy revelry, complete with  suntanned princesses, football players in short sleeves, swirls of flowers and  sun-dappled mountains. Then, migrating like lemmings, dazzled television  viewers join the westward march.  </P> <P> So goes the theory.  </P> <P> For a century, Pasadenans have treasured that vision of their city as a place  where dreams come true and the weather's fine any time of year.  </P> <P> But behind the image of civilized hoopla is a complicated city of 132,000,  struggling fitfully to reconcile its diverse elements. These days, the  once-idyllic community -- which seems to stretch across the map of the western  San Gabriel Valley like a child's bib -- has gangs, drugs, smog and a running  debate on development. But it also can boast of visionary entrepreneurship,  socially concerned city leaders, impressive arts and educational institutions  and -- especially during the holiday season -- a spirit of optimism.  </P> <P> "The Tournament focuses international attention on the city," said Pasadena  Mayor William Thomson, "but it's also a time of celebration within the city. We  tend to put aside our troubles and differences and focus on the good things in  our lives."  </P> <P> The Rose Parade, which began 101 years ago as a horse-and-buggy romp through  wrestern Pasadena, now cuts through the geographical and economic heart of the  city. For discerning Pasadenans, the 5.5-mile parade route represents a brief  tour of the city's high points and low points.  </P> <P> It begins, fittingly, on Orange Grove Boulevard, where the city itself began in  the late 19th Century. The parade starts out from the heart of well-to-do  Pasadena, in a palmy section south of the Rose Bowl called "Millionaire's Row."  </P> <P> By 8:10 a.m. today, when the Riverside Community College Marching Tigers Band  leads the parade down the boulevard, the neighborhood will be crammed with  floats and marchers.  </P> <P> For well-heeled residents, this is something between a nuisance and a blessing.  "You sort of can't live with it and you can't live without it," said Ken  Grobecker, who grumbles good-naturedly about the parade goers who jam the west  Pasadena neighborhood each year.  </P> <P> The parade moves out slowly, passing the sprawling Norton Simon Museum of Art,  then moving into Old Pasadena, the city's commercial district.  </P> <P> Old Pasadena is where city planners like to tout their city's spirit of  creativity. In less than 10 years, the area has gone from Skid Row to "Westwood  East." Buildings that once moldered in disuse now house a Cajun restaurant, a  fitness club, an espresso bar and a disco. More than 120 new businesses have  opened there since 1980.  </P> <P> Doug Brignole was one of the pioneers. He bought an 80-year-old DeLacey Avenue  stable in 1985 and turned it into a prosperous health club.  </P> <P> Not everyone is overjoyed about the crowds of young urban professionals surging  from shop to shop.  </P> <P> "It has a shiny new coat of paint, but, yeah, it's lost something," said Paul  Elliott, a former Art Center College of Design student.  </P> <P> "My favorite place was a bar called Hazel's," he said, "where the old-timers  used to sit at the bar and drink straight shots of whiskey. . . . Now I see  they've built a Benetton's where the Salvation Army used to be. That's the end  of any neighborhood."  </P> <P> His is a minority view. Cassandra Einstein, a San Marino artist who sips cafe  au lait at a Colorado Boulevard cafe, likes it just fine.  </P> <P> "Everybody who lives in Hollywood thinks this is the slow lane out here," said  Einstein, a recent Los Angeles transplant. "But this is a charming little place  to get yourself together in the morning."  </P> <P> A mile or so to the north of the parade route, Carolyn Stonestreet sits on a  bench at a Fair Oaks Avenue bus stop, talking about her troubled life in  northwest Pasadena.  </P> <P> "I'm basically homeless now," she said. "I'm staying with my sister and her  boyfriend. I took my kids to their grandmother."  </P> <P> Stonestreet's problems began when, after a long custody fight for her children  -- now 5 and 9 -- she was dismissed by the pharmaceutical firm where she had  worked for 14 years.  </P> <P> "Welfare sent me to a shelter in downtown Los Angeles," she said, sobbing  quietly. "I was terrified. I came back to Pasadena and told the social worker  it was unbelievable. I'd rather sleep on the streets over here than go back  over there."  </P> <P> This is the neighborhood where the underclass of Pasadena lives. Predominantly  black, northwest Pasadena had about 102 drive-by shootings in 1989. Six people  were killed and 69 injured -- many of them innocent bystanders -- in shooting  incidents, police say.  </P> <P> The neighborhood also has many hard-working homeowners and apartment dwellers,  sometimes overwhelmed by the crime around them. "The attitude by the  authorities seems to be, as long as it's not blown out of proportion, let it  go," one resident said.  </P> <P> "It's a population that's basically a labor population" but "there's not a  single smokestack in Pasadena," said Ibrahim Naeem, director of the  Pasadena-Foothill Branch of the Los Angeles Urban League.  </P> <P> The result is a vast gap between haves and have-nots. A city commission on  youth and families recently compared income levels in a census tract in  northwest Pasadena with one in wealthy west Pasadena. They found a $68,170  difference in median family income.  </P> <P> Often, that gap translates into a black Pasadena and a white Pasadena, black  leaders contend. "The city's attitude in the past can be called neglect at  best," Naeem said.  </P> <P> The Board of City Directors (Pasadena's city council) has tried recently to  assuage the restive black community, which constitutes about 25% of the city.  Last month, after months of criticism, the board authorized a $100,000 audit of  city personnel practices to determine whether city policies have been racist or  sexist over the past five years.  </P> <P> When the parade reaches the corner of Marengo Avenue, it is in developer  territory, say slow-growth activists.  </P> <P> The construction of the two-block Plaza Pasadena mall, between Marengo and Los  Robles avenues, was one of the first signs that the city was on a  no-holds-barred growth track, said Mike Salazar, co-chairman of Pasadenan  Residents In Defense of our Environment (PRIDE).  </P> <P> After 1977, when the Community Redevelopment Agency demolished such older  structures as the Pasadena Athletic Club to make way for the mall, slow-growth  resistance started to build. There were early battles, like a 1980 petition  drive that ultimately stopped a plan for twin office towers in the middle of  town. But boxy office towers continued to spring up, particularly along  traffic-clogged Lake and Los Robles avenues.  </P> <P> City planners say 156 office buildings have been built in the city since 1980,  almost doubling office space to about 9.7 million square feet. At the same  time, condominium projects popped up like toadstools.  </P> <P> "People would go to the city and complain that it wasn't fair to their  neighborhoods, which had been single-family homes for years," said Claire  Bogaard, executive director of the preservation group Pasadena Heritage. "But  generally the developers got their way."  </P> <P> The scene was set for a battle at the polls. Last March, PRIDE won, as 57% of  the voters approved a measure to restrict new housing and large commercial  projects.  </P> <P> City leaders worry that the measure will stifle the entrepreneurial spirit that  brought Pasadena out of economic doldrums. "It's already causing a housing  scarcity and driving up prices," Mayor Thomson said.  </P> <P> William Podley, president of the Pasadena-based real estate firm of Podley  Caughey Associates, says prices are indeed skyrocketing.  </P> <P> "Properties we handled last year for $190,000 or $195,000 are going for  $240,000, maybe even $250,000." he said.  </P> <P> The parade passes Hill Avenue, a main thoroughfare for Pasadena City College  and, a few blocks to the south, Caltech. A mile north of the route, on  Washington Boulevard, Mary Donikian doles out baklava for a customer at the  American Armenian Grocery.  </P> <P> It is a fragrant place, full of the dried fruits, nuts and cheeses that  Armenians serve during the holidays.  </P> <P> Armenians used to celebrate Christmas on Jan. 6, commemorating the arrival of  the three kings on the Day of Epiphany. "But we're getting used to American  ways," said Donikian, who came to the United States from Lebanon 10 years ago.  </P> <P> Getting used to those ways has been tough going for many of Pasadena's 15,000  Armenians. Refugees from discrimination in the Middle East and repression in  the Soviet Union, most arrive with little knowledge of English and few job  skills.  </P> <P> Yet Pasadena has accepted them with extraordinary generosity, Armenian leaders  say.  </P> <P> In 1985, the Board of Directors gave Armenians a special protected status in  awarding city contracts and recruiting for city jobs. Now, a polling firm is  conducting the first-ever Armenian census to implement an affirmative action  program.  </P> <P> It has not been easy sledding, said Serge Samoniantz, whose firm is doing the  census.  </P> <P> "Those who have had experience with local government in the Soviet Union are  extremely distrustful of anything that smacks of government," Samoniantz said.  </P> <P> A hard right onto Sierra Madre Boulevard, and the parade comes to rest in  Victory Park, where the colorful floats are then put on display.  </P> <P> It's an appropriate resting place. Eastern Pasadena is the middle-income,  home-owning bedrock of the city. The residents here are civil servants,  contractors, small-business owners.  </P> <P> A few blocks east of Victory Park is Upper Hastings Ranch, a hillside  neighborhood of winding streets and slanted roofs.  </P> <P> The holiday season is their neighborhood's time to shine.  </P> <P> For the past 34 years, residents have lit up the night with a torrent of  Christmas lights. So extravagant is the display that tour buses and long lines  of cars edge through narrow streets.  </P> <P> Committees impose unifying themes on each block -- Cartwright Street has the 12  Days of Christmas -- and a panel of judges awards prizes for the best use of  lights and the best humorous display.  </P> <P> The Upper Hastings Ranch "light-up," as residents call it, is brilliant but, in  the end, ephemeral. From her front lawn, Dottie Csik, whose evergreen bushes  are seeded with tiny white lights, takes in the short-lived illumination.  </P> <P> "After New Year's, it's like a morgue around here," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rose Parade Starts at 8:10 A.M.  </P> <P> The 101st Tournament of Roses Parade begins at 8:10 a.m. at Orange Grove and  Del Mar boulevards, proceeds east along Colorado Boulevard to Sierra Madre  Boulevard and ends at Paloma Street about two hours later. Post-parade viewing  opens at 1:30 p.m. For more information, the parade hot line is (818) 584-5983.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE ORDER OF MARCH  </P> <P> 1. Riverside Community College Band  </P> <P> 2.

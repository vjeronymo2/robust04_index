			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Yugoslav Foreign Minister </F> Vladislav Jovanovic by Frank Westerman in Belgrade on 12 April:  "United Nations Must Ban NATO Air Strikes"]    [Text] Belgrade -- Following in the footsteps of the  nonrecognized Srpska republic in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro  are now also severing their ties with the United Nations.  Belgrade is demanding that the United Nations impose an  immediate ban on NATO air strikes. This was reported on Tuesday  by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic in an interview  with DE VOLKSKRANT. "I do not see how we can continue to  cooperate with the United Nations in the same way," he said.    Until Sunday evening, when at the UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] request, NATO fighter jets brought the Serbian offensive  on the eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde to a standstill, Belgrade  had cooperated closely with the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees "on the execution of its noble task of helping people,"  Jovanovic claimed.    However, in the wake of "this unforgivable outrage  perpetrated by the United Nations," as he described the action,  "it is difficult to imagine that our attitude would not change."    Four out of six sites designated as "safe areas" by the  United Nations, including the Muslim enclaves of Srebrenica,  Zepa, and Gorazde, are provided with supplies from Belgrade.    The minister listed a number of requirements which the  United  Nations must fulfil. Only then, according to the minister, can  the peace talks be resumed. "First of all, UN envoy to the  former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi must state that no further NATO  air strikes will take place."    The UN secretary general's special envoy has just threatened  to call for more air strikes if the besieging Serbian forces  continue to threaten the densely populated city of Gorazde,  whose population numbers 65,000 or so, and the aid workers who  remain there.    Step two will involve launching a study that Jovanovic  believes should result in "self-criticism" by the UN forces.  "The United Nations must admit, even if it is too late, that it  has made a terrible mistake," the minister dictated.    Because NATO had bombed targets just 20 km from the border,  Jovanovic warned of the "possible dangers" of combat aircraft  dropping bombs on the territory of Serbia and Montenegro by  mistake or violating the country's airspace.    According to him and Western observers, the latter would  happen on a regular basis, simply because Gorazde is too close  to the border for aircraft to swoop down without leaving Bosnian  airspace. Minister Jovanovic suggested that such violations  could unleash a response by the Air Force of Serbia and  Montenegro. "We have already had to restrain ourselves several  times," he said.    Although Jovanovic is lending his full support to the  Bosnian  Serbs, who are continuing to refuse to speak with UN Commander  in Bosnia Michael Rose, he does not believe that the prospects  of peace have been lost for good. "However, at this moment in  time, the war option has the upper hand. The consequence of the  NATO action is that the Muslims and Croats now believe that they  can win the war on the battlefield."    Meanwhile, he does not trust the proposal submitted by  Russian negotiator Vitaliy Churkin, to station 800 Ukrainian UN  troops, who are already on hand, in the enclave as soon as the  Serbs have withdrawn. "The Russians have good ideas, but no  power," he said. According to him, the presence of Russian UN  troops in Sarajevo and Tuzla had not managed to restore the  "impartiality" of the United Nations.    The minister, who was a career diplomat who wrote poetry in  the evenings, believes that the United Nations has played itself  out. "Long before the air strikes, it had abandoned its  impartiality by taking the side of the Muslims," he said.    He pointed out that Gorazde never was a "safe area," because  the United Nations has not yet started disarming those people  who are defending the enclave. "Worse still, under the knowing  gaze of UN observers, Bosnian Government troops have used the  hills around Gorazde to prepare for a spring offensive," he  continued.    The push by Muslim troops, which should have started three  weeks ago, was met with a counterattack by the Bosnian Serbs.  "Just when they seemed about to overrun their enemy, the United  Nations once again suddenly started shouting murder," the  minister said. Jovanovic, who describes himself as a humanist,  democrat, and socialist, believes that there is a conspiracy.    It has been claimed that only two mortar bombs have landed  in  Gorazde over the past few days, not the "eight per minute"  reported by UN observers. Apparently, UNPROFOR Commander Rose,  who initially dismissed the reports by his staff as "emotional"  and "exaggerated," later received an order from Washington to  clear the way for a NATO air strike.    According to him, the use of combat aircraft had just one  objective: "To guard the Muslims against defeat." Mr.  Jovanovic believes that Mr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, his envoy  Akashi, and Lieutenant General Rose have gone over the head of  the UN Security Council, "thereby losing the United Nations any  prestige it might have had."</p>

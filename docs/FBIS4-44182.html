			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- FDP [Free Democratic Party]  Chairman Klaus Kinkel has described the defeat of the liberals  at the state parliament elections in Saxony-Anhalt as "bitter."  Kinkel said today on the fringes of a meeting of the FDP  executive in Bonn that the party's overall image had not been  good in recent months. However, the FDP at land level  [Saxony-Anhalt FDP] had also contributed to the election defeat.    Kinkel announced a "motivation campaign" by the FDP at  national level for the summer, but also particularly in the  regional associations in Saxony, Bavaria, and Brandenburg where  landtag elections are still to take place. The aim is to lay  greater emphasis on the function and policies of the FDP under  the motto "Germany needs the liberals."</p>

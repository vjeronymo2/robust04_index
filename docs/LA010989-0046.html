			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WEATHER TO WARM UP A LITTLE TODAY, TUESDAY  </P> <P> The weather will warm up slightly over the next two days, pushing daytime  temperatures into the low 60s for the first time in weeks, according to the  National Weather Service. Even so, it will still be unseasonably cool in San  Diego.  </P> <P> "Usually the high is around 65 and the low is 48 this time of year," said  forecaster Richard Stitt. "So even though it looks pretty good over Southern  California for Monday and Tuesday, it's still cool."  </P> <P> The clear skies and warmer days will be short-lived, however. San Diegans can  expect more rainfall by Wednesday, and a cloudy weekend, Stitt said.  </P> <P> Coastal and inland high temperatures will be 57 to 63 degrees today and 60 to  66 degrees Tuesday. The beaches will stay slightly cooler, and the daytime  mountain temperatures will fall in the upper 30s today and in the 40s Tuesday,  according to the weather service forecast.  </P> <P> The nights will also be slightly warmer than in recent weeks, with low  temperatures along the coast in the low 40s tonight, with inland lows in the  upper 30s. The mountains will stay cold tonight, at 18 to 28 degrees, according  to the weather service.  </P> <P> There will be no snow or rain tonight, Stitt said -- unlike Saturday night,  when icy temperatures brought two new inches of snow to both Cuyamaca State  Park and Palomar Mountain. No snow-related problems were reported by the  California Highway Patrol over the weekend, except "a lot of fender-benders" on  mountain roads, said a CHP spokeswoman.  </P></p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Rate cuts fail to motivate European sector Interest rate cuts in Denmark and the Netherlands failed to boost European government bond markets, where trading is thin ahead of the Christmas break, while further weakness in US Treasuries helped pull down prices in some markets towards the end of European trading. The Danish central bank cut its discount and key deposit rates by  1/4 point to 6.25 per cent while the Dutch central bank reduced its special advances rate by 10 basis points to 5.70 per cent, but both bond markets rose only slightly. The rate reductions, attributed to the strength of the Danish krone and the Dutch guilder, did however foster hopes that the French authorities will cut rates sooner rather than later, given the continuing strength of the franc. As a result, the French bond market was one of the better performers on a generally lacklustre day, ending more than  1/4 point higher. The US bond market regained its stride yesterday after the Treasury's monthly auction of two-year notes generated greater demand than dealers had anticipated. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/16 lower at 99 7/32 , with the yield rising to 6.303 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/16 , to yield 4.198 per cent. In early trading, bonds across the yield curve weakened in anticipation of the Treasury's auction of Dollars 17bn in two-year notes, to be followed by Dollars 11bn in five-year bonds today. With most institutional investors sitting on the sidelines until the new year begins, demand for the new paper was difficult to gauge. Near midday, the long bond was losing ground rapidly, dragged down by pre-auction positioning by dealers on the short end. However, the worst fears of the market proved unfounded. The sale attracted an above-average level of interest, and bond prices lifted off their session lows. The German bond market failed to draw any inspiration from the Dutch and Danish rate cuts, and also appeared to ignore some apparently encouraging comments on the German inflation outlook by Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank board member. The relative weakness of the German market caused the spread between 10-year French OAT and German bund yields to narrow further to around five basis points, dealers said. UK gilt prices were weak yesterday, largely due to technical factors and profit-taking ahead of the year-end.</p>

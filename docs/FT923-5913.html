			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Rupert Murdoch - Down and up in Beverly Hills / Two years ago, a financial crisis nearly wrecked his company. Now, he has rarely been so content IN HIS cool cream office halfway along the executive corridor at Twentieth Century Fox's studios Rupert Murdoch is, for the moment, completely absorbed and happy. The overnight television network ratings have just come in and everything else stops while the chairman and chief executive of News Corporation works out how Fox  - his network  - has done. Good news. Fox has done well against the other three networks with 17 per cent of the national audience. Its Wednesday evening shows  - Beverly Hills 90210, a high school drama, and Melrose Place, a series about 20-somethings in a trendy area of Los Angles  - have beaten the competition. 'It's so exciting. It's so much fun,' says Mr Murdoch. At 61, he looks back on nearly forty years of media competition, yet sounds as exhilarated as a young television producer with his first hit. Six months ago, he took on the chairman's job at Twentieth Century Fox. After starting as a newspaper publisher in Adelaide, moving to London, emigrating to New York and taking American citizenship, Mr Murdoch has now come to rest in Los Angeles. Every morning he drives himself to work in a green Mercedes convertible from his home in Beverly Hills, a house once owned by Jules Stein, founder of MCA. By 6.30, he is sitting at his desk at the studio where films such as The Sound of Music and Miracle on 34th Street were made. His morning starts with several hours of telephone calls to London and other parts of the News Corp empire. Then he absorbs himself in the nuts and bolts of his latest challenge  - films. Rupert Murdoch is well and happy and living in Los Angeles. But above all else, he has survived. In the autumn of 1990, News Corp was almost overwhelmed by its debts of more than USDollars 7.6bn. Nearly 150 banks had to be persuaded to roll over the debt and come up with a new USDollars 600m loan. Yesterday came the firmest evidence so far, not only that News Corp has survived but that it is bouncing back: it reported a 65 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 531m (USDollars 379.20m) for the year to the end of June. The restructuring was a long and tortuous process. Every bank had to be kept in the deal or it could all have started to unravel. At one point, the negotiations hung fire because the head of an Indian bank had gone off on a tiger shoot. At another, only a midnight call from Mr Murdoch - and a promise to stump up his personal wealth if necessary  - persuaded a bank chairman to stay in the consortium. It is unlikely that Mr Murdoch will forget the experience, or the mistakes that made it necessary. Curled up in a cream armchair in his office, surrounded by abstract paintings, he talks in a matter-of-fact way about what he got wrong. 'We just got caught running when we should have been walking and that was a sufficiently unpleasant experience to make you swear you are not going to let it happen to you again,' he says. 'If I had been more perceptive a year earlier we would have spent less money on Sky (the UK satellite television venture). Maybe we would have given it one less channel and phased it in more slowly.' Spending ADollars 1bn on re-equipping the group's four Australian newspaper printing plants at once when only one was urgent was a clear mistake, he says. 'With hindsight we could also have taken precautionary measures before you had the cash tightening when (lending from) the short-term money market disappeared,' he adds. News Corp had been taking advantage of the lower interest rates available on short-term borrowings. But once international banks started to get jittery about the scale of their debt exposure there was a certain slow-motion inevitability about the News Corp crisis. The capital commitments had been made and the loans  - typically for two to three years  - were maturing. There simply wasn't the money to pay them off. Despite the scale of the problem, Mr Murdoch says he never believed his empire was in terminal danger. 'It wasn't as if we were faced with all the tenants leaving. Our readers hadn't left us, our advertisers hadn't left us. We were still trading and capable of cutting costs to improve profits,' he says. One of his leading lenders concurs: 'Most companies that were forced to restructure their debts got into trouble because the trading conditions of their businesses deteriorated or there was a major economic event that turned the face of their business,' he says. 'Murdoch wasn't like that. Most of his businesses were doing all right. He had overinvested in businesses for which he paid too much, and he was funding everything in the short-term markets. It was his funding strategy that caught him with his pants down.' Mr Murdoch helped to ease the crisis by reacting swiftly, says the banker: 'Murdoch is an arrogant bugger, but he wasn't so arrogant that he didn't know when he was in trouble.' This view, shared by other lenders, helped to ease the financial restructuring. And a media company also has some very glamorous products with which to impress bankers with when times get tough. In November 1990, Joe Roth, president of the film division of Twentieth Century Fox, put on a tie and joined the international News Corp road show. He showed the bankers a few clips from his latest movie  - a modestly priced Dollars 18m picture due to open in a week's time. The bankers laughed in all the right places and Mr Roth told them he had a hunch this picture could maybe make Dollars 75m. The boss was taken aback, says Mr Roth. 'Rupert said to me afterwards: 'How could you say that. This is a tiny little comedy. These are bankers]'.' Mr Roth had the last laugh: the tiny comedy, Home Alone, grossed Dollars 507m at the cinema box office  - Dollars 1bn when video and television deals are included. Spurred on by such hopes, the last bank signed on January 31, 1991. The restructuring was at last over  - but, says Mr Murdoch, that was just the beginning. The debt burden  - now bigger  - had only been rolled over. The day of reckoning had merely been postponed. Revenues were falling everywhere. News Corp had to pay its banks' fees, along with the extra 1 per cent on interest rates they had insisted on. True, underlying interest rates were falling, and so was the price of the company's most important raw material, newsprint. But overall the company faced a difficult future: the first Dollars 2.4bn of debt was due in February 1994. 'Our shares had been battered down to ADollars 3.80 (they are now ADollars 23.50) and they were stll shorting us. We had to build back credibility quarter by quarter. We had to take in some equity at pretty humiliating prices and sell some assets we didn't like to sell,' Mr Murdoch says. It was time for the serious work to begin. This took two forms  - selling assets and cutting costs. Disposals had begun before the agreement with the banks was finally reached. They included getting rid of the Delux film laboratories at Fox and selling a paper mill in the UK. But that was not enough. A more central asset would have to go. Mr Murdoch says he gritted his teeth and accepted that he would have to do whatever it took to survive. 'We looked at every asset,' he says, asking ''What can we miss least? What can we replace easiest when times turn?' The answer was the smaller magazines.' In May 1991, New York magazine, Seventeen and six other Murdoch magazines were sold to K-III Holdings, a company controlled by the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in a deal worth Dollars 650m. A 55 per cent stake in Mr Murdoch's Australian magazine and printing operations raised another Dollars 575m. Selling equity  - reducing the Murdoch family interest in News Corp to around 40 per cent  - and issuing some long term debt brought in an additional Dollars 600m. The second arm of the strategy was more gradual: managing the company hard, cutting costs to get profit margins up. This task fell to Mr Gus Fischer, a spare, thoughtful Swiss-German, who met Rupert Murdoch when the company he ran supplied photographic printing plates to News Corp newspapers. He became managing director of News International, and in January 1991 also became chief operating officer of News Corp with special responsibility for cutting costs in the UK and the US. Last year News International's total revenues rose by 1 per cent; operating profits rose by 27 per cent. Over 18 months the newspaper division's costs have been cut by Pounds 40m a year. Layers of managers and supervisors have been removed. In 1990, News International's five UK national newspapers had 3,755 employees; now they have 2,924. Mr Fischer says: 'There is no magic formula. It means hard work and working with people.' Savings have been made everywhere from newspaper distribution to debt collection from people who hadn't paid for their personal classified advertisments. There was a department to chase non-payers, and a debt collection agency with payments linked to the number of letters sent out. Overall, says Mr Fischer, collecting for unpaid classified ads was costing News International around Pounds 400,000 for every Pounds 500,000 recovered. So now he has changed the rules. Personal classified ads are paid for by credit card in advance, and there is no debt collection problem. An average of 10 per cent savings has already been achieved across the group with more to come. Mr Fischer is now turning his gaze to the US, starting with the remaining News Corp magazines, especially TV Guide, the television listings magazine. The process will probably be complete by the end of next year. 'Then, like painting the Forth Bridge, it will be time to start again. There are always costs to come out,' Mr Fischer says. The results for the first six weeks of News Corp's new financial year show operating profit up 17 per cent on budget and 44 per cent up on the same period last year even though there is little sign of a lessening of recession in the company's main markets. Mr Dave DeVoe, News Corp's finance director based in New York, says that margins in the UK have increased from 14 to 20 per cent. Margins have also been improving in Australia and in the US, he says. The ratio of debt to operating cash flow, currently five, is heading south, he says. At the start of the 1992 financial year interest will be covered twice over by earnings, but 1993 will see a sharp improvement, to something like two-and-three-quarters. Tight management is not the only factor behind these gains. Another is Mr Murdoch's luck, consistently good throughout his career. Arguably, he was lucky that his refinancing crisis came to a head when it did. By late 1990, bankers were already worried enough about collapsing businesses to want to ensure News Corp stayed afloat, but they had not yet had to face the crises at other heavily indebted firms such as Olympia &amp; York. Another piece of luck was the path of interest rates. Two years ago, US interest rates were running at about 9 per cent; now they are around 4 per cent. News Corp has benefited greatly; in the last financial year, for example, falling interest rates have cut its debt service costs by 20 per cent. And luck sometimes works both ways, says one of Mr Murdoch's bankers: 'Yes, he's been lucky with falling interest rates. On the other hand, he's not been lucky in the sense that his three key markets - the US, the UK and Australia  - have been very slow in coming out of recession.' Perhaps for this reason, in Los Angeles Rupert Murdoch is still exhibiting some of the caution of the recently burned. 'Worldwide we are in relatively better shape,' he says carefully. 'We are getting our strongest growth in television and the movie company is going well.' Despite his relative caution, it is clear that the terms of his probation from the banks are beginning to chafe. There is a considerable way to go before reaching his hope of investment-grade rating: News Corp debt is currently rated B1 by Moody's, four notches below investment grade; and Standard &amp; Poor's rates the group's subordinated debt at B, five notches below investment grade. With a bit more freedom of action, Mr Murdoch's traditional enthusiasm for acquisitions would be likely to reassert itself. 'If we were in an acquiring mood we would look at improving distribution for the Fox television network,' he says, 'which means buying another two or three stations.' In spite of an easier financial situation, recent months have not been entirely trouble-free. Super Zeitung, a daily newspaper set up in what was East Germany as a joint venture with Burda, the west German publisher, collapsed messily. Mr Murdoch pulled out, mostly because he could not get managerial control of the operation and its costs. Thereafter, Burda closed it down. The project had attracted a great deal of attention, partly because of the extravagant hopes invested in it by its backers, partly because it carried more nude photographs than the Sun, the UK's racy tabloid, could ever dream of. Though defunct, Super Zeitung is a reminder that News Corp is not quite the staid, predictable business its bankers might wish it to be. Another reminder of the group's occasional oddities was a curious incident at a conference of News Corp executives in June. Wishing to make a point about censorship, Mr Stephen Chao, the newly appointed president of the seven Fox television stations, brought on a male stripper during his speech. The audience, which included US Defence Secretary Dick Cheney and his wife, was not amused. Mr Chao was fired on the spot. 'There are limits,' is Mr Murdoch's only comment on the affair now. He is more forthcoming talking his way through the prospects for the company's main areas of business: US Television. Fox now broadcasts 12 hours a week in prime time five days a week. Mr Murdoch claims it will soon be the leading network among 18-49 year olds, its target audience. It plans to go to six days a week in the autumn and possibly seven next year. But to avoid Federal Communications Commission rules that prevent networks exploiting their own production Fox has to stay below 15 hours a week in prime time  - the threshold for full network status and the restrictions that go with it. Next year's task is to set up a Fox news service, to challenge Ted Turner's Cable News Network, currently used as a supplementary news source by many independent US television stations. Mr Jamie Kellner, president of Fox Broadcasting, says the challenge is to attract younger people to the news. 'News skews quite old,' he says, in broadcaster's shorthand  - meaning that viewers of existing news programmes are older than the audience as a whole. 'That's the Fox opportunity to break the mould and do it differently as we have done with the rest of our programmes.' Sky Television. Sky is operated by British Sky Broadcasting, a consortium in which News Corp owns 50 per cent and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake. It is expected to make operating profits of around Pounds 50m in the year to June 1993, though overall the operation is still losing money because of the heavy debt to its owners incurred in its early years. 'I think the breakout is just beginning,' says Mr Murdoch, 'but of course there will be competitors.' As the audience grows, however, 'new players will widen the universe and that is bound to lead to very big profits'. Sky is planning to launch a third film channel this autumn to replace the Comedy channel which has not been a success. The new channel will be mainly based on the films of the 1970s and 1980s and will probably be offered free to those already subscribing to both existing film channels. At the moment Sky says there are 2.4m-2.5m satellite dish owners, with 1.3m movie channel subscribers. Media buyers, who buy television time for advertising agencies, are generally impressed with Sky's performance. It currently reaches 14 per cent of UK homes, says one top media buyer, with the figure likely to rise to 23 per cent by the end of 1993  - but it costs only one-tenth the price of advertising on UK terrestrial television. 'The only worry we have is that by pushing more towards subscription-only channels BSkyB might turn some people off,' the buyer says. News International. Of the five UK national newspapers, says Mr Murdoch, three are strong market leaders (Sunday Times, Sun and News of The World); the other two are doing better. Today is now profitable on a marginal cost basis, he says, and The Times is breaking even overall. New York analysts are impressed with News Corp's performance in the UK last year, given the weakness of the local economy. One possible constraint on the future is a rising chorus of complaints about press concentration. Mr Murdoch hinted at the frustration this imposes: 'We now have a strong balance sheet and strong earnings growth. The question is how do we use that competitive advantage without being accused of having monopoly power by ignoramuses.' Australia. Four times a year, a News Corp executive in New York feeds the company's quarterly results into a facsimile machine for transmission to the Australian Stock Exchange. It is a ritual that maintains News Corp's historical relationship with Australia, but some Australians are beginning to wonder how long the relationship will last. The Australian businesses are in good shape, says Mr Murdoch, and getting their share of revenue in an economy seriously hit by recession. And though Australia is becoming less important to Mr Murdoch, he remains of immense importance to Australia, controlling between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of daily newspaper circulation. Mr Murdoch says the Australian businesses will remain part of News Corp: 'Every company has to have its traditions and its roots,' he says. Those traditions include News Corp's enthusiastic use of Australia's relaxed tax legislation, which has allowed the group to minimise its tax bill through the use of offshore tax havens. The Australian government has threatened to tighten the rules, but few commentators expect News Corp to be significantly affected. 'If it was going to make an enormous amount of difference News Corp would simply move its domicile offshore,' says Mr Mr Alex Pollak, media analyst at Sydney's Macquarie Bank. One activity in Australia to which Mr Murdoch's commitment has weakened is the airline business, described as News Corp's big problem area by one close follower of the group. In the medium term, says Mr Murdoch, News Corp will drop out of its 50 per cent stake in Ansett Transport Industries, the domestic Australian airline, and its stake in Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services, the aircraft leasing company. The leasing activities would be the first to go. 'They have been a source of profit when we needed it, but they do not fit a media company,' says Mr Murdoch. This is not the best time to get a good price for an aircraft leasing business, however, with the industry plagued by world-wide overcapacity. The main Ansett stake is also to be sold, but not yet. The company has won the right to apply for international routes and a bumpy period of de-regulation lies ahead. But the intention is to sell the stake within two or three years. A third party  - perhaps an international airline - could be brought in before then. Magazines. Mr Murdoch says he is happy with the progress at TV-Guide, though he has previously admitted to paying up to Dollars 1bn too much for the magazine and its handful of sister publications. Circulation, once 18m, is now under 15m, because of increasing competition from newspaper listings sections. Mr Murdoch seems determined to return to the wider magazine business eventually, but it is too early to say whether it will be from acquisition, launches or a mixture of both. Twentieth Century Fox. As Mr Murdoch talks, outside in the sprawling studio Sean Connery is hard at work on The Rising Sun, a Dollars 40m thriller set against a background of total Japanese economic domination of the US. He has high hopes for it; but the studio has had a thin summer. A Dollars 20m film, Prelude To A Kiss, passed without notice, and a new release, Buffy and the Vampire Slayer, is not setting the world alight. The autumn and winter should be better, however. The studio's upcoming films are Home Alone II: Alone in New York (it will cost Dollars 40m this time, because sequels are always more expensive Mr Murdoch says); Hoffa, the story of the missing Teamsters union boss, starring Jack Nicholson; Toys, with Robert Williams; and Last of the Mohicans, starring Daniel Day Lewis. Sean Connery and The Rising Sun will follow. Fox has ramped up its production from about eight films a year to more than 20 and has been bringing the average cost down. Joe Roth says that every year the studio makes pictures for a few million dollars less on average. This is done by choosing less star-driven vehicles; and by being careful about action films  - blowing things up costs money. Last year Fox's average cost for a film negative  - before the costs of promotion and distribution  -was Dollars 23m. This year it is Dollars 21m compared with an industry average of Dollars 26m-Dollars 28m. Mr Murdoch says that one of the things you have to do at a film company is say no to people who want to spend money. 'I'm accused of being a gambler, but you like to know some of the odds. You also like to know what your bet is. You don't like to bet Dollars 40m and find you've bet Dollars 60m,' he says. Mr Roth thinks Rupert Murdoch will stay in Los Angeles running Twentieth Century Fox as long as it stays a challenge. 'At most he's at mid-point on the curve,' he says. Mr Roth still decides what films the studio makes, but he has started feeding Rupert Murdoch scripts as part of the educational process. 'Rupert will end up shaping this as any owner would  - not so much by his taste as by his dis-taste,' Mr Roth says. It is already starting to happen. Mr Murdoch is clearly discouraging the studio from making certain kinds of films: the very expensive, very violent sort. He says he would not have made the film Basic Instinct  - 'It has no redeeming qualities at all, no one you wanted to like '  - even though he knew it would probably be a success. By contrast, he talks enthusiastically about a Clint Eastwood film he saw a few evenings before  - a bit too much killing maybe but a very satisfying film; terrific cinematography; a bit slow moving but very well acted. Will Rupert Murdoch ever become an archetypal Hollywood studio boss? 'No,' he says: 'I'm just getting into it too late in life to learn all the tricks. But you can apply some issues of taste, some issues of economics.' As he talks it is clear that he is as content, both professionally and personally, as perhaps he has ever been. Los Angeles reminds him of home in Melbourne. 'I'm even buying a sailboat I used to sail in Australia but I was too mean to buy a boat in London for the three week summer. It's a return to the Pacific, if you like. My garden is full of gum trees and eucalyptuses and its an open new society in the way that a lot of Australian cities are.' 'The things that would get me out of here (Los Angeles) are never going to happen,' he says  - though he does not write them off without a note of wistfulness. 'If the Washington Post were to be up for sale . . .' he says, before adding quickly: 'but there's not a one-hundredth of a per cent chance.' What if Rupert Murdoch were to fall under a bus? Three years ago he nominated Andrew Knight, executive chairman of News International and former editor of The Economist as his chosen successor for the interregnum if he died before his children were old enough to take over. 'I have nothing to add to that or to alter it in any way except that the children are older,' says Mr Murdoch. His daughter Elizabeth is working as a programme manager at KTTV, the Fox station in Los Angeles. James who is about to go to Harvard is working on the set of The Rising Sun, and Lachlan, who is at Princeton, is interested in journalism. 'They are going to have to prove themselves but they are going to be lucky and have that opportunity,' says Mr Murdoch. Then he jumps up to show the visitor his 'war room', a neighbouring office with an enormous wall-chart, a jigsaw of the television week. Each network has pieces of a different colour and there is a piece for each show. Once, the room was used by a former studio boss for afternoon assignations with actresses. Now, Rupert Murdoch moves the pale blue Fox network pieces around his jigsaw, trying to make Thursday night as successful as Wednesdays.

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London's robusta COFFEE futures eased back to end around Dollars 17 down on a spate of profit-taking, despite setting an early nine-month high of Dollars 990 a tonne. The profit-taking was adding to a correction which could take the New York March arabica contract back to around 70 cents a lb, and the London January robusta to the Dollars 950 a tonne. One dealer said the market could need a couple of days' rest to slow the tempo of the rise rather than an actual price retracement. On the LME LEAD closed firm against a background of positive charts. Dealers cited good recent trade interest, with prices touching five-month sterling lows, or, in dollar terms, the lowest levels for some six years at Dollars 459 a tonne. COPPER was steady - dealers said there was little fundamental justification for higher prices, so rallies were likely to be sold into. ALUMINIUM edged ahead - late news of a possible strike at Pechiney confirmed reports circulating earlier and provided a supportive backdrop. Compiled from Reuters</p>

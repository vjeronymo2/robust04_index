			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in  Ukrainian at 1300 GMT on 20 April carries a 10-minute recorded  report on an interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk  by an unidentified correspondent in Kiev's Kharkovskiy District  on 19 April.    The correspondent asks Kravchuk about a meeting held by the  Sevastopol Town Council, which requested that the Ukrainian  president withdraw Ukraine's Armed Forces from the town.    Kravchuk replies: "I do not think this is a confrontation or  a turning point. I think there will be various points of view  and various positions until the problem of the Black Sea Fleet  is resolved. We must be calm about this and approach it with  understanding. The main thing, however, is to solve the problem.    ``I will tell you frankly that I do not see the possibility  that the Ukrainian Armed Forces can exist alongside the Russian  naval base that could be in Sevastopol on the basis of a leasing  agreement that is recognized by the world. I support this idea  because I see no other way out at the moment. There will never  be accord there if they are together or next to each other.    ``For this reason, if the base is to be in Sevastopol--I  stress not the town of Sevastopol, because there are various  interpretations here--I am not talking about the town, but about  the base in the town of Sevastopol. It is a question of  interpretation, but it is necessary to be precise. Some people  do not observe this, and there are misunderstandings because of  this. In this case, there should be a base for the Ukrainian  Armed Forces. Moreover, the base for the Russian fleet will not  be leased in perpetuity but for a specified period that will be  determined by documents.    ``There is no need to dramatize or imagine that one thing  has  been agreed and now they are talking about something else.  Everybody puts forward his point of view. Until a final  document is signed, along with all its attributes and  mechanisms, there will be various interpretations. Do not  exaggerate the various bits of information, statements, or  decisions--even by the Sevastopol Town Council-- because for us  this is of a consultative nature. I would not like to prejudice  the course of events. I know that a Russian-Ukrainian commission  has already starting working on this, but I would like them to  complete their work successfully.    ``We must resolve the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. We are  obliged to do so. Please understand that this is not simply a  question of dividing the fleet. It is a political issue. It is  considered to be a joint fleet at the moment. In reality,  however--without wanting to dramatize it--it is not subordinate  to Ukraine. This joint fleet takes some actions as a joint  fleet, and we--both Ukraine and Russia--are responsible for  these actions. For example, I am not allowed to intervene  directly, but I am responsible if it is a joint fleet and I sign  a document. For this reason, I consider that we must clearly  determine as soon as possible that this is a Russian fleet with  Russian laws, regulations, and enforceable enactments. Russia  would be responsible for its fleet and Ukraine for its fleet.    ``It is necessary to resolve this, and this is the most  important thing. We must sit behind a table and resolve it. I  insist, insisted, and will insist on this. It is dangerous to  drag it out.''    The correspondent says that the Ukrainian Supreme Council  will have to ratify the agreement, and Kravchuk adds: "This is  not a tragedy. The main thing is that the presidents sign the  documents and then submit them to parliament. An important step  will have been taken. The presidents and governments make  proposals and then submit them to parliament. Parliament  expresses its view. I am convinced that the Ukrainian  parliament understands the situation. There are realities that,  despite all desires, cannot be ignored. They exist today and  should be resolved. There is no other way but to resolve this  on the basis of wise and constructive principles, with  compromises, and in the interests of today, tomorrow, and the  distant future.    ``If it is a serious policy, then that is how we should act.  I know how sensitive this issue is, how you react to it, and  how every statement and comment is interpreted differently.  There is one principle, however, which is to resolve and settle  the issue of the Black Sea Fleet: the issue of a base for the  Russian fleet, the division of the fleet, and compensation to  Ukraine for our share of the fleet that is being given away to  Russia.    "These are the main issues. We have already discussed them  in detail in Yalta, Zavidovo, and Massandra. We have already  worked on this. We only have to sit down and write down the  precise formulation on the principles and interests of our  states, taking into account international experience. That is  all we are talking about.    ``Ukraine clearly abides by the provisions that are defined  in three documents--and now in the fourth one signed in Moscow.  Thus, there are four documents on the Black Sea Fleet. I would  like the fifth one to be the last.''</p>

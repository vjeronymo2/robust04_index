			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ghunaym Muhammad al-Mutayri: "Kuwaiti Cabinet </F> Reshuffle To Include Oil and Interior Ministries"]    [Text] Kuwait -- There was an atmosphere of anticipation  and expectation in Kuwait yesterday as the countdown began for  the announcement of the names to be included in the new cabinet.  There is all kinds of speculation in various circles with  everyone expressing his own views as to who will be appointed  and who will be dismissed, but the final decision rests with  Prime Minister and Heir Apparent Shaykh Sa'd al-'Abdallah  al-Salim al-Sabah who is still holding consultations on this  matter.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned from sources close to Shaykh  Sa'd that the expected cabinet reshuffle will be ready within  the next few days and may be announced Saturday.    The sources added that the cabinet reshuffle will cover the  ministries of oil, interior, electricity, works, communications,  and housing but will not affect the other main ministries such  as the foreign, defense, and information ministries.    The sources also said that some new names have been tipped  for important ministries. They include Shaykh Jabir 'Abdallah  al-Jabir al-Sabah, the former cabinet affairs minister who held  the post at the time of the occupation and liberation and who  also held other posts such as governor of al-Ahmadi and governor  of Hawalli. Other prominent names include al-Ahmadi Governor  Shaykh Muhammad al-Khalid al-Sabah and former Defense Minister  Shaykh Nawwaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 6 Apr -- The working visit to Hungary by Oleh  Slepichev, Ukraine's minister for foreign economic relations and  cochairman of the Ukrainian-Hungarian intergovernmental  commission for issues of trade and economic and  scientific-technical cooperation, is continuing. During his  meeting with his Hungarian counterpart, Vela Kadar, the  ministers discussed their countries' economies, primarily in the  area of foreign economic links. The two ministers noted that  the volume of trade turnover between Ukraine and Hungary has  decreased slightly despite the substantial fall in industrial  production and the decrease in the volume of Ukrainian exports  as a whole. The ministers exchanged opinions on the possibility  of setting up joint working groups to elaborate individual  directions of cooperation and accelerate the elaboration and  signing of agreements on cooperation in the field of transport.  Measures to avoid dual taxation were also examined.    During the meeting the two ministers signed a protocol on  mutual deliveries of goods and provision of services in 1994.  Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports that the next  session of the bilateral commission is planned for  August-September this year.</p>

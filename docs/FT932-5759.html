			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Field pays Pounds 6m for Boots' carton packaging activities FIELD GROUP, the packaging company, expected shortly to publish the pathfinder prospectus for its flotation, is paying about Pounds 6m for Boots' carton packaging activities, part of the Boots Print subsidiary. Boots, the retail and pharmaceutical group, has contracted to buy the majority of its pharmaceutical and toiletries cartons from Field for 5 years. It had already used some outside suppliers. The business Field is buying had sales of Pounds 10m in the year to March 31, of which 17 per cent is for third parties. Mr Keith Gilchrist, Field's chief executive, estimated its profits at Pounds 1m. Field's flotation is expected to give the group a market capitalisation of about Pounds 150m. The consideration - of Pounds 4.9m for assets of Pounds 2.4m, plus stock expected to be Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.1m - will be payable on completion in July. The business is similar to Field's Mareen subsidiary in Belgium, which is the leading carton producer for the pharmaceutical industry there. Field will move the Boots operation to new premises over the next three years, although remaining in Nottingham. This could cost a further Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m. About 200 jobs will be transferred to Field. Mr David Thompson, Boots' finance director, said the business would 'benefit from Field's expertise and market presence'. Boots is to merge the rest of its Boots Print business - promotional print, diaries and calendars - with the loss of about 100 jobs, although some employees will be redeployed in Boots.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Conservative party to maintain poll boycott South Africa's right-wing Conservative party last night announced that it would maintain its poll boycott, dashing hopes that all mainstream parties might participate next week in the first all-race elections, write Michael Holman and Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, CP leader, said that his party would not take part in the elections as he had been unable to get satisfactory guarantees from the African National Congress, which is expected to dominate the new government, and the long-ruling National party on the creation of an Afrikaner volkstaat. He said that without solid constitutional guarantees, the CP had no option but to follow an unspecified 'route of resistance'. Meanwhile, the demise of the black 'homelands' continued yesterday as Mr Nelson Ramadike, chief minister of Lebowa, was stripped of his powers by the governing Transitional Executive Council and was removed from his position on the African National Congress's official list of candidates for the election. The homeland administrations are scheduled to come under the administration of the newly elected government at the end of the month but uncertainties about salary and pension arrangements after April have provoked widespread strikes, bringing many services to a standstill.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpt" of interview with Monsignor Carlos Filipe Ximenes </F> Belo, bishop of East Timor, by correspondent Yacob Herin in  Dili; date not given]    [Excerpt] Question: During your trip to  Australia, did you pass on any message to the Catholic people  there?    Answer: First of all I appealed to them to remain  Catholics. I know that many of them have quit going to church.  In modern Australian life, people tend to forget about God.  Secondly, I reminded them of the values of reconciliation, of  redemption, unity, solidarity and mutual forgiveness.    Were the Australian people still talking about the  human rights situation in our country?    Yes. They talk about it every day. They would rather I talk  about that than about seminary matters. In the United States  and Canada, it was the same. I got upset over there as I had not  come to discuss human rights. My top priority was establishing  the seminary. But the same question came up again and again, so  when we were in Canada, the priest who was escorting us  suggested that I talk a little bit about human rights so that  the congregation would be inclined to donate funds (the  bishop said this as a humorous aside).    So, as far as I was concerned, I did not go there for human  rights. In Australia, to those who asked the questions I  replied: "You already know it all."    Whatever happens over here, they will learn about it over  there. It happens here in the morning, in the afternoon  everybody knows about it over there. So, there is no point in  trying to hide what happens over here. Although we can exercise  censorship on the press, on the television, and although we have  here sophisticated means to filter news, everybody will find out.    Were the Australians still asking about the November  12, 1991, incident?    Oh, a lot was asked about it. It was a big joke in the  cathedral as well as among the Australian press. But I told  them I did not come for that topic. I respect those who have  passed away, I pray for them, and I pray that such a thing will  never happen again. What is important to me now is the future.  I would like to forget the incident, learn from what has  happened, prepare our young generation, and hope that this will  never happen again. My mission is to build a young generation  with no internal conflicts and suspicion.    Although these kind of things are taboos and they are not  supposed to be discussed in public, in those countries it is an  everyday issue.    So, the main problem is, in today's world we cannot hide  anything. With the globalization we have now, we cannot hide  anything from the world. Domestically we can suppress news, but  not internationally.    What is your opinion about the situation in and the  condition of East Timor today?    My impression is, the people are not 100 percent at ease  yet.  Not yet. Problems that emerge are usually prompted by problems  of economy, social justice, and job opportunity. All of them.  So, let us pay more attention to the people. Let us have more  dialogues.    Security in East Timor has been achieved. In order to  complement it, perhaps we need to foster more civilian  diplomacy. What do you think about this?    Diplomacy can involve everybody: the military, civilians,  the  bishop, the pope, well...everybody.    Lately, we have seen a growing push for democratization  in every aspect of our lives. What is your opinion?    Well, hopefully that is true. Hopefully the people have  opened their eyes and their minds so that they can participate  in the process and participate in the openness. If they have  opinions and views to express, they should express them openly.  Otherwise, we will become a backward nation, still feudalistic,  still authoritarian.    Suppose that the democratization forces are genuine,  does it mean that repressive practices should be reduced?    There should be courage to do that, yes, and I can see it.  When I was still in Portugal, we had a fascist regime. Then a  revolution broke out. Those from the military refused to step  down at that time due to their vested interests. However, the  time was for democratization in Portugal, so all of them  eventually fell.    But that was OK. There should be input from all sides, from  the press, from the people themselves. Groups should be brave  enough not to keep on defending their own interests. In the  Portuguese language, we have the word tacho; it connotes a  person who has achieved a good position, has accumulated a lot  of wealth, but then defends his personal interests as if on  behalf of national and state interests or the necessity to  defend the country.    Do you have anything to say to those who have opened  their eyes and who have been participating in the  democratization efforts?    Well... I call for them to be more courageous in pushing for  democratization in the country. I know on campuses students  have become more outspoken. It serves no purpose but to educate  the people to be more mature in various aspects, such as the  economy, politics, culture and so on.    Do you think that what has been taking place on  campuses is a reflection of progress in the democratization  efforts?    Well, at least there are differences in opinion, and there  is  the courage to state them. Could you imagine if we had to live  in a society with no courage and no initiative...? Hopefully  those students will become crusaders in the future. Not only  those students, but our intellectuals, too.    In the efforts to bring about democracy?    Yes.    What is your expectation of the newly set up National  Commission of Human Rights?    Let us give them some time. Let us wait and see how they  accommodate the people's aspirations. Only then can we make  comments.    Let us move to another topic now. It appears that  local people have been asking for more opportunity to play a  bigger role on the political stage. Does this mean that their  understanding of politics has reached an advanced level?    I once made my comment on that. Ready or not, they should be  given enough opportunity. We have been wondering, when will  they be allowed to lead their own communities? Not yet ready,  not yet stable, not yet prepared, these are always the excuses  for not letting them do it. Consequently, the people are being  treated like a baby who is deprived of the opportunity to  develop psychologically. A baby, or a teenager for that matter  should develop in all sorts of difficulty, although he may have  to be guided all the time. [passage omitted on culture]</p>

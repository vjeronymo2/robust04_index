			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Cardoso set to win Brazilian presidency Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the social democrat candidate and a former finance minister, looked set to become Brazil's next leader after exit polls gave him a big lead in yesterday's presidential election. Two polling agencies, Datafolha and Ibope, predicted that Mr Cardoso's lead was big enough for him to win outright and avoid a second round run-off. Datafolha said its exit polls gave him 47 per cent of votes cast compared with 24 per cent for his nearest rival, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the leftwing Workers' party leader. Excluding invalid votes, Mr Cardoso was projected to have 55 per cent against 28 per cent for Mr da Silva. Exit polls accurately predicted the outcome of the last presidential elections in 1989. Counting of votes starts today and some urban areas may announce their results this afternoon. But final results are not expected for at least 10 days because Brazil's 95m electors also voted for new state governors, two-thirds of the Senate and all seats in the House of Representatives and state legislatures. Election authorities said voting appeared largely fair and orderly, due partly to new rules which banned late campaigning at polling centres. But several of Mr Cardoso's opponents described the election campaign as unfair. Mr Cardoso has said he intends to concentrate on keeping inflation under control and on modernising the state-driven economy. His popularity rests on the Real currency which he planned when finance minister and which has led to a sharp fall in inflation. Opponents claim he has benefited from the Real's success and government backing. Before release of the exit polls, Mr da Silva, who had led in opinion polls until July, said he remained confident that there would be a second-round run-off, scheduled for November. However, this would only happen if Mr Cardoso received fewer votes than all his opponents combined. According to the Datafolha poll, Mr Cardoso had a 10-point lead over his rivals, suggesting no second round would be needed. Mr da Silva repeated accusations that Mr Cardoso's party had distributed ballot papers in which Mr da Silva's name appeared in the wrong place. Brazil votes, Page 4</p>

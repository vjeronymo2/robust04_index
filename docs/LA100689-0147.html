			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EL MODENA MUST SETTLE FOR 14-14 TIE;  </P> <P> MISSED FIELD GOAL BY VANGUARDS CAPS FRUSTRATING NIGHT  </P> <P> For the second consecutive week, El Modena High School let a victory slip out  of its hands in the final minutes. But Thursday night at Glover Stadium, the  Vanguards' grip appeared assuredly tight.  </P> <P> With four seconds remaining and the Vanguards tied with Loara, 14-14, Greg  Lewis missed a field goal attempt of 21 yards.  </P> <P> It was a frustrating finish to a frustrating game for El Modena (1-3-1). On  three occasions the Vanguards had the ball within Loara's five-yard line and  failed to score. El Modena ran four consecutive running plays from the Loara  two in one series and could only gain a yard. And as the first half ended,  Lewis missed a 22-yard field goal attempt.  </P> <P> It has been a rough couple of weeks for the Vanguards. Last week, they were  beaten by Fountain Valley, 21-20, on a touchdown drive in the game's waning  minutes.  </P> <P> This week, it looked as if things would be different, because El Modena was  doing the rallying.  </P> <P> With 2:20 remaining to play, quarterback Adam Garcia led the charge, taking his  team from its 27 to the Loara four before Lewis' kick missed its mark.  </P> <P> Garcia had either an arm or two legs in every one of the yards El Modena gained  on the drive, including a 14-yard scramble and pass completions of 18 and 11  yards to Graham Brown. Garcia finished 14 of 23 for 187 yards and one  touchdown. He carried the ball 16 times for 62 yards and a two-yard touchdown.  </P> <P> Coy Collins had another big game for Loara (4-0-1), gaining 168 yards in 14  carries and scoring twice. His 96-yard run in the fourth quarter put Loara  ahead, 14-7.  </P> <P> But all was not well for Loara, either. Numerous long penalties in the second  half stalled Saxon drives. In total, Loara was penalized six times for 80  yards.  </P> <P> "We got ourselves in such holes all the time with penalties, penalties,  penalties, and we just couldn't do it," said Herb Hill, Loara coach.  </P> <P> One of the penalties was especially vexing. The Saxons were called for  clipping, nullifying a 91-yard kickoff return by Collins for a touchdown. A  Loara player pushed an El Modena player in the back long after Collins had  streaked down the center of the field.  </P></p>

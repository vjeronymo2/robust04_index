			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Pinning it on the banks IT IS easy to sympathise with the public in its irritation over the failure of banks and building societies to pass on the full benefit of recent cuts in interest rates. It is less easy to go along with the government's inclination to put pressure on financial institutions to pass on that benefit intact. The excuse for such populism, spelt out in Mr John Major's speech to the Lord Mayor's banquet on Monday, is that it will help promote economic recovery. Yet in practice it is much more likely to do the reverse. The public's grievance against the clearing banks rests on the suspicion that it is being required to pay for the banks' past errors of judgment. Up to a point the public is right. The decline in banking profitability since the mid-1980s owes a great deal to such aberrations as lending to developing countries, loans to over-extended property companies and ill-judged support for such over-ambitious entrepreneurs as the late Mr Robert Maxwell. But the banks' aberrations were also a reflection of the government's monetary policy; and the decline in their margins was made worse by the increasingly global nature of the competition in banking and the piecemeal liberalisation of the clearing banks' business. Spreads in both corporate lending and mortgage lending were squeezed. Nor should it be forgotten that the private customer enjoyed great benefit from the growing competition for deposits, where interest on current accounts helped depress bank margins even further. Wrong priorities The real problem is that both the government and the banks appear to have their priorities wrong. In the longest recession since the second world war, in which an overhang of debt poses a significant obstacle to recovery, the main objective should be to restore the capital base of the banks and building societies so that they are able to finance an upturn. The building societies have no immediate access to outside capital, while the banks' ability to tap their shareholders for fresh equity is, at the very least, questionable. It follows that the only sure-fire means of bolstering capital is through retained profits. That message has been grasped by the Federal Reserve in the US, which has made bank profits a more or less explicit target of monetary policy. Yet the Fed's interest rate cuts were arguably too timorous to achieve the desired end, as President Bush knows to his cost. The lesson for Britain, which the chancellor has yet to take fully aboard, is that interest rates have to fall farther to achieve a given degree of monetary stimulus than would be the case in a normal economic cycle. Nor is the threat to sterling from such cuts as great as feared, since forward interest rates already discount much of the currency risk. Dividend policy The banks, meantime, are perpetuating the habits of an earlier decade, most notably in relation to dividend policy. Clearing bank dividends traditionally were covered three times by earnings. Today they are either uncovered or inadequately covered. Yet, to keep institutional shareholders sweet, the banks have been tempted to maintain or increase the payout at the expense of their reserves at a wholly inappropriate juncture. The time has come for greater realism. The institutions should recognise that their substantial investment in the clearing banks stands to be enhanced, not undermined, by more prudent dividend policies. The banks should recognise that they are sending a damaging signal to the capital markets by leaving so many of those responsible for the disasters of the 1980s in top positions. Barclays, to name the most conspicuous case, has appointed a top executive who was associated with the bank's period of over-expansion to the dual role of chairman and chief executive. In banking, of all businesses, the existence of checks and balances is crucially important and should extend to the structure of top management and the board. Bankers are admittedly not alone in showing reluctance to accept responsibility for past error. Whitehall is, par excellence, the place where the buck no longer seems to stop anywhere. But if failure is so conspicuously rewarded, whether in banking or government, who can blame the public for its resentments?</p>

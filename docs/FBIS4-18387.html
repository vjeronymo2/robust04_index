			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [U.D. Jonker commentary: "British Sickness Seeps Further </F> Into European Union"]    [Text] The crisis that was not a crisis has found a  solution that does not resolve anything. Europe can continue on  its way. The question is, where is it headed? In an enlarged  European Community, 16 member states will cover all the points  of the compass if they all indicate the way ahead. What  political buoyancy there was following the trauma surrounding  the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty to agree on the terms  of its implementation was worn out over the past month.    Irascibility runs high. A new treaty does not make old  dividing lines fade away. As the French say, the British are  remaining British and the Germans are remaining German, even if  they have been posing as good Europeans for the last 49 years.  For France, the vim and vigor with which German Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel forced the accession of Austria, Finland,  and Sweden upon his EC partners was needless proof of Germany  being sure of itself. The open resentment of this, and the  public reconciliation which followed, point to excessive  flexibility in the axis around which the EC has to keep rotating.    The climate is not being improved by the hints of threats  aimed at the small member states by Spain, Italy, and the United  Kingdom. This is the last enlargement in which they will get off  so lightly. "It would be absurd if France, Germany, and the  United Kingdom could be outvoted by small member states," said  Prime Minister Major last week. Neither Bonn nor Paris would  disagree.    London was counting on it proving easy to sow the seed of  dissent. However, it set itself up as an unsuspecting lightning  conductor in a charged atmosphere. "Everyone has the feeling  that this will not happen again, the British simply saying no  and subsequently getting their own way," said one diplomat as  early as last week.    This was the unequivocal message delivered to British  Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd when he was offered a final compromise in  Ioannina this week. "Take it or be damned," was the edict,  which was not meant to be taken personally. European Commission  President Jacques Delors had already expressed his amazement at  the way in which the amiable and irreproachable Hurd "dazzlingly  advocated the impossible."    "The flexibility has gone, they are at their wit's end,"  said  Hurd. According to insiders, the tenor of the argument with  which Hurd forced his prime minister in the direction of Europe  on Monday and Tuesday was that "if we say no again, then we will  cause irreparable damage." John Major would appear to have  suffered irreparable damage. However, his political decline  would threaten to drag down the EC with it.    The difficulties arising in the debate on enlargement can  only become more serious now that the European Parliament is  showing its teeth. In Strasbourg, the members of parliament are  fuming over the concession made to the United Kingdom. They  cannot let their final opportunity to grab the Council of  Ministers by the scruff of the neck before the June elections  pass them by. Enlargement is a high price to pay, but it is  worth it to save their own credibility, believes a sizeable  proportion of the members of the European Parliament, 260 of  whom must vote in favor of accession.    They are not wrong. The Ioannina compromise on the voting  procedure in an enlarged EC can be viewed as a concession of  merely cosmetic value to the British. Formally speaking,  however, they can only delay a decision by teaming up with one  large member state and one small one. They cannot prevent it  altogether, as is currently the case, unless they get at least  one more small member state on their side. Accordingly, their  voice has already been weakened, and the 10 member states [which  successfully reached agreement on the voting issue] are getting  things their way.    And yet the so-called British virus which was already  lodged in the structure of the Community when the Maastricht  Treaty was signed, is beginning to multiply on the quiet. It is  a selective virus, which is merely out to smother political,  social, and economic cooperation. Market integration would  appear to be largely unaffected.    Furthermore, one notable symptom is that it rears its head  whenever its own body has been weakened. The virus causes the  British sickness and is accompanied by bouts of deep depression  in Brussels, and sends waves of nausea sweeping through large  groups of people in the rest of Europe.    The EC itself, the main pillar of the European Union, which  is poisoned by it, was not altogether free of pain, as things  were. However, decisions could still be made in major areas in  line with the supranational idea that the member states of the  Community would relinquish part of their sovereignty even  against their better judgement. Now and then that proves  painful. However, the political consolation is that the balance  of both the negative and positive effects of integration is, by  definition, almost positive.    For that reason, Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway are  knocking at the door of the EC. Remember, even the United  Kingdom joined back in 1973. It is just that London is inclined  to calculate the advantages and disadvantages in terms of  clanking coins. Most other countries also take account of the  nonmaterial achievements of the EC, which safeguard their  freedom within the process of European unification. That is  also the most valuable feature of the Union's umbrella in the  eyes of the countries of Central Europe. Since the Norman  invasion, the United Kingdom has never been enslaved by another  European people, and it therefore views the political dimension  of the Union merely as a threat to its freedom and independence.    "We are all islands shouting lies at each other across seas  of misunderstanding," would appear to be an accurate and  up-to-date British definition of the EC, even if the writer  Rudyard Kipling was actually speaking about himself and his  fellow countrymen. A miscaculation was made in the latest  crisis. The continental Europeans did not allow themselves to  be jostled apart. However, they did make the EC slightly less  European and slightly more British.    If they want to bring the British sickness to a halt, then  there is an effective remedy. Even if Spain and the United  Kingdom are both against a proposal, they still need another  member state to form a delaying majority. If the Ten were to  declare that they will not participate in forming a delaying  majority of 23 votes, but only a real blocking minority of 27  votes, then they will take the wind out of the United Kingdom's  sails.    They can then count on receiving the sympathy of the  European  Parliament and thus guarantee that enlargement can take place on  1 January. It goes without saying that the Netherlands and  Belgium will together be the first to make a unilateral  declaration of this kind. They do not recognize the Luxembourg  compromise whereby France called a false veto into being,  either. After all, the Hague says that it will go along with  the compromise merely to preserve the consensus. In this way,  the British could be shown that the EC member states are not  just islands.</p>

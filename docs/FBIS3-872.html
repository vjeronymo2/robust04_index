The minister informed the Angolan ambassador that the  Zairian  Government strongly protests the subversive statements;  statements in contempt of the nation's unity and integrity made  on Angolan soil by some Zairians in their quest for fame. The  Zairian Government regrets that the Angolan authorities have to  date not disapproved of these statements which are liable to  disturb the fraternal and neighborly relations between the two  countries.    The Zairian Government, therefore, calls on the Angolan  Government to take all the necessary measures to discourage all  those who may try to use its territory as a springboard for acts  of destabilization against Zaire. The Zairian Government wishes  to reassure the public that it has taken all the necessary steps  to protect its territory and, if need be, it will exercise its  right to prosecute.</p>

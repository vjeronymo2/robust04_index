			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Thorvald Stoltenberg, UN peace </F> mediator in the former Yugoslavia by unattribted correspondent,  in Moscow; no date given]    [Text] Moscow -- Concerted action by the United States,  the EU [European Union], Russia, and the United Nations seems to  be the only viable way of creating peace in war-torn Bosnia, the  UN peace mediator for the former Yugoslavia, Thorvald  Stoltenberg, said. The last few days Stoltenberg has been in  Moscow in an attempt to to put together an international  coalition which can bring an end to the long civil war.    In an interview with AFTENPOSTEN Stoltenberg said that there  is only one word which can describe what has happened in  Gorazde: madness. The atrocities make it clear to the whole of  the international community that there is not a single day to be  lost in the attempts to reach a peaceful solution. "For every  day that the war goes on, lives are being lost. At the same  time the involvement on behalf of and the desire for peace is  greater than it has been for a long time. This is a source of  optimism in the midst of the terrible reports from Gorazde," the  Norwegian peace mediator said.    Stoltenberg said that he is very happy about the last few  days' initiatives from both the United States and Russia. ``For  the first time in a long time we have real hope that the four  international actors -- that is, the United States, the European  Union, Russia, and the United Nations -- can arrive at a joint  position. If the international community confronts the sides in  Bosnia with a united approach and gives them a clear choice  between war and peace, there will be a realistic hope that they  will choose peace.    ``As long as the approaches of the United States, Russia,  and  the EU have remained so divergent, the sides in the civil war  have naturally enough each tried to play on their own  superpower,'' Stoltenberg continued. ``The United States has  been linked to the Muslims, the Russians to the Serbs, and the  Germans to the Croats. Each of the sides has believed that it  could win more by betting on `its' superpower than by seeking  peace. This has done nothing to promote peace.''    If developments over the next few days go as people hope,  representatives of the superpowers and the UN will hopefully  soon come together for a joint conference on Bosnia. It is also  perhaps possible to hope for a summit between Boris Yeltsin,  Bill Clinton, European leaders, and the UN secretary general.  More than one meeting will be needed to sketch a final peace  treaty for Bosnia. But if the will is there among the  international actors, a proposal for a peace agreement ought not  to be so far away, the Norwegian mediator said.    "I think that there are a couple of things of which people  should be fully aware in the future: First the fact that  anything is better than continued war. It goes without saying  that we prefer a just peace agreement under which each ethnic  group in Bosnia is given the land areas which are their due.  But we may have to settle for less. If in the next few weeks  it proves impossible to achieve anything other than a cease-fire  -- that is, a Cyprus solution where the sides are left standing  where they are now -- the Muslims will remain the losing side.  But this is greatly preferable to new victims and new  massacres," Stoltenberg said.    The second point he wanted to make was a warning against  believing that air strikes against Serb positions is an  abracadabra solution which can bring peace in Bosnia closer.  "The EU's peace mediator, Lord Owen, and I have continually  backed the possibility of the UN being able to give orders for  air strikes against one or more sides in the conflict. But such  attacks are not without their problems. You have to be aware  that the Bosnian Serbs have very good antiaircraft defenses. If  more NATO aircraft take to the air over Bosnia, we have to face  the fact that some of them will be shot down," Stoltenberg  stressed.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Letter: Private royal palaces on parade Sir, The article on royalty by John Lloyd ('Superstar route for royalty', July 10) is in need of correction. He states that all of the palaces 'including the so-called private possessions like Balmoral and Sandringham' should be opened up to the public. He obviously has not visited these two residences or he would have discovered that both are accessible to the public. At Sandringham he could not only see the house but also the extensive country park, the stunning gardens and grounds and the museums (including a motor museum). At both places he could have enjoyed a cup of tea and a meal. He could have bought granny a souvenir and at Sandringham the children could have tried the adventure playground. What more does he want?

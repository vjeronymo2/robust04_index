			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President Ilyas al-Hirawi in Beirut on 27 </F> February--recorded]    [Text] O Lebanese: Wicked hands insist on harming our  innocent kinsfolk. We insist on the steadiness of the march to  peace and salvation. The attempts to set us on a backward  course will not succeed. The catastrophe which occurred inside  the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in the Kasrawan area this morning  is a naked crime that will not succeed in diverting the  attention of world public opinion. One crime does not offset  another crime. We address the whole world and say that the all  Lebanese rally around their state and the march to peace. They  are unanimous in refusing to return to the imposed and  tendentious war.    We condemn this concocted incident. We have asked the  security authorities and all concerned security, judiciary, and  military officials to do their utmost to reveal the  circumstances of the abominable incident and to announce the  results of the investigations to the Lebanese people. We call  for the meting out of the harshest punishment to the  instigators, culprits, and accomplices and for severing every  hand which tries to jeopardize security and the march of peace.    Several attempts have surfaced in the past weeks to deflect  our march from its course and to induce friction among our  citizens. However, the state is standing firmly and steadily.  It has proved its ability to frustrate these attempts and  obstruct their aims. The Lebanese people's cohesion and their  rallying around their state are stronger than all these attempts.    May God have mercy on the innocent victims and may he heal  the injured.    What happened is yet another reason for all of us--officials  and citizens--to cooperate to prevent the tendentious aggressors  from toying with the unity of this homeland and its foundations.    Long live Lebanese unity. Long live Lebanon.</p>

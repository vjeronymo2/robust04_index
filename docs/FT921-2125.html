			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wool demand moves ahead of production RAW WOOL demand is outstripping new supplies for the first time in several years, leading to better prices and the chance for the orderly disposal of stocks, according to the International Wool Textile Organisation. The US, Japan and Italy appear to be leading the textile industry out of recession, while there is strong growth in demand from China, the organisation says in a new publication entitled International Wool Textile Overview. Latest figures show a 1 per cent year-on-year increase in wool textile manufacturing activity after almost three years of decline. 'The progress, albeit small, that is being made towards liquidating the stockpiles in Australia and New Zealand gives room for greater optimism for the future,' the report suggests. Wool growers in Australia, the world's biggest supplier, have sharply reduced their flocks not only because of the financial hardship following the end of the Australian Wool Board's price support measures, but also through drought and other adverse climatic factors. 'The latest indications are that world wool production has been cut back by as much as a tenth,' the report says. Almost three-quarters of the cut has been achieved by the Australians. As a result the availability of world supplies for 1991-92 has remained unchanged at 2.45m tonnes clean in spite of the unprecedented level of stocks carried forward from the previous season. This was accumulated before Australia and New Zealand returned to a free market in wool early last year. Stocks carried forward from 1990-91 are now put at a record 719,000 tonnes clean, 37 per cent up on the previous season. At current rates this represents about eight months requirements by the main importing countries. The latest estimate of wool production this season is 1.73m tonnes clean. 'This takes production back to what it was in the mid-eighties,' says the report.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     WORLD WOOL SUPPLY ('000 tonnes)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                1986-87  1987-88  1988-89  1989-90  1990-91  1991-92 Production       1,771    1,812    1,866    1,961    1,927    1,734 Carry-over          17       96       73      132      526      719 Total            1,788    1,908    1,939    2,093    2,453    2,453  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IWTO estimates  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

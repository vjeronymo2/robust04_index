			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Rodime in profit with Dollars 1.7m RODIME, the disk drive pioneer which now concentrates on licensing its technology, has made its first pre-tax profit since its heyday in 1985. It also said that on Wednesday it began litigation against Seagate Technology of the US, one of the world's leading disk drive makers, for 'continuing wilful patent infringement' and unfair competition. Rodime made a pre-tax profit of Dollars 1.69m (Pounds 1.11m) in the year to September 30, against a restated pre-tax loss of Dollars 22.4m in 1991. Net profit per share was 0.8 cents (16 cents loss). Operating income fell from Dollars 12.4m to Dollars 8.68m. But provisions for investments and liabilities of subsidiaries fell from Dollars 28.2m to Dollars 0.66m. Interest took Dollars 1.7m (Dollars 2.8m). Bank debt fell by Dollars 14.5m, but the balance sheet at September 30 still showed net liabilities of Dollars 25.68m (Dollars 26.8m). Shares in the Scotland-based company were relisted this August at 2 1/2 p after a year-long suspension. In recent weeks they have climbed to 7 1/2 p and yesterday closed unchanged at the same price. Rodime said it was disappointed with progress in licensing talks with 'several large disk drive producers.' It wanted negotiated agreements, but would initiate further patent infringement actions if necessary. Rodime has recovered Dollars 12.9m of the Dollars 16.9m it hoped to raise from asset disposals.</p>

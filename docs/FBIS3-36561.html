			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by V. Verbych: "Nationalist Ideas and Elections"] </F>   [Excerpt] Delegates from most of the oblast's rayons  arrived for a conference of the Volyn branch of the Congress of  Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN]. Representatives of parties and  civil unions which are members of the Prosperity, Justice, and  Order bloc also participated in the conference.    Serhiy Hodlevskyy, a member of the oblast branch of KUN,  presented to the participants an electoral platform of  nationalists entitled "Ukrainian Choice -- 94." In particular,  the document says that "the Ukrainian state faces a deadly  threat today." It also appeals for consolidation of all social  forces which support the national and state interests of  Ukraine. The platform also demands that officials who are  responsible for massive pilferage of national property and  bribery be brought to account. The document proclaims a  ceaseless war against nomenklatura and Mafia structures. KUN  will also fight against those forces which advocate racist,  chauvinist, imperial, and communist ideas. Admitting the  necessity of privatization and the establishment of a middle  class, KUN will resist unfair privatization [prykhvatyzatsiya --  relates to Supreme Chairman Plyushch's mispronunciation of the  word "pryvatyzatsiya"]. Ukraine's nuclear potential is  considered an essential security guarantee. KUN's legislative  candidates base their positions on such values as the  individual, family, nation, and state.    Meletiy Semenyuk, head of the oblast branch of KUN and head  of the Volyn branch of the Brotherhood of Ukrainian Insurrection  Army Troops, analyzed the current sociopolitical situation.  Speaking about prospects for state building, he emphasized that  "nobody will build our state except we ourselves." Special  attention was paid to the necessity of preserving unshaken  spirits and allegiance to the ideas of the Organization of  Ukrainian Nationalists [OUN] and the Ukrainian Insurrection Army  [UPA].    Meletiy Semenyuk condemned the dissemination of leaflets  signed in the name of "inheritors of national patriotism." In  particular, one of the leaflets signed by mythical political  leader "Lebed" and strategist-analyst "Uchytel," deputy  centurion of the Volyn Security Century, says: "We call on  professional racketeers, whose hands have not yet been soiled  with blood, to join the Brotherhood of OUN-UPA Troops..." M.  Semenyuk believes that activities of the so-called "inheritors  of national patriotism" are aimed at bringing discredit upon the  Brotherhood of UPA Troops and KUN. "We will not allow them to  discredit our movement," he stated, appealing to law enforcement  authorities for investigating those structures which are hidden  behind the "inheritors of national patriotism."

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / IBM poised to sell disk drive plant at Havant International Business Machines, the world's largest computer maker, is within weeks of agreeing the sale of all or part of one of its best-known European manufacturing operations. The site, at Havant, Hampshire, principally manufactures disk drives for personal computers and is the sole source of some important IBM systems. It employs some 1,500 people and turns over more than Pounds 500m a year. It is profitable, although separate figures are not published. Among the likely bidders are the plant's own senior management, led by managing director Mr Ken Wilkie. It is not known how IBM regards the prospect of a management buy-out at the plant although it would not be the first time IBM had accepted such a buy-out in the UK. It recently sold its property management activities to its senior staff. The planned disposal follows the sale of a majority stake in the company's printer operations at Jarfalla, Sweden, to a Swedish venture capital company earlier this year. It also follows the opening of part of its Montpellier, France, manufacturing facil-ities for lease by other companies. These are unprecedented moves for the computer giant which has traditionally owned and controlled its manufacturing capacity. The sites at Havant, Jarfalla, Montpellier and Valencia in Spain were identified last year as 'surplus to requirements' as part of the company's strategy to return to profitability. IBM has been reducing staff numbers and manufacturing capacity as it comes to terms with the economics of a computer industry dominated by personal computers which yield low profit margins compared with mainframe computers, its traditional strength. Havant has been operating as an 'independent business unit' - run by local management with the option to seek manufacturing contracts from outside customers. It has been diversifying into the contract manufacture of systems for other customers. At the end of last year, for example, it signed a contract to make disk drives for Western Digital, a US disk drive supplier. The staff were told this week that several potential new owners had been identified and that the parent company expected to make a final decision in the near future. A small number of potential buyers has been invited to view the plant's operations. Sun returns to its shining showing of 1980s, Page 32 Lotus posts sharp fall in third term, Page 32</p>

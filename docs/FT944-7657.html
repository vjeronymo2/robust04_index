			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Unilever drops Dollars 60m Kazakh plant bid: Move is further sign of trouble for country's privatisation programme The Anglo-Dutch company Unilever has withdrawn a Dollars 60m bid for two state-owned margarine factories in Kazakhstan, in a further sign of trouble for the country's privatisation programme. The withdrawal this week comes two months after the Kazakhstan parliament began pushing to suspend the privatisation programme alleging that auctions had been fixed to benefit powerful families. The state privatisation committee has set a December 1 deadline for Unilever to submit a new bid for the factories, located at Alma Ata and Karaganda. Ms Susan Bruno of KPMG Peat Marwick, which advises the state committee, said. 'They (Unilever) are definitely still interested. They want to keep this thing alive,' Ms Bruno said in a telephone interview. Unilever won a tender for the plants and signed a preliminary agreement in June, a deal worth Dollars 60m in cash and investment. The deal was supposed to close in August, but Unilever began having difficulty obtaining licences and guarantees from various government ministries. Finally, the company was unable to obtain a guarantee for a steady local supply of its main staple, sunflower oil, something that had been stipulated in the preliminary agreement. The company's new offer could be lower, since it appears it must supply its own sunflower oil from outside the republic, Ms Bruno said. The Unilever deal is important, since it is one of three large initial privatisations meant to send a signal to foreign investors that Kazakhstan is serious about attracting outside capital. One of the two other deals, RJR Nabisco's purchase last summer of two confectionary plants, also seemed in doubt when state officials began trying to alter parts of the contract, according to western businessmen close to the deal. As a whole, Kazakhstan's seven-month-old privatisation programme has produced mixed results. The programme is divided into three parts - tenders of large enterprises such as the confectionary and margarine plants; mass auctions of some 7,500 small and medium-sized enterprises; and privatisation of small concerns such as shops. The small-scale privatisation appears to have gone well, diplomats and western business analysts say, but the sale of medium and large-scale enterprises has been slow. Western diplomats, for example, confirmed that the sale of medium-sized concerns initially did appear to have been rigged. Many were sold to favoured families without prior advertisement of the properties, they said. 'A lot of them were done very quickly, and ended up in the hands of the rich and famous,' said one western diplomat.</p>

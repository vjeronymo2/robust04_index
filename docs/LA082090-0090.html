			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> MORE WATER: What a difference a year makes. This time last year, the volume of  water in the main reservoir serving San Clemente dropped to its lowest in  history -- 17.3 million gallons -- jolting city officials into enacting a  series of rationing laws that are the toughest in Orange County. Now, thanks to  restrictions on lawn watering, building and excessive-use penalties, along with  voluntary conservation, the 48-million-gallon-capacity reservoir has reached  44.3 million gallons.

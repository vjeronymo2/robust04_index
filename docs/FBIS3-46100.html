An official from the department of household registration of  the Beijing Public Security Bureau revealed that the migrant  population posed many problems, especially those of public order  which has seen half of the criminals arrested in the  municipality being non- permanent residents even though this  group of the population made a contribution to the prosperity of  the municipality.    A seminar held by local bureaus of public security in  Beijing  was aimed at collecting opinions from the public in a bid to  work out measures to maintain public order. Many of those who  expressed an opinion at the seminar said that the increase in  use of police radio for reporting of crimes should be employed.    Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference, Mr. Shen Zui, in a speech  praised the introduction of the police patrol system, saying he  was convinced that the police should patrol with police dogs in  order to impose further deterrence on criminals. He also called  for the installation of the more telephones for the reporting of  crime.    An expert on teenage education pointed out that great  attention should be paid to the fact that the age of criminals  was becoming younger and that education in the law for teenagers  had to be boosted. A public security official said that the  administration of public order had to be based on the strict  cracking down on crime. He added that reform of public security  work should be carried out with the aim of keeping in line with  the socialist market economy system.</p>

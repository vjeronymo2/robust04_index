			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 TEEN-AGERS TRAPPED IN TUNNEL FOR 4 HOURS  </P> <P> Two Simi Valley teen-agers were trapped for more than four hours early Saturday  in a cave at Santa Susana Knolls near Simi Valley after one became stuck while  crawling through a narrow passage, authorities said.  </P> <P> Dean Feldman, 16, got stuck in a tunnel while following Sara Morris, 15.  Because Feldman was stuck, Morris was unable to return to the cave's entrance,  said Sgt. Will Howe of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Two other teen-agers who had been crawling behind Feldman left the cave and  summoned authorities after trying for more than an hour to help their 6-foot-2,  160-pound friend squeeze through the passage, Howe said. Firefighters used an  air chisel to widen the tunnel and free Feldman about 7:30 a.m., more than four  hours after he became lodged there, Howe said. The teen-agers entered the cave  during a hike, which began about 10:30 p.m. Friday, Howe said.  </P></p>

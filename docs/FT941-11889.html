			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Unions postpone protest on pay Union leaders representing Britain's 5.8m public-sector workers decided yesterday to hold back for the time being from calling any protest action against the government's three-year freeze on the pay bill. Instead, they are to wait for the results of the public pay review body reports, which are due shortly, and the government's response to them. Union leaders warned thatsupport exists in principle across the public sector for the calling of a day of action to highlight the threat to the public services as well as jobs. A private opinion poll commissioned by the Trades Union Congress found there was substantial support among both private and public sector workers for some form of protest against government policy. 'The form a 'public sector day' will take and the most appropriate timing will be the subject of further discussion between unions,' the TUC said in a statement. Union leaders, however, dropped the idea of a day of action on April 11. Mr AlanJinkinson, general secretary of Unison, Britain's largest public-service union,and chairman of the TUC public services committee, warned that 'an explosive cocktail' was mixing in the public sector through a combination of the pay-bill freeze, cuts in jobs and services, tax increases and privatisation. The TUC said it was clear from the responses gathered by the public-service unions that the government's pay policy combined with tax rises, market-testing and contracting-out was 'likely to lead to industrial action'. Union leaders agreed to hold a special one-day conference on March 3 to debate the pay-bill freeze. User groups will be invited to take part. The unions are keen to focus attention on the threat of cuts to the public services rather than on the need of their members for higher wages.</p>

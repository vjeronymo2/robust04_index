			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / People: Railtrack Devising a railway timetable is the art of slotting trains into routes with minutes to spare. Railtrack, the company which takes over responsibility for British Rail timetabling on April 1, appears to have been honing its skills in the field of board appointments. With less than two weeks to go before Railtrack goes 'live', the company has finally announced that it has found a finance director. Norman Broadhurst, at present deputy chief executive and finance director of shipbuilding and engineering group VSEL, has been appointed. Broadhurst, 52, (below) will join Railtrack full-time on July 1. He has already started reading himself into his new job but is required at VSEL for some time yet to complete their annual accounts. After spending part of his early career with accountants Price Waterhouse, Broadhurst devoted the next 13 years to Platt Saco Lowell, a manufacturer of textile machinery and part of the ill-fated Stone Platt Industries. He subsequently moved to China Light and Power, a Hong Kong public utility, and then, in 1986 became financial director of United Engineering Steels. In 1990 he went to VSEL which had been privatised from British Shipbuilders four years earlier. Broadhurst says that the common feature of his two most recent jobs was that they involved newly formed companies attempting to establish themselves in their respective markets: 'I am used to getting in at the grass roots,' he says. Railtrack, which will take over BR track, signalling and stations valued at Pounds 6.5bn, will provide an opportunity to put those skills to the test. Melvin Pointer is moving from NFC to become group treasurer of Railtrack, and at VSEL, Rob Holden, currently group financial controller, will become acting finance director when Broadhurst moves.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Council of Ministers approved creation of the  Fiscal Police and a 105-billion bolivares budget reduction today.    [Reporter Cecilia Pachano] During the almost five hour  cabinet meeting, the ministers discussed at length the package  of fiscal laws known as the Sosa Plan, although the topic was  not exhausted. They believe the package will be finally approved  this weekend during an extraordinary Council of Ministers  meeting. To make this possible, the economic cabinet declared  this an emergency and will continue to refine the laws so they  can be ready before 8 March, the date on which the executive  insists it will formally submit them to Congress. Progress was  made on other matters, however. The ministers approved a decree  that cuts spending to a level close to the 10-percent goal the  government set. Most affected by the reduction are the  Transportation and Communications Ministry, with a cut of 30  billion bolivares, the Interior Ministry, with 12 billion  bolivares, the Agriculture and Livestock Ministry, with 10  billion bolivares, and the Defense Ministry with 6 billion.    Another result of the cabinet meeting was approval of the  decree creating the National Tax Management and Control Service  [Servicio Nacional de Administracion and Control Tributario], a  self-financing body without the legal authority [personalidad  juridica] to replace the General Income Directorate, which is to  be known by the name of Fiscal Police [Policia Fiscal].    [Begin Guillermo Alvarez, Central Information Office  minister, recording] It will direct and administer tax  activities, participate in the drafting of tax policies and  issue guidelines to implement them, participate in studying and  drafting bills, act as the authority that establishes tax  policies and explains and enforces fiscal legislation, have the  authority to collect taxes, and ensure sufficient taxes are  collected. There is no budget allocation for this body; it will  be self-supporting through the product of its own operations,  and that is why it is called an autonomous service. [end  recording]    Also approved during the Council of Ministers meeting was a  decree maintaining a freeze on medicine prices, and the  ministers ordered a revamping of the Energy and Mines Ministry.    [Begin Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Jose Arrieta  recording] The purpose of this revamping is to adapt and  modernize this ministry in line with the country's current  mining and energy situation, so we can have a policy on mining  and oil, as well as a large-scale mining activity. For that  purpose, the ministry's structure will be appropriate for that  challenge. [end recording]    [Pachano] The Council of Ministers also approved a decree  reactivating the National Border Council, which will be  installed formally on 8 March.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Monday [11 April] the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU] Executive Committee has welcomed the  decision of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] Presidium  about the continuation of the Christian-Liberal coalition.  Thus, the alternatives are politically clear, CDU Secretary  General Peter Hintze told journalists in Bonn after the meeting.  The choice is between the continuation of the coalition of the  center or a red-green [Social Democrats-Greens] coalition.    Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf  Scharping can now save himself the trouble of continuing his  "coalition hide-and-seek game." He can govern only together  with the Greens. The CDU will clearly state the alternative  positions in the election campaign. It will point to the focal  issues of tax and financial policy, to reliability in foreign  policy, as well as to the plans of Greens and parts of the SPD  that are hostile toward technology.    Asked whether the FDP decision also means a preliminary  decision for the election of the German president, Hintze said  that he is convinced that there are good prospects that CDU  candidate Roman Herzog will be elected. Answering further  questions, Hintze said that potential differences with FDP  Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger about the  question of the deportation of Kurds are considered to have been  eliminated by the minister's latest statements.</p>

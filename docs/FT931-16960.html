			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: A penny not so dreadful READERS of the Financial Times only got six pages back in 1893 but they did pay a lot less than they would have done for today's paper. The FT cost just one penny in 1893. That is the equivalent of 18.6 pence today after decimalisation of the pound in the 1970s and a century of inflation. Put another way, today's 60 pence issue would have cost 3.22 pennies if it had been put on the news stands in 1893.</p>

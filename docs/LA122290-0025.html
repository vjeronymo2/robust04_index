			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTH HOLLYWOOD TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> ALLEN, GRANADA HILLS THWART STUBBORN GRANT, 63-56  </P> <P> Granada Hills High benefited from Grant's cold shooting and untimely turnovers  in the fourth quarter Friday night to score a 63-56 victory over the Lancers in  a semifinal game of the North Hollywood tournament.  </P> <P> The Highlanders (9-1) owned a 51-50 lead after three quarters and held Grant to  just six points in the final period to advance to today's 7 p.m. championship  game against El Camino Real. The Conquistadores defeated North Hollywood,  64-44, in the other semifinal.  </P> <P> It looked as if Grant would get a break when Granada Hills' Jerry Allen, who  finished with a game-high 23 points, picked up his fourth foul with one minute,  18 seconds left in the third quarter. Allen already had his 23 points, but  Coach Bob Johnson wanted Allen on the floor for the final period.  </P> <P> "Coach Johnson told me, 'You gotta play soft, but we need you on offense,' "  Allen said. "I kept my hands in my pocket. I had to. I wanted to play."  </P> <P> Fearful of committing a fifth foul, Allen never attempted a shot in the fourth  quarter. Instead, he dished out assists to Gene Barshtak and Adrian Sellers,  and controlled the tempo on offense.  </P> <P> Grant's Brunell Mori, who finished with 16 rebounds and a team-high 16 points,  tied the score, 54-54, with 5:25 to play.  </P> <P> But the Lancers were scoreless for five minutes, allowing Granada Hills to post  a 9-0 run for a 63-54 lead. Ryan Cravens' three-point play and Sellers' 10-foot  jump shot keyed the Highlanders' run.  </P> <P> Barshtak's slam with 29 seconds left punctuated the victory. George Vicuna  stole the ball from David Knight at midcourt and passed to Barshtak, who  slammed it through with both hands.  </P> <P> Grant (6-2) turned the ball over three times down the stretch and failed to  score off six offensive rebounds in the final period.  </P> <P> Granada Hills led, 16-13, after the first quarter but fell behind, 38-31, late  in the second period after Grant put together a 7-0 run behind Sean McMahon's  four points and Eric Brown's fourth three-point basket of the quarter.  </P> <P> Brown was four of four from three-point range in the second quarter and  finished with 12 points.  </P> <P> The Highlanders outscored Grant, 12-2, in the opening minutes of the third  period for a 44-40 lead and led by one with eight minutes left.  </P> <P> McMahon finished with 14 points for the Lancers, and Sellers scored 16 for  Granada Hills.  </P> <P> Grant plays North Hollywood for third place today at 5:30 p.m.  </P> <P> In other games:  </P> <P> El Camino Real 64, North Hollywood 44 -- The Conquistadores' inside game proved  too tough for the Huskies, who played without Eric Jackson, who sustained a  broken left wrist Thursday against Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Jackson, the Huskies' best inside player and rebounder, could only watch as El  Camino Real took apart the Huskies (6-3) on both sides of the court. Jackson  will wear a cast for the next three weeks.  </P> <P> Markee Brown scored 14 points for El Camino Real (6-1), and teammates Adam  Kodish and Sam Sarpong each scored 11.  </P> <P> North Hollywood's only double-figure scorer was Robert Hill, who scored 12  points in the first half but was held to just six in the second to finish with  a game-high 18 points.  </P> <P> Reseda 66, Poly 47 -- Marquis Burns scored 16 points and James Pigford added 13  to lead the Regents (3-4) past Poly (2-6) in a semifinal consolation game.  </P> <P> The Regents led, 31-17, at halftime and limited Poly to nine or fewer points in  each of the first three quarters.  </P> <P> Steve McCann's 13 points and Juan DeLuna's 10 paced the Parrots.  </P> <P> Bell-Jeff 69, Chatsworth 65 -- Ignacio Castro scored 27 points as Bell-Jeff  (4-4) advanced to the consolation championship against Reseda today at 4 p.m.  </P> <P> Trailing by 10 points at the end of three quarters, Bell-Jeff outscored  Chatsworth, 25-11, in the fourth quarter for the victory. The Guards converted  all 12 of their free throws in the period. Castro made seven free throws and  Brian Lee, who finished with 18 points, was five of five. Chatsworth is 4-3.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Rwandans: As we have been telling you over the last  few days, as some of you have indeed witnessed, the small group  [words indistinct] killings starting from Kigali town. Many  people have died and continue to die after this small group  decided to liquidate the Tutsis and everyone else who does not  agree with the ideas of the Republican National Movement for  Democracy and Development and the Coalition for the Defense of  the Republic.    The small group of killers, as usual, believed that they  would go on killing innocent people while citizens just stood  by. The killers then came to realize that the Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF], some government troops, and other Rwandans who do  not want their country [word indistinct] had decided to resist.  Some members of the small group among the Presidential Guard,  Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi [pro-Habyarimana militias] have  started fleeing after realizing that Rwandans were going to  [words indistinct]. They are fleeing through Butare and Cyangugu.    Citizens, especially in Butare and Cyangugu areas and  elsewhere [word indistinct], must unite to protect yourselves  and fight the killers. The RPF combatants are on the outskirts  of Kigali town and are determined to rout the small group. That  should be the aim of all citizens.    We again thank government troops who have dissociated  themselves from the Presidential Guards, thereby (?making it  easier) to fight the latter. We also thank all Rwandans who  have now identified their country's enemy and are joining hands  with the RPF in Rwanda. We call on you to persevere on this  course and hope that those who have not yet joined will do so  soon. The RPF is with you. Continue to help one another to  protect our country.</p>

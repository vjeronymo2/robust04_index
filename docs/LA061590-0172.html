			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> POLICE TELL WHY THEY SUSPECT TEEN BROTHER SHOT HIS SISTER  </P> <P> A 12-year-old Anaheim Shores girl who was allegedly shot in the head Thursday  by her 14-year-old brother remained in critical condition today as police  revealed details claiming that the boy concocted a story about the shooting.  </P> <P> Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said 18 police officers searched the neighborhood for about  an hour Thursday afternoon when the boy telephoned police to report that "three  masked men" had broken into their home and shot his sister, Gema Marie Hubler,  in the head.  </P> <P> Police finally arrested the boy when evidence led them to believe that he had  concocted the story and that he was responsible for the shooting.  </P> <P> During the search, Hedgpeth said a police helicopter circled above the  neighborhood looking for a getaway car and police dogs attempted to track the  alleged assailants, Hedgpeth said.  </P> <P> One man was briefly detained during the search after a neighbor reported that  she saw a "man acting strangely."  </P> <P> "Even though we felt uncomfortable with his story, we knew that if the  'suspects' got away because we ignored him, we would have felt bad," Hedgpeth  said.  </P> <P> Within an hour, Hedgpeth said investigators suspected that the boy's story was  concocted. Hedgpeth said the physical evidence police found on the scene did  not match the boy's story. He declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> Gema Hubler was in critical condition today at UCI Medical Center in Orange  where she underwent surgery for a single gunshot wound in the head, police  said.  </P> <P> Hubler's brother is being held in Orange County Juvenile Hall on suspicion of  attempted murder. His name was not released because he is a juvenile.  </P></p>

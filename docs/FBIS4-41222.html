			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "Post-Check Privatization Draft Program </F> Will Be Submitted to President Friday"]    [Text] A draft state program of post-check [voucher]  privatization setting out the rules for denationalization of  state property after 1 July will probably be up for President  Boris Yeltsin's signature Friday. This has been disclosed by  Dmitriy Vasilyev, deputy chairman of the Russian Federation  State Committee for the Management of State Property. According  to him, an edict setting the state program in motion is supposed  to be signed by Boris Yeltsin early next week. Russian  Federation Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays stated earlier that  some 20 percent of state property is supposed to be privatized  for money in the post-check period. By July 1994 70 percent of  Russia's property will be in the private sector; 10 percent of  state enterprises are not subject to privatization.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Argentaria improves 14% to Pta21.2bn ARGENTARIA, the state-owned Spanish banking corporation which is in the process of being partially privatised through a Dollars 1bn international placement, has lifted first-quarter net profits 14 per cent to Pta21.2bn (Dollars 184m). The figures come as individual and institutional investors in Spain and institutional investors outside Spain await the allocation of shares in the close to 25 per cent of Argentaria equity that is being put on the market. Argentaria raised financial revenues by 9.1 per cent to Pta264bn, financial margin by 5.3 per cent to Pta60.2bn and operating margin by 17.7 per cent to Pta32.1bn, in what are likely to be some of the best quarterly results among Spain's leading banks.

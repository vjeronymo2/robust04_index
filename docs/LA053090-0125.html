			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS OPEN THE FIRST ROUND OF SERIES AGAINST OKLAHOMA ST.  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton, sixth-seeded in the College World Series, will begin its  quest for a third national championship Saturday when the Titans play  third-seeded Oklahoma State at 5:10 p.m. PDT at Omaha.  </P> <P> The series, in its 44th year, begins Friday, when top-seeded Stanford plays  eighth-seeded Georgia Southern at 1:10 p.m. and fourth-seeded Georgia plays  fifth-seeded Mississippi State at 5:10 in Rosenblatt Stadium.  </P> <P> Saturday's action will begin at 1:10 p.m. with second-seeded Louisiana State  playing The Citadel, which upset Miami 4-1 Tuesday to win the Atlantic Regional  and earn the tournament's seventh seed.  </P> <P> The tournament is split into two, four-team, double-elimination brackets, the  first consisting of Friday's participants and the second of Saturday's. The  winners of each bracket will meet in a single game, scheduled for June 9, for  the national title.  </P> <P> Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell was glad to see the Titans weren't in the same  bracket as Stanford, which has been ranked No. 1 in the nation for the past  month. The Cardinal, which swept a three-game series from Fullerton early this  season, eliminated the Titans from the 1988 series.  </P> <P> "Everyone is tough when you get to the College World Series, but if I had to  pick one team, Stanford is the team to beat," Cochell said. "With their great  pitching and defense, they're going to be difficult to beat."  </P> <P> Fullerton had a 4-0 record in the Central Regional at Austin, Tex. The Titans  (36-21) beat host Texas twice, 5-2, Sunday and, 3-0, Monday. Fullerton opened  the regional with a 16-3 victory over Old Dominion and then beat Creighton,  6-3.  </P> <P> The Titans, ranked fourth in Tuesday's Collegiate Baseball-ESPN poll and ninth  by Baseball America, made only one error in the regional. They outscored their  opponents, 30-8, and outhit them, 44-27.  </P> <P> Five Fullerton pitchers combined for a 2.00 earned-run average and sophomore  right-hander James Popoff won two games, including a four-hit shutout of the  Longhorns Monday.  </P> <P> Paul Bunch, who replaced David Ayala in right field for the first Texas game,  batted .556 (five for nine) in the regional with a home run and three runs  batted in. Third baseman Phil Nevin hit .467 (seven for 15) with three RBIs,  and left fielder Rich Gonzales batted .400 (six for 15) with a home run and  five RBIs.  </P> <P> "We think we have as good a shot as anyone," Cochell said. "We're playing  awfully good baseball right now."  </P> <P> Oklahoma State (53-16) swept through the West II Regional, defeating host  Arizona State twice, 17-9, Sunday and, 10-5, Monday. The Cowboys, ranked second  and third in the two national polls, made only one error in the regional,  outscored their opponents, 48-16, and outhit them, 54-31.  </P> <P> Like Fullerton, Oklahoma State has three solid starting pitchers -- junior  right-hander Dennis Burbank, a former Valencia High standout who played at  Pepperdine and Cypress College before transferring to Oklahoma State, senior  right-hander Gordie Tipton and freshman right-hander Brad Gore.  </P></p>

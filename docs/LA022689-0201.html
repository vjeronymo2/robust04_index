			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 5-AA GIRLS;  </P> <P> LESLIE LEADS TOP-SEEDED MORNINGSIDE PAST FOUNTAIN VALLEY  </P> <P> Lisa Leslie scored 36 points and grabbed 18 rebounds to lead top-seeded  Morningside High School to a 73-56 victory over Fountain Valley in a Southern  Section 5-AA semifinal girls' basketball game Saturday at Edison High School.  </P> <P> Leslie, a 6-foot-5 junior center, scored eight of her points in the second  quarter as Morningside (27-1) overcame a 15-12 Fountain Valley lead.  Morningside, ranked third in the nation by USA Today, outscored the Barons,  23-6, in the second quarter to take a 35-21 halftime lead.  </P> <P> The Monarchs, who scored 14 unanswered points in the first 4 minutes 42 seconds  of the period, held Fountain Valley (21-9) to two free throws each by Stacey  Hisaka, Amy Brand and Julie Workman in the quarter.  </P> <P> Leslie, who also had four blocks in the game, finished the first half with 15  points and eight rebounds.  </P> <P> "I was real pleased with the way we played in the first quarter," said Fountain  Valley Coach Carol Strausburg, whose team led by as many as five points three  times.  </P> <P> "They came out in a zone defense, and we shot very well against them. Then they  came out of that defense in the second quarter, and we were very intimidated by  their pressure. I wish we could have handled their defense a little better in  the second quarter."  </P> <P> Said Morningside Coach Frank Scott, whose team will play Fontana in the finals  on Friday: "We tested them with a 2-3 zone to see what they could do. Then we  went into a 1-2-2 defense in the second quarter, and that worked very well for  us."  </P> <P> Leslie added 12 more points in the third quarter as the Monarchs outscored the  Barons, 23-17, to take a 58-38 lead.  </P> <P> Morningside's Jo Jo Witherspoon had 13 points, and 6-3 freshman forward Janet  Davis scored six of her 10 points in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Hisaka and Kami Bigler had 17 points each to lead Fountain Valley, and Julie  Workman added 10.  </P></p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Schroder Wagg top in merchant bank league J HENRY Schroder Wagg has knocked SG Warburg from top place in the annual merchant banks' league table, derived from the 1992 edition of Crawford's Directory of City Connections. In the league table, which is based on number of clients, Schroder pipped Warburg for the top by picking up 25 new clients during 1991, giving it 126 to Warburg's 125. NM Rothschild has overtaken Morgan Grenfell and pushed into third place, while Hill Samuel, the loss-making merchant banking subsidiary of the TSB group, has slipped from fifth to seventh. The merchant banking arms of most of the large clearing banks have lost clients: Barclays de Zoete Wedd has fallen by one place to ninth, pushing Samuel Montagu, part of Midland, to tenth. County NatWest remains at fourteenth, though its client numbers are down. Among stockbroking advisers the blue-blooded Cazenove easily retains the lead. With 256 clients, it is far ahead of the runner up, Rowe &amp; Pitman, with 171. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew stands out as the main broker to take a tumble. It lost 14 clients last year and fell to eighth place from fifth. The directory also supports the argument that British business is still overwhelmingly a male preserve. Women make up only 2 per cent of the top executives in British companies listed by Crawford's. Though there are five chairwoman among 1,300 quoted companies, Ms Anita Roddick at Body Shop was the only female managing director and Ms Ruth Henderson, at the Alexon Group, the only woman chief executive.</p>

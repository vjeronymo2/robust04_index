			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "jip": "The Cabinet Accepted the Security </F> Report"]    [Excerpt] Prague--The Cabinet accepted the revised report  by Interior Minister Jan Ruml on security in the Czech Republic.  After the session, Minister Ruml said that no immediate threat  to the Czech Republic and its population can be derived from the  analysis of the present situation. In addition to the analysis,  the revised report lists the main risks and specific measures,  adopted or prepared by the government, for their elimination.  The legislative concept of the government in the security  sphere is enclosed.    The report indicates that two distinct groups of risks exist  for the Czech Republic. Among the large ones, immediately  affecting the stability of the political system, are especially  migration, ethnic conflicts, financial scheming, and the  narcotics problem. The group of small risks, threatening  protection of freedoms, health, and the property of citizens,  includes general crime (car theft, burglaries) and economic  crime (tax evasion and fraud).

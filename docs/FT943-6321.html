			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / New York police fight to recycle rubbish on city streets 'Look over there - another violation,' shouts sanitation police officer Julius Ingram, wheeling his blue and white New York City police car into a U-turn. 'Liquor bottles and loose boxes,' he pronounces with satisfaction. That is the least of it. The pavement of this narrow road off West 211th Street, high up in Manhattan's desolate northern tip, is covered with metal shards and rotting fruit as well as discarded bottles. We are cruising the back streets of Washington Heights and Inwood on dawn patrol to enforce the city's tough and increasingly controversial laws on recycling rubbish. Residents are now mounting a campaign against the vigilance of the city's garbage police. Meanwhile, the city, worried about the rising costs of recycling, has challenged a state Supreme Court order for it to double present recycling levels. Leaflets in English, Spanish and Chinese tell residents to tie all cardboard and paper into bundles with string, and to put metal cans, glass and plastic into pale blue plastic sacks. It seems a lot to ask of an unruly, largely Spanish speaking district, packed with illegal immigrants from the Dominican Republic and riddled with drug dealing. But officer Ingram is undeterred. The grimy six-storey apartment block, which bears a sign proclaiming 'Centre for International Aliens', has failed to flatten its boxes correctly. Writing out a pink ticket for a Dollars 25 fine, he sticks it with masking tape to the door. The recycling programme, in its fifth year in New York City's five boroughs, has achieved more success than sceptics expected. Washington Heights, which recycles nearly 10 per cent of its household rubbish, is only slightly below the programme's average, but a world away from the 28 per cent in Manhattan's elegant, environmentally concerned Upper East Side. But overall the city's recycling falls far short of the 25 per cent target for 1995 required by state law. The programme has provoked opposition from residents who feel they are sometimes unfairly fined. It is also expensive, although much of the annual budget - Dollars 78m (Pounds 50m) last year - is passed on to residents through property taxes. The underlying problem is that the city is running out of places to put its rubbish. Districts to the north are reluctant to take the waste, as are neighbouring states. 'No one wants New York's garbage,' says Ms Marsha Bystryn, assistant commissioner of the city's recycling department. 'It's like it came from Sodom and Gomorrah - who knows what might be in it.'</p>

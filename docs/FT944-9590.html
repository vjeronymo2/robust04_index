			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Testing the metal Mr Richard Oster, Cookson's chief executive, and Mr David Davies, Johnson Matthey's chairman and chief executive, are both ambitious men. Neither seems fulfilled running a medium-sized public company. The suspicion is that the main drive behind their merger talks is size for size's sake. A combined group would be able to embark on larger acquisitions than either company individually. If Cookson and JM do consummate their marriage, synergies will doubtless be claimed. But from the information so far available, it is hard to see these being substantial. True, there would be cost savings from eliminating one or other head office, but that would be true if any two businesses were merged. Synergies may also come from putting together the companies' electronics and precious metals operations: Cookson and JM make complementary electronics products which may be able to share a distribution channel. JM's precious metal refining business may also be able to wring some extra profit from a vertical relationship with Cookson's precious metal fabricating arm. But neither prospect looks terribly exciting. Even without much in the way of industrial logic, shareholders in one of the companies could benefit if they received a particularly large slice of the merged entity. Yesterday there were suggestions that JM shareholders might do somewhat better than the company's relative market capitalisation would suggest. But if that were the case, the benefit to JM investors would be at the expense of Cookson's. The companies will have to put on a convincing demonstration of the industrial case for merger if shareholders are to be satisfied.</p>

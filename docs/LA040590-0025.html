			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> 2 SIDES SUBMIT BALLOT ARGUMENTS  </P> <P> In final ballot arguments submitted Wednesday, opponents of a proposed 5%  Oxnard utility tax contend that it would not be needed if city government would  only operate more efficiently.  </P> <P> But supporters of the tax, including Councilman Manuel M. Lopez and Police  Chief Robert P. Owens, say in their ballot arguments that the tax is essential  to restoring badly needed police and fire services.  </P> <P> The tax, which would cost the average household about $4 per month, would  generate about $5 million annually for the city. An election is scheduled June  5.  </P> <P> City officials said the additional revenue would be used to make up for a  growing deficit and to fatten the emergency reserve fund, which has dropped by  about $9 million over the past four years.  </P> <P> The tax was recommended in a recent management audit, which projected a city  deficit of between $27 million and $67.5 million by 1995-96.  </P> <P> Opponents of the tax, including the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce and a group of  residents and business owners who call themselves Oxnard Residents for  Responsible Government, blame the city's financial woes on government  mismanagement.  </P> <P> According to their ballot argument, opponents also reject the measure because  it would "approve a permanent utility tax to solve a temporary budget problem."  </P> <P> Supporters of the measure say the financial problems stem from a decline in  revenues and an increase in expenses. As a result, they say, the city has had  to make cuts in police and fire services.  </P> <P> Because of the financial restraints, Lt. Tom Kady said that over the last year,  the Oxnard Police Department has about 11 police positions unfilled, including  four officers in the drunk-driving enforcement unit. The department has 155  sworn officers. HUGO MARTIN  </P></p>

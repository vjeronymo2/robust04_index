			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HIJACK ALERTS AT ASIAN AIRPORTS;  </P> <P> SECURITY CRACKDOWN TURNS UP FAKE VISAS  </P> <P> An alert among Asian airports against possible hijackings has revealed a large  number of people traveling with fake documents.  </P> <P> Manila airport officials said these would-be immigrants have been bounced back  and forth by countries that did not want them.  </P> <P> "It's like a Ping-Pong ball," said Ruben Domingo, head of immigration  intelligence at Manila International Airport.  </P> <P> Airports in the region have tightened security since a warning early this month  that Palestinian guerrillas planned to hijack an Asian airliner.  </P> <P> Domingo said that since then alert immigration personnel have been turning away  one or two foreigners a day with fake or insufficient travel documents, most of  whom are from Asia or the Middle East. That was up from an average of two or  three a week over the last six months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fake Canadian Visas  </P> <P> He said that in the last two days of December officials expelled three Chinese  holding fake Canadian visas, an Iraqi with an altered Saudi Arabian passport  and a woman describing herself as Palestinian and carrying a false U.S.  passport.  </P> <P> He said many people turned away were sent back and forth several times between  the same countries. A Chinese-speaking man with a fake Filipino passport was  sent back and forth between Hong Kong and the Philippines five times, he said.  </P> <P> A Western official of an international humanitarian organization said some  individuals without legal papers spent years "in orbit," either locked away in  immigration detention centers or deported from one country to another.  </P> <P> Domingo said that for years Manila had the reputation of being one of the  easiest capitals to travel through illegally, but security had become tighter  over the last year.  </P> <P> Last February the immigration commissioner described Manila as the "world's  capital" for obtaining fake passports, with around 80 syndicates operating in  the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fakes Previously Used  </P> <P> Domingo said many of the forged travel papers recently confiscated indicated  that they had been used successfully before in getting the illegal traveler  through the airport.  </P> <P> "Things are a lot stricter now. . . . We can no longer accept the rejects of  other countries," he said.  </P> <P> In Canberra, an immigration department spokesman said Australia deals with  about 2,000 cases of forged passports a year, and considers itself one of the  toughest countries to enter using forged documents.  </P> <P> In Japan an immigration official at Tokyo International Airport said about  7,500 foreign arrivals -- mostly from Asian countries -- were refused entry in  1988 because of forged entry documents.  </P> <P> The Japanese Foreign Ministry said Japan plans to suspend its mutual visa  exemption agreements with Bangladesh and Pakistan due to an increase in illegal  entrants.  </P></p>

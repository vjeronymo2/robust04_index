			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Luxury end helps Time Products rise 15% A successful year in the luxury wristwatch market, with one item being sold for Pounds 500,000, helped Time Products to boost 1993 profits by 15 per cent. The watch and jewellery distribution group reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 11.4m, including Pounds 1.5m from the disposal of the group's remaining property interests in Hong Kong. Turnover expanded 13 per cent from Pounds 59.2m to Pounds 67.1m. The 1992 turnover contained Pounds 9.6m from discontinued operations. Mr Marcus Margulies, chairman, said the group's luxury business had had an outstanding year. Luxury items now accounted for 80 per cent of operating profits, compared with 20 per cent from the volume operations, which include Sekonda watches. Last March the group paid Pounds 11.9m for Judith Leiber, an American designer of luxury handbags and evening bags sold at between Dollars 1,200 and Dollars 4,000 (Pounds 820 to Pounds 2,740). It also bought the North American distribution rights for Audemars Piguet, the Swiss watchmaker, for Pounds 2m. The two acquisitions contributed Pounds 13.6m to last year's turnover and Pounds 1.57m to operating profits of Pounds 9.15m (Pounds 6.34m). Mr Margulies predicted that near-term growth would come predominantly from expanding the Judith Leiber brand beyond the US. The group was already supplying two outlets in Thailand. The group had also opened a luxury watch showroom at Judith Leiber's premises in New York. It holds agencies for seven luxury watchmakers including Blancpain, Vacheron Constantin, and Audemars Piguet. Since the year end it has purchased 78 per cent of the marketing company for Audemars Piguet in Switzerland - which Mr Margulies described as 'a real feather in our cap'. Net interest receivable fell from Pounds 2.12m to Pounds 728,000. Earnings per share rose 14 per cent to 15.8p (13.9p). A proposed final dividend of 5.5p takes the total for the year to 8.5p (7.95p). COMMENT The strategy of concentrating on luxury brand names appears to be bearing fruit. Taking non-recurring items out, profits were ahead by 12 per cent - a good underlying performance - and the group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 10.9m. If the management's faith in the expansion possibilities of the Judith Leiber brand is realised, further strong growth can be expected. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.5m this year would put the shares on a prospective multiple of 16, which looks fair value.</p>

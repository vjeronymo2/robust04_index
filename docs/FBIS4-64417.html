			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lale Sariibrahimoglu: "The Greek Lobby Is </F> Influential in the United States"]    [Text] Ankara--Ankara says that for Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller to make concessions on the Cyprus problem is out of the  question yet Washington is making an effort to fulfill the  radical Greek lobby's expectations. Ozdem Sanberk, under  secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has said that  "talks can be held on the new proposals on the condition that  the balance between the two sides is not disrupted." Meanwhile,  Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in  Cyprus, has begun his contacts in Ankara.    In a statement to CUMHURIYET regarding reports that Ciller  has made a concession to President Clinton on the Cyprus  problem, Sanberk denied speculations of a difference of opinion  between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister's  Office on Cyprus. In response to a question on whether the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs was bypassed when Ciller decided to  send Ambassador Volkan Vural to Nicosia to hold talks with Rauf  Denktas on the new UN proposals during the weekend, Sanberk  said: "That is a move that the prime minister has decided to  make."    Regarding Ciller's visit to the United States, Sanberk said  that she made no statement that can be regarded as a  "concession." He stressed: "A concession has not been made.  Clinton's remarks that important developments will take place  in Cyprus in a few days can be regarded as a statement that was  prompted by the radical Greek lobby's pressure. The prime  minister has said nothing different from the views officials  have expressed for a long time. She explained that Turkey  wishes to have the Cyprus problem solved. Considering the Greek  lobby's pressure, the United States wishes to create an  expectation in the world. That may not be a deliberate U.S.  policy. The information we have received indicates that the  prime minister has not made any promise on the Cyprus problem.  However, the Greek Cypriots, the Greek lobby in the United  States, and Greek officials have tried to create an expectation  of a concession by the Turkish Cypriot side. Clinton's remarks  were aimed at satisfying the Greek lobby."    Recalling that Turkey is maintaining a policy that is aimed  at finding a just and durable solution to the Cyprus problem,  Sanberk said: "Prime Minister Ciller's remarks in the United  States do not conflict with Turkey's policy. On the contrary,  they are within the framework of Turkey's policy. Everyone  supports the solution of the Cyprus problem. However, everyone  talks about concessions when the question of solving that  problem is mentioned. The government is accused of planning to  make concessions to get rid of that problem. That approach is a  simplification of the matter. Our view on the solution of the  problem is that the two communities should hold talks between  them and find a solution. Considering Rauf Denktas' policy, we  have supported the original form of the package of  confidence-building measures. We have not supported the changes  that have been made in it in favor of the Greek Cypriots. The  policy we have maintained on that has not changed."    Sanberk also said that the UN officials have submitted  several proposals under the title "draft views" since February  and that Denktas has assessed them. Stressing that talks can be  held on the new proposals on the condition that the balance  between the two sides is not disrupted, Sanberk said that Joe  Clark's visit to Turkey was made at his request. He said that  it had not been planned before the recent developments.</p>

This is part of the framework of the new work agreement  that was initialled day before yesterday.The management intends  to finish the massive layoff process by the beginning of 1994.  Now that the agreement has signed, the treasury will transfer  the money that will make it possible to pay November's salaries.    According to the new agreement, hundreds of workers will be  laid off, in all the AI plants and in the top leadership. Those  50 and over, will leave the company in the framework of early  retirement, while workers under 50 will go as part of a round of  layoffs with compensation. The management decided yesterday to  open a counselling center for laid-off workers. This center will  try to help them find alternative work and also advise them on  how to invest their severance pay.    The treasury has committed itself to funding the layoffs of  all 2,900 workers, and for that, will be transferring  approximately $330 million to AI's accounts, in accord with the  rate the layoffs are carried.    The AI management began yesterday preparing to pay debts  amounting to $70 million to the company's suppliers and  subcontractors. They are also preparing for a similar settlement  with the banks, which the company owes $500 million. The company  will finish the year with an operating loss of about $70  million. The total loss will be much greater, because it will  include the severance payments and the early pensions for those  who have been laid off.</p>

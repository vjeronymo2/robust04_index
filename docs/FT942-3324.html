			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Clinton outlines Dollars 9.3bn plan to reform welfare programme President Bill Clinton yesterday outlined a reform package intended to turn the US social safety net into 'a paycheque, not a welfare cheque'. The reform proposals, expected to cost about Dollars 9.3bn (Pounds 6.2bn) over five years, are intended to expand education, training and childcare for the poor. But they are also aimed at those who have received welfare benefits for more than two years. Such recipients would enrol on a work programme in return for payments. Presenting his plan in Kansas City, Mr Clinton said: 'We propose to offer people on welfare a simple contract: we will help you get the skills you need, but after two years, anyone who can go to work must go to work - in the private sector if possible, in a subsidised job if necessary, but work is preferable to welfare and it must be enforced.' A relatively modest portion of the US social safety net would be affected by the proposals, which are an attempt by Mr Clinton to keep his 1992 campaign promise to 'end welfare as we know it'. The main target is Aid to Families with Dependent Children, a programme for parents with young children. It is virtually the only federal government programme paying cash benefits to healthy people who have exhausted their unemployment benefits or have never held a job. AFDC pays an average of Dollars 376.88 a month to about 5m families, depending on how much each state pays to supplement the federal portion. Under the plan, anyone who has turned down a job or has not made adequate efforts to look for work could have payments halted. The reforms will affect recipients born after 1971. The White House estimated that by 2000, fewer than one welfare recipient in 12 would be enrolled in the mandatory work programmes. However, the scope of the programme, likely to be substantially changed in Congress, has already been halved. That is because US budget rules require additional spending on areas such as welfare to be offset by higher taxes or by cuts in other such programmes. Mr Clinton has ruled out higher taxes. Mr Clinton's pledges on welfare during his election campaign helped to label him as a 'new kind of Democrat' and win back some of the middle-class voters who had deserted his party for former president Ronald Reagan. But welfare reform has been postponed again and again to leave room on the congressional agenda for the more ambitious reform of the healthcare system. There have been many suggestions in Washington that the timing of publication of the reform plan has been influenced by the desire to appease Senator Daniel Moynihan, the chairman of the Senate finance committee, seen as crucial to Mr Clinton's healthcare plan.

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Way out of the time warp - Recommendations for a new approach to litigation On the eve of publication of the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, set up two years ago after a damaging series of miscarriages of justice, the Bar and the Law Society have produced a damning indictment of the civil justice system. The verdict of a joint committee of barristers and solicitors, led by Ms Hilary Heilbron QC and Mr Henry Hodge of London solicitors Hodge Jones &amp; Allen, is that civil justice in England is trapped in a Dickensian time warp. Victorian court buildings remain unmodernised. The use of new technology is negligible - virtually all court documents and records are compiled manually. Court procedures are technical, inflexible, riddled with rules and often incomprehensible to litigants. The language of the law is wordy, archaic and littered with unintelligible and largely irrelevant jargon. Delay is widespread, leading to ever increasing costs, and frustrating the efficient conduct of commerce and industry. This verdict is all the more worrying as it comes just two years after the implementation of the government's reforms to speed up and improve the efficiency of civil justice by streamlining the jurisdiction of the High Court and county courts. Companies involved in litigation find it a protracted, cumbersome and increasingly expensive exercise. The cost of a two-year commercial dispute culminating in a one or two-month trial can run into millions of pounds. Yet litigation is on the increase. The Centre for Interfirm Comparison, an independent research group, says that on average London law firms reported a 25 per cent growth in litigation in 1992, on top of an average 43 per cent rise in 1991. Given this unpalatable fact, few businesses will be happy to learn from the Heilbron/Hodge report that much blame for the expense of resolving commercial disputes lies with the civil justice system. They will therefore welcome the report's conclusion that there is an urgent need for 'a radical reappraisal of the approach to litigation' in England and 'for many of the deeply ingrained traditions to be swept away and replaced by pragmatic and modern attitudes and ideas'. The report makes a number of suggestions for change in the civil justice system: restructuring the High Court, widespread introduction of new technology, the creation of more specialised courts such as the commercial court, and simplified procedures and court documents, expressed in plain English. But by far the most significant suggestion for achieving this shift in approach is the recommendation that the government should establish a pilot scheme for Alternative Dispute Resolution in one or two civil court centres. ADR has its origins in the far east, where it has been used for more than 30 years, and in the US. The Heilbron/Hodge report estimates that about 10 per cent of cases in the US are now resolved by ADR. About one-third of American states now have comprehensive plans for court-based ADR and there are approximately 1,200 ADR schemes receiving referrals from state courts. Some US schemes indicate a settlement rate as high as 50 per cent, and a substantial number of courts have introduced rules requiring lawyers to inform their clients of available ADR processes early in the litigation process. ADR takes various forms: mediation, conciliation or mini-trial. But common to all these forms is the fact that they are non-binding; if ADR does not work, or resolution proves impossible, the parties are still free to litigate. In the UK, where ADR commonly takes the form of mediation, companies have slowly begun to embrace the concept. Since the Centre for Dispute Resolution (CEDR), an industry-backed, non-profit-making organisation, was set up in 1990 to promote the use of ADR in the UK, almost 250 disputes involving more than Pounds 800m have been referred to it. Of these, 25 per cent went on to complete formal ADR processes. The centre estimates that more than Pounds 30m in potential legal costs has been saved - and considerably more than that, if the saving in management time is included. But, despite these signs, and support from industry and consumer groups such as the National Consumer Council, ADR has not yet had the impact in the UK that it could have. Dr Karl Mackie, the CEDR's director, believes that part of the reason for the slow take-up of ADR is the 'traditional adversarial mindset and culture of lawyers and clients in litigation'. The Heilbron/Hodge report agrees. 'The legal system and those who participate in it have shown a marked reluctance to take advantage of its potential benefits,' it says. For ADR to work in the UK and produce savings for the civil justice system, it needs to be extended beyond commercial disputes to cover all civil litigation, in particular personal injury actions. This means that it will require government support, as the majority of personal injury actions are brought by legally aided plaintiffs. Some time ago a group including the Bar, the Law Society and the CEDR proposed to the Lord Chancellor's department that a court-annexed ADR pilot scheme be run in Bristol. The proposal was not taken up - largely, it seems, because in the current economic climate the government is reluctant to increase public expenditure on legal aid by extending it to ADR processes. It is also worried about the lack of evidence that ADR could produce savings for the legal aid fund by encouraging the earlier settlement of cases. The Heilbron/Hodge report believes the government's fears are overplayed. If ADR produces earlier settlement of a dispute than would otherwise be the case, the saving in costs can be substantial, it says. Even where ADR only succeeds in narrowing the issues at dispute, rather than achieving a settlement, costs can be saved. And if costs to the legal aid fund can be saved by ADR, then the case for extending legal aid to cover ADR processes is unanswerable. In the end, the report says, the only way the Lord Chancellor and the Treasury will be satisfied that ADR can produce savings is to generate enough data to allow a proper evaluation. And the only way that can be achieved is by establishing a pilot scheme at one or two court centres. If the government wants long-term savings, it must expect some short-term expenditure, Ms Heilbron says. The establishment of a successful court-annexed ADR scheme can only encourage the development of ADR in other spheres. The Commercial Court is considering the introduction of a form of court-annexed mediation that is likely to prove popular with its foreign clients. A City Disputes Panel for banking and financial services is being set up and should be in operation this year, providing both mediation and arbitration services. But, without government support, the civil justice system will continue to be denied the overall benefits and savings that ADR can bring.</p>

All engine mount brackets require replacement with improved design engine mount brackets at the next engine removal after the effective date of this AD. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracks in engine mount brackets on engines that have completed at least one overhaul cycle. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent engine separation from the aircraft due to cracks in the engine mount brackets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective July 5, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 5, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Teledyne Continental Motors, P.O. Box 90, Mobile, AL 36601; telephone (205) 438&hyph;3411. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Jerry Robinette, Aerospace Engineer, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, 1669 Phoenix Parkway, suite 210C, Atlanta, GA 30349; telephone (404) 991&hyph;3810, fax (404) 991&hyph;3606.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) IO&hyph;346, IO&hyph;520, and IO&hyph;550 series piston engines was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 20, 1993 (58 FR 54072). That action proposed to require initial and repetitive dye penetrant inspections for cracks in certain lower left engine mount brackets, Part Number (P/N) 630695. If the lower left engine mount bracket is found cracked, that proposed rule would require replacing both the lower left and lower right engine mount brackets with improved design engine mount brackets, P/N 653306 and 653305, respectively. If a crack is not detected, the lower left engine mount bracket would require repetitive inspections at intervals not to exceed 500 hours time in service (TIS) until the next engine removal, at which time engine mount brackets, P/N 630694 and 630695, would be replaced with improved design engine mount brackets, P/N 653306 and 653305. Installation of these improved design engine mount brackets would constitute terminating action to the inspection requirements of that AD. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with TCM Service Bulletin (SB) No. M92&hyph;13, dated September 4, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the one comment received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter supports the proposed rule but states that the interval for the repetitive inspections should be reduced from 500 hours TIS to 100 hours TIS. The commenter states that if the bracket is found broken, the airframe engine mount and surrounding areas should be inspected for damage and the upper brackets and all bolts and nuts should be replaced as they may be overstressed. The commenter further states that the pilot should visually inspect the brackets on each preflight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with the recommendation to reduce the repetitive inspection interval to 100 hours TIS. Data provided from the manufacturer indicates that the repetitive inspection interval of 500 hours TIS is sufficient once the initial inspection is satisfactorily completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with the commenter's recommendation to inspect the airframe engine mount and surrounding areas for damage and to replace all bolts and nuts if the bottom brackets are found broken. Once the bottom brackets are broken, there is essentially no load being transmitted to the lower airframe structure. In addition, a structural analysis of the bolt strength indicates that with only the two upper mounts securing the engine, safety factors exceed required values for normal category ``g'' loading. Therefore, none of the bolts and nuts should be overstressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with the commenter's recommendation to require the pilot to visually inspect the brackets on each preflight. Based on the data presented above, the FAA has determined that it is not necessary to inspect the brackets on each preflight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

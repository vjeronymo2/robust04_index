			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ST. LOUIS' DURHAM, OAKLAND'S BANDO FILE FOR FREE AGENCY  </P> <P> Oakland catcher Chris Bando and St. Louis first baseman Leon Durham filed for  free agency today, leaving a record 90 free agents available.  </P> <P> There would have been one more, but Tim Teufel, who had filed earlier, agreed  today to a new contract with the New York Mets.  </P> <P> The deadline to file was 1 p.m. EST and the 90 free agents topped the previous  record of 89, set in 1977. The deadline for filing also was the time clubs  could begin to make monetary offers to free agents.  </P> <P> Jim Rice, who was eligible for free agency, did not have to file because the  Boston Red Sox placed him on waivers today. Rice, who has spent his entire  15-year career with Boston, will become a free agent without compensation  Thursday.  </P></p>

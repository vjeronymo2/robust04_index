			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Further clarity on pension rights - European Court The European Court of Justice last week decided six cases involving the application of the Rome treaty's equal pay rules (Article 119) to occupational pension rights. The judgments complete a series of decisions explaining the 1990 Barber ruling on sex discrimination in pensions. The historical context of the judgments is that the ECJ first held that the equal pay rule could be enforced by employees against a private sector employer in the Defrenne case in 1976. The court limited that judgment's retroactive effect. In 1986 it went on to rule in Bilka that the right of access to an occupational pension scheme was subject to the equal pay principle. But it did not limit this ruling's retroactive effect. Then, on May 17 1990, the ECJ confirmed in Barber that contracted-out occupational pension schemes were subject to the equal pay principle. Accordingly, retirement age discrimination was prohibited. But the Court limited its ruling to the future, save for prior claims by employees or those claiming under them. In three cases decided at the end of 1993 the ECJ clarified the scope and effect in time of Barber. In Ten Oever, it held the equal pay principle applied only to benefits payable in respect of employment periods served after May 17 1990, except for prior claims. It also said survivors' pension rights were covered by the Barber rules. In Morroni, the Court said that the Barber principles were not limited to UK contracted-out pensions but covered occupational pension schemes outside the social security system and not benefiting from public finance. In Neath, the ECJ ruled that the use of actuarial factors differing according to sex in funded defined-benefit pension schemes fell outside the equal pay rule. The six cases decided last week fell into two groups. The first concerned primarily the pension rights of full-time employees, their dependants and successors against pension scheme trustees. These cases confirmed the principles established in the three 1993 rulings but also dealt with outstanding issues on pension trusts, equalisation methods and related questions. The Court ruled: Employees and their dependants may enforce their rights to sex equality against trustees of an occupational pension scheme. Where national law limits the power of action of employers or trustees in a way inconsistent with the equal pay principle, they are bound to use all the means available under domestic law to eliminate sex discrimination, including recourse to the courts to seek amendment of the pension scheme or trust deed (themselves governed by national law). For periods of service after equalisation of pension rights, the retirement age of women may be increased to that of men. Mitigation of lost benefits for women is not allowed. For periods of employment post Barber but before equalisation, the disadvantaged sex must be given the same benefits as the advantaged. For periods before Barber, the benefits enjoyed by the favoured sex must not be retroactively reduced. Single sex schemes are outside the equal pay rule. The same principles apply to a civil service occupational scheme which may not discriminate against married men. Cases C-200/91 Coloroll, C-408/92 Avdel Systems, C-7/93 Beune and C-28/93 Shell, ECJ FC, September 28 1994. The second group concerns the right of access of married women and part-time workers (most of whom are women) to occupational pension schemes. These cases confirmed the Court's earlier decisions dating back to 1976. They also established that neither the limitation in time of the effect of Barber nor the parallel provision in Protocol 2 on Article 119 of the Rome treaty (added by the Maastricht treaty) affects the rights of employees to enforce the equal pay rules in the context of access to pensions. However, the ECJ confirmed that national limitation rules apply to claims made by employees and that, when the schemes are contributory, part-time employees must make backdated contributions. Cases C-57/93 Vroege and C-128/93 Fisscher, ECJ FC, September 28 1994. BRICK COURT CHAMBERS, BRUSSELS.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This afternoon NATO Secretary General Manfred  Woerner gave an exclusive interview to Laszlo Mecs, DUNA  Television's Brussels correspondent. The topic of their  conversation centered on information that appeared in certain  papers over the weekend about NATO reconnaissance planes staying  in Hungary's airspace and their role in settling the Bosnian  crisis.    [Begin Woerner recording, in English fading into Hungarian  translation] First, allow me to state that the information I  have heard up till now is misleading and does not represent the  official NATO stance. Now I will outline our organization's  official stance:    What NATO is doing is not a war maneuver; it is only  supporting and asserting those prohibitive resolutions the  United Nations has taken. These two resolutions are No. 781 and  No. 816, which prescribe a military ban for entire nations and  regional organizations.    What NATO is doing is to help the UN implement what it has  decided. What Hungary has done, and is doing now as well, is to  support the realization of the UN resolutions. I say once  again: This is not a war maneuver, but an entire humanitarian  action the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] are undertaking in  Bosnia. This activity is not directed against any single side,  but towards all those who violate the region's peace. Allow me  to explain it this way.    At the same time, I do not doubt for one moment that  cooperation between the Hungarian Government and NATO is  anything but excellent. We both respect the other's activity.  Hungary is an independent nation. It can decide to cooperate,  and it could also decide not to do so. We are satisfied with  what your country has done, and we would like to continue to  cooperate with your country. We have no doubt that our  relations will continue in the future as well, since this is in  the mutual interest of our organization and of your country.  [end recording]</p>

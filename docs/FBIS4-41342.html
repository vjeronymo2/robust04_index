			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Belikov: "Foreigners Invited To Work in </F> Moscow"]    [Text] A special directive from Moscow's mayor establishes  new rules for attracting and exploiting the foreign work force  in the capital.    Henceforth an employer who wishes to attract foreign workers  to Moscow must first apply to the city government departments or  committees corresponding to his line of work and convincingly  justify the need to "import" outsiders. A ruling on the  appropriateness of such an action will be delivered to him  within 30 days.    If a positive ruling on the possibility of giving work to  foreigners is obtained, the employer is to put down a sort of  pledge for every worker invited, equivalent to the cost of the  worker's return fare to his country of permanent residence.  This measure is being introduced in case Moscow's  law-enforcement organs need to deport the foreigner as an  undesirable alien in those extreme cases which, unfortunately,  happen quite often. If nothing of the sort occurs and the  foreign worker returns to his home country in the normal way,  the pledge is returned.    The capital's Main Administration of Internal Affairs Visas  and Registrations Administration registers the arrival of  foreign workers and the city's statistical service keeps a  permanent record of them. The number of foreigners invited is  determined according to the corresponding quotas established for  the number of foreign citizens as a whole and the total number  per professional group that can be hired for work in Moscow.  Permits to attract a foreign work force are issued by the  Russian Federal Migration Service according to the ruling of the  Moscow government. A permit is granted to an employee for a  period of up to one year; he cannot transfer this permit to  other persons or organizations; nor can he transfer the foreign  workers to another place. It is of no little importance that a  payment of one month's minimum salary is to be made to the city  budget in return for permits for each worker.    The foreigner can work on Moscow territory only when he has  obtained a document from the city's migration service --  confirmation of the right to labor activity, which can be  obtained only as a result of an application from an employer and  only within the permitted quota. Exceptions are made for highly  skilled foreign specialists invited to take up leading posts in  enterprises with foreign investments, and also diplomats, major  scientific and cultural figures, priests, correspondents and  journalists accredited in our country, and some higher education  students and specialists.    The first survey of the number of foreigners invited to work  in Moscow is scheduled for 1 August.</p>

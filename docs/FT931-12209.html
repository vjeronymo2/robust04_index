			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Offshoots in US 'face tax probe' THE INLAND Revenue is targeting UK companies with subsidiaries that pay high US tax bills, a leading tax practitioner alleged yesterday. Mr Terry Symons, a partner with Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, said Revenue officials appeared to be systematically investigating multinationals with high US tax bills to see if they should be paying more in the UK. His concerns follow discussions with the Revenue about one of his clients under investigation, but he said he was told by senior officials that this was part of a wider effort to collect more tax. His statement comes in the week President Bill Clinton has reiterated his intention to clamp down on foreign corporations which he claims are paying less tax than their US competitors. A 1991 analysis - the most recent available - by the US Internal Revenue Service showed that UK companies paid substantially more tax than many other foreign and US companies. US-owned companies paid a total of Dollars 94bn (Pounds 62bn) in 1988, amounting to 1.1 per cent of receipts and 0.6 per cent of assets. For UK-owned companies, the proportions were 1.2 per cent and 0.6 per cent. They were much lower for Japanese, German and Dutch companies. Mr Alan Reid, a tax partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, said much UK investment in the US was through the purchase of existing companies. There was much more scope for transfer pricing - which might reduce US tax bills - for other foreign countries which simply sold goods manufactured overseas. Other IRS figures suggest that UK companies are paying three to four times the levels of tax paid by other foreign companies in comparable industry sectors. The Inland Revenue said it would not discuss its tax investigation tactics.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TAX CREDIT OFTEN GOES TO THE INELIGIBLE  </P> <P> As much as 40% of a special tax benefit for low-income families with children  is being claimed by ineligible people, the Internal Revenue Service estimated  Friday.  </P> <P> As part of its audit program, the IRS found that in 1985, $818 million of the  total $2.1 billion earned-income credit went to those who were found to be  ineligible.  </P> <P> Credits totaling $6 billion are expected to be claimed this year by more than  10 million working families.  </P> <P> The credit was enacted in 1975 to reward low-income workers who hold a job  rather than rely solely on welfare benefits. At that time, the credit was  viewed as basically an offset against Social Security taxes.  </P> <P> For 1990, the credit is for 14% of the first $6,810 of wages and other earned  income, a maximum benefit of $953. The credit drops as wages rise, and is  eliminated once income reaches $20,264.  </P></p>

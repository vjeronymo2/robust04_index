			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Travel: An unforgettable night in a room in Mandalay - After a Chinese meal with a German doctor, Mark Hodson extricates himself from a tricky situation at the Hotel Venus Burma is not famous for its nightlife, and with just cause. At 9pm the one TV channel closes down after showing exactly three hours of state propaganda and marching band music - after which you can wander out and find all the restaurants shut. It was a Saturday night in Mandalay, city of kings and Rudyard Kipling. I was sharing a room at the Hotel Venus with a German doctor and we had eaten Chinese at Min Min Restaurant followed by strawberries and vanilla scoops at the Nylon Ice Cream Bar. We would have gone to a bar but there are none. We returned to the room to find that the air-conditioning had packed up and the boy downstairs was playing old Rod Stewart videos over the hotel cable system. We were resigned to another game of chess when there was a knock on the door and two young Burmese men, grinning and stripped to the waist, asked if we would like to come next door for a drink. It sounded rather dubious, so we thought it best to decline. 'We do have some cold beer in the fridge,' one said. Inside, their room looked like a battle-ground. It was strewn with every possible discarded bottle and food carton. On each of the two beds sat a girl in T-shirt, shorts and high heels, both about 17 years old, wearing gormless grins. The boys cleared a space for us on one of the beds by sweeping some rubbish on to the floor. They poured some beer and told us their names, ignoring the girls, who just giggled. Clearly they had not been invited for their dazzling conversation. The boys told us they were in Mandalay to sell rubies. They lived in Mogok, a mining village in the mountains to the north, an area off-limits to foreigners. Business, said one, raising a glass, was very good. I had seen something of the ruby trade at a place called Taung-gyi, about eight hours out of Mandalay. The gem market on the edge of town was a raucous den of sharks and smugglers: hill-tribe men, Bangladeshis, Indians and Chinese. As I dodged between the tightly-packed stalls where crowds huddled over piles of uncut stones, I found myself instinctively clutching my money belt. But in a country so poor and almost entirely deprived of western goods, I had never seen such ostentatious wealth: chunky gold necklaces, designer labels, fistfuls of dollars. As one of the boys topped up my glass the door opened and in walked two Indian men. One was tall, a little awkward, the other short and powerful, about 45, with piercing eyes and a face as hard as any I have seen. A striped green shirt strained to contain his thick arms, and around his neck hung a thick gold chain. He took us in with a glance, then fired some questions at the boys in a language I did not recognise. Then he turned to us with a cruel smile. 'Like these girls?' he asked. 'Very nice,' I said diplomatically. In fact they were quite ugly. Despite their puppy fat, they looked as though they had worked more nights in seedy hotel rooms than they had eaten hot dinners. And they were becoming a nuisance. One had moved behind Axel, the German, and was trying to massage his shoulders; the other sat beside me with one hand across my leg. One of the boys asked me: 'Have you used a Burmese lady yet?' I said no. He asked why not. 'Er, perhaps I haven't met the right girl yet,' I said. I was thinking this would be a good time to leave when the door opened again and in walked two more men, a tall bearded Indian and a Burmese boy of about 14 with a shaved head. It was getting to be quite a party. The newcomers stood admiring their unexpected guests as we made polite conversation about the ruby business while I kept one eye on my drink. I was wondering whether it was spiked, and was keeping a hand on my leg to ward off the prostitute. Suddenly, Axel leapt up from the bed as if he had sat on a cattle prod. 'OK, where is it?' he yelled. There was silence, and a little nervous fidgeting. 'Someone has got my wallet. I felt it taken out of my pocket. Now where is it?' Axel was furious, his voice rising and his German accent thickening. I thought: I should have seen this coming. Our hosts looked stunned and indignant, spluttering denials. Axel moved towards the door, saying: 'No one leaves here until I get it back.' I drained the last of my beer and held on to the glass. I knew what had to be done. I had seen enough movies. I would break the end off the glass and thrust it into the tough guy's face. What would happen then I had no idea. Slowly I stood, not scared, just disappointed that an interesting evening had to end like this. The Burmese boys remained slouched on the other bed, their grins barely flickering. The hookers seemed to notice nothing amiss. The three Indians regrouped slightly in the middle of the room and the skin-head made a dash for the door where Axel stopped him. Axel was still ranting, the Indians insisting on their innocence. Things seemed to be coming to a head. I suggested a compromise: Axel would go next door for two minutes while they had a last look around for the wallet. If it turned up we would all be friends again, no questions asked. They agreed. Axel left, while I stood by the door feeling foolish and trying to act as if this sort of thing happened all the time. Suddenly, Axel reappeared clutching his wallet. 'So sorry] It was in the room all along,' he announced with a big smile. The Indians were furious and the little tough guy ran at us shouting and swearing in Hindi and English. How dare we insult him, did we not know he was a very, very rich man? 'Look at this ring,' he said, shaking a fat fist in front of our faces. On one finger was a band of huge rubies set in gold. My heart sank. I was filled with shame. Axel seemed too delighted at recovering his wallet to notice danger. He even suggested another drink. I tried to cool the situation, explaining that we were stupid tourists, a little drunk maybe. It had been a long day. The tough guy was bouncing up and down with rage, veins bulging on his face. Above all he seemed upset at the implication that he was down on his luck and needed the money. As Axel grinned, I carried on grovelling. The tall bearded Indian calmed things down by clutching his chest, saying: 'Oh my God, I was so scared, my heart was going boom, boom, boom. But you must understand this cheating is not the Burmese way. In India someone will rob you. In London too. But in Burma - never.' I knew he was right. The Burmese people were just too sweet-natured. This was the country where village children blew kisses at tourists instead of asking for money, and waiters in restaurants used the menus to fan diners as they ate. Finally we left, backing out with our tails between our legs, shaking hands with everyone twice and then a third time. As we fumbled with the door key the tough guy followed us into the corridor and for a second, fear once again gripped my stomach. But his face cracked open with a smile: 'Are you quite sure you don't want to borrow the girls tonight?' Return flights to the Burmese capital, Rangoon, from Bangkok cost around Pounds 150 and it is now possible to fly direct from Chiang Mai in northern Thailand to Mandalay. The government of Burma, now renamed Myanmar, has recently been issuing four-week visas which take two working days to process in Bangkok. On arrival, foreigners must change Dollars 300 into non-refundable foreign exchange certificates. However, their value on the black market is almost the same as cash: around 100 kyats to the dollar, against the official exchange rate of six. Burmese hotel standards are acceptable, although most are expensive by Asian standards.</p>

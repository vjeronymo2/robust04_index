			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Swedish nuclear repairs to take three weeks SWEDISH power utility firm Sydkraft said yesterday that emergency repairs to the cooling systems of four faulty nuclear reactors would take three weeks, Reuter reports from Stockholm. Sydkraft said the closures, ordered by Sweden's national nuclear inspection board on safety grounds, could cost it up to SKr20m (Pounds 2.1m). Two of the boiling water reactors are at Sydkraft's fully owned Barseback plant in the south-west, and two at the half-owned Oskarshamn on the east coast. The oldest of Sweden's 12 nuclear reactors, they were built between 1972 and 1977 by ABB Atom, now a unit of Swiss-Swedish power and engineering firm ABB Asea Brown Boveri. A fifth reactor at Ringhals owned by state-controlled Vattenfall AB was also ordered closed.</p>

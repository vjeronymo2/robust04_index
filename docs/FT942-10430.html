			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Bank warns on interest rates and inflation: Concern at increase in average earnings and monetary growth The Bank of England warned yesterday that it would increase interest rates if expectations of higher inflation led to a quickening in the pace of wage and price rises. In its latest quarterly inflation report, however, it said the most likely outcome, assuming bank base rates stay at 5.25 per cent, would be for underlying inflation to be between 3 and 3.5 per cent in two years' time, within the government's target range of 1-4 per cent. The bank believes underlying inflation, which is measured by excluding mortgage interest payments from the retail prices index, will be slightly higher in April, May and June than the 2.4 per cent rate in March. Inflation fell in the first three months of this year because of a squeeze on retail margins but is set to rise because of council tax changes and the imposition of value added tax on fuel, both of which took effect in April. Over 1994 as a whole, the bank expects inflation to be slightly lower than projected in its February inflation report. But the bank revised upwards its forecast of inflation next year. It now expects the rate to be flat rather than move gently downwards. The bank has revised its expectations of inflation because of two factors: February's quarter-point cut in bank base rates and a faster than expected increase in average earnings. 'If these (labour cost) pressures are maintained, this could translate into higher inflation next year,' the bank warned. The bank pinpoints three 'small early warning signs': Rates of monetary growth have continued to increase. Although this is not a threat to the inflation target at the moment, a continued increase in the months ahead would have 'more disturbing' implications. Inflation expectations have risen and are no longer coming down into line with the target. Average earnings growth accelerated to 3.5 per cent in February from 3 per cent in November and may have been higher in March. The bank is worried that higher inflation expectations will trigger higher wage settlements. It said pay developments 'will need to be monitored closely' and urged 'adherence to a firm monetary stance' to reinforce the 'fragile' credibility of Britain's inflation target. The bank's report leaves the clear impression that it regards the February cut in base rates as a mistake. 'The rise in gilt yields after that announcement suggested that the market was revising its view of the authorities' commitment to monetary stability,' it said. Responding to the bank's report, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, last night told Channel 4 News he was 'determined to hit the inflation target' and have economic growth that lasts.

He said that this committee seeks to  boost the Israelis' morale, because the fate of the Israeli  prisoners in Lebanon is known to everyone. He added that  international parties intervened and are aware of their fate.  However, he said that the talks should have focused on the fate  of hundreds of detainees held in the enemy prisons, particularly  in al-Khiyam, where the prisoners suffer enormously.    Shaykh Qasim said: It's unreasonable that the fate of  aggressors is discussed, while the fate of innocent people, who  were detained in their homes and who are defending this land, is  not discussed. Therefore, we see no need to meet with any  committee because it is part of the campaign to promote Israeli  topics rather than resolving the issue of the prisoners and  detainees in Israeli prisons.    Shaykh Qasim emphasized that Israeli pilot Ron Arad has  never  been held by us nor do we know his fate or his whereabouts.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: PNC pays Dollars 240m for BlackRock PNC, the Pittsburgh-based institution which is already the biggest bank in the US mutual fund business, is to acquire BlackRock Financial Management in a deal which brings it Dollars 23bn in assets under management. The bank has agreed to pay Dollars 240m in cash and notes for BlackRock, which was launched only six years ago with backing from Blackstone, a venture capital group. The firm, which manages fixed income investments, handles more than Dollars 10bn for mutual funds, according to Mr Dick Caldwell, a PNC executive vice-president. These mutual funds are underwritten and distributed by other firms, such as brokers, rather than by BlackRock itself. The balance of BlackRock's investments are managed for insurance companies, pension funds and other institutions. The acquisition will leave PNC with around Dollars 75bn under management, making it one of the biggest fund managers among US banks, although it will still be behind big institutional fund managers such as JP Morgan and Bankers Trust. Another Pittsburgh bank, Mellon, is in the process of acquiring the Dreyfus mutual funds group in a deal which would put it head and shoulders above other banks in this aspect of the investment management business. Dreyfus has more than Dollars 70bn under management, while PNC currently manages Dollars 20bn of mutual fund money, virtually all of it in money-market funds.</p>

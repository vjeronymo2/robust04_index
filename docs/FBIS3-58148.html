That statement came after a meeting in the office of Rome  Prosecutor Vittorio Mele that included Assistant Prosecutors  Michele Coiro and Ettore Torri, the officials who questioned  Broccoletti yesterday in Regina Coeli prison.    While the prosecutors, citing judicial secrecy, did not  "correct" press accounts in detail, sources close to that office  described as "not true" today's newspaper reports of a 10  billion lire transfer to the Christian Democratic party from  Sisde secret funds, which leaks said Broccoletti had alleged.    That alleged payment was given considerable prominence by  several dailies, which deduced that the "political party"  referred to in leaks had to be the Christian Democrats -- based  on the fact that party has had exclusive control of the Interior  Ministry (which Sisde answers to) since 1946.    After Wednesday's [5 January] extradition from Monte Carlo,  Broccoletti talked to prosecutors about the reported Sisde slush  fund, alleging there had been a top-level cover-up -- also  involving President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro -- of the breaking  Sisde scandal.    Those charges, inexplicably leaked to the press with  rapidity  and in detail despite procedural secrecy rules, were given lead  prominence in today's Italian press, touching, as they do, the  figure of President of the Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, in  what some called a move to delegitimate the country's highest  authority just as elections were about to be called.    According to at least one paper, Broccoletti was said to  have  told the prosecutors that three top-level cover-up meetings took  place from December 1992 to late spring last year, as evidence  of the misappropriation of at least 14 billion lire by Sisde  officials including Broccoletti began to surface. The first was  allegedly attended by then premier Giuliano Amato, all three by  Scalfaro and Interior Minister Nicola Mancino, as well as police  chief Vincenzo Parisi, who all reiterated yesterday that the  charges "had absolutely no foundation."    Talking today with journalists, prosecutor Michele Coiro,  said that while the overall investigation of the Sisde scandal  is "quite complex," there is "one thread of that investigation  that is nearing the point where we can ask for a formal  indictment." He said that the charge would probably be for  embezzlement, and that the investigation would continue to  follow other leads.    Broccoletti is expected to be questioned again on Monday,  when he will be asked about how Sisde managed funds in the  period before Riccardo Malpica was appointed to head the  intelligence service.    As for the questioning of Gerardo De Pasquale, former Sisde  officer taken into custody yesterday, authorities said that  would probably take place tomorrow.</p>

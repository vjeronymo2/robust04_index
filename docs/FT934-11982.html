			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: European prices tumble on heavy futures selling EUROPEAN bond prices tumbled in hectic afternoon trading, following heavy selling in the futures pits. Traders reported large sell orders from US hedge funds, some of whom were seen not only to liquidate their long positions but also to open short positions in many European markets. This caused futures prices to breach key technical support levels, triggering stop-loss selling. Weakness in the US Treasuries market put further pressure on prices. AFTER successfully absorbing a record bond auction, the UK gilt market fell more than a point in sympathy with other European markets. The auction of Pounds 3.5bn 6 per cent gilts due 1999 was well received. According to Mr Ifty Islam, economist with Merrill Lynch, the bid-to-cover ratio of 1.56 times on such a large issue indicated good overseas buying, in addition to solid domestic demand. The tail - the difference between the highest accepted yield and the average accepted yield - was short at only one basis point. Prices edged higher after the auction announcement, but tumbled across the board when the December long gilt future broke key support at 114 5/8 to close at 113 29/32 . BUNDS also slid sharply, though outperforming many of their European counterparts on switching into Germany. However, sentiment was damped by comments from the Bundesbank president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, that there was no need at present for lower rates, and the larger-than-expected liquidity drain at the central bank's latest repo allocation. The December bund contract fell 0.36 point on the day to 99.78. Traders now are eyeing key support at 99.65. FRENCH bonds were rattled by worries that the French government's privatisation programme could come under threat, casting gloom over the outlook for public finances. Switching into bunds caused the French 10-year yield spread over bunds to widen to 12 basis points from two on Tuesday - its highest since late July. ECU bond prices fell  5/8 point, but some traders said the market could rally if the European Community takes up a proposal by French president Francois Mitterrand to launch an Ecu100bn bond programme to finance public infrastructure in order to stimulate the European economy. Mr Mitterrand said he would make the proposal at this week's EC summit in Brussels. Such a programme could reawaken interest in the market, which has languished since the first Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty last year. EUROPE'S higher-yielding markets were especially badly hit by the sell-off. The Italian BTP futures contract on Liffe plunged 1.23 point to 116.33. In Spain, the December bond contract fell 0.68 point to 113.00. JAPANESE bonds were cheered by the successful auction of Y1,000bn 3.9 per cent government bonds and by switching into bonds from stocks as the Nikkei index fell below the important 20,000 level. The JGB contract rose 0.22 point to 114.20. US TREASURY prices eased slightly at both ends of the maturity spectrum yesterday after a stronger-than-expected durable goods orders report. In late afternoon trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1/4 at 103 13/16 , yielding 5.998 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  5/32 at 99 25/32 , to yield 3.974 per cent. Prices weakened during the morning in response to the durable goods figures. Although orders rose only 0.7 per cent in September, in line with expectations, the headline number masked a big rise in non-transportation orders. Other factors contributing to the declines were comments from Mr Robert McTeer, a senior Federal Reserve official, who warned that the central bank would tighten interest rates at the first sign of revived inflation, and nervousness ahead of today's third-quarter gross domestic product figures.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Political turmoil may slow Mexican recovery: Business confidence is tumbling and interest rates are rising sharply The prospect of a rapid recovery in Mexico's economy is receding after a series of blows to business confidence and a sharp rise in domestic interest rates. The government has officially forecast growth of 3 per cent this year. But officials now say that this may be too optimistic. The increase in US bond-yields, and political turmoil following the peasant uprising in Chiapas and the murder of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, have pushed up short-term interest rates to over 14 per cent, and are expected to reduce private-sector investment. 'The recovery expected for the second quarter could now be postponed to the third quarter,' said one senior government official 'If this (political uncertainty) goes on for much longer, the consequences could be worse.' Most private sector economists have recently cut their estimates for growth. Mr Ernesto Cervera, of the consultancy GEA, says the economy will grow by about 2 per cent this year, from an earlier estimate of 2.4 per cent. Mr Rodolfo De la Torre, of the Centre of Analysis and Economic Investigation has cut his forecast from 4.1 per cent to 3.5 per cent, and says he may reduce it further. The expectation of low growth has contributed to a 25 per cent fall in the Mexican stock market, from its high of early February, as analysts have cut estimates for earnings of leading companies. The decline has forced some companies to put off equity offerings, due to finance investment. A weak economy could spell trouble for Mexico's governing party, which faces presidential elections this August. Last year Mexico's economy expanded by just 0.4 per cent, and in the final two quarters growth was negative. Opposition to government policies has grown as unemployment has increased, and business profits have fallen. The slowdown has caused a shift in government thinking on economic policy in the recognition that obstacles to growth and inefficiencies in the economy are greater than once thought. The campaign platform of the governing party puts much greater stress on industrial policy, legal reform, employment generation and income redistribution than has the administration of President Carlos Salinas. The government expected a significant pick-up in economic growth this year based on an increase in public spending and expansion in private sector investment. Last year private investment all but dried up, largely because of high real interest rates, uncertainty that prevailed over the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the unwillingness of many banks to lend money because of problems with non-performing loans. But the uncertainty over the North American Free Trade Agreement has been replaced by concern over the electoral and political process this year. The uprising in Chiapas followed by the assassination of Mr Colosio has left some wondering whether Mexico is facing a period of sustained political upheaval, which could affect the business and economic climate. Such fears seem to have increased after the government's special investigator concluded that seven people conspired to kill Mr Colosio, including an official from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in charge of security at the rally at which the candidate was killed. Speculation over who ordered Mr Colosio's death has over-shadowed the campaign of the PRI's new presidential candidate, Mr Ernesto Zedillo. The political uncertainty has coincided with higher US bond yields, which have made Mexican debt instrument less attractive to foreign investors. Both events have forced up Mexican interest rates. In this week's auction short-term rates on 28-day paper rose to 14.31 per cent, compared to 8.81 per cent in late February. Inflation is expected to fall under 7 per cent this year. Mexico is particularly vulnerable to perceptions of political risk and high US interest rates because of its need to finance a current account deficit that last year reached Dollars 23.4bn, and is expected to be still more this year. The government is formally committed to a stable exchange rate, and therefore cannot increase trade competitiveness through a one-off devaluation. The administration nevertheless argues that once the uncertainty is resolved, prospects for growth are high. In its annual report, the Central Bank points to buoyant exports, the steady rise in manufacturing and sound public finances as reasons for optimism. Such a view may turn out to be correct. But after waiting more than five years for the fruits of pro-market economic reforms of President Salinas, many Mexicans are becoming impatient.</p>

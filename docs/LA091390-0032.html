			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: IN THIS WORLD, DOUGHNUTS ARE AN AFTERTHOUGHT  </P> <P> The sign over the door reads: "Since 1968." And the photos plastered all over  the walls of Donut World in Capistrano Beach indeed elicit fond memories of the  late '60s.  </P> <P> The "decor" is especially nostalgic for surfers who can remember the break at  Killer Dana and the huge waves that once cascaded down in the now-calm waters  of Dana Point Marina.  </P> <P> Most of the folks who line up at the counter of this rustic little eatery every  morning and lunchtime aren't there to examine the photos, however. And most  order a doughnut (from among the nearly two dozen different varieties  available) only as an afterthought.  </P> <P> In the morning, the breakfast sandwiches are the hot item. Bacon and egg,  sausage and egg and the standard BLT are handed over hot off the grill on your  choice of toast. All are priced at $3.10 or under. The bread and fixings are  fresh and the result is a delicious handful of breakfast to go.  </P> <P> If you've got a few minutes to spare and the appetite, the full-fledged  breakfast plates are worth the time and effort. There are a few tables inside  and a few more outside, but when $3.45 will get you two eggs, four pieces of  bacon, toast and crisp hash browns, seating location is not a prime concern.  </P> <P> Come lunchtime, the special is the popular choice. It includes a killer of a  cheeseburger, a choice of fries or egg roll -- that's right, egg roll -- and a  soft drink, all for $3.  </P> <P>  Donut World, 34852 Doheny Park Road, Capistrano Beach. Open Mondays through  Saturdays 5 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sundays till 3 p.m. (714) 496-2454. JOHN WEYLER  </P></p>

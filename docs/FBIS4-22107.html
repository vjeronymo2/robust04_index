After studying the file, it became evident that the  investigation into the church bombing has solved the following  crimes:    1. The crime of the assassination of Engineer Dany Sham'un  [leader of the National Liberals Party] and his family in B'abda  on 21 October 1990.    2. The crime of blowing up the car of Minister Elie Hubayqah  and the killing of his companion in al-Ashrafiyah in 1991.    3. The crime of the assassination of Dr. Ilyas al-Zayik in  al-Ashrafiyah in 1989.    This is in addition to other crimes, which, together with  the  church bombing, remain under investigation.    The case of the assassination of Dany Sham'un and his family  was immediately referred to the judicial investigator, Judge  Munir Hunayn, together with the Appeal Prosecution Office's  charge of attacks on the state's internal security, which  resulted in the death of Engineer Sham'un, his wife, and two  children. Orders for the arrest of the following were issued:    Hanna al-'Atiq, Robert Abu-Sa'b, Kamil Karam, Milhim Haddad,  Marun Ghanim, Tony Musa, Walid Ja'ja', Rafiq Sa'adah, Fadi Sa'b,  Simon Khiryati, Khalil Wakim, and Ilya Irz, who have been  referred by Judge Furayhah. All of them belong to the Lebanese  Forces' intelligence service.    The judge also ruled that orders for the arrest in absentia  of those who were proven to be involved by the investigation  carried out by Judge Furayhah be issued. They are: Ghassan  Tuma, Tony 'Ubayd, 'Atif al-Habr, Jean Shahin, Jean Samiyah,  Farid Sa'adah, Elie 'Awwad alias Juliano, Tony Sim'an, Naja  al-Qaddum, George al- Fighali, Ilya 'Aqiqi, and Francis 'Aqiqi.

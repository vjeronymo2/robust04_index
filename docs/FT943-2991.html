			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Public pay bill 'to rise 2% despite freeze' The public-sector pay bill for this year is likely to rise by at least 2 per cent in spite of the government's desire for a freeze, says a leading pay analyst. Mr Chris Trinder, research director of the Public Finance Foundation, said large areas of the public sector, particularly education, were likely to have significant overruns. His comments follow confirmation by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, of the government's desire for a further year's freezing of the public-sector pay bill. Mr Clarke, in his written submission to the pay review bodies, which cover about 1.4m of the 5m public-sector workers, indirectly criticised last year's relatively high pay review body settlements. He said: 'The government remains concerned that cumulatively over the years review body settlements have more than matched most other public-sector groups.' Yet the submission also stressed flexibility. 'Recommendations should take account of the particular circumstances of each group and the need to promote the development of performance pay and other flexibilities as appropriate,' he said. Mr Trinder said yesterday that the public-sector pay bill rose 1 per cent last year in spite of the fact that pay rises were limited to 1.5 per cent and 327,000 jobs were shed. This year the average pay rise in the public sector is likely to be about 2.5 per cent and job losses are likely to be considerably below last year's figure. Mr Trinder said: 'That means it is almost certain that the increase in the pay bill will be well above last year's' The government has relaxed its original ban on cross-subsidising pay bill increases from general running costs, which means that the pay bill overrun is likely to hit services. About 58 per cent of public-sector running costs are wages. Mr Trinder said the public-sector pay bill freeze appeared to be becoming more rather than less flexible. He also warned that a growing divergence between public and private-sector pay could create recruitment problems in the public sector. Last year, when the public-sector pay bill rose only 1 per cent, the private-sector pay bill rose 3.9 per cent. Real wage growth - on top of inflation - averaged 1.4 per cent during the 1993-94 pay round, covering both the public and private sector. That was lower than the 2.2 per cent for 1992-1993 but higher than the 1.25 per cent average of the previous three years. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, yesterday accused the government of picking on public-sector workers.</p>

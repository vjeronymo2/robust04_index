			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SENATE MEDFLY BILL DIES WITH HELP FROM COUNTY DELEGATION  </P> <P> Orange County senators, some representing people outraged by repeated aerial  sprayings of malathion, were either absent or voted against a proposal last  week that would give their constituents added time to sue the state for health  problems related to use of the pesticide.  </P> <P> Without support from the Orange County delegation, the proposal by Assemblyman  Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) fell three votes short of the 21-member majority  needed for approval by the upper house. But backers of the bill said the  measure will likely be revived.  </P> <P> State health experts have repeatedly said the aerial spraying of malathion to  eradicate the Medfly in Orange County and other parts of Southern California is  not endangering public health, although the pesticide is known to ruin the  paint on cars left uncovered during the applications.  </P> <P> Roos and other anti-malathion legislators contend, however, that the experts  have been wrong in the past -- as in the cases of Agent Orange, Thalidomide and  asbestos.  </P> <P> And they want to give residents ample time to sue the government and malathion  manufacturers if medical problems are eventually traced to the pesticide.  </P> <P> The Roos bill does that by changing the deadline for filing such suits, which  under current liability law is up to a year from the date the malathion is  actually sprayed on the ground. The measure would extend the deadline to a year  after an illness or a death is linked to the malathion spraying, no matter how  long ago the aerial application was made.  </P> <P> Of the Orange County delegation, only Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk) voted for  the measure. Voting against it were Sens. Ed Royce (R-Anaheim) and Marian  Bergeson (R-Newport Beach).  </P> <P> Bergeson and Royce said Friday they voted against the measure because they do  not believe malathion poses a health problem and because the extended deadline  would open the door for frivolous lawsuits against the state.  </P> <P> "California has too many lawsuits and too many lawyers, and this measure  (would) cost taxpayers with frivolous lawsuits," said Royce, whose central  Orange County district includes Garden Grove and Anaheim, two communities that  have been sprayed.  </P> <P> Although Royce said he does not believe the spraying poses a health threat, he  is pushing his own solution to stop the aerial application -- the use of  sterile Medflies. The Royce bill, yet to come to the Senate floor, would spend  $1 million to produce an additional 250 million sterile flies for possible  release in infested areas.  </P> <P> Bergeson said she was also afraid the Roos measure would provide an "avenue for  constant litigation, and frankly that's an expense and hassle that the state  doesn't need right now.  </P> <P> "I would support the bill if there is information that malathion poses that  threat," she said. "But all of the information we have been given -- and we've  had document after document, and testimony -- says that malathion in the doses  that are administered is not dangerous and not a threat to human beings."  </P> <P> Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) did not vote on the malathion bill Thursday  because he left the floor to catch a plane to Los Angeles for a televised  debate with Bergeson, his opponent in the Republican primary for lieutenant  governor. He said Friday that, although he has some questions about the  measure, he would likely support it when it comes up for reconsideration.  </P> <P> "I have no problem whatsoever with the portion of the bill that gives extended  time" for the lawsuits, he said.  </P> <P> Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) was also recorded as absent or abstaining on the  measure. Calls to his office Friday were not returned.  </P> <P> Roos said he is "very disappointed" in the no-shows or no votes from Orange  County senators.  </P> <P> "Their counterparts in the Assembly are itching to vote on a bill to get  themselves on the record against spraying or to say that we want an insurance  policy in regard to these experts, who say there are no health risks," Roos  said.  </P></p>

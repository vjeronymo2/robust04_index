			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 10/5/1994 -- In the evening of  10 May President Ion Iliescu of Romania offered an official  dinner in honor of Albanian President Sali Berisha and of the  delegation that accompanied him on his visit to Bucharest. On  this occasion Presidents Ion Iliescu and Sali Berisha held  toasts.    In his toast, the head of the Romanian state said that  "after  the instatement of democratic regimes in our countries,  favorable conditions were put in place for the Romanian-Albanian  relations." In his opinion, the political treaty and the other  cooperation documents to be signed during the Albanian  president's visit express the political will of the sides for a  fruitful long-term cooperation.    Mentioning Romania and Albania's concern about the conflict  tearing apart the former Yugoslav space, the head of the  Romanian state said: "It is sad that momentary circumstances,  generated by the dismemberment of former Yugoslavia, that  certain resentments, some of them probably motivated, should lie  at the root of a tragedy and be now the greatest hurdle in the  way of a political settlement in the area." The Romanian  president underlined that Romania pronounces for a rational and  responsible attitude on the part of all the leading factors in  the area so that confrontation is renounced. President Iliescu  pleaded for further support to the efforts of the international  community in achieving peace. "The alternative to peace, to  dialogue is cannot be but the extension of the conflict with  enormous suffering for the peoples of former Yugoslavia and the  risk of involving other states," the president of Romania said,  who also reiterated Romania's "firm support for the actions  directed towards finding a political solution, for the  reinstatement of trust and understanding." "We wish to give the  Romanian-Albanian relations a new impetus, to act in such a way  as to forge exemplary economic, political, cultural, and  spiritual ties between our peoples," the president of Romania  also said.</p>

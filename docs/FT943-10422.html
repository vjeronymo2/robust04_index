			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Businessman to be put on trial in China Mr James Peng, a Chinese-Australian businessman, was charged with corruption at a Shenzhen court yesterday, nine months after he was detained, the Hong Kong China News Agency said. If found guilty, he faces a minimum prison term of 10 years and possibly the death penalty. 'The people's procuratorate of Shenzhen City has finished the investigation of Peng Jiandong (his Chinese name), the former chairman of Shenzhen Yuan Ye Company,' the Beijing-controlled agency said. The charges stated that between February and June 1989 Mr Peng embezzled Dollars 1.4m (Pounds 915,000) in loans from a Chinese bank. He is accused of switching the funds, apparently borrowed to finance corporate investments in Australia, to his personal account, using part to pay for his family's emigration to Australia. His wife, Mrs Lina Peng, says the Dollars 1.4m was spent on investment in Australia on behalf of Champaign Industrial Holdings. A textiles, property and trading group and the first Sino-foreign joint venture listed on a Chinese stock exchange, it was formed by converting Shenzhen Yuan Ye into a joint venture controlled by Mr Peng's Panco Industrial, a Hong Kong-registered private company. 'The investment made on behalf of Champaign had nothing to do with the Peng family emigration to Australia, which took place subsequently. Mr Peng emigrated on the strength of his personal funds and these were not part of the Dollars 1.4m,' Mrs Peng added. She has urged the Australian government to ensure her husband (who has not been allowed to hire a lawyer nor been given any opportunity to defend himself) has a fair trial in China. Mr Peng's plight began last October, when he was picked up from the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Macao by police and handed over to the Chinese police. Canberra has raised the case with Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji. Mr Peng appears to have attracted government attention through his business dealings. In early 1992, after an abortive attempt to sell Panco (then the owner of about 51 per cent of Champaign), Mr Peng was negotiating with the Shenzhen office of the People's Bank over the sale of nearly half of Panco's interest in Champaign. Mr Peng says these talks were called off by the Shenzhen government and, subsequently, the central bank. Champaign's bank accounts were frozen and the People's Bank stated no bank would be allowed to realise its security against Panco's mortgaged Champaign shares, rendering previously secured loans unsecured and prompting the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) to sue Champaign for recovery of a Yn20m (Pounds 1.5m) loan. Last September a meeting of Champaign shareholders, alleged by Mr Peng to be inquorate, voted to confiscate Panco's shareholding in the company and divide it between Shenzhen Municipal Development (Holdings) and Hong Kong China Project.</p>

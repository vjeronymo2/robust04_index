			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: Italian recovery gathers pace The Italian economy has begun to move from a timid recovery to sustained growth. Industrial production figures and the latest official survey of industrialists' opinion shows the export-led recovery has begun to include a modest element of renewed domestic demand. According to Istat, the state statistics institute, industrial production in May was up 7.5 per cent on the same period the previous year. During the first five months as a whole industrial production was 2 per cent higher than in 1993. Production of office equipment was up 14 per cent. Robert Graham, Rome. In later editions of the FT yesterday, a graph on page 2 mistakenly referred to Italian bond yields and not, as it should have done, to bond prices.</p>

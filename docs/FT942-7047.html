			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / MP urges probe of utility regulators Mr Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee, has called for a royal commission to examine the performance of utility regulators and the effectiveness of different regulatory regimes. Mr Caborn, a Labour MP, said regulation had become 'a substitute for policymaking, with crucial decisions left in the hands of unelected and unaccountable regulators'. He said areas which needed to be covered included the accountability of regulators; the feasibility of streamlining the various agencies, particularly in the energy sector; the role of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the Office of Fair Trading; and the case for widening the regulatory role to include the right to review spending on research and development. Fierce competition will remain in world coal markets until well into the next century, Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said yesterday. However by the mid to late 1990s, prices agreed in contracts with generators will be truly competitive with contract prices of imported coal delivered to inland power stations.</p>

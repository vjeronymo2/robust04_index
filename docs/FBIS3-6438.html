			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The U.S. Department of Transportation has refused  to allow the Japan Air Lines to inaugurate a regular  Sendai-Honolulu flight. Commenting on the refusal by the U.S.  Department of Transport at a news conference on 17 March,  Michihiko Matsuo, administrative vice minister of the Transport  Ministry, criticized the U.S. Department of Transportation,  saying, "Japan has the right to ask the United States to allow  the inauguration of such a new regular flight for the Japanese  airline in accordance with the Japan-U.S. Aviation Agreement."  As for Japan's countermeasures, including restrictions on  flights by American airlines to Japan, he said, "What we have to  do first is to continue to ask the United States to go along  with our request for opening the regular flight." In this way,  he made clear that Japan will not think of taking any  countermeasures against the United States for the time being.    The Japan Air Lines planned to inaugurate its first  Sendai-Honolulu regular flight on 17 March, but it hurriedly  shifted to a charter flight. The chartered airliner with 275  passengers aboard left Sendai for Honolulu on the evening of 17  March.</p>

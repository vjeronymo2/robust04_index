			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent in Paris Eldad Beck] </F>   [Text] Until midday today, the Israeli delegates spoke of  serious difficulties the economic talks were encountering, but  now Finance Minister Avraham Shohat, who heads the delegation,  speaks of a possible crisis. According to Shohat, the  Palestinians presented new demands during this week's talks. He  has informed chief Palestinian delegate Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad  Quray'] that these demands are unacceptable and that they are  liable to result in a very serious crisis in the economic  negotiations.    Shohat asserted that the Palestinians want to expand the  list  of products whose customs Israel has consented to reduce. The  original list has been doubled by the Palestinians, and it now  includes goods to be imported from countries which do not trade  with Israel, namely Arab countries. We cannot agree to such  things, Shohat said; the import regime must be uniform.    There is no telling whether the Israeli verbal escalation  was  designed to produce psychological pressure on the Palestinians.  In any event, the negotiations will continue through the night.  Tomorrow the finance minister will return to Israel to attend  the 24 April cabinet meeting. He will fly back to Paris  straight after the meeting. The Israeli delegation will stay in  the French capital to continue the talks with the Palestinians.</p>

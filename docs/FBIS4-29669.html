			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Concern Over Deregulation"] </F>   [Text] The great concern, despite the resounding positive  reactions, aroused by the May 19 deregulation of foreign  investment is quite understandable. The move opens wide areas  of public utilities such as sea and air transportation,  seaports, drinking water, railways and power generation and  distribution to direct foreign investment. The hiccup was made  even stronger because the mass media industry itself was opened  to foreign majority ownership in violation of the Press Law of  1982.    Several analysts, including noted economist Kwik Kian Gie,  have argued strongly that opening public utilities and services  to foreign investors is contrary to Article 6 of the Foreign  Investment Law of 1967. We think however, the article still  allows foreign investment in those public utilities, not in the  form of wholly-owned ventures, but through joint ventures with  domestic interests. The article completely bans foreign  investment only from the production of weapons, ammunition,  explosive materials and other war machinery.    Nonetheless, the reactions and concern we have heard so far  were, by and large, not so much against foreign investors'  involvement in the sector of public utilities, but rather  questions as to how the government would control and manage the  public utilities owned by foreign businessmen.    The questions, to a certain extent, are legitimate. Similar  to upstream industries which strongly influence the performance  of downstream plants, pubic utilities have a far-reaching impact  on both the business sector and the general public. It is  perhaps also quite difficult for the general public to imagine,  for example, that seaports can now be owned and operated by  foreign entities.    Despite these legitimate concerns, we nevertheless think it  is too early to presume that the latest policy measure is  detrimental to the public interest. In fact, judging from our  experiences with the control or monopoly wielded by our own  private sector over some industries, we cannot say that it would  have been better to only open those public utilities to domestic  private investors.    On the other hand, foreign ownership or management is not  automatically inimical to the public interest as the case of our  customs inspection of imports has shown. The transfer of the  customs inspection authority from our Customs and Excise Tax  Directorate General to the Swiss Societe Generalede Surveillance  (SGS) in 1985 has fully achieved its objective and satisfied  both the government and businessmen. The government has been  satisfied because under-invoicing and over-invoicing practices  have been minimized. Businessmen have been pleased with the  much smoother flow of imports and the much lower import costs.  So great has been the SGS performance that businessmen are now  worried because SGS is being phased out of Indonesia's customs  inspection.    We think the government is capable of preventing or  minimizing any potential damage of the foreign investment  liberalization. As we noted in this column over the weekend,  Government Regulation No.20/1994 regarding the foreign  investment liberalization has yet to be translated into  technical directives or guidelines through ministerial decrees.  The technical directives can be designed to safeguard our  national interest and to ensure that the measure will attract  more foreign capital and channel the foreign investment to  improve economic efficiency, job creation, transfer of  technology and skills as well as export promotion.    We therefore ask the government not to overreact to the  concern over the foreign investment liberalization. Doing so  might prompt the government to make the technical directives so  complex and arduous as to nullify most stipulations of the  regulation itself. It is most important to make the directives  clear-cut and the process of licensing foreign investment in  public utilities fully transparent to prevent the impression  that the deregulation was designed mostly to benefit particular  domestic private companies with strong political connections.</p>

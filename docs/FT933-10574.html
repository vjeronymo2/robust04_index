			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices in London jump to 2 1/2 -year highs COFFEE PRICES leapt to their highest levels for nearly two and a half years on the London market yesterday after a light frost hit some growing areas in Brazil and Latin American exporters agreed details of their new cartel. The November futures price for robusta - the new second position - touched Dollars 1,104 a tonne, its highest level since March 1991, before easing to close at Dollars 1,074, up Dollars 31. The initial rush to buy was mirrored in New York, where the December arabica contract reached a peak of 81.15 cents a lb in early trading before easing to 79.9 cents later, up 0.85 cents. Fund and speculative buying as well as trade interest fuelled the rise in London, surprising traders who had expected little change in prices. The unexpected cold spell in Brazil, the world's largest producer, affected parts of the southern state of Parana where only 10 per cent of the coffee is grown, and appeared to be short-lived. There were no initial reports of damage to trees. Uncertainty about the effect on next year's crop, however, excited a market already bullish about the possibility of tighter supplies following the Latin American export retention scheme agreed at the end of last week. 'We've had a good rise on the market and technically and fundamentally it may have done enough for the moment,' said one trader, adding that the implications of the Latin American plan had already been largely absorbed. Latin American producers, anxious to lift prices after the collapse earlier this year of talks on reviving the international coffee export quota system, agreed their new scheme would run from October 1. They plan to hold back 20 per cent of exports if the indicator price set by the International Coffee Organisation remains below 75 cents a lb. If it rises to between 75 cents and 80 cents they will retain only 10 per cent, while for a rise between 80 cents and 85 cents they will neither hold back stocks nor release those retained. A price of 85 cents a lb or more would trigger the release of stocks on to world markets, with a new management committee deciding when and how this should be done. The ICO price is currently just below 62 cents. 'They're coming up with a very realistic plan and not setting their sights too high in terms of prices,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodities analyst with London broker GNI. 'But there's still a question mark as to how long it can last with producers alone and how consumers will react.' The Latin Americans, accounting for more than 50 per cent of world production, will take their scheme to a meeting of the world's main coffee exporters in Kampala on August 16 and 17. Consuming countries' responses should become clear at the International Coffee Organisation meeting on September 16.</p>

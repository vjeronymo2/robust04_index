			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Different pay deals for Channel train drivers Sir, Due to a misunderstanding, your report, 'Aslef wins 30 per cent pay rise for Channel train drivers' (January 13) confused two agreements reached by my union. Annual salaries of between Pounds 20,500 and Pounds 25,000 have been agreed for 55 Eurostar drivers working for the BR subsidiary, European Passenger Services. They will take passengers from Waterloo International through the Channel Tunnel to Paris and Brussels. A separate deal has been reached with Railfreight Distribution under which drivers of freight trains will receive a tunnel allowance of Pounds 90 a week, double the current driver only allowance, on top of their BR basic weekly wage of Pounds 210. They will take trains through the tunnel as far as the terminal in Calais. We anticipate that such drivers will be able to earn about Pounds 400 a week in total. Aslef publicised these agreements, which compare with drivers' current average earnings across British Rail of about Pounds 18,000, to show that we intend to negotiate the best possible settlements for our members. Last year's Aslef conference accepted that we may not be able to keep all drivers on a uniform rate of pay nationwide when we face the possibility of having to talk to some 41 different train operating companies under the privatisation plans.

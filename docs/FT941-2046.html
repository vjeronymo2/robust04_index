			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Praise aids civil servants A strong defence of the independence of the civil service from political control was made yesterday by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury. He told a conference organised by the Council of Civil Service Unions that the civil service was 'the tangible expression of the public-sector ethic and an asset of real value. I would be wholly opposed to any change which undermined the enviable reputation of British civil servants for integrity and political independence'. Union leaders at the conference expressed pleasure at Mr Dorrell's comments at a time of mounting criticism about alleged politicisation of the higher reaches of the civil service. Mr Dorrell denied that promotion in the civil service was made through 'political cronyism'. He said: 'It is the strength of the civil service traditions of honesty and independence which make our democracy real. 'The civil service attracts and retains the loyalty of high-quality public servants because they have the assurance that, as far as is possible in any human institution, their prospects will be determined by their abilities.' But he also emphasised the government would continue its policy of contracting out services which would develop their businesses in competition with the private sector. Mr John Monks, the TUC's general secretary, endorsed the call for a new code of ethics to protect civil servants from political pressures and to govern their relationship with ministers.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / People: Royal changes the guard Management changes continue apace at Royal Insurance, as the composite insurer claws its way back to profitability under chief executive Richard Gamble. Peter Sharman is the latest to move upwards as part of a rejigging of senior posts at Royal UK, which sees the departure of managing director Geoff Prince. Sharman, a 48-year-old Lancastrian, has been with Royal since 1961. One of the company's 'troubleshooters', he has headed up problem-prone subsidiaries in Spain and Australasia. He was called back from Australia last August to become Prince's deputy. Prince, 51 and another Royal stalwart, had only been managing director for just over two years ago. He will now pursue a new career outside insurance, leaving as the company's UK underwriting results show the first signs of improvement after two years of heavy losses. Meanwhile, Roy Elms, the underwriting director appointed late last year, sees his responsibilities broadened. He becomes deputy chairman of both Royal UK and Royal Insurance (Global), the subsidiary which underwrites multinational and London market business. Royal's chairman, Sir John Cuckney, has been appointed chairman of Royal Insurance (Global). Separately, at Royal Life Estates, James Chapman has been appointed financial services director. Phillip Raw takes over as professional services director and Bill Willetts becomes human resources and general services director.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE GROUP WANTS STATE TO PROBE FIREFIGHTER PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> A coalition of Glendale homeowner associations has asked the state to  investigate whether a countywide force of firefighters responded efficiently to  a hillside blaze that destroyed 46 homes and damaged 20 others in the city on  June 27, a spokesman for the coalition said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Some activists have charged that many homes were lost in neighborhoods  neglected by firefighters until well after the flames had spread. About 350  firefighters from numerous departments battled the fire.  </P> <P> The Glendale Homeowners Coordinating Council, representing 15 homeowner  associations, asked that Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, along with the state  fire marshal's staff, "conduct a full investigation of all aspects of the fire,  examining the many unanswered questions that have been raised in the manner in  which this fire was fought."  </P> <P> "We've just heard so many negative comments from people whose homes burned and  who felt they weren't helped sufficiently," said Esther Bowen, president of the  College Hills Community Assn., where more than 20 homes were destroyed or badly  damaged by the fire.  </P> <P> Glendale Fire Chief John M. Montenero defended the efforts of firefighters.  </P> <P> "I'm very proud of our department," he said. "Our business is very judgmental.  Yes, there are probably ways in hindsight to do things better, but we don't  know what they are yet."  </P> <P> Montenero said his department's own investigation, to be completed in August,  will be thorough and objective. He said he would be willing to share records  with any outside agency.  </P> <P> But the homeowners said they want an independent probe.  </P> <P> Joe A. Bridges, a spokesman for the coalition, said the letter was mailed last  weekend, with copies sent to Gov. George Deukmejian, State Fire Marshal James  McMullen and the state legislators who represent the Glendale area. The group  made the letter public Wednesday after Bridges had informed Glendale City  Council members of its contents.  </P> <P> One resident, Rob Sharkey, who is president of the Glenmore Canyon Homeowners  Assn., said firetrucks did not arrive in his community of 200 homes until two  hours after the blaze was reported. He said 14 of the destroyed homes were in  Glenmore Canyon.  </P> <P> "They had to know this hill was burning," he said Wednesday. "Why didn't they  send even one truck? Even one truck could have saved some homes."  </P> <P> Christiana Mullen, a spokeswoman for Van de Kamp, said the homeowners' letter  had not been received in Sacramento by Wednesday. She said the office reviews  all such requests, then determines whether an investigation is justified.  </P> <P> Assistant State Fire Marshal Dave Walizer was also unfamiliar with the letter  Wednesday, but he said his office has no authority to investigate local fire  departments.  </P></p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Watchdog claims record savings The National Audit Office, the public-spending watchdog, yesterday claimed to have prevented the Department of Employment and the Welsh Office from wasting millions of pounds in recent years. In its annual report the office said it had achieved record savings of public money last year - in excess of Pounds 266m. Amid growing concern about accountability and efficiency in Whitehall, Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general, stressed there would be no let-up in the number of scrutinies carried out by his organisation. The report says that in 1991-92, the Employment Service, an executive agency, made Pounds 30m of overpayments in unemployment benefit. As a result of the watchdog's findings, the discrepancy had been reduced to Pounds 9.6m by 1992-93. It also claims to have discovered a discrepancy in the 1992-93 Welsh Office accounts which showed it had erroneously paid Pounds 963,000 of community charge grant to four local authorities. The Welsh Office has since recovered this money. National Audit Office Annual Report. 157-197 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1W 9SP.</p>

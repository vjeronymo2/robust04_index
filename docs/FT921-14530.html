			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM fails to defuse BR privatisation row - Transport MR JOHN MAJOR failed yesterday to resolve the potentially damaging cabinet clash over privatisation of British Rail which threatens to delay yet again the publication of government plans for the sale. After a lengthy meeting in Downing Street chaired by the prime minister, officials said ministers were 'a long way off' deciding between the three options that Whitehall departments are promoting. The row, if not resolved quickly, might embarrass Mr Major deeply in the approach to the general election, when British Rail privatisation is set to be a central part of the Conservative manifesto. Publication of a white paper setting out details of how BR is will be sold has already been delayed twice. The Citizen's Charter promised a white paper by the end of last year. Ministers then promised publication for this week. Downing Street said only that a white paper would be published before the general election - in spite of Department of Transport promises of publication in February at the latest. The Department of Transport has now changed its stance again, saying the top priority of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, was to get the right solution, not a rushed one. 'We can't rule in or out any timings at this stage,' officials said. Mr Rifkind is understood to be putting up a determined fight to defend his department's proposals, but he appears to be losing ground to a rival scheme proposed by the prime minister's policy unit. The Department of Transport wants to sell off BR's profitable InterCity and freight services but keep regional rail networks in the public sector, although they could eventually transfer to private operators. However, under the scheme prefered by Mr Major, BR would be split into regional companies similar to the set up before the Second World War - the so-called 'golden age' scenario. Meanwhile, Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, has proposed a scheme for privatisation which he believes would promoted maximum competition. British Rail's track would be sold to a private operator with private-sector companies competing to provide services. Downing Street was sceptical of a compromise, pointing out that the schemes were not easily compatible. Mr Major told MPs yesterday that the government's aim was to ensure passengers got better services. The Department of Trade and Industry argues that the government should learn from the experience of past privatisations and not simply create private sector monopolies.</p>

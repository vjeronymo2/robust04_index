			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon expands by 12% FIRST-quarter results from Willis Corroon, the largest insurance broker in the UK, improved nearly 12 per cent but the directors are sticking to their dividend cut. They had forecast a reduction of up to 50 per cent in the year's total in March when they halved the first interim to 1.65p. Now they are taking the same action with the second interim. In the 1992 year group profits were pulled back by substantial provisions in its UK insurance subsidiary. In the opening quarter of 1993 further provisions were included in losses of Pounds 2.9m incurred by the discontinued operations. Using a constant exchange rate of Dollars 1.50 to the pound in the quarter, pre-tax profit came to Pounds 47.1m (Pounds 42.1m). The operating profit of Pounds 47.2m (Pounds 39.9m) comprised broking Pounds 42.6m (Pounds 36.5m) and underwriting Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 3.4m). Geographically, that was split as to UK Pounds 34.9m (Pounds 36.8m), the US Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 3.1m) and rest of the world Pounds 1.9m (nil). Earnings per share were 7.1p (6.7p). Profitability of the broking and consulting businesses improved as a result of actions taken over the last two years. On an underlying basis brokerage and fee revenue grew by 2 per cent while operating expenses fell by 2 per cent. Insurance companies in North America made another solid contribution. Results of the discontinued UK underwriting operations were again disappointing, caused by deterioration in the final three underwriting years and further provisions.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Unita to join Angola unity government ANGOLA'S former rebel movement Unita yesterday said it would join a government of national unity and return its forces into a new unified army, but it urged the United Nations to send peace-keeping forces to Angola, Reuter reports from Luanda. A statement by the Unita leadership named appointees for the government and military command offered it by the ruling MPLA last week. The statement also reaffirmed the determination of Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader, to take part in a second round presidential election and demanded that the UN mediate all future disputes between Unita and the MPLA. The statement named three little-known appointees to replace senior Unita officials killed during the war with government forces last month in Luanda, the Angolan capital. General Antonio Sebastiao Dembo becomes vice-president of Unita; General Eugenio Ngolo Manuvokola becomes secretary general and Brigadier Elias Malungo Bravo da Costa Pedro was named as its new representative on a joint commission overseeing last year's peace accord with the MPLA. The Unita statement named Victorino Domingos Hossi as minister of culture.</p>

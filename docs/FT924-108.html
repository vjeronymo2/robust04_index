			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Upbeat signal from business organisations TWO OF Britain's leading business organisations have ended 1992 on a guardedly upbeat note in spite of statistics yesterday showing company failures at a record this year. Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, said the prospects for recovery during 1993 were good provided industry's improved competitiveness was not eroded by higher inflation. Mr Richard Brown, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said business 'should be able to look forward to a healthier 1993'. He forecast that the economy would be in a better state at the end of next year than at the beginning. Their comments came as Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, disclosed a 31 per cent increase in business failures in Britain to nearly 63,000 this year. South-east England, Scotland and Greater London suffered the biggest concentration of failed businesses, together accounting for 54 per cent of all bankruptcies and liquidations. However, Mr Philip Mellor, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's marketing manager, said there were signs that the increase in company failures was slowing down. Although a record 16,222 companies failed in the fourth quarter of the year, the total was only 2.5 per cent higher than in the third quarter. Between the third and fourth quarters of 1991, by contrast, the number of business failures increased by 37 per cent to 14,245. In his new year message to CBI members, Sir Michael said British companies were starting to benefit from the pound's lower exchange rate, lower interest rates and lower inflation, while opportunities were being created by the European Community's single market, US recovery and growth in the Far East and Pacific regions. He warned, however, that UK manufacturers would be able to increase market share only if they kept a firm control of costs, including pay. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in an interview with The Times published this morning, appeared to rule out further cuts in interest rates unless monetary demand and growth were 'manifestly' below the government's targets. However, he was bullish about the economic prospects for next year. Business failures up, Page 4 Lex, Page 12</p>

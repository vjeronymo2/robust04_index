			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Fawlty idea of service A New Year article of mine on the appalling standards of service in too many British shops (Nightmare on Oxford Street, December 30) drew more appreciative comment than any other piece of mine for years. I also received useful tips on places which were an exception to the prevailing mediocrity. So I shall now follow up with some comments on hotel service. These articles are not a diversion. A distinguished economist named Albert Hirschman wrote a book entitled Exit, Voice and Loyalty. Exit is the vital weapon for dissatisfied consumers and workers in a competitive market. Voice is, however, an important supplement. Loyalty comes last and has to be earned. The first sign that I should contemplate 'exit' is when I find only thief-proof hangers. Words fail to describe the inconvenience of these devices, which can only be moved with great effort and on which it is impossible to hang clothes comfortably. How much extra would it add to room costs to make an allowance for the likely loss of proper hangers to hanger fetishists? In the last resort, why not provide as an alternative wire hangers, which cost almost nothing? Nowadays, I normally carry a few, just in case. Another wrong assumption is that because there is a television set (normally unplugged and difficult to operate), radio does not matter. Television addicts may themselves find radio more convenient when getting up in the morning or getting ready for bed. And even when a radio is provided (after I complain to a so-called assistant manager, herself usually a bewildered girl just out of training college) one is almost never able in the UK to get Radio 3, and sometimes not even Radio 4. Rooms are so often too hot or too cold, with no visible means of adjusting the temperature. And sometimes when I do open a window, the structure is so fragile that the glass panes break, thus exchanging equatorial for arctic conditions. Supposedly more modern hotels often have windows which only open by swinging an inch or two from the top. Almost as bad are the windows which are meant either to open this way or to open out fully by a vertical turn, but where it takes much learning and even more elbow grease to move from one mode to another. Many annoying defects merely represent fashions among hotel architects. Somebody in the Bauhaus 70 years ago must have made a remark in favour of flat surfaces, which has resulted in the banishment of useful devices like hooks or even bathroom shelves. One good rule of thumb is that the staff at the desk know nothing about the locality, but regard their period there as a temporary and unwelcome exile from the metropolis. A glance at a train timetable is a rare favour. As for buses, one is looked on as mad for being remotely interested in such vehicles. But it is simply untrue that everyone always arrives everywhere by car. I suppose that to expect enough light to be able to read or write is like asking for the moon - or rather the sun. And there are rarely a chair and simple table at which to write. The worst hotel I have ever stayed in is in Munich. After having painfully negotiated a later departure time there than the 11am one inflicted on visitors, I found that this information was not communicated to the floor. My belongings were packed without any attempt to find me or warn me, and - most unforgivable of all - my telephone was cut off. Behind this behaviour is a detestable habit of mind which expresses itself in sentences such as 'Most people do not mind', or 'Most people don't ask for'. What makes such behaviour possible is that such hotels do much of their trade with business customers, who are out early and in late, and do not spend much time in their rooms. But even such travellers would have a better time if they were not treated as items of merchandise. Consumers of the world unite: You have nothing to lose but a few rude words and baleful stares.</p>

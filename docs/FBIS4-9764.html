			<p>BFN     [Text] Since 1990, the Ministry of Agriculture [Minag] has  relocated approximately 5,000 workers to production and service  positions in Matanzas. That attitude has allowed 70 percent of  workers to be directly involved in the production of goods and  for the rest to be employed in technical, administrative, and  management positions.    Noel Lopez, a Minag delegate in Matanzas, stated that with  the creation of 41 Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's],  work relations have improved even more. He stated that even  though UBPC's have not been created in the pork, fish, and  citrus branches, organizational measures have increased the  number of workers who directly participate in production. He  stated that in Matanzas' citrus sector, 83 percent of the more  than 600 excess workers from various sectors are now directly  employed in agricultural tasks.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Money Markets: Optimism on Germany THERE WAS a modest rise in German futures yesterday after comments from the Bundesbank president suggested a change of attitude towards interest rates, writes James Blitz. In a newspaper interview, Mr Helmut Schlesinger said the Bundesbank had to test how far it could keep cutting interest rates. He added that Germany's economic situation had deteriorated, and that this had to be taken into account in the setting of money market rates. These comments, and expectations of a sharp reduction in the Bundesbank's repo rate at its weekly money market intervention, combined to improve conditions in both the German cash and futures markets. The Bundesbank announced that it would be conducting a variable rate repo in its weekly money market operations today. The lowest accepted repo rate last week was 8.11 per cent. Many dealers expected the rate to fall to below 8 per cent tomorrow. Mr Adrian James, an economist at NatWest Markets in London, said: 'If it comes below 7.90 per cent, that will be taken as a bullish signal that the Bundesbank has moved away from gradual easing to something more aggressive.' The June Euromark contract rose 6 basis points on the day to close at 92.67, while the September contract climbed 13 basis points to end at 93.53. German call money finished a touch easier at 7.57 per cent, from a previous 7.60 per cent. The French franc market was unaffected by the move, with the June contract closing one basis point higher at 91.99. Conditions in the sterling market were a good deal easier. Mr Schlesinger's comments implied that the UK might have more scope to ease policy if it wished. The June short sterling contract moved up six basis points to finish at 93.89. Three-month money closed  1/16 per cent lower at 6 1/16 per cent. The overnight lending rate was seen as low as 5 per cent after a Pounds 1bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England was easily removed by the discount market. However, a continuing raft of good economic data has helped to keep a lid on expectations of a base rate cut. The Confederation of British Industry yesterday said UK companies are enjoying their biggest increase in confidence for 10 years.</p>

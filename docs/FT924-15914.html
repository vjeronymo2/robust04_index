			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): InterCity plucks ideas from the sky - Moves to woo passengers It's amazing how recession concentrates the mind. Faced with the prospect of a Pounds 50m hole in its revenues this year because of a dip in ticket sales, British Rail's InterCity business - targeted, like the rest of BR's train operations, for eventual privatisation - is responding almost as though it was in the private sector already. In an attempt to defend last year's meagre Pounds 2m profit, managing director Chris Green has already instigated a painful bout of cost-cutting. Now he is on the attack with the most aggressive package of marketing measures InterCity has ever deployed. The Boots promotion is back, giving shoppers at Boots stores vouchers that they can trade in for tickets; the existing range of airline-style Apex fares, giving big discounts to those booking more than seven days in advance, are extended to all InterCity journeys of more than 150 miles; and a new Leisure First ticket will offer half-price, first-class travel to people whose journeys away include a Saturday night. But the most interesting innovations are in customer service. Hosts and hostesses, for example, will be on hand at big stations to welcome travellers and help them; on-board trolley catering services will serve all passengers at their seats; and restaurant cars will be turned into bistro-style Express Diners offering much wider choice. Another innovation pinched from InterCity's airline rivals is the planned repackaging of frequent services, such as London-Birmingham and London-Bristol, as InterCity Shuttles. The idea is that passengers setting out from one end or the other of these routes will no longer need to worry about timetables: they will be able to turn up at a designated platform at any hour of the day knowing that a train will be there, ready to depart and with its buffet open. Backing the marketing effort is a slightly baffling television advertisement from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi called InterCity Train Magic ('Welcome to a city,' goes the voice-over, 'a city where the only jams are on the table . . . '). Like the marketing campaign itself, it puts a heavy emphasis on customer service. Of course, the unanswered question in all of this is why Chris Green and his colleagues can be bothered to put such an effort into the business, given InterCity's limited life expectancy in its present form. Then again, Green has made clear that he will vigorously resist any break-up of InterCity as part of the privatisation process. Modesty, however, has so far forbidden him from suggesting who might be running it in the post-privatisation world.</p>

The cable  voices the congratulations of the officers, noncommissioned  officers [NCO's], and soldiers to the brother leader president  and supreme commander of the Armed Forces on the occasion of the  blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth national anniversary of the  Republic of Yemen and also expresses support for the forces of  unity and legitimacy.    The cable condemns what was done by the gang of apostasy and  secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party, led by traitor 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, namely, the declaration of secession, stressing  that it is considered high treason against the homeland, the  unity, and the Yemeni people and that history will not forgive  that gang's crimes against the people and the homeland. The  officers, NCO's, and soldiers in the al-Khurafi camp expressed  their great appreciation for the step the leadership has taken  under brother LIt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to preserve the  homeland's unity and safeguard its gains, which were achieved  for our people under the immortal Yemeni revolution.

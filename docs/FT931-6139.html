			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Aston Martin to boost output with 'cheap' model ASTON MARTIN Lagonda, the maker of luxury sports cars taken over by Ford in 1987, yesterday unveiled a new model intended to quadruple production to 800 cars a year in 1995. The company said the car - named the DB7 - would cost 'less than Pounds 80,000,' which is some Pounds 50,000 less than the cheapest of Aston Martin's present range. First-year production is expected to be around 300 cars. The new model will be built at a separate factory in Oxfordshire by a workforce of 250, instead of at the company's main facilities in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire. The main design and development work on the DB7, which has a top speed potential of more than 160mph, has been contracted out to TWR (Design), part of the Oxford-based TWR group run by Mr Tom Walkinshaw. A new company, Aston Martin Oxford, has been formed to operate the facility at Bloxham, Oxfordshire, in which TWR has taken a 25 per cent stake. The majority 75 per cent is held by Aston Martin Lagonda. The DB7's in-line six-cylinder 3.2 litre supercharged engine, although allocated to Aston Martin's use only, uses a block originally developed by Jaguar but not used. It is expected to be assembled by Jaguar under contract at its Radford engine plant near Coventry. The bodies are to be supplied by Motor Panels, the Coventry-based components group. A wholly-owned subsidiary, Aston Martin sales, has been formed to oversee an expansion of Aston Martin's worldwide dealer network. The cars are to go on sale in Europe initially, starting in April next year, and will go on sale in north America in 1995. Car workers at Peugeot Talbot in Coventry have voted to accept assurances on job security, ending the threat of industrial action at the company's main production plant.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / German state eases grip on the mails Germany's state postal monopoly was weakened further yesterday by an agreement to let private companies deliver shopping catalogues, magazines and advertising material. Mail order company costs - and the volume of domestic letter post handled by the federal service - could eventually be reduced by up to 30 per cent. The first licences will be distributed before the end of the year among the 67 private companies which have already applied, said the economics ministry. The move is a compromise in a tussle between the economics and postal ministries, and was reached yesterday following the intervention of Mr Friedrich Bohl, senior minister in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office. Under the deal, private mass-mailings of 1,000 or more items weighing more than 250g will be allowed from next January. One year later the weight limit will be lowered to 100g. The BVH mail order industry association said it was disappointed by the 250g restriction, claiming only a third of its annual mailings could go through private distribution channels for the first year. It also wanted legally binding assurances that the limit would be lowered to 100g on time. However, the compromise marks a successful end to the BVH lobbying. Mail order companies, which have already registered a joint-venture private postal company, AZD, will be the earliest beneficiaries. During their three-year campaign they claimed complete liberalisation would help reduce their annual postage bill of DM1bn (Pounds 417m) by 20-30 per cent. They also countered warnings that 30,000 federal postal service jobs were at risk with claims that the private delivery system would generate 25,000 places. The state Infopost service, which currently has a monopoly on mass-mailings, last year contributed around DM4.5bn to the state post office's total turnover of DM28bn. The reform is one of the most important liberalisation measures yet in the postal system, and follows the post office's recent award of a contract to the TNT transport multinational to manage a network of 33 new parcel post freight centres under construction at a cost of DM4bn. Despite having facing private competition in parcel deliveries for almost 20 years, the state service still has a 26 per cent share of the domestic market. Other moves under way include the replacement of 500 single-counter official post offices with licensed agencies in private shops and petrol stations. Efforts to counter the erosion of the workforce include a project to offer companies a comprehensive mail delivery service in which post will be delivered to individual offices. The shake-out precedes the first stage of privatisation of the postal service, scheduled for 1998, under which the government will offer for sale 25 per cent of its shares in Deutsche Post, a new joint-stock company embracing all activities of the state concern, which will be established next year.</p>

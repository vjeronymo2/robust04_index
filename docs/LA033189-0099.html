			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT LIMITS LIABILITY OF SCHOOLS IN SEX ASSAULTS  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court, limiting the liability of schools for misconduct by  employees, held Thursday that a school district may not be sued for the alleged  sexual assault by a teacher on a 14-year-old boy.  </P> <P> In a 5-2 decision, the justices ruled that while the district could be held  liable for direct negligence in hiring or supervising a teacher, it was not  responsible for acts that were a clear departure from his official duties.  </P> <P> The employee's personal actions were not related closely enough to his  authority as a teacher to warrant holding the district legally responsible, the  court concluded.  </P> <P> "To impose, in effect, strict liability in this context would be far too likely  to deter districts from encouraging, or even authorizing, extracurricular  and/or one-on-one contacts between teachers and students," retired Justice John  A. Arguelles, participating by special assignment, said in the court's lead  opinion.  </P> <P> The threat of such liability would also inspire rigorous controls on activities  that would "negatively affect" the educational process, and it would make  already scarce insurance even more difficult for financially pressed schools to  obtain, Arguelles said.  </P> <P> The ruling was a victory for school administrators and districts throughout the  state that had supported the Oakland Unified School District in seeking  reversal of an appellate court decision upholding a suit by the parents of a  boy identified only as John R.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the parents had argued that the district should be liable for  damages when an employee improperly uses his job-created authority against his  victim.  </P> <P> The district countered that such liability would be financially "devastating"  on schools. The Assn. of California School Administrators, backing the  district, added that it was illogical and unfair to punish the district while  allowing the allegedly guilty party to escape economic loss.  </P> <P> A separate civil suit by the parents against the teacher is pending, but  criminal charges brought earlier against the instructor have been dismissed,  according to lawyers in the case.  </P> <P> Margaret E. O'Donnell of San Francisco, attorney for the school administrators'  association, said the ruling brought "good tidings" for California schools.  </P> <P> "We have always agreed that if there is negligence, such as failing to properly  screen employees, there should be liability," O'Donnell said. "But a broad  ruling on indirect liability as well would not be good public policy."  </P> <P> The case arose in 1981 when John R., then a ninth-grader at a junior high  school in Oakland, was asked by his mathematics teacher to take part in the  school's "work-experience" program, in which students help instructors grade  papers.  </P> <P> According to the parents, the teacher intimidated the boy into committing  sexual acts with him, threatening to give the youth failing grades if he did  not comply. The boy later told his parents about the incidents. The parents  notified district officials, who informed police.  </P> <P> The parents subsequently brought suit against the district, charging that it  was directly liable for its negligence in failing to supervise the teacher and  "vicariously" or indirectly liable for the teacher's actions against their son.  </P> <P> The high court's ruling on the issue of indirect liability came in a lead  opinion by Arguelles, joined by Justice Allen E. Broussard, and a separate  concurring opinion by Justice David N. Eagleson, joined by Chief Justice  Malcolm M. Lucas and Justice Edward A. Panelli. Justices Stanley Mosk and  Marcus M. Kaufman issued separate dissents.  </P> <P> Arguelles noted that employers were not liable when an employee "substantially  departs" from his duties "for purely personal reasons" but acknowledged that  there were instances where liability had been upheld. In one ruling by a state  Court of Appeal, Orange County was found indirectly liable for a deputy  sheriff's threats to rape a woman motorist.  </P> <P> But the justices rejected the contention that the authority given a teacher  over a student was tantamount to the power of police over the community. "The  authority of a police officer over a motorist -- bolstered most immediately by  his uniform, badge and firearm, and only slightly less so by the prospect of  criminal sanctions for disobedience -- plainly surpasses that of a teacher over  a student," Arguelles wrote.  </P> <P> In dissent, Kaufman, while agreeing it was a "rare case" in which indirect  liability would be warranted, said "this is such a case." Under the  circumstances, he said, "it is unjust not to require that the district share in  the liability for the injuries which resulted."  </P> <P> The district sanctioned the work-experience program in the teacher's home and  did not require that other students or adults be present, he noted.  </P> <P> "In effect, the district-sanctioned program virtually guaranteed that the  teacher could act with impunity, free from fear of interruption or discovery,  fully assured of complete privacy and secrecy," Kaufman wrote. "Under these  circumstances, it is not so unusual or startling that a teacher might seize the  opportunity created by the program to make improper sexual advances toward one  of his students."  </P></p>

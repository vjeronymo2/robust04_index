			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Post Office watchdog raps sell-off plans Government proposals to privatise the Post Office were roundly condemned yesterday by the industry's leading user group, adding to a succession of critical responses in recent weeks. The Post Office Users' National Council, the industry's watchdog, said it was concerned that the government's favoured option for privatisation involved splitting up the postal service, threatening levels of service. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has yet to gain final cabinet approval for legislation to sell 51 per cent of the state-owned utility. But his favoured option is to proceed with privatisation of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce, while hiving off the Post Office's counters division - which is responsible for high street and village post offices - into a separate organisation to remain in the public sector. Mr John Hackney, the council's chairman, criticised Mr Heseltine for failing to offer an option retaining all the Post Office's businesses in one organisation, whatever its ownership. He added that users were also concerned at the lack of detail in the green paper, published this summer, as to the benefits likely to flow from privatisation and on the possible nature of the delivery and counters service. In the green paper Mr Heseltine provided assurances that a privatised Royal Mail would be obliged to retain a nationwide letters delivery service. Hiving off the counters division was intended to reassure rural dwellers that there would be no wholesale closures among the 20,000 village post offices. However, the opposition parties and postal unions have been raising fears that existing post offices and levels of service would be jeopardised by privatisation. Several Conservative MPs have voiced similar concerns, putting the government's small parliamentary majority in question if it decides to proceed.</p>

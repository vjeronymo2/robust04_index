			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Call to plant energy crops: British Association for the Advancement of Science ENERGY EQUIVALENT to 10m tonnes of coal could be produced if all the land used for over-producing food was planted with an energy crop, the British Association meeting in Southampton heard yesterday. A panel of agricultural scientists and economists predicted that fields of willow - grown as fuel crops - would become as much a part of the countryside as wheat and barley, Dr Peter Carruthers of Reading University's Centre of Agricultural Strategy said such crops were unlikely to be viable without a subsidy. With grants under the Woodland Grant Scheme and annual set-aside payments - subsidies for non-food use of farmland - they should, however, 'be viable in at least some farm business circumstances'. The trees would be grown in a system known as arable coppice or short-rotation coppice, where cuttings are planted at very high densities - about 10,000 per hectare - and the first year's growth is cut back nearly to ground level. The multiple stems which grow from the stump would be harvested by machine every three to five years. The wood would then be dried and burned as fuel or fed into gasification plants. Energy crops are becoming established in some other European countries and the UK government is spending Pounds 850,000 a year on research into arable coppicing. Dr Paul Maryan of the Energy and Technology Supply Unit at Harwell, Oxfordshire, who is co-ordinating the government programme, said researchers were testing varieties of willow and poplar under different conditions. Commercial demonstrations were under way on five farms.</p>

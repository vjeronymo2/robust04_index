As has  been reported, [Defense Minister] Werner Fasslabend, Austrian  People's Party [OeVP], and [Interior Minister] Franz Loeschnak,  Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe], suspended the talks  on Tuesday without any results. The contentious issue was the  duration of national alternative service.    SPOe Chairman Vranitzky said the SPOe has already  contributed  so much in terms of improvements and concessions that he does  not understand why the OeVP cannot "take this last step." He  wants to call on Loeschnak to talk with Fasslabend once again,  the chancellor said.    Busek said he would be pleased if Vranitzky gave Loeschnak  new leeway for negotiations.</p>

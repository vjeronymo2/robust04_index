			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marie Pierre Subtil: "France Moves Out of </F> Rwanda"]    [Text] It needed hundreds of thousands of deaths before  French popular opinion took a stand on France's role in Rwanda.  The presence of French soldiers side-by-side with troops of the  Rwandan Government Army, from October 1990 to December 1993, had  been met with general indifference.    When international organizations and the press condemned  this  situation, stating that it was not limited to the protection of  French nationals, their arguments fell on deaf ears. Not once  was this especially bizarre presence the subject of political  debate, and never did the issue become an intellectual hobby  horse.    Now everyone is making France responsible for the massacre  of  moderate Tutsis and Hutus. This outcry is both late in coming  and excessive -- excess that is doubtless due to the irrational  aspect of events and the flagrant barbarism that we would like  to understand and explain.    Nevertheless, France, considered as being "pro-Hutu" because  of the president's support for the murdered Rwandan president,  Juvenal Habyarimana, is in an awkward situation. The proof of  this can be seen in France's sidestepping, in the early days of  the massacre, when it evacuated its nationals as quickly as it  could. Then there was the rejection of France by the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF], which looks likely to win the current  conflict.    The RPF does not even want Paris to supply the equipment of  the Senegalese or Congolese blue helmets. This is a logical  rejection: Comprising mainly Tutsis, the RPF would have  overturned the Hutu authorities at the start of the 1990's had  it not been for the French Army, which opposed it by backing the  Kigali regime. At the height of this support (700 soldiers),  while French public opinion remained indifferent, the experts  were getting all wrapped up in conjecture. They debated whether  it was a question of preserving the French-speaking zone faced  with the expansion of the English-speaking area (the RPF was  backed by Uganda). Should not a Socialist France intervene to  avoid a majority community (Hutus represent 85 percent of the  population) from being subjected to the laws imposed by a  minority? They asked also whether the friendship between the  French and Rwandan presidents was strong enough to permit France  to step in to save the Hutu regime, even though Rwanda is not a  former French colony.    All three proposals are, even today, open to debate. The  third suggestion is the most convincing, however. A real  friendship existed between Francois Mitterrand and Juvenal  Habyarimana. Moreover, on the morning of 7 April, the day after  the Rwandan presidential plane was blown up, the first  instruction issued by the Elysee [office of the president] to  the Foreign Ministry was: Take care of the evacuation of the  president's widow and family.    Ministerial sources say: "The Elysee not only assumes but  also confirms the statement justifying France's intervention in  support of the Rwandan Armed Forces." The Elysee, moreover, in  no way denies its Rwanda policy from 1990 to 1993, and, on the  contrary, justifies its stance by citing the results obtained  from Kigali in exchange for French support: the end of the  party-state and the commitment of the Hutu authorities to start  negotiations with the RPF. Elysee sources confirm: "Without  the presence of French troops, the Arusha Agreement would never  have been signed and the UNAMIR [UN Aid Mission in Rwanda] would  never have existed. How, by implementing this policy, can  France be held responsible for the massacres? On the contrary,  for four years we have tried to avoid it."    And so it was. However, did France really apply all the  pressure it could? In particular, it is surprising that despite  the pressure that was applied, a holder's ethnic origin remained  on Rwandan identity cards -- a useful tool for the  exterminators! Similarly, we may wonder how it was that in  January 1993 an international commission of inquiry uncovered  atrocities committed against Tutsis while 150 French soldiers  were present in Rwanda and 14 million French francs [Fr] had  been spent by Paris in 1992 in military cooperation with Kigali.  <H5>  Two Schools of Thought </H5>   It is an open secret that the Rwandan Armed Forces were  equipped by France. The Socialist government did begin to  change its policy in 1992, a few months before the victory of  the Right, when work was begun that led to the Arusha  negotiations. However, the military "establishment" [previous  word in English] did not follow suit: The French military, which  was opposed to the arms embargo decreed by France a year ago, is  still opposed to it today. Ministerial sources say that "there  are currently two schools of thought in France: On the one  hand, you have those who still want to rearm the Rwandan forces,  while on the other hand you have all those who believe that  nothing can be settled without the RPF."    Faced with this choice, the French Government made up its  mind: Rearming Paris's former ally is out of the question.  France flatly refused Tanzania's request that Paris arm the  scattered Rwandan Army -- a solution that was hoped for by many  countries in the region that fear the RPF becoming too  influential.    Having chosen not to take sides with any of the  belligerents,  France has very limited room for maneuver; its only means of  applying pressure being on the other side of the border in Zaire  which is the transit hub for weapons to the Rwandan Armed  Forces. Meanwhile, the Americans and the British are trying to  pressure Uganda through which weapons to the RPF are shipped.  Here again, French influence is now considerably reduced, since  all cooperation between France and Zaire has been suspended.    Marked by its recent "pro-Hutu" stand and handicapped by a  lack of relations with Zaire, France today seems unable to exert  any influence at all in this region. This is doubtless why it  prides itself in doing most humanitarian work, by granting  unprecedented funds to the non-governmental organizations  operating in Rwanda and Burundi. It is as if the government,  lacking the necessary political resources, is now passing the  torch to these organizations.</p>

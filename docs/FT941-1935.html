			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Prudential lifts payout on 45% rise: Turnround at M&amp;G reinsurance arm helps financial services company to Pounds 589m Prudential Corporation, the financial services and life insurance company, has reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 589m for 1993, a 45 per cent advance, helped by a sharply improved performance in Mercantile &amp; General, its reinsurance subsidiary. The final dividend rose to 8.7p, pushing the total up by almost 11 per cent to to 13.2p. Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive, said Prudential did not need to make specific provisions against potential compensation claims in respect of personal pensions sold to people transferring out of occupational schemes. Last year it carried out some Pounds 355m pension transfer business. Profits from the life business rose to Pounds 481m, from Pounds 444m, with much of the increase coming from operations outside the UK. Profits from the UK business rose just Pounds 6m to Pounds 282m. In a sharp turnround, M&amp;G's non-life business produced a profit of Pounds 6m in 1993, after a loss in 1992 of Pounds 143m. Mr Newmarch said this came partly from the 'lack of catastrophes', but also from measures to correct pricing levels, control underwriting exposure and cut costs. The full effects would be seen this year, he said. UK domestic insurance more than doubled profits from Pounds 27m to Pounds 55m, reflecting favourable weather and claims experience. The contribution from Prudential's investment management rose to Pounds 23m, from Pounds 8m. Annual premium sales of life business in the UK fell 12 per cent, though single premium sales were up 24 per cent. Jackson National Life, Prudential's US subsidiary, contributed profits of Pounds 122m, though this was not directly comparable with the 1992 figure of Pounds 86m, which included Pounds 52m related to investment gains. Mr Newmarch said that sales of Jackson's main product - single premium deferred annuities - had been disappointing and 38 per cent down in dollar terms. The company has launched a new range of products and will expand into New England this year, and open in New York. Mr Newmarch highlighted the group's operations in southern Asia and the Pacific as areas of future growth: it is to open offices in China and Indonesia. Earnings per share increased 40 per cent to 21.0p, from 15.0p. In the alternative method of calculating life company accounts - the accruals basis which seeks to recognise profit in the current year rather than from business written previously - Prudential's profits rose 10 per cent to Pounds 887m. Of this, new business represented Pounds 289m (Pounds 329m), while the investment return on shareholders' accrued interest totalled Pounds 406m (Pounds 353m). Prudential confirmed last night that in 1993 it sacked 23 members of staff for misdemeanours, including falsifying customer records. Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Chile makes early payment of Eurodebt CHILE, which was one of the first Latin American countries to return to Eurobond markets after the 1980s debt crisis, has pre-paid its Dollars 320m bond issue placed as part of its 1991 debt refinancing accord, Reuter reports from Santiago. Mr Jose Pablo Arellano, Chile's finance ministry budget director, said the operation was completed last month when the government paid Dollars 260m for outstanding bonds. Chile placed Dollars 200m in Eurobonds with a five-year maturity plus two years of grace at Libor plus 1.5 per cent in 1991 and in 1992 followed with a Dollars 120m placement. A total of 20 banks from the US, Japan and Europe subscribed the issue. Mr Arellano said the difference between the Dollars 260m and Dollars 320m total issue was accounted for by bonds which had already been repaid under the scheduled amortisation calendar.</p>

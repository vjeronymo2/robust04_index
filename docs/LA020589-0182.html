			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG MIX;  </P> <P> VIDEO;  </P> <P> SO MANY VIDEO STORES, SO MANY LANGUAGES . . .  </P> <P> It's called home video because you take it home, right? That may be generally  true, but for hundreds of thousands of Southern Californians -- mostly  foreign-born -- the home in home video means homeland.  </P> <P> Instead of going to the Wherehouse or 20/20 or Tower, these video fans head for  Bombay Spices or VIP Video -- or one of scores of other Los Angeles and Orange  County shops that carry tapes from overseas.  </P> <P> You want videos from Japan, Korea, Armenia, Egypt, the Philippines, Thailand,  France or Greece? You can get 'em, if you know where to look.  </P> <P> This special issue was edited by David Fox, Sunday Calendar assistant editor.  </P></p>

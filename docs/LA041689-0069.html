			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: COUNTRY CAPERS  </P> <P> Having conquered stage and film, Pulitizer Prize-winning playwright David Mamet  is aiming for TV with "Bradford," a series pilot he's written for MTM, which  has the project in development. The title character, according to a spokesman  for Mamet, is a NYC detective tired of the urban grind who sets up office in  the supposedly quiet countryside -- where peace and tranquility doesn't last  long.  </P> <P> It's Mamet's first network series effort, but not his first for the small  screen: Last year he wrote and exec-produced the HBO movie "Lip Service," a  satire on television news.  </P> <P> With his cop show, will Mamet stoop to conquer the boob tube?  </P> <P> " 'Bradford' may sound like a familiar situation," said the spokesman, "but  David never does anything that's routine."

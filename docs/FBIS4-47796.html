			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, the Mozambican Government asked for a  meeting of the Supervision and Control Commission, CSC, to be  postponed. That meeting was supposed to discuss the  disappearance of more than 12,000 Mozambique Armed Forces, FAM,  soldiers, according to estimates presented by the UN Operations  in Mozambique, Unomoz.    Aldo Ajello, the UN secretary general's representative in  Mozambique, has said in Maputo that the Mozambican Government  delegation to the CSC has asked for a postponement to study the  report and the number of soldiers said to be missing. The  government had initially handed in to the Cease-Fire Commission,  CCF, a list of 76,000 soldiers but then, without any  explanation, that figure came down to 64,000 men.    Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana, the second man in the  government team to the CSC, had said in mid-April that the  figures produced by the government were viable and that Unomoz  was using outdated information. Observers in the Mozambican  capital admit the possibility that the Mozambican (?Defense  Ministry) could have submitted lists containing false or  outdated information, including soldiers killed or missing in  action, as well as deserters.</p>

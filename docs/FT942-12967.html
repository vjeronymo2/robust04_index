			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Wheel of history goes full circle - A look at BAT's Dollars 1bn US acquisition BAT's Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) purchase of American Tobacco, announced yesterday, brings the wheel of history full circle. At the turn of the century Buck Duke, the brilliant and aggressive founder of American Tobacco, attacked the UK tobacco market. British companies formed an alliance - Imperial Tobacco - to head him off. In 1902 the two companies struck a truce: each would leave the other's home market alone, while their overseas operations were merged in a new joint venture - British American Tobacco. By trapping both parents at home, the deal ensured their progeny would ultimately outgrow them. For American Tobacco, the game was up in 1911, when the US Supreme Court forced the sale of its BAT holding on monopoly grounds. Then, in 1927, BAT entered the US market by buying Brown &amp; Williamson, now America's third biggest domestic tobacco company after Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco. American Tobacco, shrunk to a subsidiary of American Brands, is number five. Aside from the logic of history, the deal is in some respects a very odd one. The US tobacco industry is under unprecedented pressure. From a peak of 617bn cigarettes a year in 1977, the market last year was a mere 485bn. The Clinton administration is threatening new and sweeping curbs on smoking, and the market has been ferociously competitive ever since Philip Morris slashed the price of its Marlboro brand a year ago. According to US brokers Sanford C Bernstein, industry profits last year dropped from Dollars 9.6bn to Dollars 5.2bn. American Tobacco was worst hit again: from over Dollars 500m in 1991 and 1992, its pre-tax profits last year were just Dollars 169m. In addition BAT, like Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco and American Brands itself, has been using its cash flow to diversify. In BAT's case, the strategy since the mid-1980s has been to specialise in financial services. Granted, buying US tobacco assets at this point has an obvious contrarian appeal. In addition, the deal is a neat opportunity to gain US ownership of brands like Lucky Strike and Pall Mall, which BAT already owns elsewhere in the world. But does it not make nonsense of the group's overall direction? Not at all, says Mr Martin Broughton, BAT chief executive. The world tobacco industry has been restored to growth status by one decisive factor: the collapse of communism. Vast markets such as China and the former Soviet Union, previously closed to western companies, are now opening up. BAT is accordingly setting up joint ventures in such places as Uzbekistan and the Ukraine. America, Mr Broughton concedes, is in no sense a growth market. But it is cash-generative, and thus complements the new joint ventures, which are long-term and cash-hungry. In addition, he says, until a couple of years ago a US tobacco deal would have been ruled out on anti-trust grounds. Two things now convince him that this deal will be allowed. First, in a US court case in which BAT was involved two years ago, the judge ruled that the US tobacco market, while oligopolistic, was highly competitive. Second, the chaos caused by the Marlboro price war last year shows competition working in practice. Whatever BAT's arguments, it seems significant that American Brands' share price jumped by Dollars 2 to Dollars 33 3/4 yesterday, in spite of poor earnings figures reported for its first quarter. Clearly, one advantage American Brands expects from the deal - besides a handy Dollars 1bn of cash  -is relief from the downward pressure on its share price resulting from the political storm over smoking. Not that the deal takes it out of tobacco. Of its tobacco revenues of Dollars 7.4bn last year - more than half the group total - four fifths came not from American Tobacco but Gallaher, the international operation which is Britain's and Ireland's biggest cigarette company. But American Brands' drive away from tobacco has been single-minded. In the last five years it has spent nearly Dollars 5bn on acquisitions, building up a portfolio of consumer brands. Its large distilled spirits division takes in Jim Beam, the world's biggest-selling bourbon, and Whyte &amp; Mackay, which became the world's third largest Scotch whisky producer with its acquisition of Invergordon Distillers last year. It also owns Franklin Life Insurance, MasterBrand locks and hardware, ACCO World office supplies and Dollond &amp; Aitchison, Europe's biggest optician. For a long time now, American Tobacco has long looked a weak player in the US. With its Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Tareyton, Carlton, American, Monclair, Misty, Riviera, Private Stock, Prime and Summit brands, it has a small and declining share of the market, now less than 7 per cent, and looks vulnerable to further squeezing by the big companies in a shrinking market. For Mr Broughton, this is part of the appeal. BAT's market share is 11 per cent, making it a poor third after Philip Morris and RJR. American Tobacco is fifth. Putting the two together increases BAT's volume by half. 'We see a merger as being in the consumer's interest', Mr Broughton says - no doubt with one eye to the anti-trust authorities. 'It makes us a serious third force in the market.' Whether that is a desirable position remains to be seen. It is worth noting, though, that BAT's share price went up as did American Brands'. The undoing of history, it seems, has its own rewards.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Blending tobacco brands  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993                               BAT Industries      American brands                                                     (American Tobaccco                                                            subsidiary)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tobacco revenues                  Pounds 13.01bn         Dollars 1.5bn (as per cent of group revenues)    62.7 per cent         10.9 per cent  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tobacco operating profits          Pounds 1.21bn        Dollars 169.2m (as per cent of group  operating profits)                57.8 per cent         11.2 per cent  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tobacco brands owned jointly:         Lucky Strike and Pall Mall  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Other brands:               Kent, Kool, Player's          Tareyton and                    Barclay and State Express 555       Misty Montclair  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Other group businesses:           Allied Dunbar,      Gallaher Tobacco                           Eagle Star and Farmers       Whyte &amp; Mackay,                       Group (financial services)   Jim Beam, Gilbey's,                                                   Ronrico and Vladivar                                                    (spirits), Titleist                                                      (golf equipment),                                                    Dolland &amp; Aitchison                                                            (opticians)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINNING PITCH;  </P> <P> WOMEN'S HORSESHOE CHAMP GETS TRIP TO WHITE HOUSE  </P> <P> "Never in my wildest dreams did I picture myself as a guest of the President in  the White House. Yet, there I was. I couldn't believe it."  </P> <P> Diane (Buzz Saw) Lopez, 42, proudly showed off a photograph of herself with  George Bush on the White House lawn. The President had his arm around her.  </P> <P> "I'm just an average person with a job that doesn't pay very much, an inspector  in a small factory," Lopez said. "Out of the clear blue, I'm back in Washington  with President and Mrs. Bush. I petted Millie, their dog, and saw the new pups.  I was at a barbecue at the White House with the First Family. All because of  horseshoes. . . ."  </P> <P> It was horseshoes that brought the 5-foot-1, 125-pound Lopez to the White House  from this small Central California town. The reigning women's world champion  horseshoe pitcher, Lopez got her nickname because of the speed with which she  tosses the iron shoes.  </P> <P> George Bush is the biggest boon to horseshoes since Harry S. Truman. They are  the only two Presidents to have horseshoe pits installed on the White House  lawn. An avid pitcher, Bush formally unveiled his horseshoe pit earlier this  month and invited the world's five best men players and the four best women to  join him. That's how Diane Lopez happened to be invited to the White House.  </P> <P> A native of Santa Barbara and graduate of Santa Barbara High School's class of  1965, Lopez didn't start pitching horseshoes until six years ago.  </P> <P> "No one in my family ever pitched horseshoes that I know of," recalled Lopez, a  divorcee. "I pitched slow-pitch softball for 16 years. On Memorial Day weekend  in 1983, I was with my softball coach, Brian Dunavan, and his wife, Debbie, and  they introduced me to horseshoes. Brian told me to pitch the horseshoes the  same way I pitch baseballs and I did and started making ringers right away."  </P> <P> Lopez pitches her shoes in an unorthodox manner. She throws a backward 2 1/2  flip, which means she throws the shoe underhand with her thumb down. Most  players throw the shoes with their hand and thumb up with a 1 1/4 or 1 3/4  flip.  </P> <P> Two years after throwing her first shoe, Lopez won the 1985 California women's  state championship in Stockton. She was state champion again in 1987 and 1988.  </P> <P> Last year Lopez entered her first world's championship tournament in  Pleasanton, Calif., and placed first, winning $2,400 and a trophy. Jim Knisley  of Bremen, Ohio, won $3,500 and a trophy as the men's world champion.  </P> <P> "It was four days of really grueling competition. To win the world's  championship I won 14 games and lost one in the finals," Lopez said. "The only  game I lost was to 10-time world champion Vickie Winston of La Monte, Mo. She  beat me 40 to 25.  </P> <P> "Vickie pitched 34 straight ringers . . . at one point. We had 11 double dead  ringers, that is each one of us pitched 22 ringers in a row with our ringers  canceling each other's points."  </P> <P> But Lopez did better in the overall tournament and won the championship.  </P> <P> Even though she is the top woman professional in her sport, Lopez has won less  than $5,000 in prize money. The state championship's top prize was only $300.  In most states, the top players are awarded trophies, not money.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Much-Needed Boost'  </P> <P> "No one earns a living pitching horseshoes," Lopez said. "We're all hoping the  President's interest in the game will really give it a much-needed boost. I'd  like nothing better than to devote my full time to pitching and making a living  at it the way people do bowling, playing tennis, golf, baseball and other  sports."  </P> <P> Lopez and the other eight top horseshoe pitchers invited to the White House  paid half of their own air fare. The rest was paid by the National Horseshoe  Pitchers Assn., which has 15,000 dues-paying members and high hopes that the  President's interest will give the sport a big boost.  </P> <P> Association President Dave Loucks, 51, editor and publisher of the group's  monthly magazine, put Bush on the cover of his January issue. And when Loucks  learned that the President was installing a horseshoe court on the White House  lawn, he wrote offering technical assistance and thanking Bush for helping the  sport.  </P> <P> "President Bush wrote me a letter and in it said when the weather gets a little  warmer he wanted to have me and a few others come pitch with him at the White  House," recalled Loucks. Ten days before the dedication of the White House  horseshoe pit, the President called Loucks and invited him and the nine top men  and women professional players to be with him for the unveiling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Biggest Asset'  </P> <P> "President Bush is the biggest asset to the sport imaginable," said Loucks.  "Our long-range goal is to get sponsors to put a professional tour together  with television coverage, to enable professional pitchers to derive an income  from the sport which isn't possible now."  </P> <P> The makers of horseshoe equipment are equally hopeful.  </P> <P> "It's wonderful what President Bush is doing for the sport of horseshoe  pitching," said Nanette St. Pierre, 44, marketing director for St. Pierre  Manufacturing Corp., of Worcester, Mass., the world's leading maker of  horseshoe pitching gear.  </P> <P> The company is gearing up for an anticipated surge in sales because of the  attention focused on President Bush playing the game.  </P> <P> "This is a sport anybody can afford," St. Pierre insisted. "Our official back  yard set that includes horseshoes and two solid steel stakes retails for under  $20."  </P></p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Czech nuclear fears revived A fire at a Czech nuclear power plant at Dukovany yesterday revived a row between Prague and Vienna over the safety of Czech nuclear installations, writes Patrick Blum in Vienna. According to a security official at the plant, the fire was caused by a fault in a transformer and lasted for about two hours, but there was no radioactive leakage. Later Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, said the fire did not affect nuclear safety, but environmentalists charged that the fire had been serious enough to cause radioactive leakage. Austria has called on Prague not to go ahead with the completion of another power plant at Temelin, near the Austrian border.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria, South Africa, May 2 (YONHAP) -- South  Africa has proposed to South Korea that an agreement to open a  direct air route be concluded, South Korean Ambassador Choe  Sang-tok said Monday [2 May].    "The air agreement should be concluded first for the two  nations to promote bilateral relations including exchanges of  personnel and goods," Choe said.    South Africa finished its first multiracial elections late  last month and is counting the ballots to form a new government,  which will formally put an end to apartheid. Nelson Mandela's  African National Congress had captured more than half of the  vote after the counting of 32 percent of the ballots.    "South Korean businessmen have been reluctant to invest in  South Africa because there has been a lot of political violence,  robberies and other crimes in the country.    "But crime and political violence may drop considerably  after  a democratic government is established and reconciliation  between blacks and whites is realized," the ambassador said.</p>

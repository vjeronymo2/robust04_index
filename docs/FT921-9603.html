			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Scottish Nuclear to cut fuel reprocessing needs SCOTTISH NUCLEAR, the state-owned company which operates Scotland's two nuclear power stations, is go ahead with a project to store spent fuel at its plants instead of having it reprocessed by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL). This break with established practice in the nuclear industry should save Scottish Nuclear Pounds 40m a year when fully on stream and will mean a substantial reduction in BNFL's reprocessing business with Scottish Nuclear. However, Scottish Nuclear is committed to BNFL reprocessing at least 330 tonnes of spent fuel at Sellafield, Cumbria, as well as the quantity already contracted for. The two groups said yesterday they had reached agreement in principle on contracts for the next 15 years. The contracts, which will be backdated to April 1989, will be worth Pounds 2.7bn and will be on a fixed-price basis instead of the cost-plus arrangements of the past. They cover supply of fuel to stations at Torness, East Lothian, and Hunterston, Ayrshire; reprocessing of fuel from Scottish Nuclear's magnox station at Hunterston, now being decommissioned; treatment and storage of radioactive waste and Scottish Nuclear's share of the eventual decommissioning of BNFL's plant. Mr James Hann, the Scottish company's chairman, has argued since the company was created in 1990 out of the former South of Scotland Electricity Board that BNFL charged too much for reprocessing and that reprocessing was unnecessary - the uranium and plutonium it produced is not needed. Now Scottish Nuclear is to develop dry fuel stores at its advanced gas-cooled (AGR) plants, first at Torness and then at Hunterston. Up to the year 2005 about 2,000 tonnes of spent fuel will be stored for at least 50 years, after which it might either be reprocessed if required or transferred to a nuclear repository. The initial stage of each store will cost Pounds 15m. Scottish Nuclear will apply for planning permission and hopes to begin construction of the Torness store next year, to open two years later. BNFL, which is completing its Pounds 5bn thermal oxide reprocessing plant (Thorp) at Sellafield, is already contracted to reprocess about 600 tonnes of spent fuel from Scottish Nuclear, most of which is already in its hands. The extra 330 tonnes covers the period from 1989 up to completion of the new stores. Mr Hann said: 'These have been particularly tough negotiations over months.' Sir Christopher Harding, chairman of BNFL, said the agreement was 'a radical change in our commercial relationship,' and there were differences of view between BNFL and Scottish Nuclear on spent-fuel strategy, but the deal was good for BNFL. Nuclear Electric, which operates plants in England and Wales, last year signed a Pounds 13bn contract with BNFL which included the reprocessing of two thirds of all spent fuel from its AGR stations.</p>

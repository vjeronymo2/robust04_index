Air Quality Significance <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Light duty onroad mobile sources (cars, light duty trucks and motorcycles) are significant contributors to the emissions inventories in all three of the FIP areas. The table below (``1990 Base Year Inventory for Light Duty Vehicles'') details the level of emissions from onroad light duty mobile sources in each of the FIP inventories for the 1990 base year. The information contained in this table illustrates the large portion of the FIP inventories that is attributable to emissions from onroad light duty mobile sources. No control strategy could achieve attainment in the California FIP areas without affecting these engines which are central to the California economy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 7,L2,i1,s50,10,10,10,10,10,10 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> 1990 Base Year Inventory for Light Duty Vehicles  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Sacramento  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2VOC <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Ventura  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2VOC <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1South coast  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2VOC <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Onroad LDVs (tons)  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 108.5  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 78.0  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 38.3  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 27.0  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 772.6  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 421.1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Percent of total inventory  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 46%  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 42%  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 36%  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 31%  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 40%  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 37% <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> c. Enhanced Inspection and Maintenance_(1) Introduction. In its studies of in-use vehicle emission performance, EPA has found that vehicles typically emit at 2&hyph;3 times their certification standards in actual use. Factors such as lack of durability, tampering with emission control equipment, design defects, and poor maintenance all contribute to making cars and other mobile sources much dirtier in use than they should be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has found that an efficiently designed and managed vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program is one of the most effective and cost effective ways of cleaning the air. I/M programs are able to produce significant emission reductions after only a single inspection cycle, and the effort the consumer must expend to comply with I/M can be offset with improved fuel economy and performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Enhanced I/M. I/M programs achieve their objectives by identifying vehicles that have high emissions as a result of one or more malfunctions and requiring them to be repaired. An ``enhanced'' I/M program covers more of the vehicles in operation, employs inspection methods which are better at finding high emitting vehicles, and has additional features to better assure that all vehicles are properly tested and adequately repaired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the severity of the air quality problem in the FIP areas covered by this proposed action, EPA is proposing to implement an enhanced I/M program in all FIP areas as one of the most significant and productive of its FIP measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Background. The first mandatory  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> I/M programs were required by the 1977 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, which called for I/M programs in areas with long term air quality problems. The 1990 Amendments to the Act expanded the role of I/M, directing EPA to develop guidelines and performance standards for two levels of I/M program_basic  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> I/M for areas with moderately dirty air, and enhanced I/M for areas (like those addressed by this proposed FIP) with more serious and chronic nonattainment problems. On November 5, 1992, EPA published a final regulation (40 CFR part 51 subpart S) establishing certain minimum requirements and performance standards for both basic and enhanced I/M programs. It is this regulation and its supporting documentation that will form the basis for much of what will be proposed in this action. Readers are encouraged to consult the preamble to the final I/M rule for a more thorough explanation of the costs and benefits of I/M programs and the specific regulations. <FOOTCITE>71</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 71 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Although the proposed I/M program will meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, as well as the performance standard for enhanced I/M programs promulgated on November 5, 1992, EPA is not obligated to meet these requirements as part of its California FIP proposal. EPA would only be required to do so within 2 years of a state failure related to such requirements. EPA has chosen the proposed program design because it is one of the most productive and cost effective means by which to meet the requirement that the FIP demonstrate attainment with the ozone NAAQS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A state-administered I/M program known as Smog Check has been in existence in California since March 1984, and is currently operating in all three of the FIP areas. The Smog Check program includes a biennial tailpipe and antitampering inspection of 1966 and newer model passenger cars, as well as light- and heavy-duty trucks. The inspections are conducted in a decentralized network of private garages and service stations which are licensed by the State and which may perform both the emissions inspection and emissions-related repairs. The tailpipe test consists of a simple idle test for VOCs and carbon monoxide (CO) for vehicles up to the 1979 model year and a two-speed idle test for model year 1980 and newer vehicles. The program also includes antitampering inspections for all significant emission control components. Owners of subject vehicles must present proof that the vehicle has either been tested and passed or been waived from the program requirement prior to registering their vehicle(s) in even numbered years for even numbered license plates and odd numbered years for odd numbered license plates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the beginning of the program in California, a review committee of State and local air quality professionals has been conducting a continuing evaluation of the Smog Check network in order to recommend improvements to the Legislature and to address problems in program operation as they are identified. The ``California I/M Review Committee's Fourth Report to the Legislature'' details the results of comprehensive station audits and vehicle emission tests and concludes that the current program is yielding less than one-half the potential emission reduction benefits of the program if properly implemented due to improper testing and inadequate repair in the garages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon its own audits, as well as those conducted by California and other states, EPA has concluded that I/M programs throughout the country which combine the functions of testing and repair in a single facility are only roughly half as effective as programs which separate the two functions. The I/M rule which applies to enhanced areas requires the separation of test and repair unless a State can demonstrate that its current test-and- repair program is equal in effectiveness to a test-only network. In making this demonstration states will receive only one half the emission credit for the tailpipe test than that allowed for test-only facilities unless the state can demonstrate higher reductions from its program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SLOW-GROWTH STATUTE HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL;  </P> <P> JUDGE STRIKES DOWN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO LAW, RULING THAT IT PUTS UNFAIR BURDEN  ON BUILDERS  </P> <P> An Orange County judge Tuesday struck down as unconstitutional a slow-growth  measure approved by San Juan Capistrano voters that would have banned any major  new developments in the city until existing public works needs are met.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge William F. McDonald found that the city's Measure X placed  an unfair burden on future developers to solve problems with traffic, sewer and  other public works facilities caused by previous developments. The initiative  was narrowly approved by city voters last November after a nearly identical  countywide plan failed at the ballot box last June.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second Legal Setback  </P> <P> McDonald's decision dealt Orange County slow-growth advocates their second  major legal setback in recent months. Last October, a judge rejected a similar  San Clemente ordinance that also was approved by voters.  </P> <P> "This means that the slow-growthers will finally have to recognize the  limitations that the Constitution and state law put on their ability to  restrain development," said Jeffrey Thomas, an attorney representing one of two  developers who joined with the Building Industry Assn. to fight the initiative.  </P> <P> Leaders of the slow-growth movement, frustrated by what they contend was the  judge's misinterpretation of the ordinance, said Tuesday that they now will be  forced to seek new options for slowing development. Among those options, they  said, could be case-by-case public referendums on major projects.  </P> <P> "This is frustrating, but we're not going to be set back by mere legal  technicalities," said Thomas C. Rogers, an architect of the countywide  slow-growth measure and president of Citizens for Slow Growth and Traffic  Control. "We just go back to the drawing board."  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano officials, who found themselves legally bound to defend in  court a measure that they have criticized, said they had expected the  initiative to be overruled. No decision was made Tuesday on a possible appeal.  </P> <P> "I'm personally glad that Measure X has been dealt this blow because I don't  think it would have done the city any good," Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer said. "It  did nothing to really manage the volume of growth."  </P> <P> By a margin of just 3 percentage points, voters in San Juan Capistrano were  among several local communities last November to approve slow-growth measures  aimed at meeting current and future demands on roads, sewers, parklands, police  and fire protection, and other community resources.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would Set Requirements  </P> <P> The San Juan Capistrano initiative would have required that a certain threshold  of improvements to existing public works be met before any new developments  could begin.  </P> <P> No funding mechanism for such improvements was spelled out in the measure. But  building industry representatives have said that the measure would, in effect,  have forced developers of future projects to assume much or all of the cost of  these expensive improvements -- even if they weren't the ones who created the  problem in the first place.  </P> <P> "It is not enough for the landowner to eliminate any negative impact of the  development on these (public works) facilities" under the measure, attorneys  for Kaiser Development Co. argued in opposing the plan. "He must also improve  on the situation which existed before he began to develop his own land."  </P> <P> But attorneys for the city, defending the measure before Judge McDonald in  Santa Ana Tuesday, said they only want to see developers pay their "fair share"  for placing increased demand on local resources.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Health and Safety Cited  </P> <P> "A local municipality historically has always had the right to control local  development to protect health and safety," attorney Daniel K. Spradlin,  representing the city, told McDonald. He added that the measure "doesn't impose  the cost exclusively on the developers."  </P> <P> But Judge McDonald asked Spradlin skeptically: "Isn't (the developers') fair  share zero?" He said it was unreasonable to expect developers to pay for new  roads and other improvements to meet already-existing needs.  </P> <P> McDonald, citing Superior Court Judge John C. Wooley's rejection last October  of San Clemente's slow-growth initiative, called the San Juan Capistrano  measure defective.  </P> <P> Mayor Hausdorfer said the decision now allows the city to review a backlog of  about 50 proposed projects for compliance with earlier city ordinances  regulating growth. The projects had been on hold after the voters' November  decision.  </P> <P> "I'm glad a decision has been made. Now we need to settle down and plan for the  future because (the measure) has caused a great deal of confusion," the mayor  said.  </P> <P> Among the largest tracts for potential development may be those held by the  firms that successfully blocked Measure X in court.  </P> <P> Kaiser Development holds title to the 17-acre Rosan Ranch in the south end of  the city, on a hilltop parallel to Camino Capistrano, while Verde San Juan  Estates General Partnership owns four residential lots on Toyon Drive in the  hills above Ortega Highway.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Have to Narrow Sights  </P> <P> Slow-growth advocate Rogers said the second court defeat for a ballot  initiative may force slow-growth forces to narrow their sights in future  battles.  </P> <P> "As long as the Building Industry Assn. (an opponent of the initiative) insists  on fighting this thing in court ad nauseum, then the citizens, to defend  themselves, are going to have to look to a simpler solution," he said.  </P> <P> Rogers said that may mean abandoning broad policy statements as sought in the  ballot initiatives and, instead, putting specific development proposals to the  voters. That was the case in Cypress, where voters last week rejected the  proposed Cypress Downs project on the Los Alamitos Race Course grounds.  </P> <P> But Rogers predicted that Tuesday's court defeat "will make us more determined  than ever."  </P> <P> Spradlin, the lawyer who represented the city in pushing to implement Measure  X, agreed. "This decision is certainly a discouraging word, but it's not the  last word," he predicted.  </P> <P> The intense demand on local roads, sewer systems and other public works,  Spradlin said, "is not a problem that's going to go away if we stick our heads  in the sand."  </P></p>

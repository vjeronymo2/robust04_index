			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION SPRAYING FOR THE PESKY MEDFLY  </P> <P> All attempts to put an end to Medfly spraying have so far been unsuccessful,  and Southern California residents continue to be bombarded with pesticide  despite their protestations.  </P> <P> It's time to renew an old idea; that of dividing California into two separate  states. It has always made sense, given the disparate economies and cultures of  the north and the south. The agriculture-controlled government of a Northern  California would have had no authority to spray poison on the heads of its  unwilling Southern California neighbors.  </P> <P> GARY S.

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / German economic confidence declines GERMANY'S leading economic institutes have sharply reduced their 1992 growth forecasts and industrial confidence has plummeted, according to researchers at the Institut der Deutschen Wirtschaft (IW) in Cologne. Investment budgets have been pruned, and leading employers are preparing to reduce their payrolls. Four of the seven main organisations questioned by the IW now expect gross domestic product to grow by only 1.5 per cent, with the remainder expecting 2 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent during 1991. Last autumn they were expecting a 2.5 per cent improvement. 'The institutes have seldom been so gloomy,' the IW said. Arguing that all the causes of weakness were 'home-made', it blamed over-generous 1991 pay rises and a worsening of the investment climate following the recent half-point increase in German interest rates. Increased taxes and duties also played a part. Progress could be even slower if the economists' optimism about the growth in sales to reviving export markets - estimates range between 4 and 6 per cent - proves ill-founded. Sales outside Germany account for more than 40 per cent of gross domestic product. The forecasts also allow for pay settlements lower than the 6 to 7 per cent rises awarded last year. Unions which have so far put in their claims are demanding 10 per cent increases. A separate IW poll of confidence in 39 key industrial sectors showed 30 starting the year in pessimistic mood. Only foreign trade companies said their situation was better than a year earlier. Oil and plastics companies, hotel owners, publishers, clothing and food makers claimed their position was unchanged.</p>

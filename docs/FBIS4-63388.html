			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Filatov, chief of President Yeltsin's </F> staff, by correspondent Voskoboynikov; date and place not given]    [Text] [Voskoboynikov] Sergey Aleksandrovich, could it  happen that you, like Sergey Shakhray, might have to find out  from the newspapers about being removed from a official position?    [Filatov] Well, this is a difficult question. You see, I  think it is a ridiculous thing that a person finds out from the  newspapers or radio that a decree has been signed on his  dismissal or removal, so to speak. The procedural system had  not worked properly in this instance. Unfortunately, things  like this do happen time from time.    [Voskoboynikov] Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's  press secretary, said that Shakhray's plans were not always in  line with Russia's real state interests. Nevertheless,  President Yeltsin has decided to leave Shakhray in the position  of Vice Premier. Why?    [Filatov] Well, you know, Shakhray's activities have been  beneficial. Since the creation of the Russian Federation we  have seen the important work he has been carrying out in one or  another sector he has headed. That is why I think these  circumstances were probably taken into account. Of course, his  work is beneficial to the government and it is most likely that  this was behind the president's decision to keep Shakhray.</p>

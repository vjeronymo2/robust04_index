Approximately 22,000 tractors and light trucks, as well as  other work equipment used in the fields, will be maintained by  the soldiers as direct cooperation with the productive sector,  Radio Rebelde has reported.    Right now, the main objective is to remove corrosion and  halt  the deterioration of the equipment that is now available after  converting a large number of former state-run farms to the  cooperative system.    Until this equipment is distributed and used in other  agriculture units or assigned to cooperatives, the Armed Forces  will be charged with maintaining the tractors and mentioned  vehicles.    Similar support operations for other sectors of the national  economy have been implemented in the past, directly benefiting  the Construction and Transportation Ministries, according to  what could be learned.</p>

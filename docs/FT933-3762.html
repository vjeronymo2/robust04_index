			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: How does your pension rate? - Debbie Harrison reports on a new guide that lets members of more than 100 larger company schemes in Britain compare their benefits AN INNOVATIVE guide to more than 100 of the larger UK company pension schemes, covering half of all workers with occupational pensions, reveals just how generous - or miserly - different employers are and explains how you can assess your own scheme's competitiveness. The report, Pension Scheme Profiles 1993*, provides detailed benefit profiles of each scheme together with a rating guide that allows readers to get a quick fix on how theirs compares with others. Of particular interest is the 'target scheme' devised to set a benchmark against which schemes can be measured. More than 11m UK employees are members of final salary occupational pension schemes where the pension is based on three main factors: the definition of 'pensionable pay,' the period of membership, and the pay level at retirement. Employees interested in carrying out a pensions health check should refer to their scheme booklet and compare the definition of their own benefits with the report's target scheme benefits given below: Retirement pension: Payable from age 60 based on service and final earnings. Accrual rate: One-60th of final pay per year of service. Pensionable earnings: All earnings (apart from overtime etc paid only during earlier years of employment). Final pay calculation: The higher of either total earnings in the year before retirement or average annual earnings over any three-year period ending within 10 years of retirement, up-rated in line with the retail price index. Pensionable service: Total service including maternity leave and certain temporary absences. Lump sum on retirement: Inland Revenue maximum ie the maximum amount of pension that can be converted to tax-free cash - normally 1.5 times final remuneration after 40 years' service, although this might be subject to revenue restrictions. Pension increases: In line with the retail price index. Ill-health pension: Equivalent to the amount the employee would have received had he remained in service until normal retirement age, at his present rate of pay. Death in service benefits: Should include a dependent adult's pension of four-ninths the member's total earnings at death, plus pensions for dependent children. Also, a lump sum of four times earnings. Death in retirement benefits: Should include a pension worth two-thirds of the member's pension to be paid to a nominated dependent adult, plus a pension for any dependent children under age 18. Scheme leaver benefits: The whole of the preserved pension should be increased in line with RPI up to retirement. By law, all this information should be provided. If any is missing, contact the pensions manager or scheme trustees. In its analysis of each company scheme, the report awards an overall 'assessment ratio' based on the cost to the employer of the main benefits compared with the cost of the target scheme. Schemes awarded a rating of 100 per cent match the benefits provided by the target scheme. But no account was taken of discretionary benefits - those, such as extra pension increases, which are not an actual right but can become a regular feature of the scheme. The definition of pensionable pay is particularly important since your pension will be calculated as a proportion of these earnings. Some schemes provide a pension linked to basic pay, while others take into account other elements - such as, for example, regular overtime. If overtime forms a significant proportion of your gross earnings and this is not taken into account in your pensionable pay, you could consider top-up provision through additional voluntary contributions (AVCs). The other important point about pensionable pay is to find out just when your pensionable salary is fixed for the purposes of the calculation. Many schemes base the pension calculation on the member's gross or basic salary during the two or three years before retirement. If this is the case, you should think twice before accepting a less onerous but lower paid position in the run-up to retirement, since your pension would be based on this reduced salary. As the tables show, the generosity of employers surveyed varied dramatically. Top place went to the Abbey National scheme with 104 per cent  -the only scheme to provide better benefits than the target. Lowest was the Rank Organisation plan with just 23 per cent. So, what can you do if you discover your pension scheme is inadequate? Some employers and trustees are open to suggestions on benefit improvements, particularly if there is a pension fund surplus. But it is wise to have a few DIY ideas up your sleeve. The first is AVCs. Employees can pay up to 15 per cent of earnings into a company pension scheme but most pay in about 5 per cent. This leaves scope to pay 10 per cent (if you can afford it) into the company AVC scheme or into a free-standing AVC (FSAVC). These are available from life offices but also from a few building societies and unit trusts. Like all Inland Revenue-approved pension arrangements, AVCs and FSAVCs are very tax-efficient, offering tax relief on contributions and tax-free roll-up of funds. Company AVC schemes tend to be better value because the employer bears the provider's costs, but FSAVCs offer a wider investment choice. In both cases, the fund built up by your contributions must normally be used to buy an annuity. The company pensions manager will provide details on the AVC scheme, while an independent adviser will help you choose the best FSAVC. Remember that, in most cases, your investment will not be available until retirement. If you need more flexibility, then you could look at other tax-efficient investments such as personal equity plans (Peps). Apart from topping-up your pension through AVCs it might be necessary to boost your life cover, either through some form of family income benefits plan or a lump sum life assurance policy. Both types of insurance are available from life offices at relatively modest monthly premiums. Once again, an independent financial adviser can select the best rates on the market. *Pension Scheme Profiles is available from Union Pension Services Ltd, 50 Trinity Gardens, London SW9 8DR, price Pounds 195 (Pounds 95 for trade unions).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      OVERALL ASSESSMENT RATIOS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP TEN BOTTOM TEN  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey National Scheme*      104%   Rank Organisation Plan          23% ICI Fund                     86%   DRG Pension Fund Lower Scale    26% TSB Group Scheme*            82%   TI Group General Section        26% Legal &amp; General Fund         82%   Massey Ferguson Works*          28% Burmah Castrol Plan*         80%   Massey Ferguson Staff*          28% BBC Scheme*                  78%   Daily Mail Scheme               31% Rothmans Fund*               77%   Harmsworth Scheme               31% Shell Pension Fund*          75%   Philips Pension Fund*           31% Woolwich BS Fund*            75%   NEI Scheme Scale 1*             31% Siemens Scheme               74%   DRG Pension Fund Higher Scale   32%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Benefits and contributions based on basic as opposed to gross earnings.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

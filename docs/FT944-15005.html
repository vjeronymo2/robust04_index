			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Observer: Envy party Conclusive evidence that Germany's once madcap Green party has sold out to the political establishment. The dedicated environmentalists, who now constitute the third largest parliamentary group in the Bundestag, had earmarked November 4 and 5 for the party conference. Now the proceedings, to be held in Cologne, will be squeezed into the one day, November 5. The reason? A rather large number of the delegates apparently wish to attend the annual press ball in Bonn the previous evening, a huge but tedious event attended by the massed ranks of the great and good. Tickets cost DM250, black tie is obligatory, and about the best entertainment is to be had watching self-important politicos fall over each other to secure their picture in a Sunday newspaper. All that mould-breaking understandably produces a thirst for some champers.</p>

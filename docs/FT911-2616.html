			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / EC ministers back plan to protect Kurds EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers yesterday backed Britain's proposal for a United Nations police force to provide Kurdish refugees with protection on their return to Iraq. Their decision at a meeting in southern Luxembourg came as western military officials prepared to extend the security zone in northern Iraq further east yesterday. Officials confirmed that allied forces were already 30km east of Zakho, the Iraqi town at the centre of the safe havens plan. Brigadier Andrew Keeling of the British Royal Marines said the forces were ready to extend the zone 'as far as we feel necessary to give adequate protection'. The plan is now to push further east into the main valleys along the Iraqi-Turkish border where the largest concentrations of refugees fled after Baghdad's crushing of the short-lived Kurdish rebellion. The UK marine commander said the military was ready, but was still waiting on a political decision. He added the logical step would then be to push further south, Anatolia the official Turkish news agency reported. In Mondorf-les-Bains Mr Jacques Poos, foreign minister of Luxembourg which has the EC presidency, said the British idea to replace allied troops with UN police had unanimous EC support. But some of Britain's partners were sceptical of the UK belief that it could be done without a fresh UN resolution. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said: 'The idea is to enable the UN, without stretching its constitutional position, to provide protection as well as relief for the Kurds.' The plan would go to New York as a British initiative, but with the support of France and Belgium, currently on the Security Council, and all EC states. Explaining that the UK did not want to keep its troops in southern Turkey and northern Iraq for more than 'a relatively small number of months', Mr Hurd expressed the hope that the despatch of lightly-armed police, rather than soldiers, might be possible under UN Resolution 688. The resolution passed earlier this month seeks an end to Baghdad's repression of its citizens. He was not confident that a fully-fledged UN peacekeeping force, as sent to southern Iraq, would receive Security Council backing. Mr Hurd believed that eventually the Kurdish refugees would be persuaded to come off the mountains and return home. He agreed that unarmed UN aid workers might not appear sufficient security for the Kurds. But if the UN police idea was approved, Mr Hurd said it should be possible for it to be covered in the understandings that Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has reached with Baghdad. There were signs yesterday the UN may be indeed be preparing for a larger role in the operation. A UN team visited the new sites for the first time, before having talks with local Iraqi officials. Mr Stefan Demistura, head of the three-man UN team, said: 'This is a preparatory mission and we are talking with camp officials about humanitarian issues and will introduce ourselves to the Iraqis in Zakho.' Mr Poos also addressed the question of reported human rights abuses in Kuwait. The EC presidency had already complained to Kuwait about abuses and would do so again next week when Kuwait and other gulf states negotiate with the EC on trade, he said. Mr Hurd also said he would press European concerns when he visits Kuwait later this week. Editorial Comment, Page 16</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn strong The market welcomed Thorn EMI's decision to sell its lighting business to Investcorp, a Bahrain international investment bank, for Pounds 162m, especially against the backround of an otherwise dull leisure sector. The shares gained 25 at 920p - the company's first break ever through 900p - as 1.3m shares changed hands. Traders saw the move as a step closer to Thorn's presumed goal of discarding periferals to leave the company with two core businesses, music and rentals. Thorn has sold about 60 firms since 1987 and now makes 82 per cent of profits from music and rentals. The market ultimately expects to see a demerger but was taken somewhat by surprise by the long-expected move, which has been little discussed in recent weeks. A generally sluggish banks sector provided a bright spot in TSB, which moved to an all-time high of 198p before finishing a net 2 up at 197p ahead of interim figures scheduled for Thursday. TSB is the first of the clearing banks to report their half-year numbers, with Lloyds Bank due to follow at the end of next month. Analysts' interim profits forecasts extend from around Pounds 50m to as high as Pounds 130m, compared with last time's Pounds 92m, with provisioning against bad debts expected to show an increase on the previous year's first half but a fall on the second half's figure. NatWest Securities is forecasting a 5 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 3.3p. Turnover in British Steel rose to 19m shares after the board disclosed losses that were lower than the market expected. US selling early in the session prompted a decline in the shares to 96p, a fall that was reversed with the release of the figures. However, analysts' concern about steel overcapacity in the EC took hold in the afternoon, bringing a further decline in the stock, which closed a touch harder on the day at 98 3/4 p. Shares in Rolls-Royce shed 2 1/2 to 147 1/2 p after trade of 5.5m on fears that development costs for its new Trent-800 engine may be higher than expected. Worries about overcapacity in European steel also hurt ASW Holdings, which gave up 8 to 205p. Weekend press comment boosted Aerospace Engineering by 2 to 28p. Unconfirmed talk of a broker's profits upgrading for BTR saw the shares advance 12 to 368p. Grand Metropolitan moved up 12 to 426p on 6.7m shares traded ahead of an analysts meeting. Analysts said the company continued to benefit from last week's brokers' advice to sell Guinness in favour of GrandMet. Food manufacturers were mostly firm, with Tate &amp; Lyle up 6 at 381p on news that a strike at one of its American factories was over. Hillsdown, the poultry to upholstery group, bucked the market trend to finish 5 off at 136p United Biscuits, still riding a bid rumour, finished 8 higher at 408p. Once again Cadbury Schweppes was tipped as the chief suspect. The shares of bananas importer Geest continued to slide on traders' nerves over the future of the European Community's banana regime, now the subject of an inquiry by a panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The stock ended 10 cheaper at 344p. Other statistics, Page 32</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Korean debt to equity ratios rise THE average debt to equity ratios of listed South Korean companies rose by 23.1 percentage points to 241.7 per cent in 1991 due to tight liquidity, according to a survey conducted by the Daewoo Research Institute (DRI), Reuter reports from Seoul. The survey covered about 400 of the 528 listed companies with fiscal years ending on December 31. DRI said Hanyang topped the list, recording a debt to equity ratio of 3,294.5 per cent. Aggregate turnover of the 400 companies in 1991 increased to Won131,260bn (Dollars 171.35bn) from Won108,950bn a year earlier. Daewoo Corporation, the trading arm of the Daewoo group, had recorded the largest sales of Won6,400bn in 1991 from Won5,250bn in 1990, the survey showed. Samsung, which led the turnover charts in 1990, was not included in the survey as it has yet to hold a shareholders meeting. Samsung recorded a turnover of Won7,950bn in 1990 from Won7,610bn a year earlier.</p>

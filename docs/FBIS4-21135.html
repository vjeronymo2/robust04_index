We need resources and  assistance even from the U.S. State Department.    [Begin Gallo recording] The State Department can help in  obtaining assistance for Nicaragua's police apparatus to combat  it. You know how precarious the National Police budget is. [end  recording]    The law is also being drafted to fight money laundering,  which has not taken hold in Nicaragua.    [Begin Luis Humberto Guzman, Christian Democratic Union  deputy and National Assembly president, recording, in progress]  ...the report does not review the volume of financial  transactions in Nicaragua's banks. We could not necessarily  talk of money laundering; at least not for now. [end recording]    Nicaragua has not reached the level of drug trafficking of  other countries.    [Begin Guzman recording] Perhaps Nicaragua's only  implication  is that its territory and air space are used as a  drug-trafficking and transshipment point. [end recording]    The law may be passed in the next four weeks. Controversial  topics will be DEA operations in our country and the extradition  of nationals, something our Constitution bars.</p>

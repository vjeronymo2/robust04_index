			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Managing the debt problem"] </F>   [Text] According to reports Pakistan repaid $508 million in  principle and interest on foreign debt only during the first  three months of the current fiscal year. This indicates the  growing problem of our debt servicing liability at a time when  not only our exports have begun to stagnate but remittances from  overseas Pakistanis -- once a major redeeming feature of our  external budget -- are also shrinking substantially.    Here is a problem which now requires special attention and  careful handling. An update on the 1992-93 Economic Survey has  recorded that debt service payments for that whole year totalled  $1.645 billion of which $646 million were only interest  payments. If total debt servicing liability is deducted from the  year's disbursements in foreign assistance, that net external  flow is around $800 million. Looked at from another angle, debt  servicing was more than 24 percent of our export receipts, more  than 15 percent of all foreign exchange earnings and more than  three percent of our Gross National Product (GNP). Remittances,  which in 1982-83 soared to more than $2.8 billion, have now  slumped to about $1.5 billion.    In case of major donors like the US, Japan, Germany and two  international financial institutions -- the World Bank and the  Asian Development Bank -- repayments pre-empt a big portion of  new inflows. In case of the US, which has suspended new loans or  concessional credits, we are perhaps exporting capital rather  than importing it. Annual repayments to the US in 1992-93 were  around $350 million -- much more than what is still flowing from  the pipeline as economic assistance. If repayments on military  purchases are added, the scenario becomes more worrisome.    Pakistan has so far scrupulously avoided any default or  sought any new debt relief or re-scheduling. But it is perhaps  time to review the whole situation more comprehensively. It is  unlikely that in the immediate future there will be any dramatic  upturn in our exports. We seem to have good case for seeking  rescheduling or debt relief of some kind to tide over the  present situation. IMF assistance, now under negotiation, may  not be adequate for a year or two. The forthcoming Donors  meeting this spring may be the right forum to stimulate some  dialogue on this issue. In the meantime, Pakistan should, in  concert with other developing countries, press for a new  North-South settlement on the debt problem for the third world  as a whole.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or an exemption therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the impact of this rule on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory rules to the scale of business subject to such rules in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 120 papaya handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering fresh papayas grown in Hawaii, and approximately 400 producers of papayas in Hawaii. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to &sect;928.120, the committee currently consists of 13 members. Each member has an alternate. Six members are growers, six are handlers, and one is a public member. The six handler members and alternates are nominated from the production area at large. Grower membership on the committee is apportioned among three districts. District 1 (the Island of Hawaii) is represented by four members and alternates, and District 2 (the Islands of Kauai, Niihau, Maui, Molakai, Lanai, Kahoolawe; and Kalawao county), and District 3 (the Island of Oahu) by one member and alternate each. Any grower organization is limited to two members on the committee. Any handler organization is limited to one member on the committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 928.20 also allows the number of grower and handler members and alternate members on the committee and the composition of the committee between growers and handlers to be changed as provided in &sect;928.31(o). Paragraph (o) of &sect;928.31 also authorizes the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, to redefine the districts into which the production area is divided, reapportion membership on the committee. Any such changes are required to reflect, insofar as practicable, structural changes within the industry and shifts in papaya production within the production area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule would change the composition of the committee by increasing grower representation on the committee from six grower members to nine and reducing handler representation from six members to three. This change was recommended by the committee on April 22, 1994, by a vote of 7 in favor, 3 opposed, and 2 abstentions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The papaya industry has historically demonstrated a policy of maintaining equitable representation among handlers and growers. In 1989, committee membership was changed by allocating three grower member positions from District 1 to handlers in the State of Hawaii. This resulted in an increase from three to six handler members and a decrease in grower members from District 1 from seven to four. The committee indicated that the number of growers in the industry has increased from 325 to 400 since 1989, while the number of handlers has remained constant. The committee contends that these factors support their recommendation to change committee membership. This action is intended to provide increased grower representation on the committee consistent with the increased number of growers. This rule would not impose any additional costs on growers or handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Members supporting this change stated that the marketing order is designed to primarily benefit growers and for that reason growers should have a majority on the committee. Members supporting the recommendation also stated that this change would increase growers' influence in matters concerning amendments to the marketing order, and market research and development and promotion activities. The majority of that increase occurred in District 1. Members opposed to the change in the current committee membership stated that the marketing order should benefit the entire industry, and believe the current composition of the committee provides a good balance for the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The committee indicated that the increase in the number of growers producing papayas in District 1, justified increasing from four to seven the number of growers representing District 1 on the committee. Committee members supporting this change contend that the vast majority of growers and the highest level of papaya production are located in District 1. District 1 is expected to produce 55.6 million pounds during the 1993&hyph;94 season. Over the last four years District 1 has had an average annual production of 54.1 million pounds of papayas. For the same period District 2 has an average production of 760,000 pounds, and District 3 has an average production of 1,020,000 pounds of papayas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 928  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements, Papayas, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 928 is proposed to be amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 928_PAPAYAS GROWN IN HAWAII  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A welcome from lenders - Housing / The Budget and You HOUSING MEASURES outlined by the chancellor in the Budget were broadly welcomed by lenders this week. Halifax, the largest lender, said its optimism was tempered by caution because the chancellor was relying on his Budget proposals to bring recovery to the market and improve employment prospects. Confidence remains the key to recovery, it said. Of immediate significance was chancellor Norman Lamont's decision to raise the threshold for stamp duty from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000. Lamont said this would affect half the properties on the market and would benefit to first-time buyers and others at the lower end. 'We are very pleased and found it very encouraging,' said Abbey National, the second largest lender. 'For a first-time buyer Pounds 600 represents a significant saving.' The change applies to documents executed on or after Budget day, provided they are not stamped before March 23. The Inland Revenue said that any documents exchanged on or after March 16 would not be stamped until March 23 unless accompanied by a specific request to do so earlier. House prices in the south east are higher than for the rest of the UK but Halifax expects the measure to benefit the market even in this most depressed of areas. It said that the average price paid by a first-time buyer in the south east is Pounds 50,000 and in greater London, Pounds 60,000 against a national average of Pounds 45,000. The chancellor also said he would be limiting mortgage interest tax relief at source (Miras), to 20 per cent instead of 25 per cent. In recognition of the fragile state of the market, he said the measure would not be implemented until April 1994. Higher rate tax relief was abolished in 1991. Tim Melville Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, the third largest lender, welcomed the move: 'We have long advocated a phased withdrawal of mortgage interest tax relief and the redirection of some of the savings involved towards first-time buyers and owner-occupiers on low incomes.' The table shows the effect of the proposed Miras change. Under current mortgage rates of 7.99 per cent it represents an increase in monthly payments of a maximum of just under Pounds 10. Halifax said it did not expect the move to damage the market, partly because it was expected. 'The stamp duty measure was helpful and Miras will not matter,' it said. The National Association of Estate Agents agreed. 'It is probably the right time for the government to introduce changes, particularly now that mortgage rates are at their lowest level for many years,' said Michael Jones, president. 'The reduction will not have a profound effect on either those with homes or those thinking of buying.' However, if mortgage rates rise, the effect of the reduction in Miras benefit will be greater by pushing up monthly payments. John Cole, of Berry Birch &amp; Noble, financial advisers, said the effect would be to make more people - especially those who have already scaled their mortgage down to Pounds 30,000, the maximum on which relief is available - wonder about the value of continuing to maintain a mortgage. 'A lot of people who have retired or have been made redundant are asking us whether they should pay off their mortgage. The proposed change to Miras will make people question further this benefit,' he said. The calculation involves balancing the return on a Pounds 30,000 investment against the value of tax relief of 20 per cent on a Pounds 30,000 loan. At the current mortgage rate of 7.99 per cent, a basic rate taxpayer would have to earn around 8.5 per cent gross on his savings, and a top rate taxpayer 10.65 per cent, in order for it to be worthwhile to have savings instead of repaying the loan. People over 65 who have life annuity home income plan schemes which allow them to draw down some of the savings invested in their houses will be excluded from the Miras change and will continue to attract relief at 25 per cent. Lamont also made it easier for people with negative equity - when the value of their home is less than their mortgage - to move house. Previously, if your lender allowed you to move and to re-secure the old loan on the new property, you would have lost your entitlement to Miras because it is payable only on a new loan. Since Budget Day, however, the old loan will qualify. The Inland Revenue said, 'The measure is primarily intended to remove an obstacle faced by those with negative equity who want to move house. However, the new rules are not to be restricted to situations where there is negative equity and other borrowers may be able to take advantage of them.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EFFECT OF MIRAS CHANGES ON MONTHLY MORTGAGE PAYMENTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Loan             Repayment Mortgage               Endowment Mortgage* (Pounds)     Now       April  Difference       Now    April Difference                         1994                           1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  30,000     195.44    202.91        7.47    149.83   159.80       9.97  40,000     262.07    272.05        9.98    216.41   226.39       9.98  50,000     340.07    350.04        9.97    283.00   292.97       9.97  60,000     418.07    428.04        9.97    349.58   359.55       9.97  80,000     574.07    584.04        9.97    482.75   492.72       9.97 100,000     730.06    740.04        9.98    615.91   625.89       9.98 150,000   1,120.06  1,130.03        9.97    948.83   958.80       9.97  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Halifax.

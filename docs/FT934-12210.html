			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (11): Old-fashioned attitudes - Gems industry THE total value of precious gems smuggled out of Sri Lanka could be as high as Colombo's annual foreign aid receipts, says a former governor of the country's central bank and an expert in the gem trade. If Dr Neville Karunatilleke is right, then 'unofficial exports' of Sri Lanka's fabled array of star rubies, cornflower-blue sapphires, tourmalines, moonstones, garnets and dozens of other precious gems, may be worth as much as Dollars 300m a year. This would make gems Sri Lanka's largest single export after garments and tea. Dr Karunatilleke's guesstimate for smuggled rough stones and gems is about double the official 1992 export figure for jewellery, diamond re-exports and gems combined of SLRs6,888m. As Colombo moves towards a more liberal export-import regime and towards almost complete freedom of exchange controls, the chances are that smuggling will decline to a much lower level. Perhaps more important than legitimising the trade, a proportion of which is always likely to prove attractive to smugglers and tax evaders, is the need to catapult an old-fashioned industry into the 20th century. In the 1970s and early 1980s, for example, hundreds of Thai traders bought for a song what Sri Lankans then thought were worthless, milky-white so-called Geuda stones. The Thais took them to Bangkok, subjected them to specialised heat treatment and became the proud possessors of blue sapphires worth up to Dollars 5,000 a carat, and often more than one hundred times what they paid for them. By the time the Sri Lankan industry woke up to the fact it was being cheated, it had lost many hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of sales. Even though Sri Lankans are no longer giving away their Geuda stones they have been slow to adopt the new technology and over 95 per cent (an estimated 6 tonnes a year) of Sri Lankan Geudas are still being sold to Thailand, mostly smuggled. As the technology has improved, even high-quality rubies and sapphires are now heat-treated to improve their colour. This can increase their value by four or five times and is now widely accepted in the world marketplace. In Sri Lanka, traditional attitudes that heating a gem is somehow cheating has meant the industry has been slow to invest in the specialised furnaces needed - a loss that the state Gem Corporation is trying to remedy with a training programme and a campaign to persuade gem traders to adopt the Thai technology. Some progress has been made but because there is little vertical integration in the industry and many gem cutters operate on a cottage industry basis, gaining access to capital has not been easy. Current estimates are that 150 small operators are engaged in heat treatment throughout the country, compared to 500 large professional operations in Bangkok alone. Sri Lanka has also been slow off the mark to add value by using the thousands of tiny less valuable gems in developing its jewellery export sector. The lack of initiative, poor access to capital and modern jewellery design has been compounded by the recent loss to the Middle East of many of its experienced gem cutters and jewellers. However, in the past few years about a dozen companies have made an impact on the market, notably Blue Diamond, Eluwalla, Sifani and Zam Gems. Some have specialised in large-scale exports while others, such as Sifani, specialise in adaptations of top-of-the-range jewellery. Official Sri Lankan exports in jewellery have soared in the last two years from just SLRs94m in 1990 to SLRs310m in 1992. Purchases by foreign tourists, who carry jewellery out of the country unrecorded, could boost the value of the export trade to around SLRs1bn in 1993. One notable success story for Sri Lanka has been the cutting and polishing of imported diamonds. In the space of just four years, with foreign capital and help, the industry has grown from nothing to annual exports projected this year at SLRs8bn; up 16 per cent on last year and nearly double that of 1991. Although added value is only 20 per cent on diamond polishing compared to more than 95 per cent for gems mined domestically, many hope it will presage a new era for Sri Lanka's industry. The most ambitious are hoping the country will follow the Thai road and import rough stones and gems from all over the world, for cutting, polishing and making into jewellery. To help achieve this goal, parliament has just passed two new acts setting up a national gem and jewellery authority to engage in research and offer training and promotion, and a gem bank to provide access to much-needed capital. Sri Lanka's gem mining, cutting and jewellery business employs about 300,000 people in a country where 25 per cent of the land is said to be potentially gem bearing. Colombo seems finally to have woken up to the fact that its main potential competitor and teacher, Thailand, is heading towards a business with a total annual turnover of Dollars 4bn in 1993 and it wants a much larger slice of the action. Says Dr Karunatilleke: 'Sri Lanka's industry has never been fully exploited because 80 per cent of it has been under ground. But with the new bank offering credit and the gem authority providing training I am optimistic that many traders will decide to go legitimate and give us the modern industry we are all looking for.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SRI LANKAN STATE GEM CORPORATION Exports (SLRs millions)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year           Gems    Geuda*    Jewellery    Diamonds**    Total*** 1988          1,425       529           74             -       2,029 1989          1,351       554           77         1,904       3,886 1990          1,840       597           94         2,036       4,567 1991          1,569       634          252         1,986       4,441 1992          1,621       456          310         4,501       6,888  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992            788       223          122         1,523       2,656 1993            900       234          180         3,419       4,733  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes: * Geuda are milky white rough stones, later heat-treated to turn          them into valuable gems       ** Sri Lanka does not mine diamonds.

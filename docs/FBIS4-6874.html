			<p>BFN     [Text] Looking back at the disturbances created over the  issue of the national welfare tax, Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said at a dinner meeting with Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio  Hatoyama on the evening of 20 April that "the Ministry of  Finance [MOF] took advantage of me." In this regard, Jiro  Saito, administrative vice finance minister, made a comment at a  news conference on 21 April and smiled wryly, saying, "I have no  knowledge of taking advantage of the prime minister." He even  looked angry for a moment.    The prime minister reportedly said: "I wanted to use the  power of the MOF. On the contrary, however, the ministry took  advantage of me over the issue of the national welfare tax and  other issues." The prime minister reportedly did some  soul-searching at a midnight news conference as well. He  sounded as if he was saying he failed because he acted in  accordance with the MOF's recommendations.    In this regard, Saito first said "I think I should not  comment on this because I heard it from others." He then denied  a rumor that "the Ministry of Finance masterminded the national  welfare tax plan."</p>

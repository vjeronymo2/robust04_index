			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Pensions ombudsman warns of risk to payouts The government's proposal for a pension compensation scheme for victims of fraud and theft will still leave large numbers of pension scheme members without a safety net, the pensions ombudsman said yesterday. The ombudsman, Mr Michael Platt, was delivering the annual report of the office. Although he welcomed the proposed compensation plan, intended to cover members in the event of fraud, theft or misappropriation of assets, 'there could continue to be instances of malpractice or gross maladministration outside these categories. So the members of these schemes may still be at risk of losing some or all of their entitlement'. He stopped short of endorsing a wider compensation scheme, saying that the government should not allow companies to neglect their obligations and expect the scheme to foot the bill. Mr Platt said in the report he had ordered more than Pounds 900,000 of restitution to be paid to pension scheme members. The number of complaints brought to the ombudsman in the year ended March 31 was broadly unchanged from the previous two years at 2,179. The largest single payment was Pounds 190,000 paid to a former executive whose employer had claimed he owed the company money. The employer was sole trustee of the pension scheme and, in what the ombudsman determined was an example of conflict of interest by a trustee, deducted the disputed amount from the executive's pension. The trustee should have paid the sum to the scheme member, Mr Platt said. 'In refusing to do so until the other matters were resolved, it had placed its corporate interests first.' The report singles out conflict of interest by professional advisers, particularly among small schemes, as a prime area of concern. 'Small companies do rely on advisers; I have on occasion been disappointed to see that the adviser did not take an ethically strong stance,' said Mr Platt. Members have also complained about the winding up of schemes. This often happens when an employer becomes insolvent. The ombudsman notes that in the past 18 months there has been an increasing number of complaints from members of schemes which are winding up and which had been marketed by Crown Financial Management. In early 1993 the business was transferred to Century Life. Eighty-five per cent of the business transferred to Century is being wound up and it will be years before all members in plans formerly administered by Crown will be able to ascertain all their benefits.</p>

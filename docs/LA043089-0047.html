			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> John Galen Davenport, the last of four Orange County men to be retried after  the state Supreme Court reversed their death sentences, has been sentenced to  death again. Davenport, 34, of Tustin was convicted eight years ago of the  March 27, 1980, murder of Gayle Ann Lingle, 30, in a Fullerton field. She had  been stabbed more than a dozen times and was found impaled on a 4-foot wooden  stake. The state Supreme Court under Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird upheld  Davenport's conviction but ordered a new death penalty trial, ruling that  errors had been made by the trial judge and the prosecutor.  </P></p>

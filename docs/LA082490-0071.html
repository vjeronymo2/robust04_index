TRY ADOPT-A-SAILOR PROGRAM  </P> <P> The Navy has set up a postal adopt-a-sailor program so Americans can write to  Navy and Marine personnel in the Persian Gulf, a Washington official said  Thursday.  </P> <P> A post office box has been set up in response to thousands of requests from  Americans who wish to show their support but do not know individual servicemen  or servicewomen overseas, said Cmdr.  </P> <P> Jim Mitchell, a Navy spokesman in Washington. It is not intended for families  of military personnel in the gulf, he added.  </P> <P> "This allows a manageable way for people to be supportive," Mitchell said.  "It's a real morale boost for the sailors and Marines. And this is a way to get  mail to people who might not otherwise get it. Mail call is very important, and  when you don't get it, it's pretty hard."  </P> <P> Only letters mailed first-class and weighing less than 12 ounces will be  forwarded to sailors and Marines deployed in the gulf.  </P> <P> The address is:  </P> <P> Any Servicemember  </P> <P> Operation Desert Shield  </P> <P> SPO New York  </P> <P> 09866-0006  </P></p>

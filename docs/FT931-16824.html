			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / French schools to shelter homeless France's education minister, Mr Jack Lang, yesterday ordered schools and universities to shelter the homeless from a week-old cold spell that has killed seven people, reports Reuter from Paris. Temperatures have dropped below freezing throughout France, reaching minus 15 Celsius in places. In Italy, the death toll rose to four as wintry weather gripped the country, covering the normally mild south with thick snow. The Interior Ministry is sending 600 men from its Civil Protection Unit to provide emergency aid for parts of the south without water and electricity. In Germany, ice blocked shipping on a 200km stretch of the River Main yesterday.</p>

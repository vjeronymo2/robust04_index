			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Drayton Consld holders agree to wind up trust SHAREHOLDERS in Drayton Consolidated Trust, which specialises in unquoted holdings, yesterday agreed to appoint liquidators and to wind up the trust. After the final valuation of the assets, the amount available for distribution to shareholders will be Pounds 31.9m, or 93.3p per share. First payment will be made on December 31. A new trust, Second Consolidated, is being established to manage the unquoted holdings. Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures will take over primary responsibility for the management of the trust, with the previous manager, Invesco MIM, continuing as joint manager. The aim of the trust will be to realise the assets. However, Mr Rod Richards, a director of Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures, said that Second Consolidated would not be a forced seller. 'Some investments will be realisable reasonably quickly, others however will not achieve satisfactory prices until the economy moves out of recession,' he said.</p>

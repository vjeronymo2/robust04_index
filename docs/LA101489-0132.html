			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HITTING THE DESERT TRAIL;  </P> <P> RECREATION: DESERT OUTINGS ALLOW WOULD-BE COWBOYS AND COWGIRLS TO EXPERIENCE  THE WILDERNESS, AND GIVE TRAIL-RIDING CLUBS A CHANCE TO RAISE FUNDS.  </P> <P> It's 6:15 on a chilly morning in the desert. The smell of coffee brewing and  sausage cooking on an open grill wafts through the camp as the horses chomp on  a breakfast of hay and grain. The rising sun exaggerates the desert's colorful  face, turning rocks red and the hills orange, creating a multitoned earth.  </P> <P> Yup, this is the life: snake holes, pricker bushes and the smell of fly spray.  Camp Med for the Wild Bills and Calamity Janes at heart. And you don't have to  be familiar with the desert or the mountains to experience it. That's what  trail guides and trail riding clubs are for.  </P> <P> This particularly isolated campsite belongs to the Happy Hoofers. The Blythe,  Calif.-based equestrian group sponsors a three-day trail ride each year to  raise funds for its rodeo performances.  </P> <P> The campsite is on a private ranch just over the Arizona border in the high  desert. Though the ranch is only about 240 acres, the surrounding government  land -- taking in the Bill Williams River and Buckskin Mountains -- is  accessible to horses and riders and offers seemingly infinite views of red-rock  mountains and wide-open desert.  </P> <P> "You can see things you can't see from a car," trail guide Ralph Goleman says.  "There's no civilization."  </P> <P> Goleman and his wife, Billie, of Blythe were hired to lead one ride each day  for the Hoofers. Their group takes a four-hour excursion across the Bill  Williams River (in an area where water is scarce and neighboring towns have  long battled for the rights to the river) up into the Buckskin Mountains, where  mountain lions and bobcats share the wilderness with the monarch butterfly.  </P> <P> The rules of the trail are simple: Stay behind the trail boss; faster horses to  the front, and no running (the terrain is the challenge, not the speed).  </P> <P> It's important because of the rugged terrain, says Billie Goleman, who rides  "drag" behind the group, to "make sure you don't get yourself in a position  where you get hurt or get your horse hurt."  </P> <P> While the riders are a mix of veterans and novices, most of the horses seem to  take the adventure in stride -- at least until the first obstacle.  </P> <P> Just 15 minutes into the ride, the narrow Bill Williams River literally  separates the true trail horses from nags that are strictly show-ring material.  After most of the horses stomp ungracefully, though confidently, through the  shallow water, one horse refuses to take the plunge, reacting as though he's  been asked to jump Niagara Falls.  </P> <P> After numerous tries and as many suggestions on how to coax the animal, the  horse is finally led across by a halter, trotting on his way.  </P> <P> Following trails forged by wild burros which make their way from the mountain  grazing grounds to the river, the riders navigate narrow ledges on the steep  slopes of the canyons, the ground sometimes crumbling under the horses' hoofs.  So the guides don't get lost, Goleman says a trail boss "picks certain  landmarks and keeps them in view so you know where you are."  </P> <P> But on this ride, rarely does there seem to be a "trail" visible. The horses  trudge along nevertheless, through river beds thick with dust, over the winding  burro paths through the rocky canyon.  </P> <P> Signs of life along the trail are limited to the inevitable vultures circling,  though snake holes and feathers and other signs of wildlife are everywhere. The  only sign of humans, however, is the skeleton of an abandoned mine shaft  clutching the side of the canyon.  </P> <P> "You never litter -- whatever you take in, you pack it in the saddlebag and  bring out," says Ruth Harness, a veteran trail rider. "We all like to see a  clean desert, so we want to keep it that way."  </P> <P> Whether riding in the desert or mountains, it's a challenge -- and a historical  experience. Riding the trails with nothing more than a horse and the supplies  that will fit in a saddlebag, riders get a feel for the Wild West that pioneers  confronted a century or more ago. But part of the thrill of trail riding is  discovering parts of that era that still exist.  </P> <P> "People who ride trails are out to enjoy the unblemished scenery, the country  and the companionship of animals," Ralph Goleman says. "It's a challenge to  find different areas like this to ride."  </P> <P> At the halfway point, the group stops for lunch in a canyon lined by shade  trees. The canyon floor is covered with rocks which settled as the rushing  waters disappeared decades ago. The riders tie their mounts to trees, but  veteran trail horses will stay put with nothing more than a rein secured under  a rock the size of a basketball. After settling in the shade with their  lunches, the riders trade stories of the trail.  </P> <P> Once a month, Bonnie Ghianni of Alpine, a member of San Diego's Las Damas  riding club, makes a six-hour drive to Wickenburg, Ariz., for the monthly ride  sponsored by the Phoenix Las Damas.  </P> <P> "I go over on Wednesday, ride Thursday and go home on Friday," she says. "And  when we're not riding, we shop."  </P> <P> Rather than haul her horse and trailer along for a one-day ride, Ghianni rents  a horse from a Wickenburg stable. It costs about $35, "and that includes tack  and bringing the horse out to wherever the ride is." There's no charge for the  ride itself, just for lunch.  </P> <P> Why drive all the way to Wickenburg to ride?  </P> <P> "Just to see everybody," Ghianni says. "After you start going on the weeklong  rides, you meet so many new friends. . . . It's more than getting out on a  horse, it's the camaraderie."  </P> <P> Harness, 69, has been trail riding for 38 years. A dedicated horsewoman, she is  also a member of Las Damas and of the Desert Saddle Bags, a women's group in  Phoenix, and Saddle Mountain Riders, a couples' group she belongs to with her  husband, Leslie.  </P> <P> What keeps her back in the saddle is her love of the animals and the relaxation  she finds in the great outdoors.  </P> <P> "The minute I load my horse and drive out of the driveway, I forget about  work," says Harness, who owns a real-estate business.  </P> <P> "We're all drawn here by a common bond -- the horse," Harness says. "You have  this in common with other people and you talk the language. You rarely talk  business -- you don't even think of business."  </P> <P> Though the rides are relaxing, not all are uneventful.  </P> <P> Harness recalls a run-in with a swarm of wasps. The lead riders had stirred  them up, she says, and by the time the other riders came through, the wasps  were out for revenge.  </P> <P> "If a horsefly or something gets after the horse, their instinct is to run and  buck and try to get away -- we had about five of us on bucking horses.  </P> <P> "I still have a phobia about wasps."  </P> <P> By the time lunch ends, the desert sun is beating down. A tan is not an  objective for trail riders, so veteran riders wear long-sleeved shirts, long  pants and hats to guard not only against the sun, but also wayward branches and  nature's pests.  </P> <P> Heading for home, the riders clomp through a dried riverbed, near scattered,  sun-bleached animal bones and decaying branches and ragged trees -- it's good  to know the camp is just around the next hill.  </P> <P> But trail rides aren't necessarily all beans, dust and discomfort. In fact, the  Happy Hoofers serve pancakes, eggs, sausage, hot biscuits and fresh-squeezed  orange juice for breakfast; for dinner, riders feast on steak and lobster,  complete with salad bar. (There's more than one use for a horse trough.)  Certainly not the kind of "vittles" one might expect in a chuck wagon out on  the trail.  </P> <P> Dehydration isn't a problem either, even as the temperature crawls toward 100  degrees. A beverage truck parked next to the food tent is the first sign of  camp on the return trip from the trail.  </P> <P> "It takes lots of preplanning," says Geneil Wilson, head Hoofer. "We brought  out the equipment (including a custom-built trailer -- two-thirds kitchen,  one-third shower room), the tent and the port-a-potties a week ahead."  </P> <P> Other Hoofers say Wilson's experience as a campground owner is the reason they  are well-prepared trail-ride hosts -- although, Wilson chuckles, "I left the  butter at home once . . . the riders were vicious."  </P> <P> The supplies for the Hoofers' three-day ride include 60 pounds of potatoes, 100  pounds of steak, 90 pounds of lobster, 140 pounds of turkey (for a  Thanksgiving-themed dinner) and 20 gallons of milk -- not to mention more than  12,000 pounds of hay.  </P> <P> Equestrian Trails Inc. has 66 groups, called "corrals," in California. Created  in 1944, the nonprofit organization says it is "dedicated to the acquisition  and preservation of trails, good horsemanship and equine legislation."  </P> <P> Corral 22, based in San Fernando Valley, hosts two rides a month -- a day ride  and a weekend ride.  </P> <P> "There's usually no charge, unless we stay overnight or provide food," says  Gwen Allen, Corral 22 president.  </P> <P> Destinations range from Griffith Park (where horse and equipment rentals are  available) to Yosemite National Park. Most riders have their own horses and  equipment. Coming up in November, Equestrian Trails hosts its annual  five-and-a-half-day ride through Death Valley. For information, call Allen at  (818) 367-1401. For information on other corrals, call the ETI office in  Sylmar, (818) 362-6819.  </P> <P> Membership in ETI is $25 per year, $35 for a family. Most individual rides are  free (unless catered). The Death Valley ride is $280, but this includes all  food for riders and their horses, Allen says, in addition to transportation of  equipment.  </P> <P> The Norco Mounted Posse will lead a weeklong ride (open to the public) across  the Mojave Desert the first week in April. The group, with assistance from the  Bureau of Land Management, follows the path of old mail runs. Riders will cover  20-25 miles a day and camp at historical points along the way. Call trail boss  Bob Wright at (714) 734-5566. Cost of $275-$300 includes food for rider and  horse, and transportation of camping gear.  </P></p>

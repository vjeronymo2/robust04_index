			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 28 (XINHUA) -- President Boris Yeltsin  today urged Russians to restore accord in Russia and called the  signing of the civil accord treaty "an event of historical  importance."    Opening the signing ceremony held in the Kremlin, the  Russian  president stressed the need to stop the bloody events, to remove  the shadow of civil war from Russia and to put an end to civil  confrontation.    He noted any party, organization and mass movement can join  the treaty, proposed by him in late February immediately after  the State Duma (the lower house of the parliament) declared the  political amnesty for his main opponents including former  Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy and former parliament Speaker  Ruslan Khasbulatov.    This can be done by all who are ready to assume  responsibility for civil peace in the country, Yeltsin said.  "The key idea of this document is non-violence in achieving  political goals," he added.    Present at the signing ceremony were the president, Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin, chairman  of the federation council (the upper house of the parliament)  Vladimir Shumeyko, leaders of local regions, and heads of  parliamentary groups, political parties, mass movements, trade  unions and religious denominations.    The president urged participants in the ceremony for  reconciliation, "Let us help Russia to get rid of civil war  forever for the sake of preserving the fatherland and calm of  our children. Let our joint efforts be crowned with success,"  Yeltsin stated.    Speaking at the ceremony, Shumeyko expressed the hope that  "this treaty is not for politicians and public figures but for  the whole people."    Rybkin noted in his speech that all the participants had  proclaimed "the need to ease social tension, develop normal  relations between the branches of power and deepen economic  reforms in the interests of the entire people."    At the ceremony, Patriarch Alexiy II of Moscow stressed the  need to "continue and deepen our (Russians) accord and, finally  realize that we are responsible for Russia and its future."</p>

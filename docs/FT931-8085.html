			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Food and Drink: Baffling Belgians in the course of a meal - Jancis Robinson found more than a few food frontiers to cross when she dined with some very particular guests I HAVE become very interested in Belgians recently. The French may take wine and food seriously, but they are babes in arms compared with the Belgians. I say this with all the authority of one who spent a weekend in Leuwen - or was it Louvain? - last autumn and who spent far too much of a day recently being interviewed, in London, for a Belgian magazine. It is rare for the interviewee to learn more than the interviewer, but I did on this occasion. The man from Brussels got little out of our encounter, other than exasperation at my inability to get to grips with his dauntingly all-embracing instruction: 'Tell me about European wine.' But he had brought with him a Belgian photographer, a fascinating young man who had been brought up in a restaurant, his father being a restaurateur. Thus, although the young Belgian was there in clicking mode, he could not help passing on various epicureanisms in the restaurant where we met for lunch. That was my first mistake. I suggested we meet at Clarke's, Sally Clarke's Kensington restaurant with a California accent on both its food and wine. It therefore proved rather more difficult than it might otherwise have been to field the bottles of European wine required for the photograph. Nor could my two Belgian friends quite believe that the fresh face at the char grill belonged not just to the chef but to the patronne. While we waited for our first course, the photographer asked politely where she had trained. I would have liked a photograph of his face when I told him California. Soon after this the wine arrived. Assuming they would be interested to taste something out of the ordinary, I had ordered a bottle of Au Bon Climat Chardonnay. The name may be French but the provenance is an old barn in California's Santa Barbara County. They viewed it rather as one might a dog with three legs. The photographer was particularly worried about the means used to cool the bottle. 'I was taught,' he said, 'that you should never cool wine in a fridge, only in an ice bucket.' I can see the logic of this if you are running a restaurant full of fault-finding Belgians. Wines, especially fizzy ones, left for more than a few days in a fridge can lose their fruit, and stock rotation is much more difficult in a restaurant than at home. But my photographer friend clearly thought that wine itself is capable of sensing by which method it is being transformed from temperature A to B, and of reacting accordingly. 'Excuse me,' he then asked politely over the first course, 'but would you normally drink wine with soup? I was taught you never should.' An interesting point that, and one we discussed at some length. It is true that since soup slakes thirst, there should be no need to drink anything with it, but I could not convince the photographer that there was nothing about the flavour of soup per se that was inherently inimical to wine. However, in Belgium you do not serve wine with soup. I felt bad about making him party to this solecism. Then we discussed corkscrews. The Belgians were horrified by my enthusiasm for the Screwpull Lever model, which has transformed my life, involving as it sometimes does the extraction of more than 50 corks a day. But, they pointed out in unison, there is the possibility that the point of the screw might emerge below the cork and push a particle of said cork into the wine. So what? I said. The interviewer scribbled madly. 'We've got a right revolutionary here,' said his furtive look to the photographer. All this instructive observation of assumed national behaviour had been presaged by my Belgian weekend, where a group of us wine tasters had our knees under some table or other almost every waking hour (although we did spend a lot of time snoozing in the back of cars between meals). Tastings would be punctuated by little platefuls of truffle or foie gras and every glass was religiously rinsed with the relevant wine, even precious Yquem, before being used for tasting - and we must have tasted at least five dozen wines during the weekend. Wine thermometers were much in evidence. Our host's son had driven 500 miles (800 kilometres) to Epernay to buy the right sort of beef for Sunday lunch. Whenever a course was served it was fallen upon and ravished in a noisy - though wordless - food-dedicated interval before the upright position and conversation could be resumed. But the most riveting sight, the one that convinced me that a Belgian's vocation is to eat and drink, was of a piece of gastronomic equipment which I have never encountered elsewhere but which raised not an eyebrow in Belgian company. Just before each meal, the really keen members of our party would take from their pockets or handbags a small chain about a foot long with an ornamental clip at each end. They would reverently arrange this chain around the back of the neck before using them to clip their napkins neatly up to the chin. The ritual unclipping was invariably accompanied by a sigh of sated melancholy. For a thoroughly Belgian antidote to all this reverence, Londoners should head for the impressively, jokily, spartan Belgo restaurant in Chalk Farm Road, NW1. Great value for moules, and beers to turn the head of the most convinced wine lover.</p>

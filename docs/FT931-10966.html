			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Washington sets up early meeting of G7 THE Clinton administration last night signalled a desire for more effective global co-ordination of economic policies by announcing an early meeting in Europe of ministers from the Group of Seven industrial countries and saying that Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, will attend. The decision to hold a G7 meeting earlier than expected, later this month or in early March, was unveiled by a Treasury official. It is a sign of the importance attached by the White House to promotion of faster growth worldwide. Momentum has been building for a G7 meeting, including a call on Monday by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, for a spring summit of the G7 to co-ordinate macroeconomic policy. Yesterday, Mr Delors made an impassioned plea for vigorous leadership to relaunch world economic growth, combined with a warning that, if the EC could not co-ordinate policy with the US, it would have to stand up to it. The meeting of G7 ministers will give Mr Bentsen an early opportunity to get acquainted with his counterparts in other G7 countries. However, he is certain to discuss ways to stimulate growth and stabilise European currencies. The US administration is acutely aware that recessionary forces abroad could depress US exports and weaken what looks to be a promising domestic recovery. Since his nomination as treasury secretary, Mr Bentsen has repeatedly stated his determination to 'reinvigorate' the G7 consultation process. Mr Delors's remarks come amid worsening relations with the US after Washington's imposition of anti-dumping duties on European steel and its threat to block EC bids for US public procurement contracts. 'Over the last couple of years, there has been a total lack of world leadership: a drop in co-operation between the G7, a drop in co-operation between the (EC) member states,' he told a European Socialist conference on jobs and growth. The result was punishing interest rates, mayhem on the currency markets, and no macroeconomic co-ordination. 'The speculators are virtually running things,' he said. He denounced the US's unilateral imposition of trade sanctions on the EC. He referred angrily to what he called President Bill Clinton's 'need to preen in front of the mirror to make sure that his muscles are still firm', and said that, if Europe allowed itself to be trampled on by Washington's trade policy, 'I disavow that Europe'. Mr Delors told the conference that 'classic models of growth are not sufficient to produce jobs', and that 'the Community cannot survive without an industrial policy'. In wide-ranging, unscripted remarks, he said the EC should also reappraise whether it could let itself be undercut by competitors with sweat-shop labour conditions, remarks taken to refer to questions of whether Mexico comes to agreements with the US and Canada on environmental standards and working conditions, under the North American Free Trade Area treaty.</p>

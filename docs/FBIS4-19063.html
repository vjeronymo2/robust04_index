			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Alfredo Biondi, deputy speaker of the </F> Italian Chamber of Deputies and Forza Italia deputy, by Maurizio  Ricci in Rome; date not given: "Fazio? He Too Is To Resign" --  first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Excerpts] Rome -- Eliminating the old powers, wherever  they are, and starting again from the beginning. Alfredo  Biondi, deputy speaker of the old Chamber of Deputies and  potential successor to [Chamber speaker] Giorgio Napolitano,  explains that the logic of the "new broom" is the logic of the  majority system, and that this requires the majority to assume  its responsibilities in every area. [passage omitted]    [Ricci] What does this [shift to the majority system] mean  for the office of speaker of the Chamber of Deputies?    [Biondi] With the majority system, the majority is  responsible for leading parliament.    [Ricci] In both the Chamber and the Senate?    [Biondi] In the Senate, which is the second institutional  body of the state, tradition demands that the speaker position  be given to a person with the highest qualifications and who  also has a certain independence. But in the Chamber too, it is  important to have someone who can offer reliability and balance.  I have always guaranteed this and I believe that, in  parliament, the problem lies in the organization of dissent.  Consent, the majority already has. Hence the need to secure the  role of the opposition. For example, if the speaker ought to  come from the majority, I also find it natural that the  speaker's office include opposition representatives.    [Ricci] And the committees?    [Biondi] The majority has always held the chair of the  committees.    [Ricci] But Communist Renewal, for example, maintains that  this reasoning does not apply to those parliamentary bodies with  a more specific control function.    [Biondi] It is true that I too do not believe that this  criterion applies to bicameral committees. We can even have  here chairpersons coming from the opposition. Certainly, to  them too applies the criterion that the persons appointed should  guarantee balance and reliability, as has not always been the  case.    [Ricci] And the administration? What criterion ought to  apply: the American "spoil system," in which the victor in the  elections changes most of the top levels in the administration,  or the European one, with a clear separation between state and  politicians?    [Biondi] The European one.    [Ricci] Why then does your colleague [Center Union member]  Costa talk of changing at least 120 state appointments?    [Biondi] Costa is talking about a meritocratic reselection,  not a political purification. The bureaucracy which has  survived under the protection of ministers has, in recent years,  been the bastion of conservatism. The minister needs to have  the courage and the opportunity to select for himself those  people he wants to work with.    [Ricci] Is this what is happening with the "professors" of  the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] board of directors?    [Biondi] Anyone appointed by speakers of chambers which have  now been dissolved ought to ask himself whether he should remain  in the post to which he was appointed.    [Ricci] And control bodies like CONSOB [Commission for the  Supervision of Companies and Stock Exchanges] and the Antitrust  Committee?    [Biondi] These are collegiate bodies, where there is the  possibility of integration, and hence, naturally, of internal  flexibility. Naturally, anyone finding the new government's  policies incompatible with his own ideas can always resign.    [Ricci] But it is these bodies which will have to examine  closely the entrepreneurial activities of the probable future  prime minister.    [Biondi] [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi has said that he  is  ready to sell and I believe him. Politics, I can assure you, is  a contagious craft. On the other hand, he has a dominant  position in television and I am ready to recognize that, without  this, Forza Italia would still have been successful, but in a  more limited way. As an old liberal I say that this dominant  position is incompatible with freedom.    [Ricci] One moment. Here we have two different problems.  One is that of Berlusconi's entrepreneurial activities.    [Biondi] And here I am saying that his position today is  incompatible with the office of prime minister. Even  politically, he would become a puppet target of a thousand  polemics. Obviously he is entitled to safeguard his own assets.  He should not strip himself of everything like Francis of  Assisi.    [Ricci] And the second is that of television pluralism.    [Biondi] And here I say that the government is not  everything. Parliament is sovereign and is able to review the  Mammi law [on broadcasting], achieving a better pluralism, one  which excludes duopoly, but, I add as an old liberal, oligopoly  as well.</p>

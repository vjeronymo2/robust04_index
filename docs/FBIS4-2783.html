			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yonghong: "Project for Modernized </F> Farming is Expanded"]    [Text] China's experimental Green Certificate Training  Project will be extended nationwide in an ambitious drive to  help millions of its farmers learn practical technical theories  and expertise for agricultural production.    "Under the project, 8 million to 10 million farmers will be  trained to be qualified Green-Certificate holders by 2000," said  Deputy Agriculture Minister Zhang Yanxi at a press conference  over the weekend that announced the programme's expansion.    The project's goal is to ensure that one in every 20  households in rural China has a professional farmer with some  scientific knowledge and technical expertise, becoming a  backbone for local agricultural production and economic  development.    The training project is significant for the entire country's  agriculture advancement, said Zhang. The new corps of trained  farmers will help the government to reach its goal of putting 60  percent of agricultural research results into practical  applications by the end of the century. Currently, less than 40  percent of results get applied.    The Green Certificate is considered proof of a farmer's  knowledge and expertise for a designated technical job in  agriculture.    China initiated its training project experimentally in 1990.  So far, it has involved 362 pilot counties in 28 provinces,  municipalities and autonomous regions across China.    The vocational training has been given to more than 300,000  farmers, of whom 80,000 have obtained certificates, Zhang said.    The training project covers such subjects as cultivation,  animal husbandry and veterinary science, aquaculture,  agricultural machinery, management of the rural cooperative  economy and rural environmental protection.    As stipulated by the projects the certificate is issued by  the Ministry of Agriculture to a farmer who has successfully  completed theoretical study and practical training in a specific  subject and who has demonstrated accomplishments in practical  skills.    The training normally takes two years, but for some  specialties-- such as cultivation and animal husbandry--the  study period will be longer.    "The implementation of the Green Certificate project is not  only necessary for the ongoing bid to promote high-yield,  good-quality and high-efficiency agriculture, but it is  imperative for the country's rural modernization drive," Zhang  noted.    According to the project, the certificate holders will be in  a better position to obtain contracts and loans, technical  instruction, and other necessary government support.    As the country with the world's largest rural population of  900 million, China has more than 430 million people engaged in  its rural labour force.    However, two-thirds of these farmers are illiterate or  poorly  educated. Their low level of education in science and  technology is regarded by the government as a major obstacle to  the development of China's agricultural productivity and rural  economic progress.    A new generation of farmers, with both high school and  vocational education in scientific knowledge and technical  expertise, is vital for rural economic growth</p>

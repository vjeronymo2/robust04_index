			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 9 Jun (MENA) -- Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas, who has been appointed prime minister in south Yemen,  has warned that the persistence of the crisis will lead to major  escalation and produce gloomy regional repercussions, including  possible internationalization of the crisis.    In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM published today,  al-'Attas said: We are now limiting our efforts on reaching a  cease-fire and agreeing on a formula for future conditions in  the country. If Sanaa insists, however, on maintaining the  crisis, the future will be bleak.    Al-'Attas praised Egypt's historic support for Yemeni  interests since the 1970's up until the breakout of the recent  ferocious civil war that Egypt, under the leadership of  President Mubarak, is trying to stop.    Al-'Attas affirmed that if the northerners continue the war  and escalate hostitilies, many countries may hasten to recognize  the Democratic Republic of Yemen.    Al-'Attas accused Iraq of intervening to help Sanaa in the  current fighting.    He said the war has undermined the union and made the  division of Yemen a fact. He remarked that Yemen cannot be  stable if it continues to comprise two warring states and for  this reason a formula must be found that would preserve each  state's independence while still maintaining some relationship  between them.</p>

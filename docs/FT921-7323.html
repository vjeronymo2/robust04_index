			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Marketing rules for accountants are eased COMPANIES may have to prepare for a bombardment from accountants after yesterday's easing of the rules governing their use of aggressive marketing techniques. Chartered accountants offering to sell any service except financial reporting work to non-clients will now be able to make unsolicited visits or telephone calls. They will also be able to charge contingency fees based on a proportion of the income generated for a client, in work such as corporate finance work or tax advice. Audit and related services are excluded from the liberalisation, but cold-calling will be acceptable for work including tax and management consultancy. The revelations come in the latest professional ethics guide issued by the joint ethics committee of institutes of chartered accountants in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The guidelines offer tightening of regulations in other areas. They frown on the recruitment services offered by many accountancy firms to help audit clients find senior financial and administrative staff. They warn that the final decision on any selection must be made by the client. No firm should allow the fees from a quoted company or group of companies to exceed 10 per cent of its income. Once the figure rises above 5 per cent, there should be an independent review to ensure there is no threat to the firm's independence. Firms should also seriously consider resigning as auditor if there is litigation with its clients. No partner or individual closely connected with the partner should hold shares or other beneficial interests in a client. That includes personal equity plans. The guide recommends that firms should consider rotating partners and other senior staff involved with particular clients to provide safeguards against a loss of independence. Recommendations on three of the topics for which accountants have received strongest criticism in recent months - insolvency work, discounting on fee income and valuation of brands - are still being drafted and will not appear at least until summer.

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance and Royal Insurance exchange arms ROYAL INSURANCE has acquired the Canadian subsidiary of Sun Alliance, its rival composite insurer, in its first overseas purchase for five years. In a parallel move, Sun Alliance will acquire Royal's New Zealand business. Both deals take effect in January. No terms were disclosed. Net assets of the Canadian business amounted to CDollars 71m (Pounds 35.5m) at the end of last year, while the New Zeland operation had net assets of NZDollars 8m (Pounds 3m). 'This is a sign that we are moving onto the front foot,' said Mr Roy Randall, head of corporate relations at Royal, which is moving back into profit after three years of heavy losses. Royal is the fourth biggest insurer in Canada and the deal reinforced its commitment to Canada. Mr Roger Neville, group chief executive of Sun Alliance, said the New Zealand deal confirmed its position as third largest insurer in that country.</p>

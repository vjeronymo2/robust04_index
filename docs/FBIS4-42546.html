			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F> Alessandro Caprettini; place and date not given: "Rest Assured,  We Will Not Go Back to the Polls" -- first four paragraphs are  L'INDIPENDENTE introduction]    [Text] Rome -- Yes, the majority has lost some ground, but  we must not dramatize things. [National Alliance leader]  Gianfranco Fini professes to be optimistic.    He does not believe the rumors concerning gathering storms,  and he seems to rule out further elections, a possibility which  -- rumor has it -- some Forza Italia members may have been  contemplating.    In any case, in order to avoid further jolts, Fini is making  haste to wear the hat of the patient mediator between an  aggressive Nothern League Secretary Bossi and a haywire Prime  Minister Berlusconi.    Thus he is facing up to those constantly reproaching him for  being nostalgic about rough woolen cloth and high boots  [reference to fascist uniform].    [Caprettini] The committee war in the Senate, quarrels,  mutual accusations.... Deputy Fini, is the majority already  beginning to fall apart?    [Fini] Not at all! The election campaign is still not  over.... The situation will go back to normal after 12 June. As  regards the committee chairmanships which the majority failed to  obtain in the Senate, I do not believe they will be an obstacle  to the government's action.    [Caprettini] However, there is already some talk of going  back to the polls.    [Fini] No, I do not believe elections will be necessary.    [Caprettini] Not even if Bossi continues his offensive  against Forza Italia?    [Fini] I repeat: For his election campaign, Bossi has chosen  to clash with Berlusconi because he fears that his own identity  may be watered down or swamped. This is why he is raising his  voice. I do not justify his stand, but...let us say that I  understand his political logic. After the vote, however, I  think the problems will be solved. In fact, Bossi himself has  said that this majority is not to be tampered with for at least  another two years.    [Caprettini] However, can a negative result in the European  elections not lead the League to exacerbate the differences?    [Fini] If Bossi were to lose a lot of ground...then  something  may indeed happen. On the other hand, I am asking myself:  Where could he then go?    [Fini] Well, to the Left, I guess. His beckoning to the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left], his vaunted support for  Arlacchi's candidacy for the chairmanship of the Anti-Mafia  Commission....    [Fini] Mmmm, no.... (Here Fini made a grimace, he did not  believe that Bossi would start moving in a different direction  -- L'INDIPENDENTE editor's note) I do not believe that he is  seriously thinking of changing his position.    [Caprettini] Deputy Fini, what do you think of the fact that  the other day, speaking to his deputies, Berlusconi praised you  to the heavens? Do you wish to return his compliments?    [Fini] I must say that the prime minister was always very  straightforward with me, and therefore I reciprocate his trust  in me. Which does not mean, of course, that I have always  agreed with him.    [Caprettini] Have you already had some differences of  opinion?    [Fini] Over the intelligence services, for example. I would  have already started from scratch.    [Caprettini] What about Forza Italia's idea of opening a  dialogue with the PPI [Italian Popular Party] in the future, if  [PPI leader] Buttiglione wins the day?    [Fini] I agree that the majority must become broader, and  that it can show some interest in Buttiglione. We must,  however, establish a premise, namely, that it should be them who  approach the majority positions, rather than pretending that we  are shifting toward them.    [Caprettini] Today you were interviewed by THE WASHINGTON  POST, NEWSWEEK, and THE NEW YORK TIMES -- the entire U.S. press  is asking you whether you are a fascist, right?    [Fini] My God! I have done nothing but answer this very  question.    [Caprettini] What did you say about Mussolini?    [Fini] Exactly what I had already told LA STAMPA, and which  was in fact somewhat distorted, namely, that he was one of the  greatest Italian politicians in this century. I confirm this.    [Caprettini] What did you think of [Rome Mayor] Rutelli's  speech at the Capitol before the U.S. President -- in which he  stressed that there would never again be a dictatorship in Italy?    [Fini] He said the same things that I had already said in my  speech on trust, in the Chamber of Deputies.    [Caprettini] Finally, a word about Clinton. What is your  opinion of him?    [Fini] He is a pragmatist, like all Americans.</p>

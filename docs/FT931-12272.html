			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Indian economy set for recovery THE INDIAN government's efforts to instil confidence in the economy, following the recent inter-religious violence, yesterday received a boost with the publication of an official forecast predicting a growth rate of 4.2 per cent for the year to June 1993, Stefan Wagstyl reports from New Delhi. The figure suggests that the economy is set for a solid recovery after a sharp slow-down in 1991-92, when gross national product (GNP) grew by just 1.4 per cent. However, the disruption caused by riots in Bombay and other cities may have come too late to have been fully reflected in the forecast prepared by the government's Central Statistical Organisation. The main contribution to growth is the likely bumper performance of agriculture, which has benefited from exceptionally good weather. Farm output is expected to grow 4.2 per cent, according to the CSO. Construction and services, including financial services, are also expanding rapidly. However, manufacturing, which last year suffered a 2.3 per cent decline, is recovering only slowly. The CSO expects growth in manufacturing of just 3.5 per cent. This year's recovery is in line with the expectations of the government, and of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund which are assisting India's economic reform programme with loans. Last year's growth was held back by a tight squeeze by the government designed to cut imports and curb inflation. Now the authorities are slowly releasing their grip in the hope of promoting sustained growth fuelled by exports and by the opportunities created by deregulation. But there is still a long way to go before most Indians share the benefits of faster growth. With the population growing at 2 per cent a year, the CSO estimates that per capita output will increase this year by just 2.2 per cent.</p>

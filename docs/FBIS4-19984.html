			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 25 -- Polish Defence Minister Piotr  Kolodziejczyk handed over to NATO Deputy Secretary General  Sergio Balanzino a document including a list of spheres and  forms of cooperation with NATO proposed by Poland within the  Partnership for Peace programme, at the NATO Headquarters here  on Monday [25 April].    The NATO deputy secretary general said he hoped that an  individual programme of bilateral cooperation would be agreed  upon by Poland and NATO before the summer holidays in August.    Poland is the first partner to present a document including  details of her plans to develop closer links with NATO.    "We have never believed that the Partnership for Peace  initiative is a race with its winner receiving a prize of NATO  membership," Kolodziejczyk stressed, adding that Poland treated  this programme very seriously.    "We think that the initiative is giving an opportunity to us  -- and not only to us -- to construct a new European security,  and that is why we are aiming at setting up this system as soon  as possible."    Asked about Russia's participation in the programme,  Kolodziejczyk said it would be great if Russia would join the  states which wanted to build a secure Europe in this way.  However, he added one could not accept a situation when a  partnership gives more privileges to some members.    The Polish minister said the priorities proposed by Poland  included peace missions, humanitarian and rescue actions,  military manoeuvres, scientific exchange, trainings, and a  programme of full democratic control over the Armed Forces.    Kolodziejczyk also added that of importance were the issues  designed to settle communications procedures between the Polish  general staff and NATO Headquarters (Supreme Headquarters Allied  Powers Europe -- SHAPE) and the headquarters in Brussels.    After leaving the NATO Headquarters, Kolodziejczyk left for  a  meeting with Supreme Allied Commander Europe -- SACEUR Georg  Joulwan at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in  Casteau.</p>

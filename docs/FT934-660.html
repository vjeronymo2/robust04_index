			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Scott Pickford buys as profits more than double Scott Pickford, the USM-quoted petroleum consultant, yesterday reported more than doubled pre-tax profits for the half year to September 30. At the same time, it announced an acquisition which moves the company into a new business area. The purchase is of Samuel Denison, a maker and distributor of computer-controlled materials testing equipment, for an initial Pounds 1.15m. The consideration will be satisfied by the issue of 2.61m new ordinary shares, representing about 22.3 per cent of the enlarged capital, and Pounds 235,000 in cash. A further consideration, in either cash or shares up to a maximum Pounds 850,000, is dependent on Denison's pre-tax profits exceeding Pounds 675,000 in the year ending March 31 1995. On turnover up 55 per cent to Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.08m), the pre-tax result advanced to Pounds 209,114 (Pounds 103,167). The results included two months' trading from GAPS Geological Consultants, acquired in August. Earnings per share amounted to 1.89p (1p). The shares rose 5p yesterday to reach a high for the year of 40p.</p>

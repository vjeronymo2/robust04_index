			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORSE: A DATE WITH GREATNESS?;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: COACH JOHN SHACKLETT WON'T SAY IF THIS IS THE BEST HE'S HAD, 'BUT  IT'S GOING TO TAKE A HELL OF A BALLCLUB TO BEAT US.'  </P> <P> Homecoming at Morse is Nov. 2, and the quarterback of the best high school  football team in the county doesn't have a date for the dance.  </P> <P> Teddy Lawrence isn't really worried, but two weeks from now, he might be.  </P> <P> "I'm scared that I'm going to ask too late," he said. "You go around and ask a  certain amount of girls, and then they're going to say: 'Teddy's stressing for  a date. He needs a date bad.' "  </P> <P> How is it that a guy who gets so many recruiting letters that he doesn't even  bother to read them anymore is dateless for the big dance of fall?  </P> <P> "I think Teddy's kind of shy," Morse lineman Salua Poutoa said. "Teddy's the  shy type. But he'll get a date."  </P> <P> Probably so, but that may be the biggest challenge he faces until the section  playoffs. Top-ranked Morse (4-0) is crushing its opponents as if they were wine  grapes, and the toughest part of its season is already over. In a rematch of  last year's 3-A championship game Sept. 7, Morse pounded Rancho Buena Vista,  28-14, to paste a pleasant memory over last season's 21-7 loss in the final.  </P> <P> John Shacklett has coached at Morse since 1971, won two 3-A championships and  been runner-up two other times, but this is something a bit different. Morse is  so good that it has piqued the curiosity of an entire community. Of course,  like all coaches, Shacklett fidgets when asked if this is his greatest team,  but you get the idea that if it came to picking one, this would be his choice.  </P> <P> "I've never had a team that has gotten off this quickly, and I've had some good  teams in the past," he said. "I don't want to get too rambunctious about  predictions right now. We've got a good ballclub, and it's going to take a hell  of a ballclub to beat us. I don't know if there's one out there right now that  can."  </P> <P> It's hard to imagine there is, considering that Lawrence and running back Gary  Taylor are the top two rushers in the county. Lawrence has 504 yards in 27  carries for an 18.7 average. Taylor, a junior whose dad wouldn't let him play  varsity last year because he was too small, has 887 yards in 58 carries for a  15.3 average. That's 222 yards a game, and Taylor, who jumped from 155 pounds  to 168 since last year, has another season remaining. Scary.  </P> <P> Throw in five returning offensive lineman, including Poutoa, who at 290 has  never been told he's too small to do anything, and a defense that is plenty  good enough to complement (and compliment) an offense averaging 49 points a  game, and this team looks capable of providing Shacklett with his first  undefeated season.  </P> <P> Morse fans are gobbling it up. Shacklett keeps getting calls from people who  ask: "Who are you playing this week?" And then they want to know how good his  team really is. Section champs, maybe? Best in state, perhaps?  </P> <P> All this is fun, but Shacklett is feeling the pressure that goes with the  excitement of being the best team in town. The other day in a meeting with his  coaches, he got "a little fired up" when it was suggested that maybe Morse  should put a few new wrinkles in its plan for this Saturday's game against  Lincoln. Morse had a bye last weekend.  </P> <P> "I think I'm concerned about getting the kids moving again," he said. "So I put  some pressure on myself for this ballgame. They (the assistant coaches) said:  'We want to do this, and we want to do that.' I said: 'No, We're not doing  anything new this week. We're going to do the same thing we've done the last  four ball games.' I kind of told them off, and I realized at the time that I'd  gotten myself kind of worked up about the ballgame."  </P> <P> That kind of concern may not be necessary. Lincoln (0-4) is off to its worst  start since 1969, and even Shacklett concedes this shouldn't be much of a game  if Morse plays up to its capabilities.  </P> <P> "It's always a competitive game, but quite honestly, it's never been this  lopsided on paper," he said. "I'm more worried about our players being too  keyed up. We played the worst game of the entire season last year against  Lincoln, and it's all because I probably didn't do a very good job of settling  them down."  </P> <P> Too ready can be as bad as not ready enough. Psychology is something for a  coach to fret about. Ask a player, particularly a high school player, and he  wants only to play. Tee it up, kick it off, and get on with it.  </P> <P> For Lawrence, there isn't much to analyze. He says simply: "I don't think  there's any team in the state that can beat us."  </P> <P> And if that's true, it's largely because of him. He has taken advantage of his  athletic gifts and decided he can live with playing quarterback for a little  while longer. Lawrence, you see, wanted to be a wide receiver, but Shacklett  figured last season that this was a player who should be getting his hands on  the ball a lot.  </P> <P> "It was hard for him," Shacklett said. "He wasn't convinced he wanted to be a  quarterback. He was a quarterback because his coach wanted him to be a  quarterback."  </P> <P> Now he is a quarterback because he wants to be a quarterback. At least until  next season.  </P> <P> "I don't think I want to play quarterback in college," said Lawrence, who has  been recruited by Washington, San Diego State, UCLA and Colorado, among others.  "I like it. It's fun. But I don't think I can get to the NFL playing  quarterback."  </P> <P> That might sound a little pretentious for a high school player, but Shacklett  says Lawrence is a rare discovery.  </P> <P> "He's a hell of an athlete," Shacklett said. "He has an ability to make the big  play, and it looks so natural."  </P> <P> So naturally, he's getting a lot of attention. One teacher made photo copies of  an article that had appeared in the newspaper about Lawrence and had each  student read it.  </P> <P> Has he become a celebrity?  </P> <P> "They're not going to recognize me like I'm Michael Jordan or something,"  Lawrence said. "If somebody says 'This is Teddy Lawrence,' they'll say 'Oh, so  you're Teddy Lawrence.' "  </P> <P> The bulletin boards at Morse are covered with accounts of each week's  victories. After the Rancho Buena Vista game, Taylor awoke at 6 a.m. when he  heard commotion in the living room. Who? His parents. With every newspaper they  could find spread out all over the floor.  </P> <P> Which brings us, by way of the back door, back to Poutoa, who would like it to  be known that the offensive line has something to do with all of this.  </P> <P> "Every time I read about Teddy and Gary I just look at it and say 'Yeah, they  wouldn't have had all that if it wasn't for us,' " he said. "I just want  everybody to know that the offensive line gets a little bit of the credit."  </P> <P> Aw, what's your gripe, Salua? You've got a date to the homecoming dance, don't  you?  </P> <P> Poutoa: "Oh yeah, I have a date."  </P> <P> Two, in fact.  </P> <P> Poutoa: "I'll take one to homecoming and I'll take the other one to the  Sweetheart Ball."  </P> <P> Now the only concern is Lawrence, who is undoubtedly a good bet to find a date.  After all, it's not as if there isn't interest.  </P> <P> "I think there's more girls liking me than before," he said. "Most of them  don't tell me. People come up to me and say 'So and so likes you, but they're  scared because they don't know what you're like.' "  </P> <P> Funny how that works. Most defensive players in the county are scared because  they know exactly what he's like.  </P></p>

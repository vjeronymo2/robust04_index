			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASTING JEWISH ACTORS AS JEWISH CHARACTERS  </P> <P> I was happy to see television acknowledge Jewish people in the land of sitcoms  and other series ("Being Jewish in Prime Time," Sept. 10, by Michele Willens).  </P> <P> For too long we have watched holiday specials, some even hosted by Jewish  people, with no mention of Hanukkah, and for too long has the occasional Jewish  person in sitcoms been portrayed as weird, cheap or controlling an empire.  </P> <P> NORA AMRANI  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

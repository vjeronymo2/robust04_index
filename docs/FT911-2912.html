			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Japanese military protests TWO Japanese soldiers and an ex-soldier were arrested yesterday after they tried to force their way into the office of the chief of the Defence Agency to deliver a petition protesting against the planned despatch of minesweepers to the Gulf. In other protests, six car bombs exploded harmlessly outside dormitories used by the Self-Defence Forces (the military) and a few peaceful demonstrations were held. But generally, there was little public protest at government's decision to send the ships on the first active service overseas mission by the military since 1945. The flotilla was due to leave today. At the Defence Agency, the three demonstrators, all in military uniform, were held back by guards outside the door of the office of Mr Yukihiko Ikeda, the agency's director general. Witnesses said they shouted slogans condemning the despatch of minesweepers as unconstitutional. The three, a sergeant aged 35, a 24-year-old private and a 39-year-old former sergeant were arrested on obstruction charges.</p>

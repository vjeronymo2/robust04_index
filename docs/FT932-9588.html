			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Vimto woos the home front - A soft drink's campaign to widen its appeal Few brands achieve international status without first securing a leading position in their national market. Vimto, a fruit drink made by Manchester-based JN Nichols, is one of them. Dwarfed by Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages and Britvic - the industry leaders - the Vimto brand has a mere 2 per cent of the UK market. With the bulk of sales still in northern England and Scotland, it is probably better known in Saudi Arabia and the Sudan than it is in Surrey and Sussex. As this month's new television advertising campaign underlines, however, Nichols is intent on better exploiting at home the potential which has so long been realised abroad. British troops sent to the outposts of the empire in the 1920s and 1930s were among the first distributors of Lancashire herbalist John Noel Nichols's concoction of blackcurrant, raspberry, grape and other fruit juices, and herbs. Since then a glass of Vimto and a handful of dates has become the traditional nightly sustenance during the Ramadan fast in many Middle East countries - where the same family firms have acted as agents since the early 1930s. Across Africa, from the Gambia and Ivory Coast in the west to Kenya and Uganda in the east, demand for Vimto is still growing. It has recently been launched in Egypt and revived in Mozambique; shipped into Canada and Guyana; and distributed in new markets in South Africa, Cyprus and Spain. The brand remains a firm favourite in India and Pakistan. Vimto reaped the benefit of its early presence in overseas markets, such as the Middle East, as local consumer spending power began to increase in the 1960s and 1970s. The company's UK bottling and canning plants could barely keep pace with export demand for the company's cordial and carbonate products. By 1980 when Nichols bought Solent Canners - the company's packager for the Middle East market - exports accounted for nearly 70 per cent of volume sales. Nichols first turned its attention to the development of its home market after several overseas agents, which had long handled marketing and distribution, began to make the drink locally from concentrate shipped from the UK. As a result Nichols found itself with spare packaging capacity and, as managing director John Nichols, a grandson of the company's founder, puts it: 'We had a brand that was international but still had a long way to go nationally.' With an enlarged sales force, expansion proved relatively easy in the rest of northern England and Scotland. Moving the brand south has been more difficult. 'Multiple grocers saw Vimto as a regional brand and have taken a lot of persuading to put it on their shelves throughout the country,' says Nichols. But persistence is paying off. The company has improved Vimto's appeal as an alternative to the ubiquitous colas by redesigning its cans and cordial labels, which had been largely unchanged for decades. It has introduced diet and low-sugar versions of the drink and a variety of pack sizes. The company has also formed a distribution alliance with AG Barr, the independent producer of Tizer and Irn-Bru; and entered the vending machines market. National visibility has been raised by advertising on BSkyB and Channel 4, as well as on regional television. Sponsorship and promotional campaigns have been widely used in the push to extend market boundaries. Over the past five years, Vimto has been one of the fastest- growing soft drinks brands. Carbonate sales have risen at more than three times the growth rate of the market; and cordial sales have risen twice as fast. Although Nichols admits the drink is a little too sweet for his taste, the company may soon have the national status to match its reputation abroad.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Whitecroft warns of interim deficit WHITECROFT, the Cheshire-based lighting, home improvements and industrial and medical textiles group, yesterday announced complete withdrawal from the double-glazed windows and conservatories market and warned that pre-tax losses for the half-year to end-September would be about Pounds 1m. There will be no interim dividend (3.3p). The share price, fell from 37p to 23p on the news but later recovered to 27p. Mr Peter Goold, chairman, said yesterday: 'We are eliminating Pounds 2m of losses and this has to be right.' Two of the group's windows and conservatories businesses have been sold and negotiations are under way to sell the other two. Mr Goold said this was better for shareholders than closure because the buyers would assume responsibility for future liabilities. Whitecroft made Pounds 4.49m in the year to March 31, with operating profits halved. It cut its final dividend to 0.7p, making a total of 4p, compared with 10p in 1990-91. 'We said earlier this year that if consumers did not start buying energetically again, we would take radical action. We are, however, quite confident longer term. 'Our strategy is to concentrate on core businesses with growth potential. We have been incurring costs up front, but benefits will flow later,' Mr Goold added. Goodwill of Pounds 23.8m associated with the sales will pass through the profit and loss account. This had been previously eliminated against reserves and will be shown as an extraordinary item, with no effect on shareholders funds of about Pounds 40m. Group borrowings on September 30 are expected to be about Pounds 38m - gearing of about 95 per cent. Mr Goold said borrowings would fall back to March's level of Pounds 36m next year as investment in its performance doors business generated cash flow benefits.</p>

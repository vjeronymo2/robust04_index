			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Education bill faces fresh Tory protest The government's education bill ran into further difficulties yesterday when a prominent rightwing Tory MP complained that parts of the legislation affecting student unions were not clear enough, James Blitz writes. Mr Graham Riddick, parliamentary private secretary to Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, confirmed that he had written to ministers at the Department for Education to say that the bill did not properly put into effect the 'voluntary principle' affecting student unions. The principle - which would allow all students to decide whether they wanted to join a union - is strongly supported by Tory backbenchers. However, in a letter seen by the Financial Times, Mr Riddick claims that the bill fails to put the measure properly into effect. The legislation, which would also create a teacher-training agency, has faced difficulties in the Lords because many Tory peers feel that it infringes the rights of student unions to form political organisations and spend money as they wish. Mr Riddick believes that the government should establish a 'Facilities Association' which would provide core services, such as student catering, welfare and sports facilities. He believes that colleges would then have to 'permit the establishment of a separate student union, to which all students should have the right individually to belong or not to belong.'</p>

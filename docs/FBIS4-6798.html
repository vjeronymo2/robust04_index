			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, April 25 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Ali  Alatas said on Monday [25 April] that Indonesia congratulates  Tsutomu Hata on becoming the new Japanese prime minister.  Alatas told reporters that Hata is not a new figure to  Indonesia and has known about Indonesian affairs for a long  time. He refused to be drawn, however, on the prospect of  Hata's leadership, saying, "it is difficult for me to comment on  it because it's a Japanese internal affair."</p>

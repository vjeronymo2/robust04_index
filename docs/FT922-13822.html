			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Drug sector demonstrates its vitality THIS WEEK'S remarkable figures showing a 66 per cent increase in the trade surplus generated by the UK pharmaceuticals industry during January, compared with January last year, demonstrate the continuing vitality of the British drugs industry. Last year the industry produced a trade surplus for the UK economy of Pounds 1.18bn, a figure second only to that created by power-generating machinery. The scale of the trade surplus increase during January can be partly attributed to the slower growth of pharmaceutical imports rather than exports. Imports grew by only 10 per cent to Pounds 114.8m while exports increased by 33 per cent to Pounds 231.4m. The limited import figure is partly because UK is a small drugs market with low consumption of pharmaceuticals compared with other countries. The UK spends only 6.7 per cent of its GNP on healthcare, and drugs represent only 11.6 per cent of that spending. By comparison, Germany spends 13.1 per cent of its GNP, with pharmaceuticals expenditure representing 15.9 per cent of that sum. The UK pharmaceutical industry's export achievement can partly be explained by the spectacular success of certain UK-based pharmaceutical companies in recent years. They include: Glaxo, which markets the world's best-selling drug, Zantac. Wellcome, the group that sells Zovirax, the anti-viral drug, and Retrovir, used in the treatment of HIV-positive patients. SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American group, which sells antibiotics such as Augmentin, and Tagamet, the ulcer drug. 'The fundamental reason behind last month's increase is that British companies are researching and then manufacturing world-beating products in the UK and then selling them worldwide,' explains Mr Geoff Potter of Glaxo. The export success can also be attributed to growing sales of 'blockbuster' medicines. Sales of new Glaxo products have been impressive in recent months, for example. For the last six months to December sales of Zofran, which helps cancer patients on chemotherapy, increased to Pounds 120m, while those for Serevent, the asthma treatment, rose to Pounds 9m. Revenues generated by Imigran, the controversial migraine drug, increased to Pounds 13m. These products are so new they are only being manufactured in the UK, even though they are exported worldwide. Similarly, sales of Wellcome's Zovirax and Retrovir were up 34 per cent and 31 per cent respectively for the six months to February. In the German market, a co-marketing agreement with Hoechst helped Zovirax sales increase 22 per cent in local currency terms last year. Admittedly, some of the increase in exports can be put down to favourable currency movements. Wellcome, for example, reckons the weak dollar accounted for a 6 per cent increase in sales for the six months to February.</p>

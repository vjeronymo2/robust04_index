			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS;  </P> <P> GOODS SOUGHT FOR GULF CARE PACKAGE  </P> <P> While American military men and women linger in Middle East deserts, Joy  Hallamore doesn't want them to be bored.  </P> <P> So the Laguna Hills resident is organizing a drive to collect new and used  recreational goods such as games, cards, magazines, books, balls, puzzles and  audio cassettes, to help relieve the tedium in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> "Operation Care Package" will be collecting donated goods from 10 a.m. to 7  p.m. Saturday in front of the Laguna Hills Target Store at La Paz Road and  Pacific Park Drive.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to do something," said Hallamore, whose cousin left recently for  Saudi Arabia. She decided on the collection drive after hearing a radio  announcement asking residents to send such items. And she figured that people  were more likely to donate such goods if someone else -- such as her  organization -- handles the task of shipping the items.  </P> <P> For more information, call (714) 362-1175.  </P></p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Irish Continental cuts loss Irish Continental Group, the ferry and freight company, reduced interim losses by 35 per cent to IPounds 3.45m (Pounds 3.42m) as a result of increased passenger and roll on-roll off freight traffic across the Irish Sea. Turnover grew by 18 per cent to IPounds 46m in the six months to the end of April, reflecting increased carryings of cars and freight. There was also a first time contribution from the charter of the MV Pride of Bilbao super-ferry which ICG acquired for IPounds 56m last November and is chartered to P&amp;O. ICG traditionally incurs a loss in the first half of the year since the tourist season coincides with the second half. 'It is primarily on the Irish Sea that we are seeing growth,' said Mr Eamonn Rothwell, managing director. The ferry division increased turnover by 18 per cent to IPounds 31.7m, and the seasonal loss improved from IPounds 4.7m to IPounds 2.9m. However, the group's freight capacity on the Irish Sea remains constrained by the size of its fleet. 'There is frustrated demand on the freight side,' according to Mr Rothwell. ICG plans to introduce a new IPounds 46m super-ferry on the Irish Sea routes in 1995. The ship is currently under construction in the Netherlands and the cost is being met through bank borrowing and the proceeds of a IPounds 29.2m rights issue last March. Mr Rothwell said the group was experiencing increasing competition on its routes to France from the Republic of Ireland, with its main rival Brittany Ferries increasing capacity on these routes. The container division, which includes a 25 per cent stake in Bell Lines, the shipping company, increased turnover by 16 per cent to IPounds 14.5m for operating profits of IPounds 1.5m, including IPounds 200,000 from Bell. ICG has ended its freight joint venture with Pandora on the Dublin to Liverpool route as it was not making a significant contribution. Mr Rothwell declined to comment on the company's full-year performance, saying that a clear picture would not emerge until after the end of the tourist season. The company declared an interim dividend of 1.2p (0.97p).</p>

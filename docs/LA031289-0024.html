			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: EXPERTS TIP THEIR HANDS ON GRATUITIES  </P> <P> Alfred Cavaliere of Beverly Hills, who notes that he is "theoretically opposed  to tipping" in restaurants but tips anyway (to the tune of at least 15%),  writes to ask why the accepted percentage of tips seems to have gone up over  the years?  </P> <P> "Forty years ago," he writes, "a $20 (check) called for a $2 tip. The same meal  today would cost $60, and should warrant no more than a $6 tip. But I have to  tip $9. Why?"  </P> <P> Secondly, he asks, why should a larger percentage be called for in high-priced  restaurants than in lesser ones, "although no greater service was offered"?  </P> <P> Well, to begin with, Cavaliere must have been quite the gourmand if he spent  $20 on a meal 40 years ago. According to the 1949-vintage "Dining Out in  Hollywood and Los Angeles" by Craig Davidson, an "expensive" dinner in that era  would cost "probably more than $3 (per person) without cocktails." On the East  Coast, according to "Knife and Fork in New York" by Lawton Mackall, also  published in 1949, top restaurants would cost "more than $4 per person,  exclusive of drinks and tips."  </P> <P> More to the point, though, Davidson's book states that, while 10% might be an  acceptable tip for breakfast and lunch in inexpensive restaurants, 10% to 15%  is called for at dinner time. Furthermore, he adds, at top-flight restaurants  without a captain, "the average tip is 15%-20% of the check," and at those with  a captain, "the happy medium is 20%-25%, split one-third to the captain and  two-thirds to the waiter." In New York, says Mackall, "the waiter . . . should  get 15%; in a night club, 20%." Going back even further, Rian James, in his  "Dining in New York," published in 1934, recommends tipping a quarter on checks  of $1.50 to $2.50, 15% on checks up to $5, and "at least 20%" above $5.  </P> <P> As for why higher percentages are called for at more expensive restaurants, the  best answer I can give is simply that, at least in principle, such places do  give "greater service." Waiters are required to know more about food in such  places; more changes of silverware and china are invariably called for;  table-side service is sometimes required; and it takes more time and skill to  properly present, open, decant (if necessary), and pour a bottle of good wine  than to pick up a couple of glasses of white zinfandel from the service bar.  Service should be better at more expensive restaurants, in other words, and  thus should be better compensated.  </P> <P> HERE TODAY GONE TAMAYO: Dr. Stan Kandel, an original majority partner in Spago,  and the now-defunct 385 North, has relinquished day-to-day management  responsibility at Tamayo, the upscale Mexican restaurant he helped open last  year in East Los Angeles. Kandel's partner in the venture, David Lizarraga is  now in charge -- though Kandel maintains his financial interest. Humberto  Valoso, former general manager of Las Brisas restaurant in Laguna Beach, will  some of Kandel's responsibilities. Meanwhile, high-profile local restaurateur  Bob Morris (Gladstone's 4 Fish, R.J.'s, etc.) has signed on in a consultancy  capacity. Morris will introduce a new menu in about two weeks, keeping some  popular dishes from the original but adding more traditional Mexican items.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW ADDITIONS MEET WITH THEIR APPROVAL  </P> <P> As a once-upon-a-time journalism student and a lifelong reader of both The  Times and Herald Examine, I am among the many thousands who were sad to see the  Herald go.  </P> <P> But I am also among many more who I'm sure are as tickled as I am that The  Times hired Allan Malamud and Bob Mieszerski.  </P> <P> For my dough, Mieszerski is right up there with Andrew Beyer of the Washington  Post and Steven Crist of the New York Times.  </P> <P> Just wanted to say thanks.  </P> <P> LEE HUTSON, Malibu  </P></p>

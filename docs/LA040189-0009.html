			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNDAMENTALIST GROUP SAYS IT KILLED MUSLIM CLERIC IN BELGIUM  </P> <P> An obscure Muslim fundamentalist group, the Soldiers of Justice, claimed  responsibility in Beirut on Friday for the slayings of a Muslim religious  leader and his assistant earlier this week.  </P> <P> The Lebanese-based group said Muslim leader Abdullah Ahdal, 36, and assistant  Salim Behir, 40, were killed because they worked for Israeli intelligence.  However, Belgian police continued to focus their investigations on the theory  that the two men were shot dead because of Ahdal's moderate stance on the  controversy surrounding author Salman Rushdie and his book, "The Satanic  Verses."  </P> <P> Marina Coppieters T'Wallant, magistrate in charge of the investigation,  appealed for information, calling in particular on anyone who had spoken to the  victims Wednesday to contact police.  </P> <P> The Brussels newspaper De Morgen on Friday published a copy of an open letter,  widely distributed in the large Arab community only days before the killings,  criticizing Ahdal for his statements on the Rushdie book and his refusal to  authorize publication of another book attacking the British-based author and  his works.  </P> <P> The open letter, addressed in French to "brothers and sisters in Islam," takes  the side of another Brussels Muslim leader and religious instructor, the Imam  Mohammed Saghir, in his challenge against Ahdal. As director of the World  Islamic League Mosque and Cultural Center, Ahdal was Saghir's supervisor in the  center's program of religious education.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'He Rides Alone'  </P> <P> "The director (Ahdal) doesn't represent anyone. He rides alone," the unsigned  letter stated.  </P> <P> Specifically, the letter accused Ahdal of doing nothing to prevent publication  of "The Satanic Verses" in Belgium and refusing to urge the banning of the book  in newspaper and television interviews on the subject. "At the same time," the  letter continued, "he blocked our Muslim brother Imam Mohammed Saghir from  publishing a book he just wrote clarifying the Rushdie affair for Muslims and  non-Muslims alike."  </P> <P> The letter claimed Ahdal told Saghir that if he published the book, he would be  forced to leave the religious center.  </P> <P> Police said Saghir and Ahdal met to discuss their disagreements in the same  offices of the large mosque where the religious leader was killed only hours  later. But a police spokesman said Saghir is not a suspect in the killings.  </P> <P> However, the tone of the letter and the obvious hostility illustrates an  emotional division in the Muslim community over the Rushdie matter and Ahdal's  leadership.  </P> <P> Since it receives substantial financial aid from Saudi Arabia, the World  Islamic Center has often been the object of jealousies in the greater Muslim  community. In fact, Ahdal, a Saudi, came to the mosque and religious center,  which represents the Sunni Muslim community in Belgium, the Netherlands and  Luxembourg, seven years ago after a similarly bitter conflict forced the  resignation of his predecessor, a Tunisian, Mohammed Aluini.  </P> <P> Whether these disputes were deep enough to result in professional-style  assassination is another matter. However, investigators said Friday that they  have no evidence linking the Soldiers of Justice group with the slayings.  </P> <P> In a typewritten statement issued in Beirut, the group claimed "responsibility  for carrying out God's verdict on traitors Abdullah Ahdal and Salim Behir." The  statement claimed Ahdal and Behir had used the Brussels Islamic Center as a  front for anti-Islamic activities and were working on behalf of Israeli  intelligence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kidnaping of Belgian  </P> <P> The Soldiers of Justice organization first surfaced in December when it claimed  responsibility for the kidnaping of a Belgian doctor, Jan Cools, 32, in  southern Lebanon on May 21 last year. Since then it has issued press releases  in Beirut taking credit for a December attack on a Jewish social club in  Copenhagen and the shooting death of a Saudi Arabian diplomat in Bangkok,  Thailand, also in December.  </P></p>

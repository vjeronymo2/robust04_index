			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arja Nukarinen: "EU Opponents Publish </F> Periodical"]    [Text] Last Tuesday [26 April], a new periodical began to  appear in Finland. The paper addresses people who are  dissatisfied with Finnish society, and who are especially  opposed to membership in the European Union [EU]. The paper, THE  CITIZEN IS ON YOUR SIDE, is scheduled to be published monthly.  It will primarily be distributed through direct sales on streets  and in marketplaces.    The paper will be published by the Helsinki-based Citizen  Cooperative, which will be founded during the latter part of  May. Until then, the paper's financial affairs are being handled  by Sirkka Korhonen, from Nurmes, and Eero Taivalsaari, from  Helsinki, who came up with the idea for the paper, and who are  both opponents of EU membership.    According to editor in chief Taivalsaari, the intention is  not to stop the publication of the paper after the popular  referendum regarding the EU. Based on Taivalsaari's  calculations, 13,000 issues of the paper would need to be sold,  in order for the paper to remain financially viable.    When announcing the birth of the new paper, Taivalsaari  stated the reason for producing such a publication to be the  lack of public debate about alternative solutions. The paper  declares itself to be politically unaligned, although  Taivalsaari admits that its ideology "fairly closely" originates  from issues put forth by the Finnish People's Independence Front.    Among others, Korhonen, who is one of the paper's central  backstage figures, is active within the Finnish People's  Independence Front. Ella Karki-Sormunen, who is responsible for  marketing the paper, is secretary general for the Independence  Front.</p>

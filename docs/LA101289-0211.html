			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE VET: SMALL OUTDOOR SHELTER KEEPS TABBY PROTECTED  </P> <P> Q: Is it true that one dog year is equal to seven human years? I see this fact  on commercials and everyone seems to mention it when they talk about how old  their dogs are. How do you determine such a ratio?  </P> <P> Paul Munoz, Anaheim  </P> <P> A: The seven-to-one rule is probably a rough average estimate, not meant to be  an accurate gauge for comparing human years to dog years.  </P> <P> On the average, a dog reaches sexual and growth maturity within six to nine  months, which would be roughly equivalent to a 15- to 18-year-old human. A  dog's "adult" life span is generally uniform for about six to eight years. Then  they start to show definite signs of aging. Many dogs will age very rapidly,  changing hair coat color and losing weight. These changes occur more rapidly  than in a human.  </P> <P> The seven-to-one ratio is probably based on the average life span of a human  being, which is in the 70s to early 80s, while a dog's average life span is 10  to 12 years.  </P> <P> Q: What would cause my cat to have a drastic bowel movement change? He is about  4 years old and is a Himalayan (not purebred). He had an eye infection about a  month ago. I took him to our vet, he was treated with antibiotics and seemed to  be doing well. However, he didn't eat for a week, drank a lot of water and had  diarrhea during that week. He underwent X-rays to find out if there was  anything unusual going on in his stomach. Everything was negative.  </P> <P> He was given a vitamin shot and started eating again. He seems to be in good  health. He is playful and happy again, but he still has diarrhea. I've asked my  vet about it, but he's not very explicit and seems to think it will just go  away. This condition has been going on for two weeks now and I'm very worried.  I don't want to be an alarmist, but I feel this might lead to something  serious.  </P> <P> I love my cat. He is all I have left after I lost my husband four months ago.  I'm 70 years old, and I couldn't stand another loss.  </P> <P> Mrs. Jessie Gonzalez, Mission Viejo  </P> <P> A: Diarrhea in cats is a very common condition with a wide variety of causes.  Changes in diet, scrounging in trash cans, eating mice or birds, intestinal  parasites, stress, bacteria and viruses can all be listed as causes of  diarrhea. The difficult part is trying to identify the cause and getting your  pet treated. Ideally, multiple fecal samples should be examined for parasites  or their eggs. You should supply your vet with a fresh sample to be submitted  to the lab, or your vet may want to hospitalize your cat to obtain multiple  samples. Occasionally, fecal cultures may be of some benefit.  </P> <P> Strict diet control and symptomatic treatment with anti-diarrheal medications  and antibiotics may be necessary.  </P> <P> In some cases, no cause is ever found, and often long-term medication is the  only treatment. Most cats seem to respond to diet restrictions and medications.  Your cat may even be sensitive to the antibiotics that were given for his eye  infection and could return to normal with a change in medication.  </P></p>

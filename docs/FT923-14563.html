			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Oil and gas spending cuts predicted DEEP cuts in the energy industry's 1992 spending on oil and gas exploration and production in North America were forecast yesterday by Salomon Brothers, the investment bank. It based its prediction on a survey of 247 companies. The survey - which also found that 40 per cent of big US oil companies had underspent their planned exploration budgets in the first six months of this year - discovered that on a worldwide basis there could be a 3.2 per cent year-to-year decline in spending. Mr Jim Crandell, a Salomon Brothers analyst who participated in the study, said the lower spending plans appeared to have been based partly on the drop in natural gas prices this year and the relative weakness of crude oil and refined product prices. The mid-year survey is designed to assess how spending is progressing relative to 1992 budgets, and to provide a glimpse of industry plans for next year. Spending in the US in 1992 is predicted to decrease by 18.5 per cent for independent companies and by 20.1 per cent for the majors. Canadian expenditure is estimated to drop by 20.5 per cent in 1992. Salomon said the forecast drop in US exploration and production spending by big companies could translate into a decline in absolute terms from Dollars 13.5bn last year to Dollars 10.8bn (Pounds 5.6bn) in 1992.</p>

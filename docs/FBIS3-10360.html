PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and PT  [Workers Party] lawmakers united to accuse Finance Minister  Fernando Henrique Cardoso of harming workers through the  conversion of salaries into the real value unit (URV). In Sao  Paulo, Civilian Household Chief Henrique Hargreaves said that  the government is willing to negotiate the economic plan in  Congress, but with some restrictions.    "The plan may not be distorted," Hargreaves said. "If  Congress cooperates with proposals to improve it, the government  is willing to study them," he said, adding that "I am convinced,  however, that the plan will be approved, because congressmen  will not take the responsibility of rejecting it without  proposing alternatives."    Hargreaves last night attended the ceremony introducing the  new General Motors car, the Corsa, at the General Motors plant  in San Jose dos Campos (Sao Paulo), where the majority of  entrepreneurs praised the plan. He represented President Itamar  Franco, who canceled his presence at the event at the last  moment -- on Sunday evening -- following publication of the new  price index.    Hargreaves declined to refer to technical details of the  plan, on the grounds that it is not his area. He said he knows  that the finance minister has admitted that some sectors will  sustain salary losses, but he does not expect strikes, because  workers will in the long term win.    "The only objective of the government and of President  Itamar  Franco is to find a solution for the country to improve," he  said. "Congress is aware of the difficulties," he said.  <H5>  Critical Topics </H5>   In Congress, a large number of lawmakers expected  modifications in the provisional measure that created the URV.  Congressmen, who were dissatisfied, pointed at two critical  topics in the government proposal: the salary deterioration and  the lack of control over prices.    "It is a plan to be negotiated, and it is natural for it to  undergo changes," said PMDB Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul Germano  Rigotto, who is candidate for rapporteur of Provisional Measure  No. 434 and for assuming the leading role in the negotiations.  PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] Senator for Ceara Beni  Veras, the finance minister's fellow party member, has said that  "there is always room for negotiations."    PT members said they would propose changes in the  provisional  measure in order to convert salaries by the highest inflation  rate. PT Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul Paulo Paim -- the chairman  of the Labor Committee -- said that the Chamber has the  obligation of preparing a conversion program to guarantee  conversion by "at least the inflation rate, as is granted to  workers by the current salary policy." He recalled that labor  sectors with collective agreement renewal dates on 1 March will  sustain a loss of 33 percent, according to the Interunion  Department for Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies (DIEESE).    PMDB Deputy for Pernambuco Nilson Gibson, who referred to  Cardoso as the "atheist minister," said that the salary loss is  "the worst deterioration since the time of Minister Delfim  Netto."</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Motoring: State-of-the-art performance THAT over-used term 'hi-tech' really does apply to the Mitsubishi 3000 GT. How else can you describe a twin-turbocharged, V6-engined super-car with four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering, electronically-controlled suspension and aerodynamic aids that pop up and down according to your speed? Mitsubishi Motors says its integrated systems (the four-wheel drive and steering, ABS brakes, electronic regulated suspension and so on) make driving easier and less stressful. I will second that. No car with a 155 mph (250 kmh) potential and 0-62 mpg (0-100 kmh) acceleration time of 5.9 seconds could be more user-friendly. On busy roads in Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, it ambled along at 35 mph (56 kph) in fifth waiting for a moment to overtake. Slipped into third and right foot down, it leapt forward like a jet fighter. Used responsibly, nothing could be safer. At 140 mph (225 kmh), still in Bedfordshire but on the Millbrook proving ground's two-mile bowl, it felt as relaxed as it had at half that speed on a dual carriageway. Pushed hard on a winding, hilly, handling circuit, the 3000 GT's traction, braking capacity, cornering grip and sheer good manners made it flatteringly easy to drive. The V6 that pulls uncomplainingly at little more than 1,000 rpm at 30 mph (48kmh) in top yowls eagerly and tunefully up to 6,000 rpm and more in the gears. For a car on 17-inch wheels and ultra-squat tyres - specially-developed Dunlop SP Sport 8060s - the 3000 GT rides with surprising shock-absorbency. It comes with air-conditioning - essential equipment in this kind of car - and a driver's seat with inflatable bolsters that fit round one's form like a surgical corset. The rear seats are notional rather than practical but the tailgate lifts to reveal a fair amount of luggage space. At Pounds 35,500, a Mitsubishi 3000 GT 2+2 is Pounds 20,000 cheaper than a mid-engined, strictly two-seat Honda NS-X and around Pounds 4,000 less than a Porsche 968. But it is dearer than a Nissan 300 ZX (Pounds 32,775) and the just-announced Subaru SVX (Pounds 27,996). One hundred 3000 GTs will come to Britain this year and deposits have been taken already on more than half of them. The UK market for high-performance sports cars and coupes is not what it was. From 11,110 in 1990, it fell to 7,481 last year. Only 2,965 were sold in the first six months of 1992. Recession, soaring insurance premiums and an increasingly tough response by police and courts to serious speeding are to blame.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Bulgaria invests in N-plants Bulgaria's National Electricity Company is to invest a further Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m) to upgrade and increase the safety of four Soviet-designed 440MW reactors at the troubled Kozloduy nuclear power complex. Kozloduy provides 40 per cent of the country's power output and cannot be phased out until alternative power sources are secured. The National Electricity Company has already spent Dollars 50m on upgrading the ageing power plants, which suffered from decades of poor maintenance and from an exodus of skilled workers after the collapse of the communist regime. Two of the four older reactors, dating from the 1960s, were declared unsafe by international inspectors in 1991 and closed down for essential repairs before they were re-opened last year. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is managing and co-ordinating an international fund for improving safety at Soviet-era plants like Kozloduy, which is one of several nuclear power plants on the Danube River. But western companies have been unwilling to play a full role in upgrading such plants until complex legal issues are resolved in a way which absolves them from responsibility for radiation and other inherited environmental problems.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Southern France (5): Swing to right breaks tradition - Toulouse awaits an upturn THE RED and yellow Occitan flag, the symbol of the Languedoc region that dominated Southern France in medieval times, still flutters above the towers and turrets of Toulouse. Toulouse, the centre of the Midi-Pyrenees region, has a long history of intellectual and political independence from northern France. It began with the Occitans in the Middle Ages, went on with Jean Jaures, the 19th century dissident writer who founded L'Humanite, the communist newspaper, and continued with the left-wing liberalism that infused the city's politics until the early 1990s. But this spring's parliamentary elections marked a dramatic break with that tradition. The centre-right coalition won a sweeping victory against the old socialist government but nowhere was the scale of the swing from left to right more extreme than in Toulouse. The city went into the elections as a socialist stronghold with seven of its eight deputies belonging to the left. The result of the elections reversed the balance of political power with the right winning all but one seat. To some extent, this political shift can be explained by l'effet Baudis, or the influence of Dominique Baudis, the dynamic centre-right mayor of Toulouse. Mr Baudis, son of Pierre Baudis, another prominent local politician, abandoned his previous career as a television presenter to follow his father into politics and has since revitalised the local scene. But the right's success really reflects the French electorate's disillusion with the left after almost a decade of government by the scandal-scarred socialists and its concern about the impact of the slowdown in the French economy, particularly on employment levels. Until recently Toulouse, which has a population of 360,000 in the city itself and of 650,336 with its environs, was relatively resilient to the pressures on the rest of the economy. The unemployment level at the beginning of last year was 9 per cent, slightly lower than the national average. Toulouse was, after all, sheltered by its role as a centre for aerospace and electronics. Aerospace companies converged on the city after World War 1 when many of France's foremost aircraft makers moved there as part of the government's strategy of basing militarily sensitive sectors as far away as possible from the German border. Aerospace is still the biggest single source of jobs in the city because of the presence of large groups including Aerospatiale, Matra and the Airbus consortium. The infrastructure of research and training facilities built to service these groups has also encouraged electronics companies to move to the area, thereby creating another source of jobs from such companies as Siemens of Germany, Motorola of the US and France's Thomson. However Toulouse has, in the past year, fallen prey to the same vicious cycle of crumbling confidence and rising job losses that has hit the rest of France. The level of unemployment is now the same as the national average at around 10 per cent. The large aerospace groups have remained more or less intact. Aerospatiale, which two years ago opened its huge new state-of-the-art Clement Ader assembly plant, has managed to avoid any job losses among its 8,500 employees. But it was forced earlier this year to put one of its factories on short-time working and has, like its competitors, cut orders to sub-contractors. The same pattern has been replicated in electronics, with the big companies reducing supplies from sub-contractors in order to protect their own operations. As a result, many of the smaller businesses in Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees region have come under intense pressure. The future looks more promising. The local economic development units, Technopole Toulouse and the Bureau Regional d'Industrialisation at d'Acceuil Midi-Pyrenees, both report that, although companies are cutting down on investment, the area has maintained a healthy level of job creation. In the medium term Toulouse is expected to benefit from the decentralisation strategies now being implemented by a number of state-controlled French companies. Air Inter, the domestic airline, is opening a data processing centre in the city this summer which will employ 500 people. Air France will arrive next summer with another 500 jobs. The long-term outlook for the aerospace and electronics sectors is also encouraging. The critical question for aerospace is when the worldwide market will recover from three years of recession. Aerospatiale says that, so far, there is no real evidence of improvement apart from a slight increase in orders from regional airlines, which led the industry into the slump and so might lead it out. Meanwhile, many of the local electronics companies are small to medium-sized concerns operating in specialised, value-added niches of global markets with strong growth potential. ATG Gigadisc is typical. It is a medium-sized business with 120 employees and is a leading European player in the market for optical discs. ATG managed to maintain sales of FFr109m in 1992, but was forced to reduce its staff by about 10 people when demand declined. Business has since picked up, particularly in the US, its main export market, making the company more confident about the future. Just as its strength in aerospace and electronics helped Toulouse to prosper in the buoyant economic climate of the 1980s, so the local politicians hope that those sectors will haul it out of the doldrums in the early 1990s - whatever the change in the political complexion of the city.</p>

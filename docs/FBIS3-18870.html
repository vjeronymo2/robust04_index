The  President is in a bad situation because THE NEW YORK TIMES is  already comparing his attitude in the Whitewater case to that of  Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal.    It is a significant parallel. It is not so much the  seriousness of the initial issue for which the White House is  blamed, but for its attempt to stifle it, according to the press  and the Republican opposition. This is a suspicion which the  weekend's escalation seems to confirm: The summoning by a grand  jury of six senior presidential officials, the most important of  whom, White House legal adviser Bernard Nussbaum, immediately  announced his resignation.    At first, Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, and his  wife Hillary, then a well-known lawyer, had merely been the  victims of the failure of a private investment. The property  deal in which they were involved in 1978 with the McDougals, a  couple they were friendly with, resulted in a resounding  failure. But, now, the aim is to determine whether public funds  intended to put a savings bank owned by the McDougals back on a  sound financial footing were misappropriated to save the  Whitewater development. Or, even more embarrassingly, whether  they were used to fund the Clinton campaign for reelection as  governor of Arkansas.    It seems that truth is stranger than fiction, and the case  has been complicated by all the sudden developments of a  television soap. Last year, the suicide of Vincent Foster,  Nussbaum's assistant at the White House, remained unexplained.  We now learn that, after the death of its former colleague, the  law office where Foster had worked with Hillary hurriedly  destroyed the files left by that unfortunate man.    The public has remained largely indifferent. The subject,  which justified the appointment of a special prosecutor, is  apparently too complex for Americans to show an interest.  Optimistic because of the economic recovery which is growing  stronger, they have given Bill Clinton the highest level of  support since he entered the White House in January 1992.  According to an opinion poll published by THE WASHINGTON POST  last week, 58 percent of the respondents said they are satisfied.    But Richard Nixon also thought he could overcome the  obstacle. Five months after the burglary of the Democratic Party  Headquarters in the Watergate Building, he was reelected in a  landslide to the White House in November 1972. And yet, the  repercussions of the scandal forced him to resign two years  before the end of his term.    Conversely, Ronald Reagan survived the incredible scenario  concocted by his advisers: The money paid by the Iranian  mullahs for the clandestine purchase of American weapons funded  the antiSandinista guerrilla war in Nicaragua. But the former  actor had such an ability to extricate himself from political  problems that he deserved the nickname "Teflon President."    Bill Clinton has two problems. In his case it is not just  Caesar who must show himself to be above suspicion, but also  Caesar's wife.</p>

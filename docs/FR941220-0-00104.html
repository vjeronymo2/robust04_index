			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5) The employer has provided the information about the occupation required in paragraph (c) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> .731 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> The first labor condition statement: wages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An employer seeking to employ H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants in a specialty occupation or as a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability shall state on Form ETA 9035 that it will pay the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants the required wage rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Establishing the wage requirement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first labor condition application requirement shall be satisfied when the employer signs Form ETA 9035 attesting that, for the entire period of authorized employment, the required wage rate will be paid to the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's; that is, that the wage shall be the greater of: the actual wage rate (as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) or the prevailing wage (as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The actual wage is the wage rate paid by the employer to all other individuals with similar experience and qualifications for the specific employment in question. In determining such wage level, the following factors may be considered: experience, qualifications, education, job responsibility and function, specialized knowledge, and other legitimate business factors. ``Legitimate business factors,'' for purposes of this paragraph (a), means those that it is reasonable to conclude are necessary because they conform to recognized principles or can be demonstrated by accepted rules and standards. Where there are other employees with substantially similar experience and qualifications in the specific employment in question_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> they have substantially the same duties and responsibilities as the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant_the actual wage shall be the amount paid to these other employees. Where no such other employees exist at the place of employment, the actual wage shall be the wage paid to the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant by the employer. Where the employer's pay system or scale provides for adjustments during the period of the LCA_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> cost of living increases or other periodic adjustments, higher entry rate due to market conditions, or the employee moves into a more advanced level in the same occupation_such adjustments shall be provided to similarly employed H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants (unless the prevailing wage is higher than the actual wage). Examples illustrating these principles may be found in appendix A to this subpart H. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> prevailing wage  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for the occupational classification in the area of intended employment must be determined as of the time of filing the application. The employer shall base the prevailing wage on the best information available as of the time of filing the application. The employer is not required to use any specific methodology to determine the prevailing wage and may utilize a SESA, an independent authoritative source, or other legitimate sources of wage data. One of the following sources shall be used to establish the prevailing wage: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A wage determination for the occupation and area issued under the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. 276a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (see also 29 CFR part 1), or the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act, 41 U.S.C. 351  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (see also 29 CFR part 4) (which shall be available through the SESA); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A union contract which was negotiated at arms-length between a union and the employer, which contains a wage rate applicable to the occupation; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If the job opportunity is in an occupation which is not covered by paragraph (a)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section, the prevailing wage shall be the average rate of wages, that is, the rate of wages to be determined, to the extent feasible, by adding the wages paid to workers similarly employed in the area of intended employment and dividing the total by the number of such workers. Since it is not always feasible to determine such an average rate of wages with exact precision, the wage set forth in the application shall be considered as meeting the prevailing wage standard if it is within 5 percent of the average rate of wages. See paragraph (c) of this section, regarding payment of required wages. See also paragraph (d)(4) of this section, regarding enforcement. The prevailing wage rate under this paragraph (a)(2)(iii) shall be based on the best information available. The Department believes that the following prevailing wage sources are, in order of priority, the most accurate and reliable: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A SESA Determination.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon receipt of a written request for a prevailing wage determination, the SESA will determine whether the occupation is covered by a Davis-Bacon or Service Contract Act wage determination, and, if not, whether it has on file current prevailing wage information for the occupation.This information will be provided by the SESA to the employer in writing in a timely manner. Where the prevailing wage is not immediately available, the SESA will conduct a prevailing wage survey using the methods outlined at 20 CFR 656.40 and other administrative guidelines or regulations issued by ETA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) An employer who chooses to utilize a SESA prevailing wage determination shall file the labor condition application not more than 90 days after the date of issuance of such SESA wage determination. Once an employer obtains a prevailing wage determination from the SESA and files an LCA supported by that prevailing wage determination, the employer is deemed to have accepted the prevailing wage determination (both as to the occupational classification and wage) and thereafter may not contest the legitimacy of the prevailing wage determination through the Employment Service complaint system or in an investigation or enforcement action. Prior to filing the LCA, the employer may challenge a SESA prevailing wage determination through the Employment Service complaint system, by filing a complaint with the SESA. See 20 CFR 658.410 through 658.426. Employers which challenge a SESA prevailing wage determination must obtain a final ruling from the Employment Service complaint system prior to filing an LCA based on such determination. In any challenge, the SESA shall not divulge any employer wage data which was collected under the promise of confidentiality. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) If the employer is unable to wait for the SESA to produce the requested prevailing wage determination for the occupation in question, or for the Employment Service complaint system process to be completed, the employer may rely on other legitimate sources of available wage information in filing the LCA, as set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) (B) and (C) of this section. If the employer later discovers, upon receipt of a prevailing wage determination from the SESA, that the information relied upon produced a wage that was below the prevailing wage for the occupation in the area of intended employment and the employer was paying below the SESA-determined wage, no wage violation will be found if the employer retroactively compensates the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) for the difference between the wage paid and the prevailing wage, within 30 days of the employer's receipt of the SESA determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

This was the  most closely guarded secret of the left. Most probably it is an  SLD man, even though this information, passed by Reuter (which  quoted Aleksander Kwasniewski) was denied by Zbigniew  Siemiatkowski. It is also certain that no one queries SLD's  right to appoint its own man to this position. It is not at all  known, however, whether, just like Marek Borowski, he would be  simultaneously a minister and the deputy prime minister  responsible (even theoretically) for the entire economy.    On Monday [7 February] evening Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak  said on television that he would accept the resignation  submitted by Marek Borowski, despite signals on the part of SLD  discouraging him from doing so. He did not say, however, when  the finance minister would stop work. It is not known,  therefore, whether the Tuesday session of the Council of  Ministers is the last one with the participation of the deputy  prime minister and finance minister. It is just as possible as  the version in line with which he is supposed to stay at this  post until the Budget Law is passed by the Sejm. As we have  learned, such doubts are also expressed by other government  members as well. The politicians of the Polish Peasant Party  [PSL] voiced the opinion that Borowski should remain in his  position until the work on the budget is completed, which seems  to be a logical solution: The prime minister confirmed that the  government would defend the budget in the version that has been  submitted in the Sejm.    It is easier to answer the following question: Who is SLD's  candidate for the successor of Marek Borowski? We have learned  that Professor Grzegorz Kolodko, with whom talks were held when  Waldemar Pawlak was selecting people for his government, is out  of the question. At that time, the conditions submitted by  Kolodko were not accepted; it would be even more difficult to  agree to them now. It is also hard to suppose that he would  himself be interested in taking over this difficult post in a  situation that is far more complex than it was last autumn.    SLD will also not propose Henryk Chmielak for this post.  Right now he is the first deputy of the finance minister -- he  holds the rank of a secretary of state. The list, which was not  agreed with SLD and which Aleksander Luczak submitted to the  Belvedere in October 1993, included the name of Chmielak as a  candidate for the head of the Finance Ministry. However, SLD  probably wants someone who would be linked with the party as  much as Marek Borowski; this condition is not met by the present  deputy minister. For the very same reason (as well as a few  others) none of the members of the present leadership of the  ministry come into play.    The natural cadre reserve for any party are its deputies.  However, as early as last autumn it was clear that the reserve  bench of both coalition members was rather short; it has become  even shorter since that time.    However, on the list of SLD Sejm deputies it is not easy to  find someone who could fill the position vacated by Marek  Borowski. Among the members of the Budget Committee, who are  naturally most familiar with the problems of the state's  finances, only Professor Jozef Kaleta is an acknowledged  economist; however, this acknowledgement is rather related to  the previous epoch. He is probably not a sufficiently strong  candidate as well, but according to the information that we have  obtained, SLD leaders believe that it is a character of  considerable authority that can constitute a counterbalance for  the PSL-dominated part of the government.    Perhaps it will be Ireneusz Sekula, head of the Main Customs  Office? He once was a deputy prime minister (in the Rakowski  government), responsible for the economy. Aleksander  Kwasniewski met with him yesterday morning. However, we learned  from a well-informed source that Sekula is not the politician  that the SLD leaders spoke about.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Japan talks and does nothing Sir, I disagree with your editorial, 'Back from the brink' (October 3) - in the wake of yet another agreement that purports to open Japan's markets - where you urge Japan to 'table this weekend's concessions to the Gatt'. You also tell Japan to 'demand that the US seek to resolve any future bilateral trade differences through negotiation in the World Trade Organisation'. The US has hauled Japan before the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade three times in the last six years, and won each time. Japan has simply ignored the rulings, and pursued a ruthlessly protectionist trade policy, bolstered by the cheers of many English publications, including your newspaper. It is curious that you should constantly side with Japan and urge the US to seek a remedy that has proved to be worthless. Japan has 'opened' its market dozens of times, but it still keeps the foreigners out, and laughs all the way to the bank. Japan's strategy is to keep the US talking and talking until it is so deeply in debt that it does not matter what the US says about trade.

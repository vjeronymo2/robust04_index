Narysov, candidate of technical sciences, </F> and V.V. Sadchikov, Scientific-Industrial Association ``State  Institute of Applied Optics'', Kazan; UDC 621.396.962]    [Abstract] Following a review of basic Doppler radar  principles applied to detection of moving objects and  determination of their velocities by measurement of Doppler  reflection spectra, a Doppler radar with an optical rangefinder  is described which has been developed and built for monitoring  motor vehicles which move through dust clouds. The light source  is an LGN-901 CO[.sub]2[/]-laser with operating at a power  level of about 3 W. Its radiation is stabilized by means of a  piezoceramic corrector and a diffraction grating, whereupon a  primary plane Cu mirror reflects it at a 90 angle onto a Ge  plate for splitting into an object beam and a reference beam.  The object beam is twice reflected upon 45 incidence on two  successive plane mirrors, for passage along a parallel path  through a diaphragm into a collimating lens which reduces its  divergence to one eighth of the original. The collimated beam,  40 mm in diameter with a 0.6 mrad divergence angle, is then  reflected by a plane scanning mirror onto the road under  observation, whereupon a part of the returning beam is reflected  by the same scanning mirror into a receiving objective coaxial  with the collimator and operating in the Cassagrain mode. The  objective lens has a 1000 mm focal length and a 200 mm outside  diameter, its 110 mm inside diameter being larger than that of  the collimating lens. The objective focuses the incoming  radiation on the diffraction spot on the 0.2x0.2 mm[.sup]2[/]  large light-sensitive surface of a HgCdTe photodetector, a  high-speed photodiode with a 30 MHz wide passband. The reference  beam meanwhile passes through two successive acoustooptic  modulators operating at close to one another frequencies (40 MHz  and 39.6 MHz) and then, after reflection by another plane  mirror, through the receiving objective to the photodiode. For  automatic frequency control another photodetector, a  photoresistor with 1x1 mm[.sup]2[/] large light-sensitive  surface and a 1 MHz wide passband, is placed at the entrance to  the laser. Such a configuration of the optical system enables  the radar set to operate in the energy mode and in the  heterodyne mode without additional tuning. Use of two modulators  significantly weakens the effect of direct illumination at the  carrier frequency in the reference channel. The radar is  calibrated against a foam plastic panel set into 50 Hz vibration  by a 10GD-30 loudspeaker head. Figures 2; references 2.</p>

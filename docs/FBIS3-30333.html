			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Al.A."-signed report: "The Ministers Mend What Was </F> Spoiled by Journalists"]    [Text] At the end of last week, Romanian National Defense  Minister Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu received his  Bulgarian counterpart, Valentin Aleksandrov. Despite the fact  that one would expect closer political ties between Romania and  Bulgaria -- as the two countries are neighbors, they have  similar domestic problems, and a chance that if they had  cooperated they would find a way to solve the difficulties  generated by the crisis situation outside their borders. Except  for a few random attempts to further their ties, relations  between the two countries have been characterized by  indifference, perhaps even competition.    The Bulgarian defense minister's visit was due for several  months, but it was postponed a number of times, although the  reasons for that had nothing to do with the nature of bilateral  relations. Merely one week before the meeting of the two  ministers, a certain suspicion and tension emerged again as a  consequence of the fact that the Bulgarian press had published  some false information claiming that Romania had massed troops  along the common border.    However, in Bucharest, the two defense ministers still  managed to find a common "language." They reasserted their  consequent support for the political and diplomatic settlement  of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and excluded the variant  of military involvement, which they termed as dangerous for both  conflict parties [the Bosnian Serbs and the NATO allies acting  on behalf of the United Nations], because of the high  probability that, as a consequence of such involvement, the  conflict would expand. In the same context, the ministers  agreed that neither country would send troops to join the "blue  helmets" in former Yugoslavia. Such a decision was only  natural, whereas the opposite would have been quite unusual, as  UN peacekeeping operations are never carried out by forces of  countries that neighbor a conflict region.    During the visit, they also signed the Romanian-Bulgarian  military cooperation accord. Among other things, the accord  also provides for cooperation in the education and training of  military personnel, a chapter that, in view of the Partnership  for Peace, might be equally interesting for both countries.</p>

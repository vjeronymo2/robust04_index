			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Equity Issues: Sweden goes for variety in sell-off programme THE SWEDISH government's privatisation programme, due to kick off this summer with the sale of SSAB, the state-owned steel company, will adopt a variety of methods, tailored to suit different categories of company. The 34 state or partially-owned companies in the programme represent a broad spectrum of businesses in terms of industry sector, size and structure, according to Mr Jan Amethier, an adviser to the Swedish government on privatisation. Speaking at a presentation to investors in London yesterday, he said that the companies can be divided into four main categories: Four publicly-quoted companies in which the state owns less than 100 per cent are likely to be privatised through a secondary share offering. In this category fall SSAB, which has already been named as the first company to be privatised, NCB, the forestry company, Nordbanken, in the financial sector, and Procordia, the food and pharmaceuticals group. Three large wholly-owned industrial companies, Assi, the pulp and paper company, Celsius, the diversified industrial group, and LKAB, the mining company, could be subject to a variety of approaches, including merger and alliance. The public utilities are expected to be subject to structural changes before they can be privatised. The government does not aim to privatise monopolies. The fourth category consists of small companies which would not merit a share offering but are likely to be privatised by means such as management buy-outs. Some of these companies operate as niche monopolies. Relatively few of the companies will be suitable for large global share offerings. However, the Swedish government is aware of the 'importance of international investors who can play a major role in ensuring continued demand in the after-market,' according to Mr Amethier. Although the widening of domestic share ownership is a crucial goal, the government will seek to create 'equal opportunities for domestic and international investors,' he said. The public offerings are likely to be spread over a number of years, as care will be taken not to crowd the markets. The large companies may be sold off in stages. Remy Cointreau, the French drinks group formed in December from the merger of Pavis and Remy &amp; Associates, will next week triple the number of marketable shares in issue with a Dollars 100m international share offering, writes Simon London. Only 10 per cent of the company's shares are currently traded, with a controlling 50.46 per cent interest held by the family of Mr Heriard Dubreuil, who heads the merged group. The offering comprises a 20.8 per cent equity stake held by the company itself plus warrants for the purchase of additional shares. The issue, lead-managed by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, will be priced on Monday close to the prevailing market price of FFr195 per share. However, the thin market makes Remy Cointreau one of the more volatile stocks quoted on the Paris bourse. The offering of warrants is designed to reassure investors that the current market price represents fair value. Wellcome Trust, the charitable foundation which funds medical research, faces a similar problem - but on a much grander scale - in deciding on a structure for its Pounds 4.5bn sale of shares in Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals company. The sale, expected to take place in the summer and lead managed by Robert Fleming, may also triple the number of marketable shares.</p>

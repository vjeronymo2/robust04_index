			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRANE OPERATOR INJURED IN FALL AT METRO RAIL SITE;  </P> <P> TRANSIT: A WORKER SUFFERS A BROKEN ARM WHEN HE SLIPS AND PLUNGES INTO A SHAFT  NEAR THE LOCATION OF THE JULY 13 FIRE.  </P> <P> A crane operator at a Metro Rail construction site was injured Friday when he  fell 20 feet down an air shaft at the downtown subway segment that burned two  months ago, officials said.  </P> <P> Jim King Jr., 21, was rushed to County-USC Medical Center, where he was treated  for a broken right arm, dislocated right elbow and bruises, said hospital  spokeswoman Adelaida De La Cerda.  </P> <P> The accident occurred about 9:30 a.m. near the Hollywood Freeway and only about  600 feet away from where an underground fire collapsed a 150-foot stretch of  tunnel in July. King apparently was attempting to put some pipe down an air  plenum -- a ventilation shaft used to circulate fresh air into the underground  rail system -- when he slipped on a piece of plywood that gave way, plunged 20  feet and struck the concrete below, said John-Paul White, resident engineer  with the PDCD, a consortium that manages construction on the Metro Rail  project.  </P> <P> King was conscious and talking as paramedics placed him in a wire basket that  was pulled to the surface by a crane, White said. It was the first serious fall  to occur at the site, where construction is being done by the  Tutor-Saliba-Perini joint venture.  </P> <P> Cal/OSHA sent an investigator to the tunnel site to determine if any state  safety laws had been violated, said Byron Ishkanian, head of Cal/OSHA's mining  and tunneling division in Van Nuys. Cal/OSHA checks into all such injury  accidents.  </P> <P> The air shaft was on top of A-130 Right, one of two parallel tunnels that will  carry empty trains between Union Station and a maintenance yard being built  beside the Los Angeles River, said Clara Potes of the Los Angeles County  Transportation Commission, which is responsible for the design and construction  of the Metro Rail system.  </P> <P> The July 13 fire that led to the closure of a three-mile stretch of the  Hollywood Freeway occurred in A-130 Left and about 600 feet south of where  King's accident occurred, Potes said. Arson investigators are still trying to  determine what caused that blaze.  </P> <P> The tunnel is part of a 4.4-mile, $1.4-billion first phase of construction on  the Metro Rail project. Tutor-Saliba, which joined with the Framingham,  Mass.-based Perini Corp. for three of its Metro Rail contracts, has been cited  nearly 300 times for safety violations by Cal/OSHA since 1979, 9.3% of which  were considered serious.  </P></p>

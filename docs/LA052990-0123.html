			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE / TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> OPTICAL COMPUTING COULD STEP UP THE MOVEMENT OF DATA  </P> <P> If you imagine a freeway where cars could pass through each other and make the  traffic jam obsolete, you would have a pretty good idea of what AT&amp;T Bell  Laboratories researchers were raving about last week at a laser and electronics  conference at the Anaheim Convention Center.  </P> <P> Like congested freeways, traditional electronic computers -- which use  electrons as the basic messenger that carries data within the computer -- bog  down because only so many pieces of data, or cars, can pass through  communication lanes without running into each other.  </P> <P> With optical computing, a futuristic technology that is being studied by Bell  Labs and Japanese researchers, the physical barrier creating the jams could  vanish, said David Miller, head of AT&amp;T Bell Labs' photonic switching  research in New Jersey.  </P> <P> Miller was one of several researchers who discussed the potential of optical  computing at the Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics, which drew about  7,000 scientists and technicians to Anaheim last week.  </P> <P> Optical computing uses packets of light, or photons, as the basic messengers to  carry data within a computer. Unlike electrons, light particles are not subject  to electrical interference and can pass through each other and deliver their  data unscathed.  </P> <P> The light beams themselves can be theoretically controlled using tiny mirrors  and prisms in ways that could mimic basic electronic components such as  transistors and resistors.  </P> <P> Used in combinations that take advantage of both electronic and optical  technology, computers of the future could reach performance levels a thousand  times better than current supercomputers, Miller and other researchers believe.  Such performance levels could yield a new generation of products such as video  phones, Miller said.  </P> <P> Miller, along with fellow Bell Labs researcher Alan Huang, believes that  optical computing has gained legitimacy in the past year as a viable path  toward creating the next generation of supercomputers.  </P> <P> Once derided as hopelessly complicated, optical computers could be used to  develop much-faster telephone switches by 1995, Miller said. AT&amp;T first  demonstrated an optical transistor in 1986, and in January it unveiled its  first optical microchip.  </P> <P> Skeptics of optical computers believe that conventional electronic-computing  methods, when combined with new computer architectures, is a more practical  approach to building faster computers.  </P> <P> For instance, Active Memory Technology Inc. in Irvine is building computers  that incorporate a technology known as "parallel processing," in which many  processors are linked together to perform certain calculations faster than a  conventional computer using a single, central processor.  </P> <P> With this approach, a computer can reach higher speeds by adding more "brains,"  or processors, like breaking a traffic jam at a toll bridge by adding more  lanes and toll booths to process the traffic.  </P></p>

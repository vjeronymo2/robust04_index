			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Allstate raises estimate of California earthquake toll The financial toll of January's earthquake in California seems set to rise sharply to as much as Dollars 4bn, following yesterday's announcement by another big US insurer that it has raised its estimate of losses. Allstate, which has the second-biggest exposure to the earthquake, said it now expected the disaster to cost it Dollars 600m, rather than the Dollars 350m it estimated before. The increase followed an inspection of most of the 38,000 claims from policyholders, the company said. Another US insurer, 20th Century Insurance, said on Friday it expected the earthquake to cost it Dollars 325m, more than double its original estimate of Dollars 162m. The company, based in Los Angeles, warned that the costs would wipe out around a quarter of its net worth. Mr Jack Snyder, an insurance analyst at AM Best, the US ratings company, said the two announcements reflected a general trend among US insurers to revise their loss estimates upwards by between 50 and 100 per cent. The revisions suggest that the total insured losses from the disaster, put a month ago at around Dollars 2.5bn, are likely to be closer to Dollars 4bn, he added. Allstate put its market share of Californian homeowners insurance policies at 15.6 per cent, behind State Farm, the market leader. State Farm has yet to revise its expected losses, but the final cost to the company could reach as much as Dollars 1bn, said Mr Snyder. The higher level of losses is unlikely to be reflected in catastrophe insurance premiums until the end of the year. Allstate said the revision meant that it would report a pre-tax charge of Dollars 750m in all in its first quarter results to reflect catastrophe losses, with the remainder of the losses coming from bad weather. The losses would result in an operating loss for the quarter of 30 cents a share, and a net loss of around 15 cents a share. Lloyd's of London said yesterday that the insurance payouts as a result of the latest Los Angeles earthquake were unlikely to be large enough to trigger any payments from its reinsurers, Andrew Jack adds from London. It said that payments so far from London reinsurers from the Los Angeles earthquake in January were Dollars 20m from non-marine and just Dollars 207,000 on aviation insurance policies. These were only triggered once claims in the US on Los Angeles had risen above Dollars 3bn. Royal Insurance said it did not believe that many UK composite insurers would be affected by yesterday's events.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / US vote brings sharp defeat for gun lobby The US gun lobby suffered a stunning defeat last night when the House of Representatives passed by two votes a bill banning the manufacture and sale of 19 types of semi-automatic assault weapons and large-magazine guns. The final tally, 216-214, cut across party lines, with Democrats splitting 177 to 77 in favour and Republicans 137 to 38 against (the sole independent voted in favour of the ban). After a spirited, day-long debate, many congressmen from rural districts, where hunting is most common and gun ownership most prevalent, voted for the first time in their careers against the powerful National Rifle Association Within half an hour of the vote, President Bill Clinton was on the White House lawn proclaiming a great victory. His administration, faced with apparent defeat earlier in the week, had lobbied furiously for the bill, bolstered by supportive letters from former presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan. The House action does not yet mean the bill is law. The Senate included a similar ban, though couched in different language, in its omnibus crime bill last year, but it was excluded from the House bill at the insistence of Congressman Jack Brooks, the Democrat from Texas and chairman of the judiciary committee. Differences between the two crime bills still have to be reconciled by the two houses. The probability is that the final bill will include the ban, offering a last opportunity for its opponents. Anti-crime legislation is so popular, however, that the chances of removing the ban must be slim. The bill, sponsored by Democrat Congressman Charles Schumer, emerged as a serious test of the power of the gun lobby. But earlier this week it appeared that the legislation would fall 15 to 20 votes short of securing a majority in the 435-member House. Some conspicuous converts to the gun control cause were achieved in the last 24 hours, including two congressmen from Texas, where the NRA has long been a powerful political force. But the Democratic party leadership was sharply divided. Mr Brooks's opposition was offset by support from Congressman Richard Gephardt, the majority leader. All evidence suggests overwhelming public and police support for the ban, particularly in the suburbs, the most populous political constituency. The NRA relied heavily in its lobbying on its conventional arguments that the ban on assault weapons is merely the beginning of the slippery slope which ends with the banning of all privately owned firearms, thus, in their view, violating the constitutional right to bear arms.</p>

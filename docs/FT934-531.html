			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Making money out of Mao: The 100th anniversary of the birth of Mao Zedong is the stuff of fairy tales and commercialism One by one the great Maoist shrines have fallen, not to angry mobs bent on casting out the devils of the past, but to the power of money. In this 100th anniversary year of the birth of Mao Zedong - he was born on December 26 - a visitor to his birthplace, to his revolutionary strongholds, and to the commune that came to symbolise his most erratic phase would find that celebrations have less to do with the past than they do with cashing in on the present. Seventeen years after Mao's death, in September 1976, which ended a decade of torment known as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, his centenary has been transformed into a fantasia, even though official celebrations are lukewarm. China's reformists seek to draw sustenance from association with this deeply flawed icon of the revolution without attracting attention to the stark differences between Mao's policies and their own. The history of the post-1956 period, during which disaster piled upon disaster, has become a black hole. Pictorial essays, photographic exhibitions, biographical material shudder to a halt from the mid-1950s, before the 'anti-rightist' persecutions of 1957, the catastrophic 'Great Leap Forward' of 1958 and the madness of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. But these episodes, beyond revision of even the most creative of party chroniclers, have been put aside for the moment. The anniversary makes 1993 a good news year for the party and for Mao. Thus Mao's place in the firmament is the stuff of fairy tales and commercialism. Like tawdry Christian relics, Mao memorabilia, ranging from jewel-encrusted gold watches with the Great Helmsman's face on the dial, to cigarette lighters playing the Maoist hymn The East is Red, are being foisted on an eager public. It is not the least of paradoxes that in death the man who railed against money as the root of all evil has spawned one of the greatest cottage industries of all time. Traffic in 'Maobilia' this year is certain to yield tens of millions of dollars to China's new-rich entrepreneurs. At Shaoshan village in the green hills of southern China's Hunan province where Mao was born, the rebellious son of a well-to-do peasant grain dealer and money-lender, an oriental Jerusalem has emerged complete with rows of stalls selling trinkets. The only god is mammon. In the Yanan redoubt of northern China where the communists took refuge at the end of the epic Long March of 1935-36, townspeople go about their business without much regard, it seems, for Mao's teachings. Karaoke bars, whose synthetic repertoires include an up-tempo version of The East is Red, mock the austere 'spirit of Yanan'. Several hundred kilometres to the east at the Dazhai commune, singled out by Mao in 1964 as a model for a communist utopia, the survivors of the zealotry that enveloped this rural hamlet during the Cultural Revolution are quietly getting on with implementing Mr Deng Xiaoping's 'capitalist-style' reforms. Members of the younger generation are becoming factory hands in a garment plant, or workers in a joint venture cement works, or miners in the local coalmine. Unlike their poor fathers who scrabbled in terraced fields to survive, the sons and daughters of Dazhai equip their wedding nests with stereophonic sound systems, refrigerators and TVs. On walls around this village of 500 people, faint outlines of Maoist Cultural Revolution slogans survive. But superimposed are the bold exhortations of the Deng era. Archaeologists of future generations may well track the twists and turns of 20th century China by studying wall slogans piled upon each other, and be confused by the apparent sudden shift from Mao's emphasis on collectivisation to Dengist free-market economic policy. They might also wonder why this tiny settlement in the barren hills of Shanxi province required a hotel with a dining room capable of seating 800 people. These days, this vast room stands virtually empty, an echo chamber to past excesses when tens of thousands of cadres, including Mr Deng himself, were trucked in to 'learn from Dazhai'. Dazhai's small picture exhibition celebrating its revolutionary past includes not only photographs of such visitors as Pol Pot and Mr Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, but also one of Deng Xiaoping, taken during his rehabilitation in 1973 before he was purged for a second time during the Cultural Revolution. The expression frozen on Mr Deng's face in black and white is one of deep scepticism. If a picture can be more revealing than words themselves, it seems that China's future leader was saying that hysteria surrounding the 'learn from Dazhai' campaign was the last thing China needed if it was to be transformed into a modern state. Madam Guo, Dazhai's party secretary who gained prominence in the 1960s as the photogenic leader of the 'Iron Girl Squad' of peasant workers, appears uncomfortable when conversation turns to the past. Not only were the commune's production figures exaggerated, but its former headman became a tame mascot of the revolution, used by the Maoists as a theatrical prop in remorseless ideological campaigns. 'We started walking forward a bit late because we carried a huge ideological burden,' she says. 'Now we want to travel light . . . it's been a very stressful transformation.' But like government officials the length and breadth of China, Madam Guo was not about to forsake the party catechism. 'I was a worshipper of Mao, I respected him very much,' she declares. 'He was a great man.' This latter observation is the one that drops, like a mantra, most readily from official lips in this year of 'Good Mao'. When asked whether Mao, like other towering figures of history, was deeply flawed, she says: 'We are all deeply flawed . . . after all, he was human. There is no perfect human being on earth. He was a man not a god.' One wondered whether such blasphemy might have been possible while the Great Helmsman was still alive. In Yanan, some six hours' drive north of Xian, China's ancient capital, Mao's compound and those of his senior comrades from the 1930s and 1940s are deserted. Snow lies on the ground and it is bitterly cold, a reminder of the hardships that were endured during the more than decade-long Yanan period. It was in their simple cave dwellings, cut into the hills of northern China, that Maoist ideology was tempered in long days and nights of debate and discussion. This is where Mao spent more than a decade sheltering from the nationalists. There was scarcely a more important period in the history of the Chinese Communist party. During this time, Mao consolidated his hold on the party, directed Red Army military operations in a series of stunning victories across China, and married a saucy young actress from Shanghai named Jiang Qing. And yet, curiously, in the quarter of a century between 1949 and his death in 1976, Mao did not return to the place where he had spent more than a decade sheltering from the nationalists. It was almost as if he wished to avoid the memories, and perhaps even the ghosts of former close comrades-in-arms who served with him in happier days. At Yanan's museum of revolutionary history, one of China's most complete pictorial records of the early stages of the communist struggle, many of the smiling revolutionary heroes pictured standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Mao eventually became his victims, either before or during the Cultural Revolution. Some, like Liu Shaoqi, the former president, Peng Dehuai, former defence minister, and He Long, the revolutionary warrior, died miserable deaths after being persecuted by young revolutionaries unleashed by Mao and his supporters. Even Zhu De, the brilliant Red Army commander, suffered persecution and died virtually ignored in July 1976, just two months before Mao passed away. There was hardly one of Mao's intimate circle in the Yanan period, including Zhou Enlai, who went on to be foreign minister and premier, and Deng Xiaoping, who emerged unscathed in the post-revolution era. Not one of those pictured in the Yanan gallery, with the possible exception of Kang Sheng, could possibly have predicted that the glorious victory in 1949 would have produced the nightmare of the decades 1956-1976. The shadowy Kang became Mao's secret police chief and evil genius behind the mass campaigns and persecutions of the Cultural Revolution. At Yanan university, like countless institutions across China, the department of political science has been evaluating Mao's contribution to Chinese history. The results of these judgments have followed a predictable course, adhering to the party's own assessment made in the early 1980s that the chairman had made 'mistakes', but on the whole his contribution to the revolution far outweighed those errors. Mr Feng, director of Yanan's political science faculty, perhaps came as close as any Chinese official might to an admission that more time was needed before an unexpurgated version of Mao's life and works might be possible. 'The time is not ripe yet for a complete assessment,' he said. 'He was a very complicated man and revolutionary.' His colleague, Mr Li Xin Chang, added: 'All in all Mao made quite a few serious mistakes. He was a successful leader in wartime, but he was not so successful in peacetime.' There would appear to be ample scope for future Chinese historians. In Beijing, the custodians of the Central Party Archives have been churning out Mao literature to mark the centenary, while studiously avoiding controversy. Five books have been published, including a compendium of his Selected Works drawn from Volumes 1-4 dealing with the (safe) pre-1949 period; a digest of his military speeches; a non-controversial biography of the 1893-1949 era; an idealised pictorial essay; and a sugary tribute from former associates, including his bodyguards. Likewise, Mao's speeches captured on tapes and laser discs and distributed in their thousands to mark the anniversary do not trespass beyond the 'Great Wall of Silence' of 1956. This was the year before the 'Hundred Flowers Campaign' of 1957, which led to the anti-rightist purges and disastrous 'Great Leap Forward' in economic policy, which left in its wake terrible famine and hardship. Mr Wang Yuyao, head of the Mao Zedong Research Group at the Central Party Archives, was hazy about when there might be further volumes of Mao's works covering the period after 1957 to his death in 1976, saying merely that an enormous amount of preparation was required. But the last entry in volume five of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong (published in 1977), by recalling his famous statement that 'all reactionaries are paper tigers', shows that much of his thinking was not as prescient as his followers liked to believe. 'US imperialism has not yet been overthrown and it has the atom bomb, but I believe it too is a paper tiger and will be overthrown,' Mao wrote in November 1957. Unlike Nostradamus, Mao was not in the habit of saying when his predictions might come true. Mr Wang made no attempt to disguise his organisation's mission in this 'good news year' of the Mao centenary. 'We want to make the best use of Mao's good thoughts,' he declared. 'Psychologically speaking, the masses would rather think of Mao in a positive way for the good things he has done for the people.'</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / International Company News: Citibank in Dollars 165m loan to Alcatel offshoot Citibank of the US has agreed terms with the Turkish government for a Dollars 165m loan to bail out Teletas, the Turkish arm of Alcatel, the French telecommunications group. The deal rescues Turkey from an embarrassing position, where the liquidity crisis at PTT, Turkey's state telecoms company, had forced Teletas, which is 65 per cent owned by Alcatel, to seek court protection from its creditors. The loan will allow Teletas to restart operations. It also goes some way to salvage Turkey's battered privatisation image. Teletas was Turkey's first privatised company when spun off from PTT in 1988. Parliament last month agreed to the sale of 49 per cent of PTT next year. The loan carries government guarantees. The credit will be paid to PTT to settle outstanding accounts of around TL4,000bn (Dollars 120m) with Teletas for equipment and other supplies. The facility will also allow Teletas to settle with its own creditors - 34 foreign and domestic banks which are owed TL2,743bn. Around 95 per cent of Teletas equipment sales go to PTT. Alcatel has undertaken to route more of its sourcing of supplies to its Turkish unit. Citibank said the loan will provide PTT with cashflow, will improve the maturity composition of PTT's debts, and allow it to continue its investment programme.</p>

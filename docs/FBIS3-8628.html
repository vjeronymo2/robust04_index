The Croat-populated village of Lovrici near Gradacac in the  north has been completely depopulated, which the Moslem media  are trying to deny.    Also, Croats in Zenica, central Bosnia, are selling out  their  property at a frenzied rate, a sure sign of preparations for a  move-out.    Moslem authorities have ordered the torching of Croat houses  in the abandoned village of Zubici near Travnik, also in central  Bosnia, and the two sides are trading accusations of burning and  demolishing houses around Mostar in the south.    On the Kiseljak front near Sarajevo on Friday, Moslem  infantry forces attacked Croat positions at the locality of  Kazagici in an effort to break into Croat-held territory, said  Zagreb-based Croatian radio.    The Croat troops fought back and repulsed the attack at no  casualties to themselves, the source said.

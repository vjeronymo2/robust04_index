			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (12): Foreigners lured to the mines - The mineral wealth of Peru accounts for about half the country's export revenue THERE HAS never been any doubt about the mineral wealth of Peru. The country is streaked with enormous deposits of copper, iron, zinc, gold and silver, and its mines account for about half of the export revenue. But what foreigners have found doubtful is the wisdom of investing in Peru, given the country's recent history of state intervention, economic instability and terrorist attacks. That may be changing. A new mining code, more promising economic indicators and improved internal security are beginning to generate real interest in Peruvian mining. Multinationals, spurred on by the forthcoming privatisation of some of Peru's most promising mines, are for the first time in years seriously considering new investments. 'Mining groups are more used to risk than other industries,' says one western diplomat. 'They have to invest where the mines are. Everybody has known for years that Peru has fantastic resources. They've just all been waiting.' For some companies, the wait is over. Last November, China's Shougang Corporation committed Dollars 312m to purchase state iron producer Hierro Peru. In August of this year, a consortium of Newmont Mining of Denver, BRGM of France and Peru's Buenaventura group saw its Yanacocha goldmine begin production. The mine, which has estimated reserves of 800,000 troy ounces, is likely to repay its initial investment of Dollars 34m in a matter of months. Multinational companies, cautious for years about Peru's seeming antagonism to foreign investment, have been heartened by last year's mining code which puts foreign groups on an equal footing with their counterparts in Peru. Investors have been assured of full legal rights over mining property, freedom to market their own products, a stable tax environment and the immediate repatriation of profits. The package proved sufficiently attractive for Anglo American of South Africa which, through its Chilean subsidiary Mantos Blancos, last year bought the unexploited Quellaveco copper deposit with about 250,000 tonnes of reserves. The Dollars 12m paid by Anglo American, far below international prices for a mine of Quellaveco's size, highlights the bargains that Peru can offer investors willing to gamble. Mining groups appear to have taken note. A total of 19 foreign companies, including US, Canadian and Japanese, have pre-qualified to bid for the Cerro Verde copper mine, slated for sale on October 13. The government has set a minimum price of Dollars 30m in cash and Dollars 60m in pledged investment for the deposits, which have proven reserves of 800m tonnes, averaging 0.68 per cent of copper. You do not need to look beyond Cerro Verde, which largely exhausted its oxide deposits in 1985, to understand why many state-employed engineers welcome privatisation. Its output has dropped markedly over recent years, because the concentrator plant needed to treat secondary sulphides remains unbuilt for lack of cash. The mining industry has for years been held back by shortcomings in technology and exploration. It is estimated that only about 10 per cent of the country's mining potential is being exploited. Minero Peru, the state's second-largest mining company which owns Cerro Verde, is also auctioning off its Japanese-built copper refinery at Ilo, which has the capacity to process 190,000 tonnes of blister a year, and its zinc refinery at Cajamarquilla, east of Lima. The state has assumed responsibility for about Dollars 425m of Minero Peru's debts. The government hopes to raise Dollars 400m from the sale of the three units, though price may not be the prime concern. 'The fact of obtaining money from the sale is complementary to the fundamental aim of restructuring the state,' says Mr Daniel Hokama,the mining and energy minister. The bellwether of Peru's mining reform may prove the attempted sale of Centromin, the largest state-owned mining and refinery concern, for which bids are due on December 10. The government will announce the minimum price and required investment levels in November. Against initial advice, the state has persisted in its strategy of selling Centromin - which consists of seven mines, a metallurgical complex and four hydro-electric plants, not to mention railroad track, houses, hospitals and schools - as a single unit. 'We are pretty sure that it will be sold off as a single unit,' says Mr Hokama. According to Coopers and Lybrand, the firm of accountants which is promoting the sale in conjunction with Chase Manhattan, 25 companies have pre-qualified to bid. Three to five are expected to bid individually, with the possibility of an offer from at least one consortium. Centromin, which last year had a turnover of Dollars 400m, is tentatively valued at Dollars 300m-500m, though the government may well place more emphasis on investment pledges. Whether debt paper will be accepted in partial payment has not yet been resolved. Mr Hokama says that this would 'help us tremendously', but President Alberto Fujimori has displayed a strong leaning towards 'cash money'. Centromin has seen a significant improvement in its recent performance. The group, for years hampered by debts, a high exchange rate, labour unrest and terrorist attacks, posted a small profit last year after losing Dollars 174m in 1991. Gains were largely the result of cuts in the workforce - from 19,000 in 1991 to about 12,000 currently - as well as a more realistic exchange rate and greater quality control. Attempts to pull off the same turnaround at other mines have had mixed fortunes, says Mr Hokama. Managers have often not had enough cash to pay off workers to cut costs. Stricter lending criteria and the scrapping of the state mining development bank have made borrowing more difficult. Nevertheless, foreign interest remains strong. Other mineral resources up for grabs include a gold deposit at San Antonio de Poto, the Tintaya copper mine (which last year became Peru's third largest) and medium-sized copper deposits at Michiquillay and La Granja. The feeling among some foreign mining executives is that security concerns and the uncertain political outlook make Peru a risky proposition. But, as the country's mineral potential attracts growing interest, many believe that to delay too long and risk losing out on the best mining prospects may be the greatest risk of all.</p>

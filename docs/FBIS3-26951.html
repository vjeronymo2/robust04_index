			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] China says that there are still problems over the  latest funding package for the new airport. The Chinese team  leader of the Joint Liason Group, Guo Fengmin, says Beijing has  studied the fourth financial package but it needs to discuss the  remaining problems with the Hong Kong Government. The latest  package implies that the government will inject equity worth  about 60,000 million dollars into the project. However, Mr Guo  refused to say whether the problems relate to the size of the  government's equity injection. He added that the Sino-British  Airport Committee would discuss the land to be granted along the  airport rail link and he hoped that the committee could meet  soon.</p>

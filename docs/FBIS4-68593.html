			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Sosin, director of the Scientific Research </F> Center for Problems of Economics and Management (Kemerovo),  under the heading "Economic Restructuring": "They Cannot Be  Harnessed to the Same Cart: Lessons From the Creation of  Industrial Corporations in the Kuzbass"]    [Text] The Kemerovo Oblast Administration possesses an  amazing gift: it constantly presents the people of the Kuzbass  [Kuznetsk Basin] with various "miracles" which will supposedly  help overcome whatever their latest problem is. The latest such  "miracle" was the "Free Economic Zone." Everyone knows what  became of that. Recently, belief in a new "miracle" has emerged,  this time the financial-industrial groups (FPG  [finansovo-promyshlennyye gruppy]), based on a regional  financial-industrial group called the Kuznetsk Company.  Supposedly we can pull ourselves out of this crisis by our own  bootstraps, right here at home.    In a recent address to his fellow citizens M. Kislyuk,  governor of the Kuzbass and also administration chief of mining  towns and head of a number of coal-producing enterprises in the  oblast, stated that "information received from Moscow indicates  an unwillingness and inability to establish order, not in basic  industries such as the coal industry, much less in the entire  country." That statement preceded a rather curious conclusion:  since B. I. Yeltsin and V. S. Chernomyrdin are not capable of  establishing proper order in the country, we are going to help  see to it that they are replaced and wait for "our own people"  from Russia's Choice to take office. Is that really the issue?    Is it up to the drowning to save themselves? Can we break  this crisis right here where we live and create an economic  oasis? Laudable! But is it possible at this point in the game?  Can the planned Kuznetsk Company actually function effectively?  I assert that it cannot. Why am I so certain? Because such a  decision is not economically justified or well reasoned. It is  proposed that this faulty concept be used to create a new  hybrid, something like Sovrynkhoz -- a market-oriented sovkhoz.  Judge for yourself. The Kuznetsk Company FPG is supposed to  combine in a single entity 278 major industrial enterprises in  the coal, metals and energy industries and rail transportation.  Or, to put it another way, 30.7 percent of all large enterprises  in our oblast. But that is not all. There are plans to lock up  R18 billion [rubles] in fixed capital in the Kuznetsk Company  FPG at 1984 prices, which is equivalent to 73 percent of all  fixed production capital in the oblast economy. Would that not  constitute a supermonopoly?    If such a decision were actually approved even for a short  period of time, then we would definitively lump all of our  problems together and witness a repetition of the failed company  that was supposed to create a free economic zone. Once again the  mountain would produce a mouse.    Addressing an expanded session of the Russian Federation  government, B. Yeltsin said that the creation of an FPG "is a  means of concentrating resources in growth areas and supporting  investment activity and competitiveness. The government must  find the proper course in order not to slow down or hamper this  process, but rather to monitor it and head off adverse effects."  To what was the President referring when he mentioned "adverse  effects"? Possible the very "ideas" that are leading to  establishment of a "Sovrynkhoz" and others like them. It seems  to me that the Kuzbass administration, in order to avoid falling  into another quagmire, should carefully study both our own  Russian experience with the establishment of corporations  (FPGs), i.e., KamAZ, ZIL, NGMK, Lukoyl, etc., as well as the  tremendous amount of time-tested experience accumulated in the  United States, England, Germany and Japan.    A question naturally presents itself: on what financial  basis  are they attempting to establish the Kuznetsk Company FPG?  According to a statement by A. Lavrov, chairman of the oblast  Committee for State Property Management, it will include not  only gigantic regional complexes in specific industries -- coal,  metals, energy and rail transportation -- but also the committee  itself, the Kuzbassinvestugol Corporation, etc.    As for the committee, it is obvious that this is an effort  to  save it from collapsing altogether. But why at the expense of  coal and steel producers? That is not just a financial question,  it is a moral one. An artificial hybrid will not produce  positive results. On the one hand, it sharply restricts  organizational and scientific-technical maneuvering room, and on  the other it restricts and thoroughly obstructs the field  available for economic maneuvering. As a poet once said, a horse  and a skittish deer cannot be harnessed to the same cart.    Our preliminary analysis indicates that for the sake of the  oblast economy it would be appropriate to establish in the  Kuzbass, first of all, three major corporations (FPGs): Ugol  Kuzbassa [Kuzbass Coal], Metall Kuzbassa and Sibkhimiya  [Siberian Chemical]. As for rail transportation and electric  power production, they, as key elements in the federal  manufacturing infrastructure, should be independent components  of the economic process.    Now a few comments regarding the actual composition of the  proposed FPGs. This should be dictated solely by economic  expediency. For example, the Ugol Kuzbassa FPG should be  comprised of coal mining and processing enterprises, specialized  machine building plants which manufacture mining equipment,  internal production-related infrastructure, a mine rescue unit,  research and design organizations, investment companies along  the lines of Kuzbassinvestugol, and so on.    Even by world standards this would be a very large  corporation. Judge for yourself: it would have fixed capital of  R12 billion in 1984 prices. Currently more than 241,000 people  are employed in coal mining alone, with more than 400,000  working in the coal industry as a whole.    In my opinion, what we need here is not an artificial  patchwork of an FPG, but instead an integrated economic fabric  and an integral connection between everyone that becomes part of  the corporation. Particular emphasis should be placed on  creating systems of specialized trading companies in coal sale  centers.    In our opinion, all the enterprises and organizations that  comprise an FPG should be financially independent. They would be  required to operate within the framework of a single economic,  scientific-technical and investment policy and strategy, but  that would be the extent of it.    The coal industry is, I repeat, subsidized. One should not  expect any substantial foreign or private investment in the near  future. Consequently, we will have to carry out this  restructuring using federal budget funds only. Therefore I feel  that it would be very appropriate to develop a special program  for coal industry restructuring in the 1995-2010 period, with a  breakdown of investment by year.    The planned Metall Kuzbassa corporation would include, in  addition to anything else, 35 of the largest enterprises in the  ferrous and non-ferrous metals industries, with R5.8 billion in  fixed capital at 1984 prices. This would be a huge system, and  it should be set up according to the same principle as the Ugol  Kuzbassa FPG. However, if possible it should also consider  broader cooperation within Siberia and Russia and be oriented  toward multinational corporations.    Corporations are, on the one hand, the most highly developed  form of enterprise and production organization, and there are  things that can be learned from them. On the other hand, being  part of one makes it possible to attract needed investment  funds, technology and access to the world metals market so that  we can sell our products at normal world prices, not at  discounted or unprofitable prices. Under the right conditions  such a corporation could within five to seven years develop  successfully on the basis of self-financing, loans and private  investment.    Particular attention should be paid to the formation of a  corporation (FPG) to unite enterprises in the chemical industry.  Creating one within the Kuzbass exclusively would be to create  nothing.    The problem is that the Azot AO [Joint-Stock Company], the  Khimvolokno AO and other enterprises in the Kuzbass chemical  industry are economically and technologically very closely  linked to oil producing and refining enterprises in Western  Siberia and with tire plants in the Altay region and Eastern  Siberia. Therefore this corporation should be created first on  an interregional and then on a multinational basis, because the  chemical industry, like the oil industry, is economically  efficient and could under certain conditions compete in world  markets.    There is not a single reasonable person who doubts or would  dispute that it is essential to create corporations in the  economy of Russia in general and that of the Kuzbass in  particular. To a certain extent we have already attempted to  take that route, as the establishment of production associations  in the USSR was an attempt to utilize a form of incorporation,  but without its principal aspect, i.e. a market orientation.    In order to make up for lost time we must, as A. Sakharov  said, "travel their path," i.e., follow a trail that has already  been blazed abroad. Since we now lag behind, we must catch up.  And we may yet surpass them.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Rifkind limits role of Bosnia troops THE JOB of the 1,800 British troops being sent to Bosnia-Hercegovina will be to escort relief convoys and not to establish 'corridors of safety' through areas under bombardment, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, assured the Commons yesterday. He confirmed that their primarily humanitarian role, carried out under the authority of the United Nations, would be escorting convoys to areas hardest hit by the conflict resulting from the break up of Yugoslavia. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who opened the debate, led MPs from all parties in condemning the atrocities inflicted on civilians in Sarajevo and other centres. Mr Hurd, expressing a personal view, maintained that military action by land or air against those responsible would have been 'morally justified', but acknowledged that the most likely outcome would have been increased casualties and not an end to the conflict. He suggested that further efforts should be made to secure agreement in the UN for a ban on all military flights over Bosnia-Hercegovina - which would significantly restrict the activities of Serbian forces. 'We are considering what kind of 'no-fly zone' would make sense.' A warning by Mr Tom King, the former defence secretary, about the dangers which would arise from any escalation of the role envisaged for British troops was strongly endorsed by Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary. Mr Rifkind emphasised that the task of the British troops would be to escort convoys carrying urgently needed medical and food supplies. They would also escort detainees released from internment camps. Mr Rifkind emphasised that the task of establishing safe corridors would require the deployment of manpower on a scale 'vastly greater than at present contemplated'. In military terms it would amount to a commitment 'far more substantial and worrying' than would be appropriate. The minister confirmed that the rules of engagement applying to British troops would ensure that they were able to defend their lives and the lives of those for whom they were responsible. Mr Hurd made a cautious response when urged to authorise the release of Iraqi assets held by Britain to secure the release of British subjects imprisoned in Iraq. He described the sentences imposed on Mr Paul Ride and Mr Michael Wainwright for minor immigration offences as 'grotesquely severe'. Mr Hurd explained that the release of assets subject to claims by British interests could lead to 'quite serious trouble' and would be a difficult road to tread. Mr Michael Meacher, shadow minister for overseas development, who has recently visited the famine areas in Somalia, called for more decisive action to relieve hardship there. He said Britain should use its positions as president of the European Community and a permanent member of the UN security council to press for the deployment of 10,000 to 20,000 troops to secure supply depots and distribution lines against brigands.</p>

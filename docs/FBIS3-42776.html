			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N.N. under the rubric "In the Russian Federation </F> Procuracy": "Investigation Into Rutskoy's Money May Be Reopened"]    [Text] It is not nice to count money in other  people's pockets. Nevertheless, since August of last year all of  Russia was doing precisely that, trying to figure out how many  million dollars A. Rutskoy had in a Swiss bank--$3 million or  $10 million.    The commission especially set up by the president made  public  the vice president's alleged account number in the Swiss  Indosuez Bank and a copy of a trust agreement. By this agreement  A. Rutskoy entrusted to a certain Austrian citizen, Kerets, the  management of his own firm abroad--Trade Links, to whose  accounts money allegedly flowed from Russia.    The Moscow City Procuracy was assigned the task of checking  out these allegations. The Procuracy, in turn, quickly closed  the case, just before the elections to the Federal Assembly and  the referendum on the Constitution. The voters realized that an  honest man, A. Rutskoy, simply had been set up by his political  opponents.    Two months have passed since that virtual exoneration of the  former vice president. The case is currently in the Office of  the Procurator General of the Russian Federation for review.  There are reasons to believe that a decision will be issued that  it had been closed improperly.    At first glance it may look like there is an intent to  "finish off" A. Rutskoy one way or the other. But this is not  quite so.    The conclusion that led to the decision to close the case  was  made mainly after a Moscow investigator had traveled to  Switzerland and interviewed the owner of the Seabeco company, B.  Birshteyn. The latter stated that Trade Links was his company  and that A. Rutskoy had nothing to do with it.    The Office of the Procurator General, however, believes that  in order to make a decision on the case it was necessary to meet  with a Canadian notary, Chapnik.    He was the person who at the time notarized the original of  the trust agreement and a true signature of A. Rutskoy, to which  he recently testified in the presence of two witnesses--officers  of the Canadian Mounted Police. And if the Office of the  Procurator General does indeed close the case, Chapnik will face  a criminal prosecution in Canada for perjury. The big question,  of course, is who will turn out to be right--our Procuracy or  the Canadian notary.    So, we have, on the one hand, the testimony of B. Birshteyn,  the owner of a company that is banned from operating on the  territory of the Russian Federation. And on the other, a  statement of a neutral Canadian notary.    Some light on the Rutskoy case could be shed by the  documents  of the Renewal foundation, through which money and  contracts--including those with Seabeco--had been handled. But  all documents, not without the knowledge of R. Khasbulatov, had  been transferred in good time to the White House and were burned  during the October events.    A number of witnesses met with a tragic death. It appears  that the fund's documents in regional branches already have been  destroyed.    As to accounts in Western banks, many people probably  remember that at the time of being an acting prime minister, Ye.  Gaydar had contacts with the American company Kroll Associates.    The latter was looking for the CPSU party money and, of  course, personal accounts. Well, according to some information,  it is quite easy for this company to find out account numbers  even in Swiss banks--at a price, of course.    There are rumors that they are in possession of many secrets  regarding Russian citizens' foreign currency holdings abroad.  There are also rumors that quite a few people in the West do not  want such scandals.    Imagine how solidly one can keep any person on the hook  (especially if he is big brass) if one sits on such compromising  materials. And what if such a person happens to be a minister;  or a presidential candidate?</p>

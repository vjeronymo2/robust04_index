			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sanita Upleja: "Ulmanis Discusses Skrunda With </F> the Union of National Forces"]    [Text] Riga, 14 Mar -- President Guntis Ulmanis met today  with representatives of the Latvian Union of National Forces  [LNSA] to discuss the possible signing of an agreement with  Russia on troop withdrawal and the future of the Skrunda radar  station. Actually, after two hours of conversation, both sides  maintained their original positions regarding the Skrunda  station. Nevertheless, all participants in the meeting were  unanimous on the point that G. Ulmanis should meet with Russian  President B. Yeltsin and emphasize, during their meeting, the  unwavering position of Latvia. G. Ulmanis promised that during  his meeting with B. Yeltsin, he will speak about the possibility  of shortening the term -- four years and 18 months -- of the  Skrunda agreement, but admitted that he has no hope of a  positive result, because the term has already been agreed upon  between the United States and Russia.    The president expressed his opinion and his support for the  compromise achieved by the government on this issue. After  signing such an agreement, he said, Latvia will at least have  some international guarantees and supervision from other  countries, whereas without any agreement, Latvia would have no  such international support. Naturally, by concluding the  agreement, the government and the president will assume  political responsibility and risk, but if the opposite occurs,  Latvia would make no progress, emphasized the president.    G. Ulmanis stated that after signing the agreement, the  United States will allot $10 million for the dismantling of the  new building at the Skrunda radar station, and will provide  assistance in relocating the military personnel to Russia.    The view of the Latvian National Independence Movement  [LNNK]  was expressed at this meeting by Aristids Lambergs, who stressed  that Russia should first withdraw its Army by 31 August 1994,  and only then should the issue of the Skrunda radar station be  discussed. However, even providing that the agreement with  Russia is concluded, there are no guarantees that the Army will  be withdrawn, said Lambergs.    In his turn, Latvian Popular Front Chairman Uldis Augstkalns  said that, first of all, the Latvian Government and parliament  should officially acknowledge the fact of the 1940 occupation,  and then appeal for the United Nations to do the same. U.  Augstkalns emphasized that while considering the Russian troop  withdrawal, Latvia should rely upon the CSCE document which  demands immediate and unconditional troop withdrawal, whereas  signing the agreement with the present conditions would mean  that Latvia practically abandons all hope of fulfilling these  documents.    Ojars Blumbergs, representative of the "League of Economic  Activities," represented by LNSA, emphasized that the presidents  of both countries should take more pains to plan for the  repatriation of civilians to Russia, because a lot of people  wish to return to their fatherland. In addition, Russian state  institutions have shown a well-disposed interest in this  respect, he said.    Several representatives of LNSA expressed the view that by  signing the agreement on the Skrunda radar station's continued  operation in Latvia for another four years, Latvia would show  its willingness to maintain a Russian military base on its  territory, which would mean that the withdrawal of the Russian  Army is not complete. The chairman of the Party of Latvian  Union, Maris Plavnieks, described the Skrunda radar station as a  Trojan horse which, if it remains in Latvia, will always provide  the opportunity for provocative actions, both on the part of  Latvia and Russia.    The leader of the "Fatherland and Freedom" faction in the  Saeima [parliament], Maris Grinblats, stated that the national  party members have not given up the idea of a referendum on the  Skrunda issue. Taking into account the fact that the  Constitution does not provide for referendums on issues  regarding international agreements, there would be a possibility  to organize a so-called recommending poll.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Staying in the family - Charles Batchelor discovers that some of the world's oldest corporate dynasties thrive on diversification Do not underestimate the staying power of the family business. After a decade when the rise of the corporate financier and the insolvency specialist appeared to mark the end of corporate longevity, the old-established family company still has its place. A French-based association of international, family-run businesses claims one Japanese member going back as far as 718 while it counts another three members dating from the 14th and 15th centuries. The Henokians,* named after a Biblical patriarch who reputedly lived to the age of 365, has more than two dozen members over 200 years old. The association requires members to be majority-owned and managed by the founder's descendants and to be financially sound. Established in 1981 by descendants of the founders of Marie Brizard &amp; Roger International, a French manufacturer of spirits and fruit brandies, the Henokians have 11 members from Italy, eight from France, two each from Spain and Japan and one each from Germany and Norway. Asprey, the British manufacturer of luxury goods, was a member but lapsed when its character changed as it expanded. What are the common characteristics of member companies? The main one, in the view of Dimitry Limont, association secretary, is a strong sense of family history. This means employing professional, non-family managers when necessary, and excluding incompetent family members, to ensure the business flourishes but ultimate control stays with the founding dynasty. A striking characteristic of members is the dominance of traditional sectors such as wines and spirits and textiles. Metal working and packaging account for a significant minority, while jewellers, glass makers and printers are also represented. These sectors may be traditional but the companies have adapted to technological and market change. Confetti Mario Pelino, an Italian confectioner, is proud of its hand-made traditions which require four days to glaze its sweets. Nevertheless, it is modernising production and franchising the Pelino name outside Italy. Viellard Migeon, a French iron foundry established in 1679, diversified out of chains, bolts and screws into fish hooks at the beginning of this century and claims to rank second in this sector in the world. The oldest member of the association is the Hoshi Hotel, which claims to be the oldest ryokan, or traditional inn, in Japan. Founded on the site of a hot water spring by a Buddhist priest, Hoshi has expanded to a 100-room hotel owned and managed, if oral tradition is to be believed, by the 46th generation of the founding family. It was another 919 years until the establishment of the second Japanese member, Gekkeikan Sake Company. This relative newcomer was established as recently as 1637. Gekkeikan has concentrated on improving methods of producing sake while other Henokians have sought growth through diversification. Friedr. Schwarze (1664) claims to run the largest Coca Cola bottling line in Germany alongside its traditional business of producing corn spirit. The predominance of Italian and French companies may reflect the relatively underdeveloped capital markets in those countries and the economic weight of the family-owned business, but the Henokians are seeking to broaden their membership. The annual subscription of FFr24,000-FFr42,000 (Pounds 3,000-Pounds 5,250) may however, deter some smaller family firms. The Henokians meet annually to discuss issues affecting the family company and have links with organisations such as the Tercentenarians' Club**, a UK group of 300-year-old companies. British family businesses such as R. Durtnell &amp; Sons, a Kent building company founded in 1591, and Folkes Group (1699), a Stourbridge-based open-die forging company, would probably qualify for membership. In the UK, at least, the significance of family companies has been largely ignored, although the Confederation of British Industry and Stoy Hayward, an accountancy firm, have established a family business forum. The compilation last year of a register*** of the largest 50,000 UK companies by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, revealed 258 companies, many still family-owned, which were over 200 years old. Further research is needed to show whether the corporate old-timers are an appealing curiosity or whether they have a message for students of business management. *The Henokians, 26, bd Gouvion Saint-Cyr, 75017 Paris, France.

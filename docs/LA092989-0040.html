			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> BAKKER TO TAKE STAND IN HIS TRIAL TODAY  </P> <P> Jim Bakker will take the stand today to defend himself against fraud and  conspiracy charges, his lawyers said after presenting about 50 character  witnesses on behalf of the PTL founder. Bakker is expected to be the last  defense witness. "It could have been today (Thursday), we're going tomorrow,"  defense attorney George T. Davis said when asked by reporters if Bakker would  take the stand. Meanwhile, the federal judge in the trial in Charlotte, N.C.,  refused to allow the jury to tour the Heritage USA retreat built by the  disgraced television evangelist. "It would be a waste of time and serve no  purpose for the 18 people on the jury to go see it," U.S. District Court Judge  Robert Potter said.  </P></p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Bankers united on pace of union: Tietmeyer and George recommend a cautious approach to Emu EUROPEAN Union governments must put their monetary houses in order before implementing measures to speed the pace of union, central bankers said yesterday. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, displaying a rare degree of unity, both argued against premature moves towards European economic and monetary union. 'As the credibility of the system has been greatly impaired by developments in the past few years, every member state must now initially pursue a policy to restore its own credibility,' Mr Tietmeyer told a Frankfurt conference. 'In future, the rules of the system can at best foster this credibility, but not replace it.' Lending his support to the view that there should be no quick and general return to narrow bands in the exchange rate mechanism, Mr Tietmeyer went on to argue that 'we should be careful. . . . to avoid too ambitious and too early implementation of new instruments such as common targets for monetary aggregates. 'Given the present environment and the essential need for building up the credibility of the system again, such a move would be premature and in the end counter-productive. Regaining credibility by improving (economic) convergence is a serious and long-term job and requires co-ordinated action of all member states on their own responsibility,' he said. Mr George warned of the danger that 'political aspiration will run ahead of economic reality', which in his opinion would set back rather than advance the cause of European union. He urged that it would be better to concentrate on the 'here and now' - in other words, the immediate task of promoting convergence between the economies of individual European countries. Especially important was internal price stability, without which lasting exchange rate stability would be no more than an illusion. He acknowledged, as did Mr Tietmeyer, that the flexibility inherent in the move towards wider bands for currency fluctuation in the ERM posed risks for the convergence process. He argued that monetary policy objectives within the EU, having once been too tightly drawn, were now underspecified, and that there was a case for buttressing the ERM in its current, looser form 'with clearer Community-wide understandings on the domestic policy objectives to be pursued within the looser exchange rate framework'. The agreement between the two men contrasts with the tensions which arose over the conduct of monetary policy in September of last year, when the UK perspective was that German monetary rigour directly contributed to market pressure on sterling and its eventual withdrawal from the ERM. Mr Tietmeyer acknowledged that the functioning of the EMS had been affected by German monetary policy in the early 1990s, itself a reaction to the inflationary problems caused by reunification. But he said that the EMS would have suffered a shock even in the absence of German reunification as 'the less dynamic world economic environment would have exposed the lack of convergence between participating countries'.</p>

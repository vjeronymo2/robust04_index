			<p>BFN     [Text] The national economy has started showing signs of  recovery because of the effective economic management by the  present government. This was stated by the federal minister for  information and broadcasting, Mr. Khalid Ahmad Khan Kharal, and  the information secretary of Pakistan People's Party, Mr. Salman  Taseer, in a joint news conference in Islamabad today. They  said that the size of the stock exchange has been doubled during  the last eight months by the infusion of $700 million by foreign  investors, which shows the confidence of the international  community in the macroeconomic stability of the country.    Mr. Khalid Ahmad Khan Kharal said the government has taken  various measures to augment resources and reduce its expenditure  considerably. He said the expenditure was curtailed by dropping  uneconomical schemes, reducing size of the federal government  expenditure, freezing of supplementary grants, and imposing  discipline on provincial finances. He said revenues have  registered an increase by 16.6 percent during July-March 1993-94  over the corresponding period last year by plugging loopholes,  launching successful recovery campaigns, and improving  administrative capacity of the CDR's [expansion unknown]. He  said the deficit financing has also been reduced to rupees 10.34  billion against rupees 61.87 billion during the corresponding  period last year. He said these measures have activated the  economy and the positive results are visible in the key sectors  and segment of the economy like GDP growth rate, balance of  payments, and prices of essential commodities. The minister  said in a short period the government has succeeded in bringing  about macroeconomic stability in the financial and fiscal  sectors and has also arrested declining trends in the domestic  production. The government has also initiated programs of  far-reaching improvements in the areas of energy, physical  infrastructure, and social services so that the structural gap  which has persisted for long in these sectors could be plugged.</p>

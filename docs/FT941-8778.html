			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Industrialists urge India to reform tariffs Indian industry yesterday appealed to the government for an end to the anomalies in the country's complex import duty rates under which imports of finished goods are often taxed at lower rates than imports of raw materials and components. In an appeal before the 1994-95 budget on February 28, the Confederation of Indian Industry placed newspaper advertisements urging ministers to reform the country's duty structure to ease the burdens placed on domestic manufacturing, particularly on the makers of machinery and other capital equipment. Such reforms have long been on the CII's agenda, but companies hope that with a final pre-Budget appeal they can persuade Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, and Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, to at least start removing anomalies. Since Mr Narasimha Rao launched an economic liberalisation programme in mid-1991, import duties have been cut from a maximum of 150 per cent to 85 per cent, gradually exposing Indian industry to competition. However, duties on capital goods have come down further to 35 per cent in order to permit industry to equip itself with modern equipment of international standards. Duties on raw materials have remained much higher - mainly because producers of steel and other basic products are largely state-owned and enjoy the support of influential officials and politicians. Domestic capital goods makers say they are being squeezed, especially as orders from the cash-strapped state corporations have fallen in the wake of government efforts to make them operate more efficiently. Output of capital goods fell 7.6 per cent in 1991-92 and 1.8 per cent in the year to last March. Imports of such equipment are rising fast - by 30 per cent in the first seven months of 1993-94, compared with an increase in overall imports of just 9.1 per cent. Capital goods makers spell out the duty rates in their advertisement. The duty on imported machine tools, for example, is 35 per cent; raw materials such as carbon steel are charged at 85 per cent and components at 40 per cent. In addition, domestic makers pay 10-15 per cent in sales tax on their finished products. Similarly, imported industrial valves attract duties of 35 per cent, compared with 85 per cent on sealants, balls, gaskets and other components. Again there is 10-15 per cent sales tax to pay on domestically produced items. Larsen &amp; Toubro, a leading engineering company, says it has lost orders to foreign competitors simply because duties and taxes made it uncompetitive. It is widely believed that the budget will include measures to rationalise the duty structure - but it unlikely to contain the overhaul which the capital goods makers seek. Strikes closed banks in Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and other parts of India as employees stayed away from work in protest at government moves to partly privatise state-owned banks, write R C Murthy in Bombay and Stefan Wagstyl. Banking business was disrupted and cheque clearance suspended. The All-India Bank Employees Association, a left-wing trade union, staged a protest march in central Bombay. but the strike did not affect foreign banks or the State Bank of India, the largest and most profitable nationalised bank. The trade union's main concern is that efforts to prepare state-owned banks for partial privatisation could involve job cuts.</p>

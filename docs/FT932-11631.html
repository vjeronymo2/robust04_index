			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Books: New set of clothes for the naked ape - A C Grayling is intrigued by the latest thoughts on the true ancestry of the human race GETTING THERE by William Howells Compass Press Pounds 26/Pounds 14.50, 261 p ages IN SEARCH OF THE NEANDERTHALS by Christopher Stringer and Clive Gamble Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 18.95, 247 pages THE NEANDERTALS by Eric Trinkaus and Pat Shipman Jonathan Cape Pounds 20, 454 pages APART from those who take the Book of Genesis literally, most people know that humans descended from apes, and that our closest relatives among animals are chimpanzees and gorillas. Until now the fascinating details of enquiry into human evolution have been the province of specialists. But in the last two decades debate has reached a crucial point: two main theories have emerged about our origins, and the reason for the current spate of books is that the experts are now submitting their arguments to the public. The branch of science which investigates mankind's origins is palaeoanthropology. It is based mainly on the study of fossilised skeletal remains of early humans and their hominid ancestors, discovered by chance in caves or ancient lake-beds. It is like trying to reconstruct a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle from a mere handful of remaining shapes. It is an utterly fascinating branch of science. As each of these new books shows, it is more like a gripping detective story than a scientific pursuit. William Howells, until recently Professor at Harvard University, is the doyen of contemporary palaeoanthropologists. His beautifully written survey of the history of human origins is a worthy successor to Mankind in the Making, the book that made him famous 30 years ago. Lucidly succinct and magisterial, Howells' account takes us from the beginnings of life on earth to the emergence of humans, setting the scene for the more detailed discussion given by Christopher Stringer and Eric Gamble in their superb study of the origins of modern man. They give a brilliant introduction to the field: richly informative, marvellously illustrated and always accessible to the layman. They not only investigate the competing theories about our origins but explain how evidence for them is gathered and assessed. This is excellent enjoyment and instruction in one; anyone interested in the subject must own this book. Eric Trinkaus and Pat Shipman, despite succumbing to the disagreeable current fashion for chattily personalised writing which publishers believe makes 'serious' subjects palatable to general readers, have produced a valuable history of palaeoanthropology which dramatises the clash of opinions now dividing it. Like Stringer and Gamble, their interests lie chiefly with the more recent end of the human evolutionary story, beginning 100,000 years ago with the emergence in Europe and Western Asia of heavy-browed, massively-built Neanderthal Man, named after the valley near Dusseldorf where, in 1856, the first recognised skull was found. They recount the controversy that immediately arose about whether Neanderthals are our ancestors or a mere evolutionary side-branch. This question is at the heart of the current controversy. Most theorists agree that ape and man diverged about 5m years ago. The earliest known hominids, the Australopithecines, date from 3.7m to 1.6m years ago, represented in popular imagination by the diminutive hominid ape called 'Lucy' The commonest and most enduring early man is Homo Erectus, found across Africa, Europe, and Asia from 1.6m to 300,000 years ago. About 125,000 years ago our direct ancestors, archaic Homo Sapiens, appear at African sites; then, mystifyingly a little later, Neanderthal Man appears, only to vanish about 35,000 years ago. Was Neanderthal Man part of our own direct lineage, or is he an aberration? All the authors under review attempt to answer this question. The first recognised Neanderthal remains were judged to belong to an idiot with rickets. When accumulating evidence proved that Neanderthals were a new kind of man, opinion divided; some took the ancestral, others the aberrational view. Only one thing was clear: Neanderthals are distinctive, differing from early modern humans in their powerful frames and heavy skulls. They seem to have died out with the last ice age, rapidly succeeded by a quite different type: taller, slimmer, smooth-browed Cro-Magnon Man. And here one immediately sees the source of controversy. Ideas of race sprang to the fore. Some earlier anthropologists refused to countenance the possibility of human descent from Neanderthals, perceiving them as violent, shambling brutes. Others interpreted early modern man in Aryan terms as Neanderthals' conquerors. Either way, the savage appearance of Neanderthals made them repugnant, even frightening. Studies at certain sites suggested that Neanderthals might be cannibals. The brutish stereotype stuck, and concepts of 'low' and 'high' human forms gave impetus to racism and eugenic theories. But evidence shows that Neanderthals buried their dead, perhaps on flowers as the Shanidar fossils seem to testify, or with grave-gifts of meat, perhaps for a journey into an afterlife. Some fossil individuals appear to have lived into old age as cripples or invalids, impossible unless others cared for them. This makes the brutish caricature implausible and has encouraged some to think that Neanderthals genuinely belong to humanity's lineage. The needle-in-the-haystack nature of the enquiry has elicited both brilliance and bizarrerie from researchers. Exquisite science has been offset by folly or pettiness, the latter illustrated by those who, out of jealousy, refused to let colleagues view their fossil finds. And there has even been fraud, at its worst with Piltdown Man, the supposed apeman 'discovered' in Sussex in 1912. The main conflict of theory is between the view that after the initial spread of Homo Erectus from Africa about 1m years ago, different types of humans evolved in the local areas where groups of Erectus settled. This is known as the Regional Continuity hypothesis or, in Howells' apt phrase, the 'candelabrum' theory, because the evolutionary tree showing development from Erectus to different modern human types looks like a many-branched candelabrum. The opposing theory is that true modern man developed from the Erectus stock left in Africa. About 130,000 years ago, this theory has it, true Modern Man began to spread out of Africa in a second exodus, everywhere replacing the earlier descendants of Erectus in Europe and Asia. This is called the Population Replacement hypothesis. It explains why Neanderthals and Modern Man co-existed for a while, before the former vanished, seemingly displaced by the latter; with the latter thereafter developing into all the types of humans now found in the world. Which hypothesis is right? The jury is out. These books help us to become informed observers of its deliberations. Whichever way future evidence pushes the decision, the debate will have given us an affection for our ancestors and their relatives alike - including the Neanderthals - no matter which branch of the family tree they sit upon.</p>

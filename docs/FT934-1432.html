			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Now Ernie could make you a million - Premium bonds respond to lottery challenge Ernie could be creating the fastest millionaires in the west (or east) when April comes around. The top monthly premium bond prize, selected by the Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment, is to be quadrupled to Pounds 1m. The change is seen widely as a response to the threat of the national lottery (although this is denied by National Savings, which runs Ernie; it claims the change was a necessary updating of the system). The lottery, due to start late in 1994 or early 1995, is expected to offer prizes of several million pounds. From April, Ernie will have no weekly draw. The monthly draw will include two prizes of Pounds 100,000, three of Pounds 50,000, four of Pounds 25,000 and 10 of Pounds 10,000. There will be no change in the distribution of smaller prizes (from Pounds 50 to Pounds 5,000). The annual yield on the fund rises slightly from 5 to 5.2 per cent, increasing its attraction for those who can buy the maximum holding of Pounds 20,000. Premium bond winnings are tax-free. In addition, the waiting period for bonds to enter the prize draw is being reduced from three months to one month. Bonds bought in January and February will qualify. Meanwhile, following the base rate change, National Savings is reducing the rates offered on its savings products The main changes are: A new 41st issue of fixed rate certificates, paying 5.4 per cent tax-free if held for five years. The same rates apply to the Yearly Plan. The old 40th issue paid 5.75 per cent. The 7th issue of index-linked certificates will pay a tax-free return of inflation, plus 3 per cent, if held for five years. The 6th issue offered inflation plus 3.25 per cent. First option bonds will pay a taxable 6 per cent if held for 12 months. Those who buy more than Pounds 20,000 of bonds will get 6.4 per cent. The old rates (which will continue to be paid on bonds bought before December 16) were 6.34 per cent and 6.74 per cent respectively. A new Series H of capital bonds will pay a taxable 7.25 per cent if held for five years. The old Series G paid 7.75 per cent. Issue F of children's bonus bonds will pay 7.35 per cent tax-free if held for five years. Issue E paid 7.85 per cent. The new maximum holding limit is Pounds 1,000 which can be bought on top of holdings in previous issues. From January 1, the investment account will have three tiers: a taxable 5.25 per cent for deposits under Pounds 500; 5.75 per cent for Pounds 500 to Pounds 24,999; and 6 per cent for Pounds 25,000 and above. Old rates varied from 6.25 to 6.5 per cent. From January 29, the income bond will pay a taxable 6.5 per cent or 6.75 per cent for holdings over Pounds 25,000. The old rates were 7 and 7.25 per cent respectively. Finally, the general extension rate, which applies to matured certificates, falls again, to 3.51 per cent. Investors should remember to withdraw their money, or re-invest in new certificates.</p>

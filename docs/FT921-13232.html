			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Surprising response by fans for Spurs rights THE Pounds 7M rights issue by Tottenham Hotspur, owner of the north London football club, was taken up by about 2,000 shareholder fans at 125p - a premium of 30p over yesterday's market price. Holders representing 42.4 per cent exercised their rights, representing 2.47m new ordinary shares out of 5.82m offered. Of the 10,000 small shareholders some 20 per cent opted to take up their new shares. The issue confirms the control of the company by Mr Alan Sugar, chairman, and Mr Terry Venables, chief executive. Mr Sugar, who took up his rights in respect of 1.66m shares, said: 'I am surprised and pleased that so many of our shareholders have supported the issue. It is a particularly high level when one considers that our shareholders are not, in the main, traditional investors in the market.' Edennote, a company owned by Mr Venables, took up its rights in respect of 640,000 shares, giving it a 22.1 per cent stake. The shares not taken up were split between Mr Sugar, who will take up another 3.09m, giving him 47.8 per cent of the enlarged capital, and Viewthorpe, which will take 266,772 shares, as part of the underwriting arrangements. Viewthorpe is a company in which the family of Mr Frank Sinclair, a former Tottenham director, is interested. Mr Bernard Jolles, director of Henry Ansbacher which handled the issue, said it had reduced the company's debt to Pounds 5.9m and valued it at Pounds 16m.</p>

			<p>Years   Reportedly Released   <F P=102> 94WB0038B Mexico City EXCELSIOR in Spanish 27 Apr 94 pp 4-A,  34-A </F>  <F P=103> 94WB0038B </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City EXCELSIOR </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina Cruz] </F>   [Excerpts] Over 45,000 warrants for arrest, rearrest,  presentation, and appearance before federal courts, including  those issued against drug traffickers, tax evaders, defrauders,  and ex-civil servants, are still awaiting implementation by  Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents. Moreover, during this  administration, the Attorney General's Office [PGR] has remanded  to district judges of criminal proceedings over 90,000 persons  involved in crimes against health, at least 60,000 of whom have  been released.    Based on reports provided by the PGR, it was learned that no  fewer than 45,000 court orders issued against traffickers and  killers, including Luis Hector Palma Salazar, aka "El Guero,"  Amado Carrillo Fuentes, Juan Garcia Abrego, and the Arellano  brothers, Francisco, Ramon, Javier, and Benjamin, have not been  implemented by the PJF. This is said to have "unquestionably  fostered the atmosphere of violence and insecurity being  experienced in the majority of the country's federative states."    Agents from that department assigned to the Arrests  Directorate maintained that the delay in implementing orders for  arrest, rearrest, appearance, and presentation "has declined  considerably." Observing that it was reduced as much as 50  percent within the past two years, they nevertheless admit that  the number of unfulfilled orders "may still be considered large."    Among those yet to be implemented are warrants relating not  only to drug traffickers, but also to ex-civil servants who took  advantage of their positions to gain large sums of money.  [passage omitted]    The investigative agents acknowledged that the lack of  personnel, as well as the limits imposed on them, "play a major  role in the possible deficiencies occurring in the  implementation of court orders. Therefore, efforts must be  redoubled to end the delay."    The Federal Judicial Police agents themselves expressed the  view that the Attorney General's Office high command, which is  aware of the delay, should order an increase in the number of  personnel to implement those warrants. They remarked that it  should not divert personnel to "pursue those selling counterfeit  video and audio cassettes," a task that they claim might well be  performed by crime prevention police under orders from the  Federal Public Prosecutor's Office.    Moreover, investigations conducted in the PGR itself and in  the courts reveal that, during the past five years, the social  representative's office has remanded to district judges  throughout the country some 90,000 persons presumed guilty of  crimes against health. At least 60,000 of them have regained  their freedom. It is believed that the release of those  implicated in crimes against health has been due to deficiencies  in completing the preliminary investigations.    It was also found that a large percentage of the orders not  yet implemented by the PJF have been issued against criminals  who were released after having been remanded, in whose cases the  judges failed to find evidence of guilt.</p>

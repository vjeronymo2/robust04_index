			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Intel and Sharp form chip alliance INTEL, the US semiconductor maker, and Sharp, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday announced a long-term partnership to develop flash memory devices, one of the fastest-growing products in the electronics industry. The agreement is bound to provoke controversy in the US as Intel has chosen a Japanese rather than an American partner in an area where Intel has a clear technological lead and supplies 85 per cent of the world market. US companies have been heavily criticised for selling leading technology to Japanese companies, which later come back to dominate the field. A flash memory device is a tiny semiconductor chip which retains stored electronic information even when power is switched off and can be erased and reprogrammed. It is expected to replace most disk drives in portable computers because it is smaller and lighter and uses less power. It could be used in consumer products ranging from tapeless recording devices the size of a pen to electronic still cameras the size of a credit card. The world market for flash memory devices is about Dollars 130m a year. However, the value of the market has quadrupled in each of the past four years while prices have halved annually. Dataquest projects a market of Dollars 1.5bn a year by 1995. Intel said it required a strong partner in order to maintain leadership in what was expected to be a rapidly-growing, highly competitive market in which all leading semiconductor makers were investing large amounts of money. Mr Robert Reed, Intel senior vice-president, said Sharp brought to the partnership a research and development capability, the ability to push forward rapidly with manufacturing and a strong presence in consumer electronics. Intel's business is geared entirely to the computer industry. The two companies will collaborate on developing the next generation of more powerful flash memories, in which lines as small as 0.4 and 0.6 microns are etched into silicon wafers. A micron is about one-hundredth the width of a human hair. Production is to begin at a Sharp facility in Fukuyama in 1994. Details, Page 27</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ho Chi Minh City, April 6 KYODO -- Business leaders  from Japan and Vietnam differed on ways to promote Japan's  direct investment in Vietnam as they opened a joint economic  session Wednesday [6 April], conference sources said.    The sources said the Vietnamese side urged Japan to  accelerate direct investment in the country to help promote its  economic development.    The Japanese delegation took a cautious stance on the issue,  seeking Hanoi to consolidate legal and infrastructural measures  to promote the inflow of Japanese capital, they said.    The Japanese panel expressed disappointment at slow progress  in improvement particularly in electric power, transportation  and communications industries, and the double pricing system for  public utilities rates, the sources said.    The conference, the second session of a joint Japan-Vietnam  economic conference, drew attention as it took place amid the  changing international situation in favor of Vietnam, such as  resumption of aid by international financial institutions and  the lifting of economic sanctions by the United States, they  said.    The 117-member Japanese delegation consists of  representatives from about 60 major corporations. The  Vietnamese panel was led by Vice Premier Tran Duc Luong.</p>

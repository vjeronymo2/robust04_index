Chernik, Experimental Meteorology Institute, Obninsk; UDC  614.72+614.77]-074]    [Abstract] The wide-ranging use of toxic chemical  substances and materials leading to an increasingly frequent  development of the so-called ecotoxicological situations (ETS)  due to the discharge of dangerous chemical substances into the  environment (OS) is discussed, and the impracticability and  inexpediency of analyzing all of most of the close to 50  thousand organic and hetero-organic compounds is noted. This  necessitates selection of priority pollutants which must be  analyzed in critical ecotoxicological situations (KETS) when the  contamination sources are unknown and there are no data on the  chemical compounds which led to the critical ecotoxicological  situation. The principal criteria which determine the chemical  substance priority (or ranking) depend on the medium for which  its danger is being assessed. The danger classes of organic  compounds and danger classes of organic compounds based on their  persistence and sorption ability in the soil are summarized;  altogether, five classes are identified on the basis of lethal  doses (LD[.sub]50[/]) and lethal concentrations  (CL[.sub]50[/]) as well as maximum permissible concentrations  (PDK) established by the Public Health Ministry. The study made  it possible to identify the principal list containing 82  substances and eight compound classes and a supplementary list  of 47 compounds which are to be analyzed in the soil during  critical ecotoxicological situations.

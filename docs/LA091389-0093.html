			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KENMORE TO MAKE ROOM FOR BRANDS X, Y AND Z  </P> <P> Sears customers accustomed to seeing the retailer's own Kenmore and LXI brands  in the appliance and electronics department are in for a change.  </P> <P> On Thursday, 28 of the big Chicago-based company's Southern California stores  will introduce Brand Central, a "superstore within a store" offering an array  of more than 70 nationally known brands including Sony, Amana, General  Electric, Whirlpool, Toshiba, Zenith and Hitachi.  </P> <P> The shift is part of Sears' push to win more customers and compete with rivals  such as Montgomery Ward and Circuit City. With Thursday's opening of 136 Brand  Centrals, Sears will be more than halfway through a national rollout.  </P> <P> Since announcing a sweeping strategy change last October, Sears has met with  mixed results as it has begun offering more national brands and moving away  from frequent sales and toward lower regular prices.  </P></p>

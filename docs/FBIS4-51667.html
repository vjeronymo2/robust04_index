			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gwen Benjamin] </F>   [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 30 KYODO -- First feelers by  ASEAN to gauge support from potential member countries for its  proposed East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) has drawn warm  responses from China and South Korea, but Japan remains  negative, according to a confidential report.    The report by the secretary general of the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Ajit Singh, who visited the  three countries in November, described Beijing's support for  EAEC as "strong and conditional," with Seoul being "helpful and  constructive," while Tokyo was "negative." "The Japanese  reaction was not at all encouraging," the report said, pointing  out that Tokyo seemed "overly preoccupied" with the reaction of  the United States, which is excluded from EAEC. A copy of the  report was obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE.    Although ASEAN leaders endorsed the Malaysia-proposed EAEC  in  1992, it has yet to take off chiefly because of Washington's  cool stance toward the purely Asian grouping it views as a  would-be trading bloc aiming to split the Asia-Pacific region.  ASEAN last October agreed to dispatch Ajit to seek the views of  Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan on EAEC, which  Malaysia hopes will be launched this year. The concept was  floated in late 1990 by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir  Mohamed.    The report said officials in Japan, South Korea and China  cautioned ASEAN to move gradually, with more discussions on  defining EAEC's aims before the grouping can be established.  Two main obstacles hampering the birth of EAEC are the U.S.  position, which China termed the "key" to its launch, and  Beijing's objections to Taiwan and Hong Kong joining as core  members, the report said.    ASEAN economic ministers, who discussed the report at their  informal retreat in Malaysia last week, said the association  will brief the U.S. for the first time on EAEC when the two  sides meet in Washington on May 9 and 10 for an annual dialogue.    The report had recommended ASEAN inform the U.S. of the  group's EAEC plans as Washington's opinion was sought by  officials in all three countries. Referring to the Japanese  position, the report said Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro  Matsuura suggested Australia and New Zealand be included within  EAEC since Japan has close trade ties with and relies on them  for resources and foodstuffs. Australia, which originally  suggested the 17-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  forum in 1989, rejected joining the rival EAEC in unofficial  overtures by Japanese Foreign Ministry officials early this  year, according to ministry sources. But Japan, the report  added, appeared to be the `odd man out' since neither China nor  South Korea backed the membership of Australia and New Zealand.    ASEAN has ruled out the two countries and the U.S. from EAEC  due to "geographic" reasons, but Malaysian officials have  privately expressed qualms about Australia, which they see as a  surrogate of the U.S. in the region. The report said Japan  fears EAEC may affect the agenda of an already effective  ASEAN-Japan annual trade dialogue, and that its potential to  undermine APEC needs to be addressed by ASEAN to allay U.S.  concern. An ASEAN official felt Japan was making too many  excuses, but said he understood Japan's quandary of not wanting  to antagonize Washington further amid the current U.S.-Japan  trade dispute stemming from Tokyo's huge trade surplus. The  report quoted Matsuura as questioning Ajit, "do we need an EAEC  and what would it do since we have ASEAN and APEC? What is the  purpose of EAEC?"    APEC includes Japan, the U.S., China and the ASEAN members  of  Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and  Thailand. Some ASEAN members fear the U.S. is manipulating APEC  for its own economic interests. The report suggested that with  China's strong backing for EAEC, ASEAN should reassess Ajit's  planned visits to Hong Kong and Taiwan to avoid sending the  "wrong signals" to Beijing. While China was flexible on Hong  Kong, it strongly opposes Taiwan joining as a core EAEC member,  though it is open to Taiwan's participation later on. Taiwanese  officials have said Taipei is willing to join EAEC at its  founding with "equal footing" and rights as other members.  Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan urged ASEAN to have  prudence on the politically sensitive matter, especially since  Taiwan has been using "elastic diplomacy" in trying to assert  its independence. Taiwan and Hong Kong joined APEC as  "economies" rather than countries to appease Beijing.    The report said South Korea has offered to act as a mediator  for ASEAN with the U.S. and Japan on EAEC, which Seoul is keen  to assist in the development of its structure, although Seoul  has yet to decide on membership. The report quoted Foreign  Minister Hang Sung-chu as saying he would be happy to see EAEC  "getting off the ground" and that its issues should not overlap  with APEC's.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli, former secretary general of  the Hizballah terrorist organization, has again claimed that  Israeli pilot Ron Arad was killed by his captors or died in  captivity. In an interview with the Lebanese newspaper AL-DIYAR  today, al-Tufayli said he does not believe that anyone stands to  gain anything by detaining Arad. He added that the Syrians have  denied that they are holding Arad; in fact, they are searching  for him.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> The Hammond Co., a Newport Beach mortgage banking firm, posted a net loss of  $513,000 for its fiscal first quarter, ended June 30, more than double the  $243,000 loss reported in the same quarter last year. Quarterly revenue fell  10% to $4.5 million this year from $5 million last year. Thomas T. Hammond, the  company's president, attributed the quarterly loss to reduced sales of  loan-servicing rights. He said the company expects to recoup the loss and turn  a profit in the second quarter. Hammond directors also elected William P. Foley  II as a director, expanding the board to eight members. Foley is chairman of  Fidelity National Financial Inc. in Irvine, which bought a 16.3% stake in  Hammond last month. That stake grew to 20% after the company completed a tender  offer to retire one-fifth of its shares.  </P></p>

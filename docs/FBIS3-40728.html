The Rajya Sabha activities were postponed until 1430.    The opposition members of both houses gathered around the  seats of the majority members to show their opposition to  signing the Dunkel proposals and demanding that the prime  minister come to the House to clarify the situation related to  Dunkel. In the Rajya Sabha, after the morning noise, the  question-answer period began, however, nothing was achieved in  the Lok Sabha. The opposition members accused the government of  insulting the Parliament by signing the agreement without taking  them into confidence.    The opposition disrupted the questions session in the Lok  Sabha by making noise and raising slogans. After 20 minutes of  pandemonium, Vice Chairperson Mallika Arjunaiya postponed the  House activities until noon. As soon as the meeting began, the  opposition members demanded that the prime minister should  attend the meeting. They raised slogans in support of their  demand and gathered around the chairperson's seat.    Jaswant Singh was the only BJP member present in the House.  The members said that the government had sold out the nation by  signing this agreement. The statement of Mukul Vasnik, minister  of state for parliamentary affairs, that the Commerce Minister  Pranab Mukherji was ready to clarify the whole situation in the  House did calm the opposition members.    However, the opposition members continued to demand that Mr.  Rao must make a statement. Mr. Vasnik said that making all this  noise will not help anyone. The opposition leaders continued to  raise slogans such as "revoke the Dunkel agreement" and "stop  selling out the nation." Later, the slogans asking for  resignation by Narasimha Rao also echoed in the House.    These members standing in front of the chairperson's seat  were saying that the Dunkel agreement was an agreement to accept  economic slavery. The government, they said, had made agreement  against the nation's economic interests, and this government  does not deserve to stay in power.    The vice chairperson repeatedly said that the commerce  minister was ready to make a statement during the questions  period. He said that the prime minister could not come to the  House for some reason, however, the opposition members were  adamant about the prime minister's attendance.    Mr. Vasnik, the parliamentary affairs state minister, said  that it was the opposition that had asked the commerce minister  to make a statement, and now it is refusing to hear him. He  asked the vice chairperson to set a time for the statement.  Janata Dal's George Fernandes said that India by signing this  agreement had become a U.S. colony. He wanted to know what the  Parliament was for now.    Mr. Pranab Mukherji had some discussion with the vice  chairperson during that time. Somnath Chaterji of the CPI (M)  said that the whole nation and the House was angered by the  government's action.</p>

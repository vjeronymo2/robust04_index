			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Asians seek a head for their bloc - Attempts to find a forum for co-operation ASIAN countries, aware that growing economic power carries with it political responsibilities, agree on the need for greater co-operation. There are divisions, however, over the form it should take and, in particular, the role the US should play within Asia. Two meetings, the first later this month in Singapore and another in Seattle in November, will push forward attempts to forge a more multilateral approach to regional security and economic issues. But western experts are doubtful that they will produce much more than talk. In Singapore foreign ministers from the Association of South East Asian Nations - which represents Brunei, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines - will meet counterparts from the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and the European Community. Other countries, including Russia, Vietnam and Laos, have also been invited in the most broad-based regional discussions yet. The meeting will look at how regional disputes can be kept in check with the end of the cold war and a scaling down of US troops in Asia. The North Korean nuclear threat, the future of Taiwan, and disputed territory in the South China Sea all pose significant security risks for the future. But as Mr Gerald Segal, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, points out: 'At a time when there are real security issues on the agenda, is it enough to be just discussing them?' He says nothing of substance has been done to solve the dispute over the Spratly Islands, claimed by China and several other countries, because nobody wants to upset Beijing. A series of confidence-building measures should be undertaken, such as a regional listing of arms sales, to improve transparency in relations, Mr Segal says. A similar lack of progress has characterised discussion of regional trade issues. Asean is the region's most active trade grouping but the US is pushing for the 15-member Asian-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum to be given a more prominent role. The US and Japan are members of Apec, which groups together most south and east Asian countries - including the 'three Chinas' (China, Taiwan and Hong Kong) - along with Australia and New Zealand. Malaysia, however, with the support of some Asian countries, is proposing an alternative, more restrictive, East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC), which would exclude the US, Australia and New Zealand. Mr Gareth Evans, foreign minister of Australia, which was the driving force behind Apec's creation sees its future as a powerful vehicle for regional trade liberalisation to be built on the principle of 'open regionalism - that is, not aimed at putting up barriers to the rest of the world'. Apec is 'starting to lock in much more specifically and in a much more switched-on way to the absolutely mainstream economic debate about the future of the region,' Mr Evans said in an interview. The US, which does more trade with Asian countries than with Europe, is keen to play an active role in the region's trade issues. Hence, President Clinton's call for an 'informal leadership conference' of Apec in Seattle to map out a grand vision of future co-operation. The US government's enthusiasm, however, is not shared by some Asian countries and Apec is a long way from establishing any trade agreements. Washington will have its diplomatic hands full to persuade leaders from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong simultaneously to attend the summit. Mr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, has already said he will not attend. Malaysian officials believe Apec could become a western-dominated trade bloc and Mr Abdullah Badawi, the Malaysian foreign minister, said last weekend he would ask other Asean leaders to refuse Mr Clinton's invitation. The US may struggle to win over Asian governments which are sceptical of Washington's commitment to free trade. Rather, many Asian diplomats believe the US sees Apec as a means of preventing a purely Asian trading bloc, such as Mr Mahathir's EAEC proposal, emerging. Mr Peter Ferdinand, who heads the Asia programme at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, says Apec is weakened by the US which, while apparently promoting it, adopts a confrontational approach to Japan on market access and attaches human rights conditions to its trade relations with China. The short-term outcome is likely to be a compromise which leads to a confusing proliferation of acronyms and suits none of the parties. Indonesia takes over from the US as Apec chairman in November and will probably support EAEC's creation. Jakarta will argue, however, for EAEC to fall under the umbrella of Apec, rather than be an extension of Asean, which Kuala Lumpur would prefer. How hard any of the parties will push depends in large measure on the outcome of negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. If the Gatt talks fail, Asian attempts to strike trade agreements will take on a new significance.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTRA-ASIAN TRADE 1991 (Dollars m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TO:                  China   NIEs*     SE    26 Asian   Japan   World                                      Asia  developing                                             countries  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FROM: China                    -    36.3    2.1        39.8    10.3    70.4 NIEs                  27.9    41.7   24.9        99.0    32.1   307.8 South-east Asia        2.4    23.3    4.5        31.8    23.6   102.4 26 Asian developing   countries           30.6   104.2   32.8       176.0    69.1   511.0 Japan                  8.6    66.9   25.6       105.0       -   314.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Newly Industrialising Economies: HK, S Korea, Singapore, Taiwan Sources: IMF and Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Taiwan  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / US presses India on nuclear curbs A US delegation of officials yesterday pressed India to attend a conference of South Asian countries on nuclear non-proliferation. India is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), despite having exploded a nuclear device in 1974, arguing that the treaty discriminates in favour of established nuclear powers. Pakistan proposed the five-nation conference for a nuclear weapons-free zone, to which China - another nuclear power that has refused to sign the NPT - is to be invited. While the US still feels that India should sign the NPT, it sees the conference as the next best alternative. India has not specifically turned down the proposal, but believes it does not tackle the issue of nuclear proliferation. It also feels that the Pakistan proposal does not take into account its security needs. Officials said the proposed conference does not place controls on Pakistan's clandestine nuclear weapons programme. Also discussed at the two-day Indo-US talks were US curbs on spares and components for research and development in India's missile technology programme. The curbs were imposed after India recently tested an intermediate ballistic missile despite US disapproval.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE TALKS ON LARGER ANTI-DRUG PLAN COLLAPSE;  </P> <P> HATFIELD BLAMES DEADLOCK ON BYRD, WHO ACCUSES WHITE HOUSE OF MEDDLING  </P> <P> Weeklong talks between Senate Democrats and Republicans over proposed  expansions of President Bush's anti-drug initiative broke off abruptly Friday,  with both sides blaming the other for the 11-hour deadlock.  </P> <P> Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee  and the chief Democratic negotiator, accused the White House of working "in the  shadows" to torpedo a bipartisan compromise on increasing the President's  $7.9-billion drug plan.  </P> <P> But Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.), who led the Republican team, countered that  Byrd had called off the negotiations after rejecting the latest GOP offer, even  though an agreement was within reach.  </P> <P> "I thought we were moving very close, and I thought we'd complete our task  today," Hatfield told reporters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Bills Jeopardized  </P> <P> No additional sessions were scheduled, and it was unclear if negotiations would  be resumed next week. In addition to delaying progress on the President's drug  plan, the impasse jeopardizes passage of several key appropriations bills  before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1.  </P> <P> Although the Senate often makes back-room deals on legislation, the drug talks  were exceptional because they centered on a major new presidential proposal  involving what is generally regarded as the nation's most pressing problem.  </P> <P> Comments by negotiators on both sides indicated that the Democrats and  Republicans were only $50 million to $150 million apart when the talks broke  down and that the impasse could be resolved if other issues were settled.  </P> <P> One major dispute involved how much additional money would be spent on  prevention, treatment and education. The three areas are high on the Democrats'  priority list, in contrast to Bush's primary emphasis on law enforcement.  </P> <P> Byrd, however, charged that the White House had jeopardized progress toward a  compromise by intervening in the negotiations and causing increasing demands  for Democratic concessions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Compromise Possible  </P> <P> "We gave, but there was no take," he said. "I'm tired of dealing with a shadow  team on the other side. I don't see any point in meeting and meeting and haggle  and haggle and chip away and chip away." Despite the unexpected collapse of the  talks, both sides indicated that they may try to salvage a compromise after a  weekend break.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping we'll take a clear Monday morning view," Hatfield said. "We have to  wage this war. The sooner we get at it, the better."  </P> <P> "The door is open," said Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate  Budget Committee and a key negotiator. Byrd agreed, noting that he was "always  at the other end of the telephone" but was tired of meetings with no results.  </P> <P> Without an agreement on an anti-drug package, Byrd said, pending appropriations  bills would turn the Senate into a "free-for-all" as Democrats and Republicans  vied to outdo each other with amendments to expand the drug war.  </P> <P> Several key appropriations bills have been stymied in the Senate by Republicans  who hope to force a bipartisan agreement on an anti-drug measure.  </P> <P> One result may be adoption of a generally disliked "continuing resolution" to  keep running the government on an interim basis if all spending bills are not  passed by Oct. 1.  </P> <P> A continuing resolution allows federal agencies to continue spending at  previous levels, but it prevents new programs from starting and blocks  additional funds for existing programs.  </P> <P> Hatfield said the Republican senators, acting with White House approval,  offered to increase spending by $850 million more than Bush's proposal and to  allocate $750 million of that amount for treatment and prevention, as the  Democrats wanted.  </P> <P> Byrd, however, said his side already had made many concessions and wanted to  raise Bush's spending level by $1 billion, with $800 million of that amount  earmarked for treatment and prevention.  </P> <P> Both senators said there had been "serious discussion" of a compromise  $900-million increase.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expansion Proposed  </P> <P> The nine-member Democratic and Republican negotiating teams consisted of senior  lawmakers appointed by the Senate leaders. The teams met repeatedly to search  for a compromise agreement. After the President announced his drug plan in a  nationally televised speech on Sept. 5, Byrd proposed expanding it by $2.2  billion. He suggested providing additional financing with an across-the-board  spending cut in most federal programs.  </P> <P> Republicans countered with a plan to increase the President's proposal by $600  million, financed by a smaller across-the-board cut and certain additional  reductions outside the defense area.  </P> <P> If there is no agreement, Sasser predicted, senators from both parties would  offer amendments to cut weapons systems from the Pentagon budget and shift the  funds into the drug war.  </P></p>

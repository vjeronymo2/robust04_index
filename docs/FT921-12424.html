			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / French Bonds: Stability defies convention after rate rises CONVENTIONAL wisdom suggests that two rises in official interest rates in little more than a month should not be good news for bonds. But conventions have little or nothing to do with modern markets where investors are influenced as much by the international environment as by the exigencies of individual economies. Hence the French bond market has remained surprisingly stable so far this year, despite France's recent round of rate rises. 'It's all emotion,' said Mr Christopher Potts, market strategist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. 'Anyone with any sense knows that French interest rates cannot come down until the German rate falls in a few months' time. But investors are looking at the international rather than the domestic context, and France now seems much more attractive than the US, Canada or Australia.' As a result French bonds, like their German counterparts, have been buoyed by the switch of international investment into Europe. Rates on the benchmark 10-year OAT government bond rose to 8.45 per cent on Friday, from a cyclical low of 8.36 per cent on Wednesday. This compares to levels of 8.75 a month ago. The Matif's 10-year notional OAT futures contract was stable beginning the week at 108.72 and ending it at 108.66, against 108 at the end of last year. One encouraging sign for the French market was that the spread over German bunds has been falling. The bund differential is now seen as a critical indicator of the French market's health given that France's currency and now its interest rates are effectively tied to those of Germany. The trend before the Maastricht summit was for the bund differential to widen. Since then the spread has narrowed. The differential peaked at 70 basis points in early November, slipped to 60 or 65 by mid-December and had fallen to around 50 basis points last week. Most analysts expect the spread to fall further. Meanwhile, the prospects for the French economy are more clouded than ever. Official forecasts for gross domestic product have growth of 1.4 per cent in 1991 followed by growth of between 2 and 2.2 per cent in 1992. Goldman Sachs, like most other forecasters, is more cautious, favouring growth of just 1 per cent to 2 per cent for this year. Last week's announcement that industrial production fell by 0.6 per cent in November compared with October highlighted the mood of 'Franco-pessimism' as Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, calls it. Yet the French can seek solace in low inflation. The December inflation figures disclosed an increase of 0.1 per cent, producing a total of 3.1 per cent for 1991, this represents a fall from 3.4 per cent in 1990. Rising unemployment suggests inflation should stay low for the foreseeable future - just the way the bond markets like it.</p>

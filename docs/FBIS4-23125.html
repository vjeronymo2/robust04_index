			<p>SUMMARY                                         Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik's efforts to improve relations with  the Hungarian minority suffered a setback when the government's  legislation on using bilingual signs in Hungarian-populated areas  was rejected by parliament.  Vehement opposition from former  Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's party--the largest in  parliament--and increasing pressure by Hungarian minority parties  to make more concessions have dimmed prospects for easing  interethnic tensions.                                    END SUMMARY     Possibly calculating that further efforts in behalf of the  Hungarian minority would undercut his party's chances in the 30  September parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik  has indicated that other legislation to grant the Hungarian  minority in southern Slovakia greater cultural autonomy might  have to wait until after the elections.  Following the  parliament's rejection of the bilingual sign legislation on 3  June, the coalition parties announced that although they will  reintroduce the bill in July, they will not make any concessions  to Hungarian demands to widen the scope of the legislation (CTK,  17 June).  On 14 June, Moravcik told Bratislava radio that a     "solution" on the issue will most likely "be the responsibility  of the future government" after the autumn elections.  In an  interview published in the 14 June edition of Budapest daily  Nepszabadsag, Moravcik said that he "assumes" that "establishing  conditions for" the signing of the European charter on minority  issues will also be a "task for a new government."     Apparently trying to gain support from Hungarian minority parties  as well as improve relations with Hungary, Moravcik has attempted  to improve on his predecessor Vladimir Meciar's tense  relationship with the Hungarian minority.  Shortly after he  replaced Meciar in March, Moravcik announced that his governing  coalition had agreed to offer some concessions to the Hungarian  parties in exchange for their support of his "policy statement."  Among the Hungarian demands were laws protecting Hungarian  surnames and placenames and the establishment of special  departments for minorities in the Education and Culture  Ministries (Bratislava radio, 10 May).  On 27 May, the government  fulfilled the first of these demands by passing a law allowing  Hungarians to enter names in local registers without the "ova"  suffix normally used by Slovak women (SME, 28 May).  When he  introduced his policy statement to parliament, Moravcik said that  his predecessor's "nurturing of national intolerance" was "alien"  to Slovaks' "national character," adding that the creation of a  "peaceful atmosphere" between citizens "of different ethnic  backgrounds" is "of great value" (Bratislava radio, 12 April).     Meciar Opposition     Meciar has sought to use Moravcik's support for improving  relations with the Hungarians against him by portraying the prime  minister as an unwitting tool of foreign governments.  Shortly  after Moravcik's government was confirmed, Meciar accused it of  coming to a "secret agreement" with the Hungarian parties that  met "outrageous conditions" demanded by the Hungarians (CRK, 8  May).  Following parliament's rejection of the proposed signpost  law, Meciar accused Hungarians at home and abroad of "staking  out" territory "by means of signposts" and called the government  a "vassal" of Budapest (Slovenska Republika, 4 June).  The 68  deputies--out of 150 in the parliament--from Meciar's Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and its ally, the Slovak  National Party (SNS) were instrumental in rejecting the signpost  law and walked out of parliament in protest over the passage of  an earlier bill on Hungarian surnames (CTK, 7 June; SME, 28 May).     Hungarian Pressure     Threatening to cut off vital support for the government, the  Hungarian parties have put Moravcik under growing pressure to  provide concessions to minorities.  Tacit support from the two  Hungarian parties represented in parliament--Coexistence with  nine deputies and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement  (MKDH) with five--has given the governing coalition a slim  majority on many legislative issues.  According to CTK, however,  by either abstaining or voting against the signpost bill, three  Coexistence deputies, protesting an amendment exempting villages  named after Slovak historical figures, left the government one  vote short of the number necessary to pass the law (CTK, 7 June).  Coexistence chairman Miklos Duray linked his continued  cooperation with the government to its ability to reach a  compromise on the issue (CTK, 15 June).  Although MKDH leader  Vojtech Bugar, who is attempting to form an electoral coalition  with Coexistence, had earlier condemned Duray's statement that  the governing coalition was "not keeping its promises" to the  Hungarians, MKDH leaders have recently echoed Duray's threat to  withdraw support for the government.  While Bugar had earlier  stated that "even a blind person" could see that the agreement's  points are being "successively fulfilled" (SME, 31 May), he  asserted on 6 June that the government had "not yet fulfilled its  promise" to set up minority deprtments in various ministries  (SME, 7 June).  Demanding that the government amend the signpost  law to reflect the objections of the Hungarian dissenters, MKDH  deputy Pal Farkas warned that "nobody can expect blind support  from us" (CTK, 15 June).     Implications     With early parliamentary elections rapidly approaching,  Moravcik's ability, and willingness, to pass legislation he had  promised to the Hungarian parties appears to be limited.  The  issue of the government's relations with the Hungarians will  likely be utilized by both Meciar, who is seeking to portray the  governing coalition as a threat to the Slovak nation, and by the  Hungarian parties, which could try to encourage a strong  Hungarian turnout at the elections by playing an increasingly  prominent political role.  Under such pressures, Moravcik will  find it difficult both to placate Hungarian demands in return for  their support on vital legislative matters--such as a new  privatization law--and to avoid any appearance of caving in to  Hungarian demands right before the elections.

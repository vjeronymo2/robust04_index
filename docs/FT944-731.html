			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Fear of failure may reunite the Northern League: A snap election could spell the end for Italy's divided regionalist party If a thick skin is a prime requisite for a successful politician, then Mr Umberto Bossi, the garrulous leader of the populist Northern League, is set to be very successful indeed. This week he has been pilloried with insults of betrayal from within and without his party for provoking the downfall of the Berlusconi government. Mr Berlusconi was the most vicious, labelling him a 'despicable traitor' for bringing a no confidence motion against the government his party had agreed to join. But the League leader has given as good as he got, with his gravelly voice and rude vocabulary. Indeed he now bears the impish smile of a schoolboy whose prank has gone slightly wrong. To regard Mr Bossi as a traitor within the coalition is a gross over-simplification. He made an electoral pact with Mr Berlusconi which was based on mutual convenience. The League brought to Mr Berlusconi's newly-born Forza Italia the political respectability of a vigorous reformist movement that had toppled the long- standing hegemony of the Christian Democrats in northern Italy. In return Mr Berlusconi provided funds, his media power, and his media appeal as new political figure. Mr Bossi and Mr Berlusconi may share a common identification with their northern roots, but politically they have little in common. Mr Bossi, as the head of a lively regional party that has grown from the grass roots upwards, is wedded to the idea of a more federal Italy. Mr Berlusconi has national political ambitions and leads a political movement which is tailored for his self-promotion and which was set in motion by supporters drawn from his Fininvest business empire. Ideologically, Mr Bossi is a liberal; Mr Berlusconi embraces an ill-defined right-wing demagogy. The outcome of the March general election results altered the marriage of convenience to a more unequal relationship. Although the League had won a similar number of deputies to Forza Italia and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, Mr Berlusconi's electoral partner in the south, Mr Bossi had only one bargaining chip. This was the threat of withdrawing the League's support from the coalition - without which Mr Berlusconi could not survive. Mr Bossi cleverly used this threat from the outset, which explains why the premier was permanently exasperated by him. Mr Berlusconi countered the danger of withdrawal by the League by threatening early elections and dropping Mr Bossi as an ally. With an electoral system under which 75 per cent of deputies are chosen on a first-past-the-post basis, League candidates would be extremely vulnerable if they stood alone when other parties have formed coalitions. This counter-threat lasted only so long as Mr Berlusconi's standing in the opinion polls remained high. Since September his ratings have fallen, and it has simply been a question of when Mr Bossi would make the break. Not surprisingly, he chose the moment the premier came under investigation for corruption by Milan magistrates and had been humiliated by unions threatening a general strike. Having now brought down the government, Mr Bossi and the League still face the same threat, as Mr Berlusconi is determined to force early elections. The League's candidates cannot fight elections alone without the risk of being wiped out. They need allies to succeed in the majority voting system. The collective fear of becoming a vanishing political force could prove sufficient glue to keep the movement together in the wake of Mr Bossi's 'treason' against the government. As many as 40 of the 105 League deputies have said they will remain loyal to Mr Berlusconi and have formed a dissident group headed by Mr Roberto Maroni, the wily interior minister and long-time intimate of Mr Bossi. Mr Maroni, like Mr Bossi, knows full well a snap election could finish the League. He is equally aware that should the dissidents wish to abandon Mr Berlusconi, the options are few and unattractive. The League's natural allies should be Forza Italia; but this is an ill-defined movement lacking proper organisation and wholly dependent upon the political fortunes of Mr Berlusconi. Of the alternative allies, the small Christian Democratic Centre - the rump of the old Christian Democrat party - is too small; the MSI/National Alliance is too right-wing for many in the League; and the former communist PDS is too left-wing. Thus suggestions that the League will break up are premature, especially if its members realise the value of the principle: united we stand, divided we fall.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Local rivals unite in gloom IN THE Hertfordshire town of Stevenage, Mr Clive Willmott, chairman of the local Chamber of Commerce, and Mr Alan Daley, a street trader - 'cash paid for old gold' - voted differently at the general election. But they now appear to have much in common on the economy and Europe. Mr Willmott, who works as a financial services consultant in Stevenage's industrial park, remains unimpressed by the government's performance of late, is not convinced that the latest cut in interest rates is sufficient to help some of his members who are on the verge of bankruptcy, and considers his commitment to the 'European ideal' undented. 'If I'd been running my company the way the government has been running the economy over the last week I would have gone bust a long time ago,' he said. 'You sack whole boards for this kind of thing. 'You can't blame it on the Germans or the ERM . . . you mustn't lose sight of the fact that we've had two world wars and European economic integration is intended to stop that from ever happening again.' Mr Daley looked despondently at the trickle of people making their way along the market stalls. 'Interest rates cut? It's had absolutely no effect here today,' he said. 'People are fed up with the word interest rate, down today, up tomorrow. We need good tough negotiators like Kohl and Mitterrand.' Euro-sceptics could take comfort in the comment of Mr Paul Stevens, a postal worker: 'If there was a referendum here tomorrow, the majority of us would vote No, wouldn't we?' In 1946, Stevenage - twinned with Ingelheim in Germany and Autun in France - was designated as the first new town for blitzed Londoners. But the dream of housing and jobs for all has turned sour in recent years. Unemployment has risen in the past three years from 4 per cent to 10.7 per cent. The recession has been most obviously felt in redundancies by the town's biggest employer, British Aerospace. Mr David Cullen, a member of the majority Labour council who works as a dynamics systems engineer at the local BAe plant, said: 'The perception here is that the government has screwed up, rather than Europe. Many of my work colleagues are white-collar staff who voted Conservative but now feel conned.' While the mood was overwhelmingly negative on the government's economic performance, it was by no means unanimous. Mrs Diane Clark, a health visitor, welcomed the interest rate cut. 'We've been trying to sell my house without success for six months and buy another one with a mortgage we can afford. We are in with a chance now.'</p>

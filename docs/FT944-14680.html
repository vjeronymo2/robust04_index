			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T flat despite record rise in revenue following McCaw merger AT&amp;T, the leading US telecommunications group, yesterday said revenues jumped by a record 8.3 per cent in the third quarter but its net income was virtually static. These were the first results to reflect AT&amp;T's recently completed merger with McCaw Cellular Communications. Although the deal in effect depressed short-term profitability, it also opened up an important new source of revenue for the group by giving it a solid presence in the growing market for wireless communications. Net income for the enlarged group was Dollars 1.05bn, or 67 cents a share, compared with restated profits of Dollars 1.02bn, or 66 cents, for the same period of 1993. About 10 per cent, or 9 cents a share, was sliced off the combined earnings by the dilutive effect of 200m new shares issued by AT&amp;T as part of the merger deal. Associated expenses reduced profits by a further 11 cents, or Dollars 170m. AT&amp;T's underlying perform-ance was robust. Without the merger, net income would have shown a solid 13 per cent increase to Dollars 1.19bn, or 87 cents a share, against Dollars 1.05bn, or 78 cents, a year earlier. Stripping out the McCaw contribution, revenues were still strong, up nearly 8 per cent at Dollars 18bn. Wall Street had expected slightly lower figures. 'No matter how you look at the numbers, they add up to a very good quarter from operations,' said Mr Robert Allen, chairman. The improvement was evident across the board. Long-distance calling volumes climbed more than 7 per cent, due in part to the success of consumer incentive programmes. Gross profit margin showed a gain, too, helping to lift telecom-munications revenues by 3.5 per cent to nearly Dollars 11bn. McCaw Cellular generated total revenues of Dollars 735m, against Dollars 563m in the 1993 quarter. Its subscription base grew to 3.6m. Sales of products - including network equipment, computer systems and microelectronic components and others - surged by 20 per cent to Dollars 5.07bn. However, the good results failed to have much impact on AT&amp;T's share price, which was up a scant Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 54 3/8 in early trading. For the first nine months of the year, consolidated net income was Dollars 3.37bn, or Dollars 2.16 a share, on revenues of Dollars 53.9bn. Restating the year-earlier figures, the company would have reported a net loss of Dollars 5.5bn, on sales of Dollars 50.2bn.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Strategy on jobs 'beats EC rivals' THE GOVERNMENT is 'winning the argument' with its European partners about how to combat unemployment by reducing employment regulation and increasing labour flexibility, according to Mr David Hunt, employment secretary. He was speaking yesterday as the Treasury and his own department released separate submissions to European Commission reviews of competition and employment. The Treasury submission says that improving skills and productivity is not, as often argued, in conflict with reducing the high cost and strict regulation of labour. It adds: 'On the contrary, if the costs of employment are too high, profits are reduced and investment in both capital goods and human skills is held back.' The report says that EC labour costs rose by 4 per cent a year during the 1980s compared with 0 per cent to 1 per cent in the US and Japan. Also, public social security and healthcare as a proportion of GDP is nearly twice as high in the EC compared with Japan and more than 60 per cent higher than in the US. The employment department submission to the Social Affairs Directorate General's green paper review of employment legislation, due in the autumn, says that co-operation between member states is usually preferable to legislation. Where legislation is necessary it should only be drawn up after much wider consultation than was customary and should just set a general framework allowing individual countries to fill in details. The submission does support further work in such areas as cross-border mobility by, for example, facilitating the portability of occupational pensions.</p>

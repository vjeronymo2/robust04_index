The summit  included Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Butrus Sfayr; Shaykh  Muhammad Rashid Qabbani, acting mufti of the Republic; and  Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, deputy chairman of the  Higher Islamic Shiite Council. The latter two visited Bkirki to  offer condolences to the victims of yesterday's explosion.    The heads of the Muslim community informed Patriarch Sfayr  that Druze spiritual leader Shaykh Bahjat Ghayth will not be  able to come for health reasons and that they were asked to  speak on his behalf and extend his condolences.    Shaykh Shams-al-Din clarified that a small committee  consisting of the Islamic-Christian dialogue group has been  commissioned to hold contacts with officials and urge them to  take the necessary measures to uncover this crime and its  criminals.    After leaving Bkirki, Shams-al-Din said the target of the  crime is not the church or the worshipers, but the heart and  unity of Lebanon and the government's projects. He affirmed  that the criminal hand is not Lebanese. It is certainly a  foreign hand. He noted that this crime has not been committed  against the Maronite community alone, nor against the Muslims  alone, but against all Lebanese.    Shaykh Qabbani said that the fingerprints on the church and  Hebron Mosque massacres are the same. He called on the Lebanese  to arm themselves with comprehensive national unity. He  affirmed that the Lebanese will never be dragged into sectarian  sedition and that there is no justification for what happened,  no matter what the reasons.    A Hizballah delegation was one of the most prominent  visitors  at the Patriarchate today and it took part in the service for  the victims of the church bomb. A delegation from the National  Liberal Party also visited Bkirki today to express their  condemnation and pain over the crime.    The Amal Movement condemned the massacre at the Sayyidat  al-Najat Church and saw it as an extension of the massacre at  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. The General Labor Federation also  condemned the crime and asked the state to track down the  criminals and punish them as severely as possible so that they  would be an example to others.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Glory days gone for discount pioneer - Kmart's costly expansion and modernisation has turned sour Kmart, the US retailer and pioneer of the discount store concept in the early 1960s, was rewarded for its invention for one fleeting moment in the late-1980s, when it became the world's biggest retailer. Now, in the 1990s, it is still near the top of the league in terms of annual sales - but in terms of last year's profits, it looks like a company on the ropes. After five years of disappointing earnings, Kmart went from bad to appalling with the figures it reported on Monday. For the fourth quarter to January, it turned in net losses of Dollars 1.2bn, compared with net profits of Dollars 535m last time. For the year as a whole, it reported net losses of Dollars 974m, compared with net profits of Dollars 941m a year earlier. Admittedly, there were special factors at work. During the fourth quarter, it incurred costs of nearly Dollars 1.9bn pre-tax for the disposal of some operations and the restructuring of others. However, even after stripping out all the unusual charges, and ignoring the losses made by the discontinued operations, the group would only have shown net income for the year of Dollars 534m - clearly unsatisfactory for a group with sales of Dollars 34.2bn. In contrast, Kmart's bigger rival, Wal-Mart, reported net income of Dollars 2.3bn on turnover of Dollars 67.3bn for the same period, even after acquiring Kmart's loss-making Pace Membership Warehouse operations during the year. However it's not only the financial performance of the two companies that separates them: they have also followed contrasting strategies. While Wal-Mart has stuck closely to general merchandising, either through its discount stores or membership warehouses, Kmart has bamboozled observers with its changes of direction. These started in the 1980s when, faced with growing competition from Wal-Mart and other discount-store operators, it started looking for new sources of profits growth. Following Woolworth's example, it decided specialty retailing was the answer, and set about using the cashflow from its discount stores to gain a foothold in new sectors. It bought or set up the PayLess Drug Stores chain, the Waldenbooks and Borders book stores, the Sports Authority sporting goods shops, the Builders Square home improvement stores, and the OfficeMax office supplies chain. Confusingly, however, it also sought to expand in general merchandising by making forays into the hypermarket or membership warehouse business, first by taking a stake in the Makro hypermarket chain and then buying the Pace Membership Warehouse operation. Both ventures proved unsuccessful, ending in heavy write-downs. Next, the core of its strategy started to weaken when it discovered that the discount stores could not be relied upon to generate the cash required, because they needed heavy investment to survive the competition from Wal-Mart and other discount store groups. In 1990, Kmart responded to the competitive threat by launching a costly modernisation programme for the discount stores. By 1992 it had reached its goal of refurbishing 450 stores a year. However, it abruptly scaled back the programme, saying it wanted to consider re-entering the hypermarket sector with a new Super Kmart format. In January, another about-turn came when Kmart announced that the results coming through from the refurbished discount stores were so good the modernisation programme would resume, absorbing the larger part of a Dollars 1.3bn restructuring charge. Meanwhile, back in retailing, the PayLess Drug Store chain produced unimpressive results and was sold last year. Taken as a whole, the other specialty retailing operations have delivered profits falling short of target and, in January, Kmart announced it planned to sell between 20 and 30 per cent of their equity in a series of stock sales. An optimistic view of Kmart's outlook for 1994 would be that all the bad news had been cleared away, and that the company was poised for growth. However, the state of the share price, hovering close to its 12-month low of Dollars 18 3/4 , suggests that few in the market subscribe to that view. Kmart's lack of a clear strategic direction is only one reason for the pessimism. The other is that it is not up to the competition with Wal-Mart because the latter is simply a better retailer. Last year, for example, the poor financial performance of Kmart's discount stores was largely explained by the fact that it overstocked on goods that people did not want, and ran out of things they did want. Analysts say this does not happen at Wal-Mart, because it is ahead in using technology to match what people want with what it stocks. 'Wal-Mart has a much better read of what is selling in its stores, so it doesn't carry dead inventory,' says Ms Maureen McGrath of Smith Barney Shearson, the Wall Street brokerage house. Kmart has also invested in technology, but it has not been enough to stop Wal-Mart's inexorable growth. Last year, Wal-Mart's sales - already twice the size of Kmart's - rose by more than 20 per cent, and analysts believe they will advance by another 20-25 per cent this year. Since the market itself is barely growing, something else will have to give. Seen in that context, Kmart's troubles seem far from over.</p>

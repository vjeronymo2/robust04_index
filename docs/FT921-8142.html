			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Singapore retailer slides 27% to SDollars 8m COLD Storage, the Singapore supermarket operator and food retailer, yesterday reported a 27 per cent fall in net profits, to SDollars 8m (USDollars 4.9m) for the first half to December from SDollars 10.9m a year earlier. Sales were flat at SDollars 218.6m compared with SDollars 221.7m, AP-DJ reports from Singapore. The directors said pre-tax profits fell 37 per cent to SDollars 12.1m from SDollars 19.3m because the previous period included SDollars 19.6m in profit from subsidiaries which had since been deconsolidated. For the ongoing activities, pre-tax profits fell 3.1 per cent to SDollars 12.1m from SDollars 12.5m, and turnover also rose 8.2 per cent to SDollars 218.6m from SDollars 202.1m. Earnings per share fell 27 per cent to 6.39 cents from 8.78 cent, while the dividend is being raised to 3.25 cents a share from 3 cents. The directors said that while performance of the group's retail, wholesale distribution and trading, and ice and storage businesses was satisfactory, its beverage operations continued to face difficulties. Beverage manufacturing was closed down last month, they added. They are expecting the second half to be better than last year's, although they are predicting increasingly competitive trading conditions. They are also expecting interest income to 'be impacted by lower interest rates'.</p>

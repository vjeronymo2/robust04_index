The principal, a 29-year-old Swede,  was sentenced to 11 years in prison for, among other things,  aggravated drug crime. The other persons involved got varying  sentences, from nine years in prison to suspended sentences. The  network was uncovered in the spring of 1989, when two young men  were caught at Arlanda airport with 4 kilos of cocaine in their  baggage. The police were able to determine that the men had  brought the drugs from Colombia, where a 25-year-old Stockholm  resident had begun a trade in cocaine with Europe.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dieter Kopp from Bonn] </F>   [Text] At a news conference in Bonn today, Federal Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel commented on the prospects of the  Bosnian-Croatian summit meeting on Petersberg near Bonn  scheduled to begin tomorrow afternoon. Kinkel sees a slight ray  of hope, but does not want to demonstrate too much optimism,  because, Kinkel says, we have been bitterly disappointed too  often.    In the scope of a comprehensive foreign policy tour  d'horizon, Kinkel viewed the situation in the Balkans and  stressed that the patience of the United Nations, the Europeans,  and above all the French and British is not inexhaustible. We  have arrived at a certain turning point, he said, adding that a  mood is spreading showing that if the parties to the conflict do  not really demonstrate their readiness to find a solution, they  must consider that the troops will be withdrawn; this would  mean, among other things, that no humanitarian relief can be  provided for the needy any more.    There is no doubt that the federal foreign minister will  inform the opponents about this assessment before their closed  meeting begins tomorrow afternoon.    The participants in the negotiations, led by Presidents  Alija  Izetbegovic and Franjo Tudjman, will be alone. Possibly, the  two mediators, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, will be  called in. But this is a matter to be decided by the chief  negotiators.    Kinkel does not see himself as a mediator. He said that Bonn  will only host the meeting. The foreign minister will be in  Berlin tomorrow evening, but his plane is ready to take off at  any time in case he is needed on the Rhine. Kinkel, who in his  own words was surprised by his role as a host -- the news  reached him at his party's Epiphany meeting in Stuttgart --  believes the summit will, in any case, last until Sunday [9  January].    The main issues in his view will be an end to the fighting,  the future of Mostar, and access to the sea. He is convinced  that the Muslims will only be ready to sign any agreement on the  Balkans under one condition, namely, that the Europeans  guarantee its observance.    In his foreign policy tour d'horizon, Kinkel also commented  extensively on the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels and the  extension of NATO to the East, which will be discussed there.  He predicted that there will be no guarantees of assistance for  the East European states, and he also expressed understanding  for the fact that Poland and other East European states are not  satisfied with this development.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Clothes retailers hit as Brussels imposes limits on silk imports The imported silk shirt could soon disappear from the British chain store. Clothes retailers say that harsh import restrictions levelled against Chinese textiles by the European Commission have left them with millions of pounds' worth of silk clothing sitting in Asian ports, paid for, but now unlikely to be delivered. Until last month there were no limits on silk clothing imports into the UK, and the market was thriving. The silk shirt, once an expensive specialist purchase, was on the racks of all the big clothing chains thanks to cheaper imports from China. However, Brussels introduced a Europe-wide system of quotas on Chinese imports not covered under its bilateral trade arrangements, and British importers say they have already filled this year's European silk quota of 20,000 tonnes. Trade officials at the Chinese embassy in London protested yesterday that the quota was introduced without consultation. The low ceiling was set as the Commission began preparing for wide-ranging market-opening negotiations with Beijing. Apparently unaware of the axe that was about to fall, retailers such as Marks and Spencer, Burtons, C&amp;A, BHS and Sock Shop ordered shirts on which irrevocable letters of credit were issued. 'It is not just that these items were paid for and now can't be got into the country, but the level of the quotas is so low that it represents a scandalous interruption to the flow of trade,' Mr Hugh Clark, the director of trading policy at the British Retail Consortium, said yesterday. The Department of Trade and Industry confirmed that licences issued for Chinese silk imports into the UK had already reached the limit. In 1992, before the silk boom, European imports were 12,000 tonnes, according to the Commission, but UK retailers say their imports more than trebled last year. 'We will be OK for about two months, but then that's it,' said TEL Europe, silk supplier to the Burton Group and BhS, among others. 'There will certainly be no silk shirts for the pre-Christmas shopper. And we are looking at a fall in our business to a third of last year's level.' The DTI is lobbying hard for an increase to the quotas. But Brussels is adamant that not only will it not alter this year's quotas, but that the quotas will stand, subject to negotiations with China.</p>

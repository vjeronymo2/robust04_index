			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: CLEVELAND STATE FIRES MACKEY AS COACH AFTER ARREST, DRUG TEST  </P> <P> Cleveland State basketball Coach Kevin Mackey was fired Thursday, six days  after his arrest for alleged drunk driving.  </P> <P> His lawyer, David Roth, said Mackey will soon begin treatment for drug and  alcohol abuse at a center in Houston run by NBA player John Lucas.  </P> <P> Mackey was arrested as he and a woman drove away from a reputed drug house. A  urinalysis revealed that Mackey was drunk and had cocaine in his system, police  said. Also arrested was Alma Massey, 36, who has a history of soliciting,  according to police.  </P> <P> "I just said that I fired Kevin Mackey, but really, he fired himself,"  university President John A. Flower said at a news conference. "It has become  clear over the past few days that Kevin Mackey has, by his own admission,  habitually and repeatedly made a mockery of standards of moral and ethical  behavior."  </P> <P> Mackey pleaded not guilty to driving while intoxicated, consumption of alcohol  in a motor vehicle and violation of the open container ordinance.  </P> <P> Mackey did not attend Thursday's news conference. On Tuesday, he said he has  been living a double life, one as a family man and popular coach, the other as  a man addicted to alcohol and drugs.  </P> <P> Last week, he signed a new two-year contract with base salaries of $85,000 and  $90,000. The contract has been voided, according to Jan Muczyk, senior vice  president, although Muczyk said Mackey may be entitled to some payment.  </P> <P> "Kevin Mackey's contract did not have a morals clause in it, per se," Muczyk  said. "Behavior that disgraces the university is adequate grounds for voiding a  contract."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Irina Litvinova under the general heading: </F> "Russia Does Not Intend To Create Military Bases in Latvia.  Diplomats Believe Boris Yeltsin Was Given the Wrong Document To  Sign"]    [Text] Aleksandr Rannikh, Russian ambassador to Latvia,  was summoned to the Baltic state's Foreign Ministry, where he  was handed a protest concerning military bases on the territory  of CIS countries and Latvia mentioned in an edict of the Russian  president.    The Latvian Government, after an emergency discussion of the  Russian document, stated that the Russian president's directive  is "in sharp conflict with the draft agreements on the  withdrawal of the army from Latvian territory initialed by the  two countries' delegations in Moscow 15 March this year." The  Latvian Cabinet of Ministers suggested that the mention of a  Russian military base in Latvia, which was not agreed with Riga,  could be seen as indicating that Russia is reluctant to sign the  agreed documents. The Latvian Government stated that it "did  not agree, does not agree, and will never agree to the creation  of a Russian Federation military base or to the testing of new  Russian arms and equipment on the territory of the Latvian  Republic, and rejects the possibility of talks on these  questions."    As is known, the only military facility for which an  exception was made at the Russian-Latvian talks is the radar  tracking station in the settlement of Skrunde. Latvia made a  concession and granted permission for it to remain for several  years after the withdrawal of the army, until a similar facility  can be built in Russia. But in the agreement the Skrunde  station was not referred to as a military base.    The Latvian delegation repeatedly came out against that.    The Latvian national radicals are doing everything possible  to retard the signing of the treaty with Russia, including the  agreement on Skrunde. The mention of a Russian "military base"  in Latvia in the presidential document prompted a nervous and  aggrieved reaction in Latvia's top echelon. Riga demanded  explanations in connection with the Russian president's  directive.</p>

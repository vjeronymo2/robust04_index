			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A WHOLE NEW BREED OF CEO RUNS THE BIG BUSINESSES;  </P> <P> MANAGEMENT: LISTENING TO PEOPLE, KNOWING WHAT'S ON THEIR MINDS, AND MAKING THEM  FEEL RESPECTED AS INDIVIDUALS IS ESSENTIAL, A CEO ADVISES.  </P> <P> Autocrats, tyrants and eye-gougers are a vanishing breed on the American  corporate landscape, according to top executives at several major firms.  </P> <P> The notion that a successful corporate chief must be a modern day Genghis Khan,  as suggested by former Gannett CEO Al Neuharth in his book, "Confessions of an  S.O.B.," is simply not accurate, they say.  </P> <P> "It won't work here," says George B. Harvey, chairman, president and chief  executive officer of Pitney Bowes Inc. "The employees would throw you out."  </P> <P> Successful CEOs recognize that satisfying the needs of company employees can be  just as important as satisfying the demands of stockholders and customers,  Harvey says.  </P> <P> "You've got to listen to people, know what's on their minds and what they worry  about," he says. To a greater degree than ever before, corporate employees  "want to feel respected" as individuals.  </P> <P> The key to productivity at Stamford, Conn.-based Pitney Bowes, a company that  reported $2.6 billion in revenues last year, is synergy, not adversity.  </P> <P> "I don't like 'creative tension,' " says Harvey, referring to a management  style that pits employees against one another. "People ought to be free and  willing to express their views. . . . Any manager that doesn't solicit ideas  from everyone is making a big mistake."  </P> <P> James P. Schadt, president and chief executive officer of Cadbury Schweppes  Beverages in Stamford, appears to take that philosophy a step further. Because  his company competes with corporate monsters like Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Schadt  encourages his managers to think creatively and act quickly. That's the best  way for a company like Cadbury Schweppes to score hits on its larger opponents  in the marketplace, he believes.  </P> <P> "The only weapon we have is our people. . . . My job is to make people feel  secure so they'll be creative and open with their ideas," he says. "In our  company, no one ever gets punished for being open."  </P> <P> The price of this freedom, however, is a heavier load of personal  responsibility. "If I ever hear someone say, 'I could have told you that would  happen,' I will do what I have to do and that person won't be in the company,"  Schadt says.  </P> <P> Like Harvey, he frowns on internal politicking. But that doesn't rule out  competition between managers. In fact, a degree of intramural competition is  essential because the company owns several competing brands of soft drinks.  </P> <P> What prevents this sort of competition from turning ugly is a clear set of  corporate values spelled out in a little white manual entitled "The Character  of the Company."  </P> <P> In addition to fostering a sense of fair play, the manual serves as a good  recruiting tool for Schadt. The company's size (it recorded $1.1 billion in  sales last year, contrasted with $8.3 billion for Coca-Cola) prevents Schadt  from offering prospective executives mega-salaries or huge departmental budgets  to play with. "They come here because they want to be here, in our culture.  It's not just another job," Schadt says.  </P> <P> Because today's employees are better educated and more demanding than their  predecessors, corporate leaders need a whole new set of skills to motivate  them.  </P> <P> "The key things are communication and concern," says David E. A. Carson, chief  executive officer of Bridgeport, Conn.-based People's Bank, a $6.3-billion,  multiservice financial institution. "No organization that intends to be around  for a while forgets its people."  </P> <P> In an age of rapid-fire mergers and overnight acquisitions, a CEO's reputation  for honesty and sensitivity can prevent valuable employees from jumping ship  when most needed. "The worst announcement you can make to employees is that  nothing is going to change," says Carson, noting that People's Bank has been  through six mergers in the last decade.  </P> <P> Candor is paramount when competing in a rapidly changing marketplace, many  believe. In a recent article in the Harvard Business Review, John F. Welch Jr.,  chairman and chief executive officer of General Electric, stresses the  importance of facing reality, rather than denying or hiding it.  </P> <P> "We've had managers at GE who wouldn't change . . . ," he says. "They wanted to  sit back, to keep things the way they were. And that's just what they did --  until they and most of their staffs had to go. That's the lousy part of this  job."  </P> <P> Welch, whose company reported revenues of $50 billion last year, says that many  managers are still afraid to let go of the bureaucracy that cushioned them in  the past. "Real leaders don't need clutter. You can't believe how hard it is  for people to be simple."  </P> <P> Gone forever are the days when a corporate boss could fly by the seat of his  pants, relying on personal experience and gut instinct to safely guide his  decisions.  </P> <P> Today's CEO is "a professional manager, not a hip-shooter," says William J.  Alley, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of American Brands in  Old Greenwich, Conn. A former U.S. Air Force captain, Alley now pilots a  company that had revenues of $12 billion last year.  </P> <P> Alley believes that consistency is the prime ingredient in the recipe for  modern CEOs. "If they're going to be a tyrant or a nice guy, they've got to be  consistent one way or the other," Alley says, offering two successful generals,  George C. Marshall and George S. Patton, as examples. "Marshall was a nice guy  all the time; Patton was a tyrant all the time."  </P> <P> The ability to play the role of a leader is also indispensable. "You can't ask  someone to do something you would not do yourself. It's very difficult to set a  standard you don't maintain yourself. . . . If I want people to be on time, I'd  better be on time."  </P> <P> Setting appropriate standards of behavior and performance are part of the  challenge of modern management, most executives agree.  </P></p>

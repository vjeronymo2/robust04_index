			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORTRAYAL OF FUR TRAPPING  </P> <P> A recent episode of "L.A. Law" featured Jimmy Smits' character representing a  furrier who was suing an animal-activist group over the activists' militant  vandalism against his business. The show was slanted. To give only two of many  examples:  </P> <P> A man whose livelihood depends on trapping held up an outdated trap, one that  has been phased out in 99% of the country.  </P> <P> The trapper claimed his traps were checked weekly. Local, state and federal law  require checking traps daily, or a trapper could lose his license.  </P> <P> How could a respected program such as "L.A. Law" present such a slant against  an industry so rooted in our American heritage? When will urban Hollywood learn  that we must utilize all of our natural resources instead of polluting our  planet with synthetics? And that "humane" is a way to treat our fellow man.  </P> <P> God-given animals are on our planet to be dealt with in respect and to utilize  within nature.  </P> <P> MARK MILLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

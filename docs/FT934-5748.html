			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Business leaders say chance of settlement must not be missed Leading businessmen in Northern Ireland believe the province has a unique opportunity for lasting peace that should not be missed. They believe Sinn Fein, the political wing of the provisional IRA, will have to be drawn into talks once it has renounced violence to make a political settlement possible. Interviews over the past week with executives at the top 50 companies in Northern Ireland found most broadly support London and Dublin's efforts to reach a settlement. They warned that failure would risk an upsurge of violence with damaging consequences for the economy. A number of the province's leading businessmen believe that an eventual unification of Ireland could be acceptable if there are economic and business dividends from a peace settlement. Business leaders in Northern Ireland have traditionally been reluctant to be drawn into the political debate for fear of becoming targets of terrorist attacks. Their decision to break their silence underlines the importance attached to peace efforts at a time when businesses are threatened by terrorism on the one hand and recession on the other. Sir George Quigley, chairman of Ulster Bank, said: 'The two governments should work closely together and all concerned grasp the sense of urgency . . . there is a need to act now and not just drift for another 12 months which would lead to a repetition of the violence of the last 25 years. This is a turning-point.' Mr Edward Wilson, managing director of Ulster Carpets, said there was a great desire for peace. 'I would be quite happy as an industrialist to work in a united Ireland or within the UK . . . given the right political institutions and the right economic support from the EC, there is no reason why Ireland should not operate as a single political and economic entity.' Mr Trevor Campbell, managing director of Moy Park, a leading food processor, commented: 'No one is in any doubt that a cessation of violence would help the economic climate generally. I don't want a temporary ceasefire but a permanent one. If the government can get a devolved administration in Northern Ireland, this will help business.' Mr Georges Senninger, managing director of Montupet, a French motor components company based in Belfast, said: 'Every time we try and sell something the 'troubles' factor comes into play. The IRA is part of the landscape here, you have to take them into account. I don't think it is possible to have a political settlement without them.' Mr Alex Bell, director of Castlecourt Investments, which runs Belfast's main shopping centre, said: 'The government is totally on the right track by trying to bring about a settlement, although we cannot have peace at any price. It is inevitable that Sinn Fein will be included in the political process . . . but there is an essential criterion prior to that happening. This would involve the complete cessation of violence.' Mr Sean O'Dwyer, chief executive of Desmond and Sons, a Londonderry clothing manufacturer employing 2,700 people and the second biggest manufacturer in the province, agreed that Sinn Fein would have to be at the negotiating table 'but only after a cessation of violence'. Mr Ian Young, managing director of a Derry electrical contractor, said: 'I believe a united Ireland will eventually come about. Unionists should be negotiating from a position of strength now, to get the best possible terms and guarantees. Politicians are going to have to grasp the nettle and all will get stung.'</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Devon wind farm plans rejected Plans for a wind farm in Devon have been rejected in spite of advice from a government agency that the proposed site was one of the best in the county. North Devon District Council turned down the scheme by West Coast Wind Farms for 23 wind turbines on a 300-acre site near Barnstaple, even though the site had no special landscape designation and the scheme was backed by Devon County Council and the government-backed Energy Technology Support Unit. An appeal against refusal was rejected by a planning inspector on the grounds of visual intrusion and noise pollution. Mr Michael Baker of West Coast Wind Farms, which wanted to develop the site, said: 'This decision means no further wind energy projects will be approved in Devon, one of Britain's windiest counties.' He added that his lawyers would consider seeking a judicial review of the decision, which he believed applied subjective judgment to an issue of national importance.</p>

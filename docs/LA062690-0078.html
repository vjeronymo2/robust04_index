			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> EARLY MARKET RALLY FIZZLES; DOW DROPS 12  </P> <P> Stock prices slipped Monday, adding to Friday's steep loss on selling that was  inspired by a sharp drop in the Treasury bond market.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials dropped 12.13 points to 2,845.05,  extending last week's 78.71-point decline.  </P> <P> In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by more than  two to one in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with  1,049 down, 496 up and 460 unchanged.  </P> <P> Leading the decline was Caterpillar Inc.'s report of sharply lower earnings  projections for the second quarter. That raised fears that broader corporate  earnings prospects overall might be weaker than anticipated. Caterpillar  plunged 5 to 58 1/2.  </P> <P> Some analysts said the drop in Caterpillar may have been an overreaction since  the agricultural equipment company said more than half its second-quarter  earnings drop was due to problems in Brazil. Still, Tenneco, a competitor, fell  1 1/2 to 65 5/8.  </P> <P> Analysts said stocks rose early, with buyers attracted by Friday's steep drop  of 44.55 points in the Dow. However, the rally stalled against the background  of a weak bond market, and stock traders lost their taste for bargains.  </P> <P> The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down nearly a full point. Concern that  the Federal Reserve may not ease credit soon kept the bond market under  pressure.  </P> <P> Traders said they detected a resumption of profit taking and some  computer-driven program selling in stocks.  </P> <P> One trader noted that buying was selective, particularly as the end of the  second quarter approached. "They want IBM, and Philip Morris," he said, ticking  off blue chips that were firmer.  </P> <P> Share prices started the day higher, but the gains evaporated by midday. Stocks  meandered in a narrow range for much of the afternoon, tailing lower on  late-afternoon program selling.  </P> <P> The early advance "was artificial, just as Friday's trading between 3 and 4  (o'clock) was artificial," said George Pirrone, senior trader at Dreyfus Corp.  "The bond market turned sour, and consequently, stocks turned sour."  </P> <P> Rao Chalasani, market strategist at Prescott Ball &amp; Turben, said he  believes that the recent string of big losses in stocks has a lot to do with  overbuilt expectations about corporate earnings and interest rates. "The market  was expecting too much, and now it's paying a price."  </P> <P> J. C. Penney said its sales for June were off last year's pace, and an  investment bank downgraded the company's earnings estimates for 1991 and 1992,  indicating weakness in the retail economy.  </P> <P> J. C. Penney was off 2 7/8 to 59 7/8, Woolworth fell 7/8 to 32 7/8 and K mart  was off 3/8 to 35.  </P> <P> Foxboro jumped 12 7/8 to 51. The British company Siebe PLC agreed to acquire  the company for $52 a share.  </P> <P> Big Board volume retreated to 133.1 million shares from 172.57 million on  Friday.  </P> <P> In foreign trading, stocks in Tokyo posted their biggest one-day point fall in  more than two months. The 225-share Nikkei index was down 570.38 points to  close at 31,124.19.  </P> <P> Stock prices ended higher on the London Stock Exchange, boosted by a healthy  start on Wall Street. The Financial Times 100-share index closed up 20.0 points  at 2,398.5.  </P> <P> Foreign buying interest and optimism that West German interest rates will not  jump after German monetary union on July 1 lifted the 30-share DAX index 23.29  points to 1,896.21.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT: Bond Prices Fall on Fears of Glut  </P> <P> In the credit markets, bond prices tumbled and interest rates rose as dealers  cited worries about a sizable slate of Treasury securities sales.  </P> <P> The Treasury's key 30-year bond dropped 7/8 point, or $8.75 per $1,000 in face  amount. Its yield climbed to 8.55% from 8.47% late Friday.  </P> <P> Trading was described as moderate.  </P> <P> "The decline . . . was mostly because of upcoming supply," said Elliott Platt,  director of fixed-income research at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities  Corp. "People are setting up for the auctions."  </P> <P> Those auctions got under way Monday with the Treasury's sale of $17.2 billion  of new three-month and six-month bills at the highest rates in a month.  </P> <P> The sales continue this week as the Treasury is selling $11.25 billion of  two-year notes today, $8.25 billion of four-year notes Wednesday and $10.52  billion of one-year bills Thursday.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8.313%, up from 8.188% late Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY: Dollar Ends Mixed as Interest Shifts  </P> <P> The dollar turned in a mixed performance as dealers directed their attention to  trading other major currencies.  </P> <P> Much of the movement in the dollar came as a byproduct of trades involving the  West German mark against the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. Renewed buying of  Canadian dollars after a recent slide was another feature of foreign exchange  trading.  </P> <P> The absence of significant economic reports being released this week and the  onset of month-end investment maneuvers were expected to mute activity in the  currency markets, dealers said.  </P> <P> The start of the European holiday season also was expected to restrain currency  trading.  </P> <P> Continuing uncertainty over the economic consequences of German unification put  pressure on the mark. Concerns have resurfaced as the day of German monetary  union approaches on July 2.  </P> <P> The Canadian dollar rebounded modestly from a selloff sparked by the failure of  the Meech Lake accord, a plan designed to preserve the country's unity by  recognizing French-speaking Quebec as a "distinct society."  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES: Corn, Soybeans Rise on Weather Report  </P> <P> Forecasts for a Midwestern heat wave helped push corn and soybean futures  prices up sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade amid fears that an extended dry  spell could harm tender young sprouts.  </P> <P> Wheat futures closed narrowly mixed, reflecting perceptions that hot, dry  weather would benefit the maturing winter wheat crop.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, precious metals advanced; copper fell; energy  futures were mixed; livestock futures were mixed, and pork bellies declined the  daily limit for the third straight day.  </P> <P> On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures settled 3 cents lower to 0.50 cent  higher, with the contract for delivery in July at $3.335 a bushel; corn was  2.50 cents to 8 cents higher, with July at $2.87 a bushel; oats were 3.75 to  4.50 cents higher, with July at $1.3825 a bushel; soybeans were 12 to 19 cents  higher, with July at $6.12 3/4 a bushel.  </P> <P> A high pressure system featuring temperatures in the 90s is expected to edge  into the western Corn Belt from the Southwest by Wednesday.  </P> <P> If the expected heat lasts beyond five days, young plants could be damaged, and  traders will "start pushing the panic button," Karlin said.  </P> <P> "It's not uncommon for these high-pressure systems to become entrenched in an  area for a fairly long while, eight to 10 days," he said.  </P> <P> "At that point, you would have dried out the topsoil to an undesirable degree."  </P></p>

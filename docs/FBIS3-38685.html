			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "nf": "Unemployment Will Remain High Over </F> the Next Few Years"]    [Text] Nuremberg, 4 February -- Federal Employment Office  Bernhard Jagoda (Christian Democratic Union) has no hopes for a  lasting decline in unemployment in Germany. At the end of this  decade, when the labor market in the old and new laender will  have grown together, Jagoda still expects about 3.4 million  unemployed. This winter the 4 million threshold will probably be  "touched or even crossed"; an initial recovery can only be  expected in spring. Unemployment will be a decisive topic in the  forthcoming election campaign. The Christian Democrat stresses  that he wants neither to downplay nor to dramatize the  situation. One can rely on his loyalty even in the event of a  change in government, stresses Jagoda, whose term of office  lasts until 2001.    He thinks the frequent comparisons with the economic  situation in the 1920's are dangerous: "Bonn is not Weimar."  One must view the unemployment figures in relation to the  potential of the working people, which was far smaller at that  time -- then the "marked difference" becomes clear. In  addition, it is "inappropriate" to add the 2.1 million people  who were spared the loss of the jobs through labor market policy  measures last year to the unemployed. This great easing of the  burden on the labor market is, rather, an indication of the  Federal Employment Office's successful work.    In addition, Jagoda stresses that his office filled almost 3  million jobs in the difficult year of 1993. However, one does  not want to rest on these laurels. This month special  "mediation teams" will be established and largely released from  any other tasks. Vacant jobs can then be filled even more  quickly than in the past, hopes Jagoda.    This year the Federal Employment Office must, however, make  do with even scarcer financial means. "It is difficult to cut  away something when the dress is already tight," says Jagoda,  referring to the 3.9 billion German marks [DM] in cutbacks of  the 1994 draft budget. With a view to the Federal Government's  constrained financial situation, which paid about DM24.5 billion  to the Federal Employment Office last year, Jagoda also shows  understanding for the savings measures: "The Federal Employment  Office, too, is affected by the constraints of the moment," he  defends himself against occasional criticism that his office  does not utilize all promised means. From industry Jagoda  demanded "the iron will to stay competitive on the world  market." This can be achieved only through "new products and  top quality." The current restructuring of companies is the  correct path toward more competitiveness and employment. It is  also necessary, however, to orient oneself more vigorously  toward the rising national economies and improve the  coordination of European research.    Jagoda also hopes that flexible work time models and more  intensive use of part-time work will provide strong stimuli to  employment. By doubling the German ratio of part-time work to  the Dutch value of about 34 percent, the FRG could have about 2  million less unemployed, estimates Jagoda. Decoupling  individual work time from machine time, too, is necessary to  clearly raise productivity. "We must become much more creative,"  he admonished. Jagoda sees other possibilities to raise  employment in environmental protection and by using people who  are obliged to have social insurance in private households as  well as in nursing care; in outpatient care alone about 150,000  employees are needed.    Jagoda also wants to raise efficiency in his own office.  Simplifying official procedures and improving the use of  information technology play as important a role as  decentralization. At the moment, a study is being conducted on  which jobs -- beyond the already existing budgets for advance  training, retraining, and job creation measures -- could be  taken over by the local labor exchange offices on their own  responsibility.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Yegorov: "Financial Squeeze for </F> Industrialists, Scientists, and VUZ Teachers Training Cadres for  the Defense Sector"]    [Text] As is known, the 1994  draft budget calls for significant cuts in defense expenditures  in comparison with last year: For maintenance of the Army by  practically half, for research and development by a factor of  2.3, for arms purchases by a factor of 5.5. Conversion programs  approved by the government for 1993-1994 are being rolled back  since credit resources have been provided only for the first  quarter of this year. Besides this, we are not meeting the  requirements of the Order of the President of Russia of 6  November 1993 "On Stabilization of the Economic Situation of  Enterprises and Organizations of the Defense Industry and  Measures to Support State Defense Orders" having to do with  development of weapons programs for the period up to the year  2000, establishment of conditions "for stable functioning of  defense enterprises in the market economy," financing of  conversion and wages in the amount of eight minimal monthly  payments.    The adoption of the state budget for 1994 in the form  which is proposed by the government thus means complete stoppage  of the majority of 3,000 scientific-research institutes [NII],  design bureaus [KB] and plants, and discharge of a minimum of 6  million persons directly employed in [filling] military orders  from the sphere of material production.    Counting the enterprises which form whole cities and where  no  other work exists, the number of those suffering from the cuts  may exceed 15 million persons. Areas of concentration of the  defense industry in Moscow and the Moscow oblast (1.5 million  persons), Udmurtiya, the Urals, central Russia, the Northwest,  Novosibirsk, and Omsk will suffer especially greatly. But it is  not only a matter of social consequences. The country is being  stripped of its basic industrial and scientific potential. It is  a matter of national security, the future of Russia and its  people. This is how the directors of defense enterprises, trade  union leaders, and scientists assess the present situation.    It is not hard to predict the negative consequences of  stoppage of the defense complex. The cost of civilian goods will  skyrocket. Export of arms will halt completely, since the  "finishing" enterprises will not be able to close the  technological circuits of cooperation. Already experiencing a  shortage of up-to-date systems and equipment, the Army will be  disarmed without international treaties and agreements. The old  weapons grow decrepit, and new ones are not being developed or  purchased.    What are we to do in this situation? In the opinion of the  industrialists, prominent scientists, and VUZ teachers preparing  cadres for the enterprises of the military industrial complex,  we absolutely must raise appropriations. By a factor of two at a  minimum. But on the other hand, this is a hard thing to do under  present conditions, for the weight of military expenditures in  the general budget is already excessive. What, then, is the way  out?    Aleksey Shulunov, president of the League for  Assistance to Defense Enterprises, believes it lies in  immediate resolution of a group of problems. In particular, he  believes, we must approve the expenditure portion of the state  budget for the first quarter of 1994 in the amount of  expenditures of the fourth quarter of 1993, no less. And by  indexing that, provide industry with the means of existence in  the coming months, while there is no annual budget. Then we must  improve the tax legislation of Russia. Today it does not  stimulate production or enhance the investment activity of  enterprises. For one ruble of commodity production, says A.  Shulunov, we pay taxes of up to 90 kopecks.    It is easy to see that the growth in state extortion,  dictated by the desire to compensate for the cut in income due  to the sharp drop in volume of production, in turn prompts the  producer to conceal income. Just according to official data,  last year the government failed to collect 7.5 trillion rubles  for this reason. This is more than all military expenditures put  together. The chairman of the Customs Committee states  officially that budget losses due to failure to pay taxes from  foreign economic activity amount to 10 billion dollars. And if  monies of the shadow economy, which also circulate outside the  sphere of tax control, are included in this sum (according to  some data they amount to three times the annual budget), it is  easy to see that the income portion of the budget for 1993 has  been reduced by a factor of three. If this had not occurred,  industry not only would avoid the "card file," but would also  have earned money for investment.    The industrialists and scientists unanimously demand an  immediate change in the existing order of military-technical  cooperation of Russia with foreign countries, and for  elimination of all obstacles in the path of independent export  of arms and military equipment by defense enterprises through  state licence. In the words of Shulunov, just the restoration of  old commercial ties, resuscitating the export of ZIP [spare  parts, tools, and instrument kits], and modernization and  servicing of equipment sold in the past will bring in up to 4  billion dollars annually to the complex.    Director of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute  [TsAGI] Academician German Zagaynov says that today we  still have in fact a system of weapons sales by the state. And  this is a symptom of a totalitarian regime. He also names  another possible way out from this situation -- to move from  talking about selective support and structural  perestroykaof industry and science to actually doing  something. Now instead of selective support, there is dilution  of resources at the level of the department apparatus. Says the  Academician, it is time for the state to decide whom it intends  to support through the budget, and to what extent. For with the  present orders of 3 to 5 planes a year for a plant with a  capacity of 200, everything will become pointless. The same  applies to the scientific research institutes and design  bureaus: often they duplicate one another. For this reason,  state orders must be concentrated after determining the  executors on the basis of expert assessment. As for those who  are left without orders, give them their freedom. Freedom to  privatize, selecting the optimal type of activity.    I need to make a qualification here. The directors of  enterprises and officials of trade unions, while unconditionally  supporting the idea itself of going public, at the same time  sharply protest voucher privatization of their enterprises. And  in general this is understandable. Through the sale of stock  they could obtain sizeable resources to resume production. But  for now the profit from privatization of state property (in  1993) amounts to 169 billion rubles. This sum scarcely sufficed  for conduct of check auctions and advertising. Aleksey Shulunov  states bluntly that we must halt checkbook privatization while  the complex still has things of value.    In the opinion of German Zagaynov, today we cannot "cage up"  even those enterprises which remain "purely state enterprises."  It is reasonable to change a number of them into technical pools  and holding companies, where the part which is national property  would remain state property and would be maintained out of the  budget; and the rest, which grew up for service support and  impart to the enterprise the nature of a subsistence economy,  would serve as the basis for the holding company. A system of  daughter enterprises would allow the transformation of high  defense technologies into technologies of civilian branches of  industry. The director of TsAGI believes that we can no longer  put off the formation of large industrial-finance corporations  and the merger of design bureaus and serial plants into a single  technological and commercial structure. Otherwise we will lose  not world markets, but our own, and will be deprived of the  design bureaus and plants.    But then, we have already lost practically a third of the  numerical strength of the defense complex. Clever and  knowledgeable specialists have left science and design bureaus,  so that the average age of the associates of scientific research  institutes and design bureaus has increased sharply. There is  practically no worthy replacement for the designers and  engineers owing to the complete absence of so-called cadre  accompaniment of the programs being developed in the state. The  opinion is growing that the authors are writing them for  themselves, eternal and ageless.    The Rector of Moscow State Technical University [MGTU]  imeni N.E. Bauman, Professor Igor Fedorov, who lately has  spoken often at various types of conferences, strives to call  attention to the disastrous plight of his university, and also  of other major technical VUZ of the country, the Moscow Aviation  Institute [MAI], and the Tula and Chelyabinsk Technical  Universities, but finds sympathy only from colleagues. In recent  months the state has flatly refused to finance the MGTU, with  the result that the university's indebtedness for utilities  today amounts to 1 billion 600 million rubles. The out-of-town  academic and experimental complex at Dmitrov, which for around  20 years has been developed through the efforts of enterprises  of the defense and space complex, has been frozen. And today  practically the main concern of the rector of this VUZ, which  graduated Korolev, Tupolev, Shukhov, Barmin, and Pilyugin, is to  clarify relations with Mosenergo [Moscow Electric  Company], which intends to disconnect the electrical power from  the university.    In other countries this is called a shame; in ours it is  called difficulties of the transitional period.    In his letter to the editors, the director of TsAGI  Academician G. Zagaynov analyzes the situation and the ways of  emerging from it: "Today it is hard for everyone, but for all  the variety of state tasks and interests, we must nonetheless  single out one and give it the status of most important --  assuring a worthy standard of living for Russians. Really, it is  the only task whose start will require that we begin to speak of  morality, of culture, and of national security. The relationship  is clear: There is a high living standard in those countries  where there is high technology in the basic branches of the  economy -- machine-building, transport, power engineering,  raw-materials and processing branches, agriculture,  communications, construction, and the service sphere.    Thus it has developed that in Russia, in these civilian  branches of the economy, the technological level is far from the  world level. High technologies have been preserved only in the  defense complex, and primarily in the aerospace complex. For  this reason, technical refitting of the basic branches of the  economy, with participation of the defense complex of the  Russian Academy of Sciences and the higher school, should be  considered the national task of first priority.    That is why the government must listen to the defense  industry leaders first of all. Especially since not so much is  required of it. It must use its influence to promote the union  of defense industry leaders and civilian branches, not oppose  the purchase of foreign technologies, and guarantee investments.  In other words, the industrialists, scientists, and trade unions  of the defense branches once again are offering themselves as  allies to the government. And this is not a return to the older  system of socialist planning. Basically, it is a market economy  with directed influence of the state. This is how national tasks  have been and continue to be accomplished throughout the world.</p>

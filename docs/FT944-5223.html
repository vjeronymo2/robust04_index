			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Business Travel: The in-between city - Smart Guide / Kuala Lumpur Kuala Lumpur (always referred to as KL by locals) is an in-between city. Visitors who come south from Bangkok are relieved to arrive in a less congested, greener city. But KL has a provincial feel about it and lacks the Thai capital's vibrancy and variety. On the other hand, those who travel northwards from Singapore are at first put off by KL's lack of efficiency and order. But, in spite of the traffic, they find a more relaxed, lively city than strictly controlled Singapore. What is the best area to stay in? KL is a comparatively small city, with a population of less than 3m, but it seems as though everyone drives a car, all the time. The main commercial district is referred to as the Golden Triangle. Most big companies, including banks and brokerage houses, have offices there. If you are visiting industrial areas in the satellite township of Shah Alam or elsewhere in the Klang Valley (the area surrounding KL), think about staying closer to the airport. Where should I stay? The Shangri-la, in the Golden Triangle, is generally considered to be KL's best business hotel. The cost for a standard room (regardless of single or double occupancy) is MDollars 410 (Dollars 160) a night, plus 10 per cent service and 5 per cent government tax. However, costs can be almost halved if you organise a corporate rate: all this involves is a call or letter to the reservations manager. Even if you don't have such an arrangement, it is worthwhile making inquiries on arrival. The same rules apply at the Regent Hotel. A standard room there is MDollars 450 plus service and tax. The Regent is a short walk from the central business district but closer to the shops. For something out of the ordinary, try the Carcosa. On a hill surrounded by parkland, the Carcosa complex was the HQ of the British during colonial times. It now functions as a state guest-house and hotel. The rate for a standard suite - non-negotiable - is MDollars 950. The Hyatt Saujana, near the airport, has standard rooms at MDollars 330 plus service and tax - and an attached golf course. Recommended restaurants? For Malay cuisine try either Sri Melayu or Yazmin, near the Golden Triangle. Both have low-key cultural shows each evening. Extremely reasonable and appetising Indian vegetarian food can be found at Ana Lakshmi, in the suburb of Bangsar, while there is a number of good Chinese restaurants: food at the Hakka restaurant on Jalan Bukit Bintang is among the best. It also has the advantage of having outdoor seating (offices, hotels and restaurants throughout south-east Asia seem to delight in running air-conditioning systems at near-arctic levels). Bon Ton near the Hakka restaurant is a pleasant and subdued western-style eating place. For something more old-fashioned, try either the Coliseum or Le Coq D'Or. Sizzling steak is a speciality at both, though the elderly waiters seem to enjoy abusing customers. How about entertainment? The nearest KL comes to distinctive entertainment after hours is at the Boom Boom Room, under the shadow of a church in one of the older sections of the city. There is good music and an interesting, slightly daring array of shows, many featuring transvestites dressed in their best. Don't go before 10pm. Another doubtful establishment is the Top End club in Wisma Stephens, in the business district - very badly lit, so be careful. Otherwise KL has the usual range of discos, pubs and yuppie bars, which look dreadfully similar all over the world. Cee Jay's and Uno's, both near the Shangri-la, have good music. What are the local business quirks? Don't expect to settle anything on the telephone or by fax. Malaysian business people, like most in the region, want to see potential business partners. Though the Chinese make up only about 35 per cent of the population, they control the bulk of Malaysia's economy. Finding out who is who is vital. Even the bigger corporations tend to be tightly controlled by one man. Getting around? Traffic problems mean that it is unwise to aim for more than three or four appointments a day. Taxis are reasonable and can be hired by the hour. However, hiring a hotel limousine is usually more comfortable. Suppose I have a spare day? It is relatively easy to get out of KL, but make sure you go at non-peak hours. Malacca, on the coast, is about 2 1/2 hours away by car (airport taxi drivers offer good rates for such journeys). It's a bustling town with old Dutch settler architecture and streets of recently restored Chinese shop-houses. Malacca's Nyonya cuisine - a blend of Malay, Chinese and Indian  -is worth trying. The Peranakan restaurant, serving nyonya food, is in an old Chinese house in Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lok. There is another branch on the coast just outside town. Fraser's Hill is an old highland resort about three hours' leisurely drive from KL, founded by a reclusive colonial metals trader at the turn of the century. At 1,530 metres, it offers cool nights and fresh air, and there is a pleasant nine-hole golf course. You can stay in bungalows where cooks serve up mushy peas and apple crumble. The jungle round Fraser's is slowly being ruined by some appalling construction work, so go soon.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian cabinet of ministers has decided on  resuming work at one of the enterprises in the town of Pripet,  which is located inside the 30 km exclusion zone around the  Chernobyl nuclear power station. This decision was made in  connection with the need to provide for the functioning of  Ukraine's nuclear power industry and meet its requirements for  spares and nonstandard equipment. Work at Pripet's industrial  enterprises was halted on 26 April 1986 -- the day of the  disaster at Chernobyl nuclear power station.</p>

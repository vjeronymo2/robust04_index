			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Cabinet poised to accept deal over EU voting rights: Tory backbenchers angry over 'climbdown' The government was last night preparing to accept the proposed compromise with its European partners over voting rights. The move should pave the way for four new members to enter the Union next January. But as Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, awaited cabinet endorsement of the arrangement this morning, Mr Major, the prime minister, was accused on the Conservative backbenches of reneging on pledges to strike a harder bargain. To limit the potential backlash among Tory MPs, Mr Hurd was awaiting urgent assurances from the European Commission that in future it will not seek to circumvent Britain's opt-out from the social provisions of the Maastricht treaty. The foreign secretary expects to receive this morning a written commitment from Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, that in future Brussels will not use health and safety legislation to frustrate the opt-out. The compromise - tabled at a weekend meeting of EU foreign ministers in Greece - raises to 27 from the present 23 the number of votes required to block decisions in the Council of Ministers once the Union is enlarged. But it allows for a legally enforceable pause in decision-making when countries muster between 23 and 27 votes. It also stresses that the new arrangement is an interim one, with the whole question of the relative voting strengths of small and large EU countries to be reopened in 1996. With the other 11 EU governments expected to endorse it, senior Brussels diplomats said the UK had little choice but to do likewise or risk triggering a crisis with its other EU partners over enlargement. Sir Leon Brittan, the senior British commissioner in Brussels, also urged acceptance. But the consensus at Westminster was that by encouraging his supporters to believe he would take a more determined stance, Mr Major had again damaged his political authority. Anticipating the anger also of rightwing ministers about an arrangement which falls short of Britain's original demands, Mr Hurd refused publicly to anticipate the cabinet's decision. But, speaking in the House of Commons, he made it clear that his own political authority rested on an accord which he insisted had safeguarded Britain's interests without delaying the entry into the EU of Finland, Sweden, Norway and Austria. Other pivotal figures in the cabinet, including Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr David Hunt, offered Mr Hurd their full backing. That left cabinet Eurosceptics such as Mr Peter Lilley, Mr Michael Portillo and Mr John Redwood the stark options of backing the compromise or resigning. Despite some speculation that Mr Lilley might consider such a course, the judgment of most ministers was that it was not an issue on which the cabinet's sceptics would make a public stand. Close friends of Mr Hurd also dismissed suggestions that the latest row has persuaded him to stand down as foreign secretary when Mr Major reshuffles the cabinet in the summer. The friends insisted that Mr Hurd wants to stay at the Foreign Office at least until mid-1995. The foreign secretary stressed repeatedly his view that the proposed accord had gone as far as he thought possible. Stressing the legal status of the proposed pause and its interim nature, Mr Hurd gave the impression that in practical terms the blocking minority would stay at 23 votes. But he admitted that once efforts to secure an agreement on that basis had been exhausted, the new position meant decisions could in fact be pushed through on the basis of a minority of 27. In Brussels, officials said the compromise expressly excluded an open-ended discussion on decisions which were opposed by countries mustering between 23 and 26 votes in the council. The draft text says: 'The council will do all in its power to reach, within a reasonable time and without prejudicing obligatory time limits laid down by the treaties and by secondary law . . . a satisfactory solution.'

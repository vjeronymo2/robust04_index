			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXTRAORDINARY LOOK AT NON-ORDINARY TOPIC  </P> <P> When I picked up the View section on Sept. 18 and glanced at your cover story,  "A Step Toward the Light," I thought I was in for another cynical portrayal of  the paranormal by a jaded reporter. I was mistaken. Beth Ann Krier's look at  pediatrician Melvin Morse's studies of children's near-death experiences was an  objective piece. Krier's article presented the non-ordinary in a manner that  was neither critical nor trivial.  </P> <P> If only the medical community could be as nonjudgmental as Krier. What I found  so acutely ironic was Morse's admission that although 23 out of 25 of the  children he studied who had had near-death experiences reported to have  encountered a "presence of light," Morse knew that his scientifically conducted  study would be rejected for publication in a professional journal, should he  include this significant finding. Morse had used the scientific model to  conduct his studies, he had made a statistically significant finding using that  model, and yet he knew that the scientific paradigm would not accept such a  finding.  </P> <P> What was equally ironic was Morse's concluding remark that, "As doctors, we  don't know what to do with this kind of information . . . I'll include myself  in this. Even now, people say to me, 'Well, doesn't this make you believe in  life after death?' I guess it just goes against my training so much that I have  to say, 'Well, I really don't know.' We're not comfortable with death."  </P> <P> Here is a man who has the weight of his own empirical data on his side, yet  feels compelled to reject the conclusions that data strongly suggest because  the edifice of a purely material world devoid of anything outside the  scientific purview would crumble should he make such an admission. As many  philosophers of science have predicted, the scientific paradigm will itself  fall under its own rigidity.  </P> <P> HEIDI ZIOLKOWSKI  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

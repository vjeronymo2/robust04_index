			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARTH DAY FOCUSES ATTENTION ON DETERIORATION OF ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> Society's current environmental consciousness is proof again that the American  liberal political agenda is decades ahead of its time.  </P> <P> Liberals were promoting environmentalism 30 years ago, when the status quo  labeled them as "loonies." In fact, liberals throughout history have  consistently promoted causes and issues that eventually became part of the  American mainstream. Racial and sexual equality, opposition to the Vietnam War  and warnings over the dangers of nuclear power are only some of the issues  initially championed by liberals.  </P> <P> So take heart, liberals, your cause today will become the norm of political  thought tomorrow.  </P> <P> RON KOBAYASHI  </P> <P> Tustin  </P></p>

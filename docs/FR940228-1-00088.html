			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the case of nonprofit institutions, the Secretary has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed standards in accordance with Statement of Financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accounting Standards No. 117 (FAS 117) that was issued in June  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). FAS 117  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> altered the reporting format for not-for-profit organizations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the negotiated rulemaking process was already well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underway. FAS 117 is effective for annual financial statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994, except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for organizations with less than $5 million in total assets and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than $1 million in annual expenses. For those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations, the Statement is effective for fiscal years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning after December 15, 1995 with earlier application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encouraged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to require a nonprofit institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare a classified statement of financial position in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide the Secretary with the financial information necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the institution's financial responsibility under these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations. The Secretary proposes that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatively, a nonprofit institution could provide this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information as footnotes to the audit. Although FAS 117 does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require a nonprofit institution to submit a classified statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of financial position prior to published implementation dates, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not prohibit the institution from doing so. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notes that a financial statement that is not classified is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structured to provide the financial information necessary for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary to determine an institution's compliance with these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations; however, the information could be included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as footnotes to the audit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes that a nonprofit institution is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially responsible if it cannot demonstrate, at the end of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its latest fiscal year, a ratio of current assets to current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities of at least 1:1. The Secretary proposes to not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit a nonprofit institution to include the cash reserves in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution's current assets. The Secretary believes that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the proposed current assets to current liabilities ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a nonprofit institution is 1:1, if the institution used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated reserve funds to meet this ratio, there would be no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance of solvency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The importance of a higher current ratio for for-profit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions lies in the fact that they are not as likely to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to draw on fund raising as a source of cash in the event of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hampered liquidity because donors are less likely to contribute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds to a for-profit institution where those contributions would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be tax deductible. Many nonprofit institutions have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient support in the community and from friends and alumni  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who are willing to donate to the institution. The cash intake of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for-profit institutions is therefore limited to cash generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through profitability, whereas nonprofit institutions have an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional source of cash. Endowments, even when restricted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions such as providing scholarships, are awarded and may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken into cash from operations. Consistent profitable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations result in a better liquidity position for for-profit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions, whereas consistent profitable operations are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for a nonprofit to remain viable. In addition, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inherent in a nonprofit institution that its final cash position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not reflect a profit. In the nonprofit industry, the financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager has limited authority. The financial manager may make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations, but the ultimate authority lies with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governing board. There is, therefore, less control in the hands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of financial managers and a corresponding decrease in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to control a liquidity situation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lack of liquidity means that the institution is unable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service its current debt. This can lead to the forced sale of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term investments and assets. To the owners of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution, a lack of liquidity will mean reduced profitability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or it may mean loss of control or loss of the entire capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment. To creditors of the enterprise, it means slow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection of principal and interest due or even loss of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts due them. Students of these institutions can also be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by a short-term poor financial condition. These effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may take the form of inability of the institution to perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their contract, inability to make refunds due to students or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lenders, or the loss of supplier relationships. Suppliers are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested in an institution's liquidity position, and if it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found to be inadequate, it may cease to do business with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

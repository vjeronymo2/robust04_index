			<p>BFN     [Text] Ibrahim Ghawshah, spokesman for the Islamic  Resistance Movement, Hamas, reiterated in Damascus today his  objection to the agreements signed recently between Israel and  the Palestinians and between Israel and Jordan. He said: We  reject the defeatist policy that began in Madrid, Oslo, and  Cairo and ended now in Amman, because these policies aim at  relinquishing the rights and lands of the Palestinian people.    Ghawshah made this statement before the meeting of the 10  Palestinian factions that oppose the self-rule agreement.  Palestinian sources said the conferees will discuss in this  meeting the situation in the self-rule territories and in all  territories still under occupation.</p>

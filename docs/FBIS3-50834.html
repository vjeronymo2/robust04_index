Robaina told Gili that:    [Begin Robaina recording] I am going as a guest of several  foreign ministries, in this case the foreign ministries of five  countries located on a continent with which we have,  historically, maintained special relations. You are aware of the  offensive the country, and the Foreign Ministry in particular,  has launched in areas like the Caribbean, Latin America, and  other areas of the world. In this particular case, we will be  touring Ghana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Angola, and Namibia. In Angola,  as in the other countries, we have always been in contact with  our counterparts. The health, commerce, economy, and tourism  ministers have also been in close contact with their  counterparts in those countries. We are pleased to announce that  on this trip we will be meeting with the presidents of the five  countries.    I believe that Europe and other countries of the world are  being manipulated by a one-sided version of the news regarding  our country which is handled by a manipulated press. This  country is not the hell many reporters paint it to be nor is it  the paradise others paint it to be. We must exploit the means to  tell those countries what our country is all about.  Unfortunately, when we tell the big newspapers what the  situation is, they do not always print what we tell them. The  offensive involves, above all, explaining our truth to Europe.  Our truth has good, average, and bad things to it, but we must  have a chance to explain it. For example, I believe that the  recently concluded meeting with the European Parliament opened a  space for this communication. We agree on some issues and  disagree on others; but the idea is not whether we agree or  disagree; the idea is to keep communication channels open. I  believe that communication with Europe is indispensable to this  offensive.    In the economic area I believe there are already some  European countries that have an important presence in our  country. Many have an opinion about Cuba, many express opinions  about Cuba, but not many have direct contact with Cuba or  express their views on Cuba. I am not asking that they share our  views or that they share the views of others; all I ask is that  they analyze our situation and that we be heard before a  decision is made about us. We do not like it when others talk  about us and we are not allowed to tell our side. That is what I  am talking about. Our side must be heard. Unfortunately, those  who oppose us have much more space than our Revolution has. [end  recording]</p>

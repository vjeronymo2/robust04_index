			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Good inflation data, bonds support stocks Wall Street GOOD inflation news and a rally in bond prices helped stock markets to end a difficult week on a firmly positive note yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 32.14 at 3,621.63. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 4.22 higher at 461.72, while the Amex composite finished up 2.68 at 456.06, and the Nasdaq composite up 6.59 at 744.30. Trading volume on the NYSE was 266m shares. After three difficult trading days, when share prices either fell sharply or struggled to hold their ground, the announcement of a big fall in producer price inflation was welcome news for equity investors. The government said that the August producer prices index fell 0.6 per cent, and that 'core' producer prices (excluding the volatile food and energy components), fell by 1.0 per cent - the largest decline ever recorded. Although a good part of the decline was attributed to sharp falls in tobacco prices, the inflation data was still regarded as extremely positive for both stocks and bonds. The impression of low inflation was reinforced by a drop in commodity prices yesterday - the Commodity Research Board's index of prices ended down almost two points at 213.17. Lower inflation and commodity prices provided a big lift to bonds, with the benchmark 30-year government issue climbing more than a point and the yield dropping to 5.87 per cent. Among individual stocks, Paramount Communications climbed Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 61 1/8 in heavy trading on reports that the entertainment group has been discussing a merger with Viacom, owner of MTV and other television and cinema interests. According to the reports, the two companies would swap stock in a deal that would value Paramount shares at Dollars 60 each. Separately, Paramount unveiled a modest improvement in second quarter earnings to Dollars 120.4m. Viacom, traded on the American Stock Exchange, firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 65 3/4 . Blockbuster rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 28 1/2 after the company told analysts at a retail investment conference in New York that it was comfortable with estimates of between 29 cents and 31 cents a share for the third quarter. Bank stocks were once again in demand as analysts forecast good third quarter results. JP Morgan rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 79, Chase Manhattan rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 36 5/8 , Citicorp added Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 35 3/4 , and Banc One climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 42 1/4. On the Nasdaq market, leading technology stocks were flat-to-firmer. Microsoft rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 78 and Intel Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 65 1/2.</p>

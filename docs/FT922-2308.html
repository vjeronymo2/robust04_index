			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Macy falls deeper in the red RH MACY, the large US department store chain which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year, yesterday turned in a net loss of Dollars 225.9m for the third quarter to May 2. The figures were distorted by a Dollars 75m charge for interest expense and Dollars 91m in reorganisation expenses, including Dollars 85m to cover the costs of closing some stores. In the corresponding period of fiscal 1991, Macy had a net loss of Dollars 100.9m, including one-time gains of Dollars 15m. Sales in the latest quarter slid 5.8 per cent to Dollars 1.31bn from Dollars 1.39bn. On a same-store, comparable week basis, Macy said sales in the 1992 quarter had fallen 6.4 per cent. Macy said the results also reflected the depressed economic conditions in its key markets in the north-eastern US and California, as well as the disruption in merchandise deliveries during the period of the bankruptcy filing. Mr Mark Handler and Mr Myron Ullman, co-chairmen and co-chief executives who replaced Mr Edward Finkelstein in April, said: 'We are continuing to take steps to return Macy to profitability and guide it out of Chapter 11.' Macy has closed five I Magnin stores, 52 specialty stores and has plans to close another eight under-performing department stores. The company said that it had Dollars 103m in cash and cash equivalents on June 12. It added that it had not used its Dollars 600m debtor-in-possession credit facility to meet working capital needs, although some of the facility was committed for overseas letters of credit. In the third quarter, Macy's pre-tax losses from operations, before interest expense and reorganisation costs, grew to Dollars 59.7m from Dollars 15m in the year-earlier period. For the first nine months, the company's pre-tax loss from operations, before interest expense and reorganisation costs, was Dollars 586.8m against pretax profits of Dollars 248.8m in the corresponding period last year.</p>

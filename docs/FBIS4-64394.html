			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report]  <H5>  U.S. Prestige at Stake </H5>   An editorial in the 24-25 April Paris daily LE MONDE  comments  on President Clinton's decision to address a NATO ultimatum to  the Bosnian Serb forces besieging Gorazde. According to the  editorial, the United States had to act to stop losing prestige  after its repeated threats and warnings to Bosnian Serbs were  not followed by action. This time, President Clinton seems  determined to defend the people in the so-called security zones.  While some U.S. officials believe that there are no vital  American interests in Bosnia that would justify the use of  force, others judge that the credibility of the United States is  at stake, the editorial continues. Doubtless, most Americans  agree with the first group, the editorial contends, because they  fail to perceive the U.S. interest in Bosnia. However, the U.S.  public does not like its presidents to be defied, be it  President Carter in the Iran hostage issue or President Clinton  by the Gorazde Serbs, the editorial concludes.  <H5>  Loss of French Influence Seen </H5>   According to Philippe Marcovici's editorial in the 13 April  Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, when Minister of Foreign  Affairs Alain Juppe asked on 12 April that Europe assume the  presidency of an international peace conference on Bosnia on an  equal footing with the United States and Russia, he was in fact  admitting that the European Union (EU)--and consequently  France--no longer plays the principal role in settling the  conflict. This is despite the fact that most initiatives on  Bosnia to date have come from France, which is not seeking to  "use force as an end in itself" but only as the means to a  settlement, Marcovici writes. While it is still too early to  know whether France's policy will be successful, its  disadvantages are already clear, Marcovici continues. Even with  its European partners, France lacks the means to implement it  and Paris had to resort to NATO--in other words, to the United  States. Since Washington's first concern is to "handle Russia  delicately," this country has been able to become an actor on  the Bosnian scene. This return to the "classic East-West  dialogue naturally occurred to the detriment of Europe, and of  France in particular, which for the past three years has borne  the heaviest burden in the former Yugoslavia," Marcovici writes,  noting that a "cruel paradox" has emerged. With no ground  forces in Bosnia, the United States has taken the political  lead, while France, whose soldiers are dying there, is losing  the initiative.  <H5>  French Policy Criticized </H5>   In the 14-20 April Paris weekly LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR,  Jacques Julliard's "Chronicle" criticizes the "strange  perseverance" of French diplomacy, which almost never departs  from one characteristic scenario. In a first phase, he writes,  France behaves like a mighty power and multiplies diplomatic  initiatives without prior consultation with its partners. It  then realizes that it lacks the means to implement these  initiatives, at which time the United States imposes its own  solution "to the anger of our diplomats, who reluctantly fall  into line," Julliard remarks. In the end, France--"which  accumulates ambiguities and succeeds in quarreling with  everyone"--must accept the final settlement while "cursing the  ingratitude of the peoples concerned and the arrogance of the  Americans." This is now occurring in Bosnia, notably in  Sarajevo, where France, which gave so much of itself, has had to  give in to Washington's initiatives, Julliard concludes.</p>

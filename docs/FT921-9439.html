			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Increased liquidity helps Stanbic advance 23% A WIDENING interest margin helped Standard Bank Investment Corp (Stanbic), South Africa's second largest banking group, increase attributable earnings by 23.6 per cent to R510.7m (Dollars 183.7m) in the year to December. The results were heavily influenced by difficult economic conditions and tight monetary policy maintained by the Reserve Bank. To the bank's advantage, weak demand for credit increased liquidity, and hence lowered the bank's cost of funds and raised its interest margin. However, the bank had to increase its specific provision for bad debts by 86 per cent to R329.4m. Net interest income rose by 31 per cent to R2.03bn, while other operating income was 21 per cent higher at R1.28bn. Operating expenses were 26 per cent higher at R2.52bn, and operating profit was up 29 per cent at R794.2m. Attributable earnings were up less because of lower income from associated companies. Although total assets grew by only 10.7 per cent to R50.4bn, Mr Eddie Theron, managing director, said loans and advances had actually increased by 16 per cent. He said this was a 'very satisfactory' performance, given the weak corporate demand and lack of big projects. Another notable figure was the increase in the return on assets, to 1.04 per cent from 0.93 per cent. Mr Theron said the ratio of bad debts to advances, of 0.75 per cent, was similar to that of the difficult years of 1985 and 1986. He noted, however, that while then many large companies got into serious difficulties, this time around the bulk of bad debts was being incurred by personal customers, small businesses and farmers. Earnings per share rose by 20.1 per cent to 507 cents, and the dividend was lifted by 20.3 per cent to 160 cents per share. Domestically, Mr Theron said the bank had maintained market share in all its main divisions. Internationally, it had applied for a banking licence in the UK, and was expanding into Africa in a 'measured' fashion. Although the group had not seen any signs of a pick-up in business, it was still budgeting for improved earnings in the current year, he said.</p>

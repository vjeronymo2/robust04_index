			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (6): US farmers win pledge on subsidies US farm subsidies and programmes will not be cut to make up for the shortfall in government revenue caused by the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, according to Mr Leon Panetta, outgoing director of the budget office. Mr Panetta made the pledge while speaking before a House agriculture committee. The administration has yet to account for approximately 25 per cent, or Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn), of the tariff revenue which the US will lose under the Uruguay Round. Mr Panetta's assurances to the House committee were intended to quell rumours, circulated by Gatt opponents earlier in the week, that the administration was planning to slash agricultural aid in order to cover the lost revenue. Some members of Congress had threatened to oppose Gatt implementation legislation if the administration cut farm programmes. Mr Michael Espy, US agriculture secretary, yesterday said Mr Panetta's announcement demonstrated the administration's deep commitment to domestic farmers. Despite reports that an announcement of the administration's solution to the Dollars 3bn loss was imminent, no statement has been released so far this week. Federal lawmakers, who have yet to pass legislation to implement the Uruguay Round, have raised a number of other concerns about ratifying the Gatt deal. These range from its perceived conflict with US laws and infringement on US sovereignty to fears about the loss of domestic jobs. Special interest groups opposing US implementation of the Uruguay Round and participation in the proposed World Trade Organisation - the successor to Gatt - have stepped up their attacks recently, staging a 'national call-in' to the Capitol Hill switchboards to voice their opposition.</p>

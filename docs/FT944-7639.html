			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UN troops blockaded in Sarajevo Bosnian Serb leaders threatened to declare all-out war on the United Nations, blockading about 150 peacekeepers around Sarajevo, in retaliation for Nato air strikes on Serb targets. Sarajevo radio said Serb forces were trying to take back their heavy weapons from three UN-supervised collection sites. Fearing retaliation from angry Serb forces, the UN yesterday morning began withdrawing the bulk of its troops supervising nine weapons depots, created last February as part of an exclusion zone round Sarajevo. One person was killed and three wounded when Serb forces opened fire on a tram driving through the centre of Sarajevo near the Holiday Inn where many foreign journalists stay, Bosnian radio reported. The move comes after a warning from Mr Jovan Zametica, adviser to the Bosnian Serb leadership, just before the assembly of the self-styled state met to consider the declaration of a state-of-war throughout Serb-held territory in Bosnia. 'If they (the air strikes) prove to be pure aggression of Nato at the request of the UN, then Republika Srpska will consider that the UN has sided with the enemy,' he told the Bosnian Serb news agency. 'This would mean war with the UN,' he warned.</p>

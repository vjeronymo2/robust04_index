			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Environmental Achievement 1993: Glass that keeps the heat in - Pilkington PILKINGTON, the giant UK glass manufacturer, claims also to be the country's largest maker of energy saving products. One of those products, K Glass, has won the Merseyside company an award for environmental achievement, writes Clive Cookson. K Glass is an energy saving glass which reduces heat loss through a single glazed window by 70 per cent. In a double glazing unit it gives better insulation than triple glazed ordinary glass. In addition, because K Glass is such an efficient insulator - equivalent to a brick wall nine inches thick - architects can specify larger areas of window, to make full use of daylight and save more energy. Domestic heating is the biggest polluter in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, which are the prime cause of the greenhouse effect and global warming. Buildings as a whole (commercial and residential) account for half of UK primary energy use, and 60 per cent of this is in houses. Pilkington calculates that if all the country's single glazed homes were double glazed with K Glass, Pounds 1bn worth of energy would be saved every year. This would reduce CO emissions by 11m tonnes - or 6 per cent of all CO emissions associated with buildings. K Glass can be made directly on a float glass production line. Previously, low-emissivity glasses had to be coated in a secondary process, which added greatly to their cost and reduced their performance. K Glass has a colourless scratch-resistant coating and is virtually indistinguishable from ordinary glass; no special handling is required. Ordinary window glass is an excellent radiator: in a warm room it absorbs heat and radiates it from the colder outside surface. The low-emissivity coating on K Glass converts the window into a poor radiator: instead the heat is reflected back into the room. But the coating does not reduce the amount of short-wave radiation coming into the room from the sun. This energy is absorbed by the walls and floors and re-radiated in long-wave form - which is reflected back by the K Glass. The technical achievement of K Glass is reflected by its success in the market. Sales have increased by 50 to 100 per cent a year since its launch in 1990 and are expected to be about Pounds 30m in 1993. One of four float glass lines at Pilkington's St Helens factory is now devoted full time to K Glass production. Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, was an early user of K Glass for its London offices. Many local authorities are specifying it. Pilkington has also licensed the low-emissivity technology to PPG and St Gobain, the largest glassmakers in the US and France respectively.</p>

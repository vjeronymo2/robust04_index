			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA) -- The 11th conference of the  Nonaligned Movement's [NAM] foreign ministers currently being  held in Cairo has issued a resolution on Rwanda, urging the UN  Security Council to quickly take all the necessary measures to  immediately end the massacres taking place in Rwanda and to  effectively provide all the necessary means for the deployment  of peace keeping forces there as soon as possible.    The resolution, passed at the conclusion of the foreign  ministers meetings today, also urges the international community  to respond to the peaceful and humanitarian efforts being made  in Rwanda by providing the material and financial resources and  extending all practical assistance to ensure the immediate  containment of pollution and the dangers to public health and  the environment resulting from the human massacres taking place  in Rwanda.    The resolution expresses the NAM's support for a roundtable  with the participation of all the parties to the conflict. It  calls for drawing up an action plan for the reconstruction and  rehabilitation of Rwanda.    The resolution appeals to the international community not to  delay in supporting the good initiative by Kenyan President  Daniel arap Moi, which calls for a minisummit of the countries  bordering Rwanda to be held in Nairobi early next week to  discuss this issue.</p>

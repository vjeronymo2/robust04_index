			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Honolulu, March 19 KYODO -- The following is a joint  statement of finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum, obtained by KYODO News Service.    For the first time, APEC finance ministers have met to  discuss some of the fundamental economic challenges facing the  Asia-Pacific region: sustaining growth with low inflation,  financing investment and infrastructure development, and  promoting capital market development. This meeting was convened  at the request of the APEC leaders at their Seattle meeting in  November 1993.    We recognize the growing significance of overall regional  economic performance to each member's economic well-being and to  the health of the global economy. Ours is a region increasingly  bound together by growing trade and investment ties. We agree  that the following principles should guide our policy formation  as we move toward the next century:    -- Sound macroeconomic policies and stability should remain  a  pillar of sustained, low-inflation growth in the region.    -- Increasing cross-border flows of goods, services and  investment should be another pillar for strong economic  performance in the region.    -- The private/business sector should continue to be the  primary engine of growth.    -- Further development and integration of capital markets  is needed for effective mobilization and allocation of  private/business capital.    -- Improving the capacity to finance infrastructure  development is necessary to address current shortages and  inefficiencies.  <H5>  The Financial Challenge </H5>   Mobilizing the capital needed to finance high levels of  private investment and infrastructure development presents a  formidable challenge for the region. Large and growing inflows  from external sources have been, and will continue to be,  crucial. Capital inflows augment domestic savings, help  diversify sources of financing, reduce the cost of capital, and  assist in capital market development.    -- We will pursue policies which promote ongoing large and  diversified inflows of foreign direct investment. Such flows  have already made a significant contribution to accelerating  growth.    -- We agree to work on increasing the contribution that  portfolio inflows can make to regional investment, building on  recent increases in cross-border equity and bond flows.    -- We shall consult on the kinds of strategies which can  sustain capital inflows in a manner which fosters both growth  and macroeconomic stability.    It will be critical to improve our capacity for mobilizing  domestic capital to meet financing needs.    -- We will consult on efforts to develop and deepen banking  sectors and domestic securities markets, including through  effective supervision and regulation.    -- We will work together to promote further development of  domestic bond markets as a key source of financing, particularly  for large, long-term infrastructure projects.    -- We welcome the ongoing efforts by the International  Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the International Finance  Corporation [IFC], and the Asian Development Bank [ADB] to  assist development of financial markets. We urge that these  programs be adapted and expanded as appropriate to meeting the  changing and diverse needs of Asia-Pacific economies.    -- We also encourage these institutions to examine and  disseminate successful strategies for promoting public and  private financing of small and medium enterprises.    -- We recognize the need for public resources to provide for  funding for sustainable development projects where private  funding is not available. We therefore look forward to the  imminent conclusion of negotiations for a general capital  increase of the Asian Development Bank, that will embody a  forward looking vision for the bank and make available more than  20 billion dollars for the region.  <H5>  Future Meetings and Consultations </H5>   We believe that our discussions today have promoted greater  understanding of key economic challenges facing the region. We  are therefore looking forward to meeting again next year to  consult on regional economic developments, economic growth  strategies, other macroeconomic objectives, regional capital  flows, and financial sector developments and policies. We ask  our deputies to undertake preparations for this meeting.    We also ask our deputies and their central bank counterparts  to meet jointly in late 1994 or early 1995 to discuss  macroeconomic developments and in particular issues relating to  the sustainability and management of the capital flows that are  important for growth. To support that joint meeting, an ad hoc  group of senior financial officials will meet to identify key  factors and developments which the deputies and their central  bank counterparts should address.    We believe that improvements in information flows,  availability, and exchanges can contribute importantly to  efforts to mobilize financing and develop capital markets. We  therefore call for the cooperation of key players in these  efforts in undertaking the work and consultations proposed below.    -- Study of regional portfolio flows: We ask the IMF,  working with existing databases in cooperation with the World  Bank, IFC and ADB, to prepare a study of cross-border portfolio  flows into and within the region, providing quantitative  measurements of the sources and destinations, as well as the  contribution of external flows to total capital mobilized in  securities markets. The study should be completed by the time  of the meeting of APEC finance ministers' deputies and their  central bank counterparts.    -- ADB symposium on financing infrastructure development: We  call upon the ADB to host a symposium on issues and problems in  infrastructure financing, with emphasis on the role of the  private sector. Such a symposium should bring together private  sector officials involved in finance, construction and other  aspects of infrastructure development, with government officials  and officials from the international financial institutions.    -- Regional consultations on banking sector and securities  market supervision and regulation: We welcome and encourage  growing contacts between regulatory authorities in member  economies to discuss supervisory and regulatory issues of common  interest.    -- Asia-Pacific financiers: We call on private financial  sector leaders in the region to convene a meeting to identify  issues regarding capital market development, to explore ways to  strengthen private sector contacts, and to explore the  possibility of establishing a more permanent private sector  structure.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Hanson drops bid for RHM Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, formally dropped its bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall yesterday. The bid, of 220p a share in cash, had been superseded by a higher offer from Tomkins, another industrial conglomerate. A week ago Hanson said it would not increase its bid, effectively withdrawing. Hanson had received acceptances from holders of 93,691 RHM shares by late yesterday.</p>

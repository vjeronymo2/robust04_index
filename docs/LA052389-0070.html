			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> STOCK PRICES GET A BOOST FROM DOLLAR  </P> <P> The stock market closed a trace higher Monday, barely reaching a new post-crash  high as a rising dollar and surging Treasury bond prices shored up a market  weakened by profit taking.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which surpassed the 2,500 level on  Friday for the first time since Oct. 13, 1987, added 0.92 to 2,502.02. At one  stage the average had been down about 10 points.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 833 up, 695 down and 486 unchanged.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 185.01 million shares, down from  242.41 million Friday, when the total was inflated by program trading linked to  expiring options and stock index futures.  </P> <P> The dollar rose sharply in world currency markets Monday. That prompted  strength in the American credit markets. (Story, Part I, Page I.)  </P> <P> That all was seen as positive for stocks. Falling rates mean less competition  for stocks from interest-bearing securities.  </P> <P> In addition, analysts say, falling interest rates reduce the perceived chances  that the economy will have to go through a recession.  </P> <P> But brokers also noted that the market has come a long way in its rally since  last November, when the Dow got as low as 2,038. They said some traders moved  today to cash in on those gains.  </P> <P> Avon Products led the active list and rose 2 3/8 to 34 5/8 on conjecture that  the company, which recently fended off a takeover bid by Amway Corp., might  become a target for other offers.  </P> <P> Compaq Computer, which introduced a new high-power desktop personal computer,  climbed 3 1/8 to 87 1/8. International Business Machines, faced with that  competitive development, dropped 1 1/4 to 109 7/8.  </P> <P> American Family fell 1 to 16. The company said it was looking for  second-quarter operating earnings per share to be flat with the comparable  period last year, and projected lower results for the full year than analysts  had been estimating.  </P> <P> Stocks also closed modestly higher on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in cautious  trading despite the sharp decline of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.  The Nikkei 225-share average, which jumped 144.65 points Friday, added another  65.90 points to 34,067.86.  </P> <P> On the London Stock Exchange Monday, share prices plunged amid heightened fears  that European interest rates might have to rise to halt the dollar's surge. The  Financial Times 100-share index finished 35.7 points, or 1.6%, lower at  2,169.0.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> The surging dollar and an improved outlook for inflation propelled bond prices  sharply higher and drove interest rates downward.  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up 13/16 point, or nearly $12 for  every $1,000 in face value. Its yield fell to 8.59%, the lowest closing yield  since March, 1988, and was down from 8.70% on Friday. Bond prices and yields  move in opposite directions.  </P> <P> The dollar's surge helped spark a sharp drop in commodity prices, and that in  turn increased bond traders' hopes that inflation would slow down and the  economy would cool off, analysts said.  </P> <P> When the economy is slow, the Federal Reserve Board is less likely to tighten  credit, which raises interest rates and sends bond prices lower.  </P> <P> Mitchell Held, chief financial economist with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;  Co., said money that had flowed out of bonds as interest rates rose was moving  back into Treasury securities.  </P> <P> "People are realizing the economy is slowing down," he said. "People are  under-invested in bonds."  </P> <P> Ward McCarthy, a managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates  Inc., a money market research firm, said he expected bond prices to continue to  move higher because "there's a lot of people who want to get on the bandwagon."  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  9.688%, up from 9.675% on Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Grain and soybean futures prices dropped sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade,  reflecting investor reaction to wet weather forecasts and the relentless rise  in the dollar's value.  </P> <P> On other markets, precious metals continued their slide, copper fell sharply,  livestock and meat prices were mixed,and energy futures were off.  </P> <P> Grain and soybean prices dropped, largely in reaction to weekend rains in farm  regions and a National Weather Service forecast of normal or above-normal  rainfall for six to 10 days beginning Thursday.  </P> <P> Gold and silver continued to slide on New York's Commodity Exchange.  </P> <P> "There nothing new to say about them," said William O'Neill, an analyst for  Elders Futures Inc. in New York. "They remain under pressure from the dollar."  </P> <P> The dollar's increasing attractiveness has caused many investors to sell their  positions in gold and silver.  </P> <P> Gold was $2.90 to $5.40 lower, with June at $363.70 an ounce; silver was 12.3  cents to 15.8 cents lower, with May at $5.106 an ounce.  </P></p>

Macedonia is the only  former Yugoslav republic to have gained its independence  peacefully, and it is an example of the cohabitation of  different ethnic groups, which is more unique than rare in these  parts. The Albanians are even represented in the government,  run by Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski, who is only 32 years  old.    What is the present situation like on the borders with  Serbia  and your other neighbors? There is talk of illegal trafficking  and of the embargo being violated.    [Crvenkovski] Extremist Albanians in Macedonia, Kosovo, and  Tirana, dream of a greater Albania. This plan is embarrassing  for the authorities in Tirana, with whom we have good relations.  If Kosovo were to explode, the war would be more devastating  than the present one. The Albanians in Macedonia would rush to  support their brothers, and Serbia could take advantage of this  to invade our country. At this point Bulgaria, which recognized  us and with which we now have good relations, would come forward  with its ancient territorial claims. Even Greece, in which  there is a Macedonian region, would be involved.</p>

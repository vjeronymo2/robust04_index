			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: A matter of interest FT-SE Index: 2,530.7 (+22.3) Global interest rate policy is still made in Washington, as far as Europe's equity markets are concerned. Share price gains yesterday were spread across the board: 2 1/2 per cent in France, 1 1/2 per cent in Germany, 0.9 per cent in London. Equity markets are evidently half-persuaded that where US interest rates lead, others will follow, no matter what is said at G7 meetings. UK short-term interest rates, indeed, are discounting a half percentage point cut in base rates by June, with May 17, the date of the next RPI figures, a popular candidate. None the less, London's rise yesterday was accomplished on unexciting volume, only a little better than that of recent dismal sessions. Monday, in particular, was one of the worst days for activity since the rally started. By historical standards, it can be argued that London is not dangerously costly; or even (looking at the ratio between long-term interest rates and equity yields) that it is rather cheap. That ratio is sensitive to inflation, though. It has moved in its current range only since inflation took off in the mid-1960s. If inflation were now to move permanently to a lower level, the normal range would shift downwards too, making today's level less of a bargain. Hopes remain of a flood of cash takeover bids to offset the Chinese water torture of rights issues; corporate lawyers talk of merger work stacking up in their offices, waiting to burst upon the world once preparation is completed. So far, that is just talk; until it becomes more than that, London will continue to bounce between New York's side-effects and the local election hangover.</p>

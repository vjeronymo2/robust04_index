			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Bonds with Pep appeal / Advantages seen in the corporate equivalent of gilts Kenneth Clarke's Budget proposed that certain UK corporate bonds, along with UK and EU preference shares, should be eligible for personal equity plans from April 6 next year. It is not yet clear exactly which bonds will be allowed - but stock market prices of all bonds that looked likely to qualify rose promptly in the hope of increased demand from Pep managers - even before next April. Doughty personal investors may prefer to pick their own bonds and put them into a self-select Pep. We explain the basics. What are corporate bonds? They come in several different varieties. In essence, they are the corporate equivalent of gilt-edged stocks, but without the government's rock-solid guarantee behind them. As a result, they tend to pay a higher rate of interest. Gilts - which come in units of Pounds 100 - are that part of government debt which is traded on the stock market. They pay a fixed rate of interest twice a year and the bonds are repaid at a specified date in the future. The Treasury 8 per cent of 2009, for instance, pays interest of Pounds 4.00 for every Pounds 100 twice a year until 2009, when it is repaid in full. But the price investors pay for existing gilts goes up or down as interest rates vary. At present, an investor would pay about Pounds 95.50 for the Treasury 8 per cent 2009, and get a slightly higher effective interest rate of 8.37 per cent. Investors in gilts also have the advantage that they can sell them on the stock market at any time if they need the money, rather than wait until they are repaid by the government. Corporate bonds are very similar to gilts. Many are priced in the same way as gilts, in units of Pounds 100. Companies issue them as an alternative to borrowing from the bank or issuing new shares. Many corporate bonds are issued through the Eurobond market these days, and some Dollars 400bn was raised that way last year. That, though, is a market used mainly by professional investors. Some corporate bonds are still traded on the stock market and personal investors can buy these easily in amounts as small as Pounds 1,000 - although the spread between buy/sell prices might be as high as 0.75 to 1.0 per cent, compared with around 0.375 per cent for large deals. Who buys corporate bonds? Corporate bonds and gilts are bought by people who want to lock in a fixed rate of interest on savings for a longer period than is normally possible with a deposit. Fixed deposit rates are only really available for up to three years or so. Bonds can give fixed interest rates for 20 years or more. But that also means that investors should be cautious about locking themselves into fixed bond interest rates when general interest rates are low, as now. Corporate bonds fall into two main types: loan stocks, which are very much like gilts and are sold in units of Pounds 100 (such as the Enterprise Oil 10 3/4 per cent loan stock 2013); and debentures (such as the LASMO 10 3/8 per cent debenture 2009), which are bonds secured on particular assets belonging to a company, often property. Most have a fixed repayment date and a fixed annual interest rate. How safe are corporate bonds? Because companies can go bust, unlike the government, they carry a higher risk than gilts and so pay a higher rate of interest. Broadly, the smaller and riskier the company, the higher the interest rate it pays on its bonds. Take a debenture from a large property company, British Land 9 3/8 per cent 2028. This now offers an effective interest rate of 9.1 per cent, while one from a much smaller property company, Derwent Valley 10 1/8 per cent 2019, offers an effective interest rate of 9.9 per cent. The former offers the investor 0.7 per cent a year more than the comparable gilt; the latter offers 1.6 per cent more. As well as carrying the same risk as gilts - that their prices will go up and down as interest rates move - they carry a small but significant credit risk that the company could at some point go bust. What is credit risk? Effectively, it is the risk that a company will go bust before it repays you. In practice, though, because bonds are usually issued only by reasonably large and respectable companies, the risk of failure is small. What is market risk? Just like shares, bond prices go up and down on the market, and bondholders can get a guaranteed return on their investment only if they hold it until the bonds are redeemed. Bond prices move up and down in response to bank base rate changes and inflation worries. In broad terms, the longer a bond has to run before it is repaid, the more volatile it is likely to be meanwhile: that is, the more sharply its price will move for a given shift in interest rates, and the wider its swings on either side of its underlying trend. Remember, too, that bond prices rise when interest rates and yields fall as they become more attractive investments. Similarly, bond prices fall when interest rates and yields are rising. What is a yield? The annual rate of interest you get on a bond at its existing market price. Any fixed interest stock with a fixed repayment date has two yields: the current (or interest) yield and the redemption yield (or yield to maturity). The annual interest rate on any bond is fixed in relation to its value at redemption - usually Pounds l00. But if the market level of yields is higher or lower than the nominal rate on a particular bond, the market price of the bond will move down or up - until its current yield comes into line with market rates. Which yield should I look at? If you are holding to redemption, look at the redemption yield if you want to know your total return. But check the current yield to find out your annual income. What kind of yield do these bonds offer now? High-quality, medium-dated debentures are yielding around 9.5 per cent, and long-term ones just under 9 per cent. But if you are willing to go for a bond from a smaller company, you can probably get about half a percentage point more. Where can I find out about bonds? This is a big snag. Very few prices are quoted, even in the FT, on a daily basis. You will find some of the prices in the dealings page in the first section on Saturday. But it is hard to get the information needed to choose in the first place and hard to monitor your holdings afterwards. Ask your broker to look them up in the Stock Exchange Daily Official List (also in large libraries). Should I buy bonds now? Possibly not. While prices have fallen this year as rates have started to rise, they may drop further yet. The best time to buy is when interest rates are near their peak (as they were in 1990 when base rates were 15 per cent). At such times, bonds offer the best rate and you can lock in high interest rates. Interest rates in the UK have further to rise yet, so hang on to your building society deposits for now.

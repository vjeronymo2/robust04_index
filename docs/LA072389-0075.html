			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A 17-year-old San Jose boy accused of killing a male sexual partner in a rage  of guilt will stand trial as a juvenile rather than as an adult, according to a  ruling by Juvenile Court Judge John T. Ball. If convicted, Joaquin Ocasio would  face less prison time under Juvenile Court requirements than he would face in  the adult court system. The judge said he based his decision in part on  evidence that showed the boy had been seduced by the stabbing victim, Kevin  Beaird, 34. Prosecutors said the youth had "rage reactions." The decision to  try Ocasio as a juvenile was criticized by Cynthia Goldstein, a Bay Area gay  activist, who said "The court's ruling signifies that it's not serious if you  kill a gay person, as opposed to a non-gay person."  </P></p>

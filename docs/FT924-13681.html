			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Nissan strengthens Bosch alliance NISSAN, Japan's second-largest carmaker, has strengthened its alliance with Robert Bosch, the German components manufacturer which has bought a 9.6 per cent stake in a key Nissan parts supplier. Robert Bosch, which already supplies Nissan's Japanese and European operations, paid Y5.14bn (Dollars 43m) for the stake in Unisia, a Nissan affiliate. Nissan and Bosch in July announced plans to merge Unisia and Japan Electronic Control systems, which is 12.5 per cent owned by the German group. By investing directly in Unisia, the German company will raise its stake in the merged company from a planned 2.7 per cent to about 10 per cent. Nissan's stake in Unisia, which was spun off from Nissan in 1956, will fall from 33 to 24 per cent. The merged company is expected to become a leading supplier to Nissan in the next few years, by combining Unisia's brake and engine technology with Bosch's engine control electronics. The merger is a significant step in Bosch's relationship with Nissan because it will expand its role as a supplier from alternators into the development of key electronic systems for Nissan cars. Kao, a leading Japanese household products maker, is acquiring Chemische Fabrik Chem-Y, a German chemical company, from DSM Fine Chemicals of the Netherlands, for an undisclosed sum, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Chem-Y, which makes agents used in cosmetics, detergents, metal processing and starch processing, is capitalised at DM10.4m (Dollars 7.30m) and has annual turnover of DM50m.</p>

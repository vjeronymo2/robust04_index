			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Russia frees prices The Russian government yesterday freed the price of vodka and gold, implementing moves promised by the government earlier this year. Other price controls are due to be phased out under a programme being fleshed out with the International Monetary Fund. A government spokesman said the freeing of the vodka price - which now fetches Rbs120 a bottle on the black market - would eradicate corruption and speculation connected with artificially low prices. Vodka at controlled prices is already virtually unavailable in most Russian cities, including St Petersburg where inhabitants have been given ration cards supposedly entitling them to buy one bottle a month for Rbs45. The state is to keep its monopoly on production of spirits - although yesterday it gave up its monopoly on the production of beer and wine.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deng Rong, daughter of Chinese leader Deng </F> Xiaoping, by NHK announcer Yoko Sakurai at a Tokyo hotel; date  not given; Deng speaks in Mandarin with Japanese subtitles  appearing on screen -- recorded]    [Text] [Sakurai speaking from the NHK studio] Today, we  will televise an interview with Deng Rong, daughter of China's  paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. She is now in Japan to  commemorate the publication of Japanese edition of her book:  My Father, Deng Xiaoping.    [Video shows Sakurai sitting face to face with Deng Rong]  [Sakurai] You resemble your father. Your face is round and your  brow is broad. You resemble your father.    [Deng] [Laughter] I resemble my father a bit but not  completely. I have my mother's eyes and eyebrows and my  father's nose, mouth, and chin. I told my father that I am more  good-looking than he is. [laughter] [video shows Deng Xiaoping  holding Deng Rong in his lap when she was a child]    [Sakurai] We saw Mr. Deng Xiaping on the New Year's Day by  the lunar calendar for the first time in one year. How is your  father's health?    [Deng] Generally speaking, he is in fairly good health [shen  ti zhuang kuang bi jiao hao di]. Specifically, for a man at the  ripe old age of 90, his condition can be described in English as  perfect [the preceding word rendered in English]; that is his  current health condition is remarkable [heng chu se]. What is  important is that he is not ill; however, because he is at the  advanced age of 90, his health and overall physical condition  are naturally not as good as two or five years ago. There is an  old Chinese saying that when a man gets old, his feet are the  first to age. Therefore, he does not walk as fast as before.  [video shows Deng Rong accompanying her father on New Year's  Day]    [Sakurai] What is Mr. Deng Xiaoping's dream or hope?    [Deng] My father is a statesman, and his greatest concerns  are none other than major domestic affairs and international  political and economic matters. However, because he has  retired, he has begun to pay heed to his grandchildren's report  cards. If their academic performance was not so good, he would  make comments in order to show that he was concerned about his  grandchildren's studies in his capacity as a grandfather. My  father is a bridge enthusiast who plays bridge three or four  times a week but not every night. [laughter] Before he retired,  he played twice a week. After he retired.... [pauses] We spent  this winter in Shanghai, where he invited his bridge partners so  that they could play bridge everyday, not three or four times a  week. After he returned to Beijing, they reduced the frequency,  to three or four times, because they live quite far apart.    [Sakurai] Mrs. Deng, you just said your father's feet have  become weak, but he walks three km every day. [Deng's response  not heard]</p>

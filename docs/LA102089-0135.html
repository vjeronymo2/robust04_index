			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 SEEK 2 GARDEN GROVE TRUSTEE SEATS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: TWO INCUMBENTS AND A SANTA ANA MAN RUNNING FOR THE SECOND TIME  COMPETE FOR SCHOOL BOARD POSITIONS.  </P> <P> Two incumbents and one challenger will vie for two seats on the Garden Grove  school board in the Nov. 7 general election.  </P> <P> Maureen G. DiMarco, 41, of Cypress and Richard H. Hain, 68, of Garden Grove  will be seeking their third terms. Watson Lewis Warren, 44, of Santa Ana is  making a second run at a post on the governing board of Orange County's second  largest school district.  </P> <P> DiMarco, an educational consultant and a third-year law student, also is  president-elect of the California School Boards Assn.  </P> <P> "I'm running because I feel I have a lot to offer the school district. It's  gone through all kinds of changes. The experienced leadership is there. I think  I've got a lot of support," she said.  </P> <P> Her goals for a third term would include "maintaining a high level of quality  of education" in spite of "funding fluctuations."  </P> <P> Hain, a resident of Garden Grove since 1954, is a retired educator who was  formerly the director of personnel for the district. He's seeking a third term  because "I'm vitally interested in what happens in the Garden Grove Unified  School District and to the young people who will graduate from it."  </P> <P> He lists among the accomplishments of the current board "good utilization of  special funds," including lottery money for projects ranging from carpeting  classrooms to putting rubberized mats beneath playground equipment.  </P> <P> Hain said the district has tightened graduation requirements, emphasized a  global dimension in its social-studies programs and broadened the use of  computers in all grade levels.  </P> <P> Warren, an operating engineer, finished last in a field of eight candidates in  1987, polling 1,387 votes. He also ran unsuccessfully in 1988 for a spot on the  Rancho Santiago Community College District board.  </P> <P> "I think the English-only program is important," Warren said. "I think it's too  tough on teachers to have to teach in two different languages. I'm also in  favor of fundamental schools, which place a heavy emphasis on the basics."  </P> <P> He concedes that "this election will be an easy one for them (the incumbents)  to win." Warren does not have a candidate's statement in the voter-information  pamphlet mailed to all registered voters, and says he is planning no  canvassing, mailings or signs promoting his candidacy.  </P></p>

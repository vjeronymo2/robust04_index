			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Boardroom reshuffle at loss-making Aviva MR GRAHAM Ferguson Lacey, the evangelical preacher who heads the group that recently bought Land's End and John o'Groats, has become deputy chairman of Aviva Petroleum, a Texas-based but London-quoted oil and gas company. Mr Lacey, who made his name as a controversial entrepreneur in the 1970s, is president and chief executive of Gulf Resources &amp; Chemical Corp, which increased its stake in Aviva from 17 per cent to nearly 21 per cent last November, when Mr Lacey initially became chief executive. He is one of four Gulf directors who occupy non-executive roles on Aviva's board. Mr Denys Milne, who used to be a BP director and is still involved with the Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering concern, has been appointed chairman of Aviva, replacing Mr Gerald John Ward, who has resigned. Mr Ron Suttill, the only executive director, becomes president and chief executive. 'I'm now on my fourth - or is it my fifth? - chairman since 1985,' he said. The company is involved in exploration and drilling in the US, Alberta and Columbia. Gulf Resources has taken a much stronger interest since increasing its stake over the equity accounting threshold. Mr Suttill said Gulf might buy more shares, possibly through supporting a rights issue. Aviva, which lost Dollars 3.2m (Pounds 1.75m) in the first half of 1991, plans to seek a US listing on either the Nasdaq over-the-counter market or the American Stock Exchange.</p>

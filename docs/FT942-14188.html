			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Economic Viewpoint: 'Competitiveness' rides again What do you do if a confused idea has a seemingly irreversible hold on politicians and businessmen? Oppose it to the bitter end, saying in adaptation of King Lear: 'No sense will come from nonsense: speak again prime minister'? Or redefine the idea to mean something sensible? The first attitude describes the reaction of the Treasury's economic thinkers to the UK government's promise or threat to publish a 'competitiveness' white paper on May 16 (a deadline likely to be missed). The second is the alternative preferred by thinkers at the Department of Trade and Industry, who would like to redefine competitiveness to mean overall economic performance. My sympathies are with the doubters. Competitiveness is a concept that applies to companies, not countries. The interests of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola are in conflict, as one gains largely at the expense of the other. The economic interests of the US and Japan, or of the European Union and post-communist Europe, are not. There is a limited meaningful sense in which one can talk about an individual nation being uncompetitive. It may have cost levels at prevailing exchange rates which are so high as to undermine the solvency of otherwise profitable companies or to threaten jobs which would otherwise be safe. It is in this sense that the UK was seen as uncompetitive at the 1990-92 ERM exchange rate. Uncompetitiveness here means an overvalued exchange rate. It is rarer than supposed. Not every country can have an overvalued exchange rate. Moreover, if a country has repeatedly depreciated, and the benefits are repeatedly offset by rising domestic costs, then its problems are not those of competitiveness even in the narrow, parochial sense, but of a different kind  -often labour market ones. The well-known US economist, Professor Paul Krugman, diagnoses the European unemployment problem: 'Taxes and regulations imposed by Europe's elaborate welfare states have made employers reluctant to create new jobs, while a generous level of unemployment benefits has made workers unwilling to accept the kind of low wage jobs that help keep unemployment comparatively low in the US.' These difficulties are, he thinks, aggravated by exchange rate links with post-unification Germany. The British government would be in broad agreement with Krugman's diagnosis; and even Jacques Delors came to adopt some of it in later versions of his white paper. But both have done so under the misleading slogan of safeguarding European competitiveness. Indeed I have been provoked to return to the issue by the UK government's efforts to make 'competitiveness' the focus of its economic policies. Another influence has been that of Krugman, who has delivered what in a logical world would be a knock-out blow to the idea in an article in the April issue of Foreign Affairs and in a very entertaining book called Peddling Prosperity, already published by Norton in the US and to be issued in the UK on June 1 at the bargain price of Pounds 16.95. One puzzle is how the European Union, whose currencies float against the rest of the world, can be uncompetitive even in the narrow overvaluation sense. John Major had a very good try at persuading EU summit conferences that it was in 1993. But as I pointed out in an Economic Viewpoint of July 1 last, he based himself on a Commission chart of European unit labour costs compared with US and Japanese ones, which contained a howler. For it was drawn up in national currencies without correcting for exchange rates. When this correction was made, it showed that both the US and the European Union costs had risen less than Japan's. Krugman comments: 'How could John Major, with the sophisticated resources of the UK Treasury behind him, present an analysis that failed to make the most standard of adjustments?' Scarcely credible as it may seem, the same chart, without the exchange rate correction, was repeated in a 1994 UK paper, Competitiveness and Employment. In his efforts to be fair, Krugman tries to squeeze another meaning out of 'lack of competitiveness'. This is when deteriorating terms of trade are required to price a country's goods into overseas markets. Krugman examines an official US index called 'Command GNP', which corrects for terms of trade effects and is thus an index of the nation's purchasing power. The correction makes a trivial difference to the US trend. I have replicated his analysis with the aid of the official index of UK 'Gross National Disposable Income'. This corrects the GNP estimates for terms of trade effects and other modest complications. Over the whole period 1971-93 and even sub-periods, the movement of the two series was, as in the US, almost identical. The result is pretty remarkable for an exposed country with an overseas trade sector three times as large as that of the US. But in both countries exchange rate changes mainly offset inflation differentials and did not have any noticeable effect on living standards. British experience following the departure from the ERM in September 1992 does show some, probably temporary, departure from trend, but of an opposite kind to that envisaged by pedlars of competitiveness. For the UK, terms of trade have improved radically since ERM departure. If the official estimates are to be believed, import prices have risen by 6 per cent, but export prices by 17 per cent. Exporters have been criticised for raising margins rather than reducing foreign currency prices. But if prices were already in line with world markets, they have moved quite rationally to prevent their products from becoming too 'competitive'. Why does the rhetoric of 'competitiveness' have so much appeal? Businessmen have a comfortable feeling of understanding if they can believe 'what is good for General Motors is good for America'. Moreover, the images of the 'strategic traders' (those who sell competitiveness slogans in the US) are bloodthirsty and thrilling, eg 'The decisive war of the century has begun and America may already have decided to lose'. A further reason may be that 'competitiveness' is often confused with the case for competition. The latter refers to the benefits of rival bidding by companies for their customers' dollar or pound, for workers and for loanable funds in the capital market. It is promoted by measures such as anti-trust, the outlawing of price rings and union closed shops, and the removal of barriers to international trade, none of which depends on treating international trade as warfare. But why not allow our leaders their rhetoric if they can use it for good causes, such as reducing the US budget deficit or removing rigidities from European labour markets? Krugman suggests three reasons. First, it can result in wasteful government spending. An example is the proposed focusing of US government-sponsored research on manufacturing, because it is more open to foreign competition than services. Second, it can lead to protectionism and trade wars. One only has to look at the US attempts to impose specific import targets on Japan. Third, and most important, by encouraging sloppy thinking it can undermine policy on a much larger range of issues. For instance, Lawrence Summers, a former colleague of Krugman's and himself a well-known economist, in his capacity as under-secretary of the US Treasury, asserts that Japan's surplus is a drag on world growth instead of a source of useful savings. In Britain, the normally economically-literate Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, talks of Europe's 'need to be 'competitive' with the rising Tigers of Asia'. Quite apart from any effect on GNP, clear thinking is worthwhile for its own sake.</p>

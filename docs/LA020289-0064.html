			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 6 ARABS SENTENCED TO LONG JAIL TERMS AS STONE THROWERS  </P> <P> A military court sentenced six Palestinians to up to two years in prison for  throwing stones, and an army official said Wednesday that the unusually harsh  sentences are intended to deter other youths.  </P> <P> In the past, stone throwers have received only fines or jail terms of several  months.  </P> <P> The sentences for the six ranged from 18 to 24 months in prison, plus suspended  terms of 18 to 40 months and fines of $417 to $833.  </P> <P> The Israeli daily Haaretz said three of the incidents involved stone throwing  at soldiers. It said the defendants range in age from 15 to 22.  </P> <P> No one was hurt in the stone-throwing incidents, said the army official, who  spoke on condition of anonymity. But he added:  </P> <P> "Stones have the potential of causing death, just like live ammunition. . . .  The punishment was meted out not only as a punishment but also as a deterrent  for the defendants and the general public."  </P> <P> Also Wednesday, 10 Arab teen-agers were wounded in clashes with troops in the  West Bank and Gaza Strip, including a 13-year-old boy shot in the head with a  rubber bullet, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed five wounded.  </P></p>

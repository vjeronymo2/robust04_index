			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US blue chips plunge in late selling burst Wall Street AFTER MOVING in a narrow trading range for most of the session, a late burst of selling left blue chip issues markedly lower at the end of trading yesterday, although secondary stocks held their ground, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 14.04 at 3,241.95, the bulk of the decline coming in the final 30 minutes of trading. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended down 1.78 at 433.35, while the Amex composite firmed 1.37 to 405.21, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.63 at 697.44. Trading volume on the NYSE was 269m shares, and declines outnumbered rises by 972 to 882. There were no new economic statistics released yesterday, which meant that the market's attention was primarily focused on the inauguration of President Bill Clinton. Some analysts had been nervous that the market might react negatively if the new president referred to substantial economic stimuli in his speech; but, in the event, Mr Clinton avoided specific references to economic policy and the speech passed with no significant reaction from inves tors. The news that the Iraqi government had made conciliatory offers to the incoming administration aided market senti ment, primarily because it led to a drop in crude oil prices on world commodity markets. Drug stocks, which have languished lately, were in strong demand. US Surgical was the highlight, rising Dollars 7 1/4 to Dollars 75 7/8 in volume of 2m shares as investors reacted positively to the news, released late on Tuesday, that the company earned a profit of 64 cents a share in the fourth quarter, up from 48 cents a share a year ago. Also firmer were Pfizer, Dollars 2 1/2 higher at Dollars 63 1/2 , Schering-Plough, up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 57 5/8 , Merck, up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 41 1/4 , and Johnson&amp;Johnson, up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 45 3/4 . Tenneco fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 40 in busy trading on the news that Mr Michael Walsh, the conglomerate's chairman and chief executive, has been diagnosed as having a brain tumour. Mr Walsh said that he would continue to work while being treated with radiation and chemotherapy. Among computer stocks, Unisys climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 12 1/2 after the company unveiled fourth quarter income before extraordinary items of Dollars 101.2m, up sharply from the Dollars 80.5m earned at the same stage of 1991. Also firmer was Digital Equipment, up Dollars 1 at Dollars 41 5/8 . IBM, however remained under selling pressure following the announcement on Tuesday of a record annual loss, and fell another Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 46 7/8 . AMR, parent group of American Airlines, fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 67 1/8 after announcing a fourth quarter net loss of Dollars 200m. Canada TORONTO stocks were mixed overall, despite rallying gold shares. The 300-stock composite index added 2.06 points, or 0.06 per cent, to 3,290.14, with declining issues ahead of advances 320 to 277. Volume was 44.96m shares worth CDollars 370m compared with Tuesday's 55.46m shares worth CDollars 544m. Ten of 14 sub-groups ended lower. The gold sector showed the largest swing, up 3.7 per cent.</p>

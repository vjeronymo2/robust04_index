			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Mongolia ends communist ways MONGOLIA, where even the matches are rationed after 70 years of Marxism, passed a new constitution yesterday throwing out the last vestiges of communism and enshrining democracy and a market economy, Reuter reports from Ulan Bator. The document, which takes effect on February 12, makes Mongolia a democratic parliamentary state with an independent judicial system and guarantees freedom of speech, faith and other basic human rights. References to the communist party, Marxist ideology and centralised planning have been erased. The former People's Republic of Mongolia, sandwiched between Russia and China, is now the State of Mongolia and the communist star has gone from the flag. The national emblem - a white horse jumping to the left, symbolising socialism jumping over capitalism - has been replaced by a winged horse running to the right.</p>

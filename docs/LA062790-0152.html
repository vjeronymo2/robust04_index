			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KATHLEEN TURNER GIVES BENEFIT AUCTION THE SLIP  </P> <P> Sure, anyone can give someone the slip, but actress Kathleen Turner's slip  costs $1,200.  </P> <P> The slip, which she has been wearing in the play "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," was  one of 29 items sold Tuesday night at a black-tie dinner and auction for Easter  Seals.  </P> <P> The auction raised $30,000 for the charity that aids people with disabilities.  </P> <P> Bidding for the slip started at $500 and quickly grew after auctioneer Diddi  Lynn Worsole informed potential buyers that the slip was not in the room  because Turner was wearing it just a few blocks away.  </P> <P> "She's sweating in it right now," Worsole said. "Maybe there will be a little  perfume on it."  </P> <P> The bidding quickly escalated in increments of $100 until Staten Island real  estate broker Henry Setaro came in with the top bid of $1,200.  </P> <P> "It's the closest I will ever get to Kathleen Turner," Setaro said. "I hope  they don't wash it before I get it."  </P></p>

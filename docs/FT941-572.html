			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Italy braced for fresh row over its EU milk quota Italy was braced last night for a new row over its European Union milk quota, which it is threatening to widen to other areas in another example of hostage-taking in EU decision-making. Unless it gets satisfaction, Italy says, it may hold up ratification of the increase in the EU's revenue base agreed at the December 1992 Edinburgh summit, necessary for increased flows of regional aid from next year. The threat is analogous to the current row over the UK's holding up of enlargement to include Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway as new members, unless the rules on majority voting are changed. Italy is upset because the European Commission feels it has not done enough to comply with an agreement whereby it would cut its excess milk production from 11.5m tonnes down to its permitted quota of 9m tonnes, in exchange for which it would get an increase in quota of 0.9m tonnes. Brussels says Italy is 350,000 tonnes short of the roughly two thirds cut it had to make in illicit milk output. Commission officials warn that milk producers such as the UK, Netherlands, Germany and Denmark - unhappy at the original concession to Rome - could block any attempt at flexibility. Italy was expected to argue that the original 11.5m tonnes figure was an over-estimate, and to produce some new figures. But Italy, as well as Spain and Greece, was also expected to oppose a Commission proposal to delay payment of olive oil subsidies until mid-October. The Commission fears it could get into trouble on its Ecu36bn (Pounds 28.3bn) farm budget next year because of the compensation costs in the reform of the common agricultural policy and compensation to farmers for currency swings during the 1992-93 monetary crises - unless the olive oil pay have complied with EU agreements to bring their own excess milk output into line with their quotas, the Mediterranean trio could form a mutually reinforcing bloc because of the olive oil proposals. In the current dispute over voting weights after enlargement, Spain had sided with the UK in wanting to keep the number of votes needed to block decisions at 23 out of 76, instead of 27 out of 90 votes.</p>

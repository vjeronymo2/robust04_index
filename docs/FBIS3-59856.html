			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yacine Lahcene: "Sidi Ghiles Prison Attacked"] </F>   [Text] The terrorist cell, consisting of three armed  individuals, was apparently well organized, whatever else one  may think of it. It was about 1800 and night was just beginning  to fall. The streets near the penitentiary were virtually  deserted. At that time of day, in that part of town, passersby  are very rare. The presence of anyone, even strangers behaving  suspiciously, would thus attract no attention.    The prison guard, an accomplice, waited for a sign from his  confederates. At the appointed hour, he opened the prison gate  and let the three terrorists inside. Obviously, the guard must  have given his partners a detailed map of the prison in advance.  With their pinpoint knowledge of the premises, they proceeded  first to the office of the warden, who was taken by surprise and  failed to react quickly enough. They rushed him and--to avoid  making noise--fell on him with knives. With serious wounds in  the throat and elsewhere on his body, the warden collapsed on  the floor of his office in a pool of blood. According to the  latest information we have obtained, the victim is still in  extremely critical condition. One crime already behind them, the  group proceeded with the guard in the lead to the facility's  armory, carrying off six pistols, an equal number of "mat 49"  and Seminovs. Armed with all these weapons--the principal motive  for the attack--the terrorists and the guard took flight.    While the facts about this attack discredit recently  circulated rumors about a spectacular prison breakout of some  200 prisoners, they do confirm that the Cherchell prison was  indeed the target of a terrorist operation.    Also, we have learned the prosecutor in Saida was seriously  wounded yesterday in a terrorist attack.    Thus we see terrorists are again targeting officers of the  court. Other magistrates brought down by the beastly terrorists  include Lardi Baida, deputy prosecutor for the court of Algiers,  assassinated last July; Mohamed Said, prosecutor general of  Tlemcen, victim of a terrorist attack last May; and Bekai  Mustapha, presiding judge for the court at Kolea.    Indeed, the attack on Sidi Ghiles prison and attempted  assassination of Said's prosecutor were part of an almost  synchronized recrudescence of terrorist attacks throughout the  country.    In several cities, a number of civilians and members of  security forces were assassinated between last Tuesday and  Sunday: no less than 21 civilians, including a forest ranger,  his eight-year-old daughter, a clerk, the president of the  Guigbab DEC [expansion unknown] (Merouana), and an imam. The  security services are mourning the loss of 14 of their men,  including nine policemen savagely murdered last Wednesday at  Benghazi while trying to remove a police roadblock. Two other  policemen were wounded in that ambush. Nevertheless, the  security services have struck back with some effective blows  against the terrorists in the space of only a few days,  eliminating 12 and arresting 149 others.    The biggest raid was carried out on Tuesday at Tiaret, where  five terrorists were killed and 46 others rendered harmless,  while in the Sidi Bel Abbes region seven members of the group  that set fire to the ENIE [expansion not given] at Telagh were  neutralized.    These results demonstrate once again that despite the  relentlessness and murderous fury of the armed groups, the  security services are more determined than ever to wage  unceasing battle against them.</p>

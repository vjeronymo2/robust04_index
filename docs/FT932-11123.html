			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Clinton lays ground for action THROUGHOUT the long build-up to a still imponderable denouement in Bosnia President Bill Clinton has always promised maximum consultation with Congress and a full justification of whatever actions the US undertook to the American public. Yesterday he provided the barest glimmer of the latter. Welcoming home US troops from their humanitarian mission in Somalia, he spoke of 'other missions that lie ahead,' and of a world that 'has not seen the end of evil." He went on: 'Some will ask why we must so often be the one to lead. Well, of course, we cannot be the world's policeman, but we are, and must continue to be, the world's leader. That is the job of the United States of America.' But the word Bosnia never passed his lips. It may have been understandable that it did not do so, for no decision had been taken by the Bosnian Serb 'parliament' as he spoke. But of all the options still open to him two are particularly fraught. There remains the very good chance that within days President Clinton will either be authorising the dispatch of a substantial 20,000 plus US military contingent to keep the new peace in Bosnia or air strikes against Serb installations. His country will want to know why the US deems its vital interests are so much at stake for a president schooled by opposition to the Vietnam War. As Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia put it yesterday: the president has 'to identify our strategic interests. He has to identify our humanitarian interests. And he has to express clear goals that may be tied to military action." Mr Clinton knows the case can be more easily made if US action is part of a UN operation and with the participation of its allies and Russia. In spite of reports from the current mission to Europe by Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, of disagreements between the US and its allies, it is assumed that, in the crunch, this can be obtained. Yesterday's commitment by Russia to contribute to peacekeeping is seen as very helpful. Indeed, if Europe, already heavily criticised in the US for ducking the Bosnian problem, were to sit on its hands, or to continue to resist the alternative option of lifting the arms embargo, then Mr Clinton would probably face an impossible domestic selling job. He may even conclude it is not worth attempting because the constituency in favour of unilateral US action is undoubtedly in the minority. Further uncertainty surrounds the speed at which either a UN peacekeeping force or offensive action could be put into effect. This delay may buy Mr Clinton some time to persuade his domestic audiences he is doing the right thing but not much, but the appearance of indecision might be harmful. The most likely course for the president would be more than one national televised address from the Oval Office together with excursions outside Washington, plus mass deployment of senior officials to make the case to various audiences. But this process, in turn, will invite criticism on a very grand scale, with the almost certain consequence that Mr Clinton will be accused of forgetting why he was elected in the first place - to put the domestic economy back on the rails.</p>

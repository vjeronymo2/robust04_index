			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Spanish groups ponder the KIO's change of policy - A look at how the Kuwaiti investment institution has shocked Madrid's financial world Bankers in Madrid were puzzled two weeks ago when they were asked by Prima Inmobilaria, a young property development company 33 per cent owned by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), to attend a meeting of creditors. Representatives of some 60 banks assembled to hear Prima's chairman ask them to agree on a two-month moratorium on repayment of capital. In return, the KIO would lend Dollars 35m to Prima to enable it to continue paying interest. The curious thing about the meeting was that hardly any debt was due to mature in August and September and that which did only affected a handful of the banks present. Why call the meeting? The most probable reason was that the once powerful and discreet KIO, under new management since May, wants it that way. KIO's new president, Mr Ali Rashaid Al-Bader, controls assets worth close to Dollars 40bn around the world but nothing with quite the public profile as the industrial and property empire his predecessors have built up and managed in Spain since 1984. Prima has consolidated debt of close to Dollars 700m which the KIO has evidently decided not to continue funding until it disposes of a number of assets. This must be heartbreaking for a company caught in a property recession with most of its prime assets still under development. At least it is still alive. A few weeks earlier, the KIO had refused to continue funding losses at Ercros, Spain's biggest chemicals company, 39 per cent owned by the Grupo Torras, the KIO holding company in Spain. Most of Ercros is now in receivership. Torras's other two large affiliates, the Ebro foods group and the Torraspapel paper operation, are likely to be affected by the KIO's efforts to trim debt and creditor banks are waiting to be called to new meetings. The events have been a shock. The new KIO management has decided to implement, almost overnight and quite without warning, a radical change of investment policy in Spain. What was once a long-term commitment to build up the Torras group is being rapidly reduced to little more than a short-term portfolio play, with more than 20,000 Spanish jobs at risk. Torras is one of the biggest privately owned industrial groups in Spain. It was built up by a flamboyant partnership of Mr Javier de la Rosa, a Catalan financier, and Mr Fouad Jaffar, the KIO's former general manager. As the Spanish economy has foundered, though, so has the group. Mr De la Rosa left on May 26. The last two months have seen a worsening of the prospects of Torras's assets and share prices. Partly, this is because new KIO representatives in Spain, professing their 'shock ' and 'surprise' to Spanish newspapers in unattributable briefings, have been openly critical of Torras's businesses and have begun a legal investigation of the actions of the old management. However, the surprise and the investigation may be more theatrical than real. The Torras companies were in trouble but documents show that this was well known, certainly to the Kuwait Investment Authority (the KIA, which theoretically controls the KIO), by late last year. The previous management at the KIO and Torras fought for, and won, agreement in January from the KIA for a Dollars 1bn transfer of funds to keep the Spanish group alive. Almost Dollars 700m had been channelled into Torras from the KIO between February 4 and June 2, when the new KIO team took over the Torras board. The transfers were interrupted at the behest, it is understood, of the finance ministry. The KIA agreed to that funding (treating it not as fresh capital but simply replacement funds) after being presented, in December 1991, with a pessimistic report on Torras by KPMG Peat Marwick, the KIO's auditors. That report flatly states that Torras needed a cash injection of Dollars 1bn and says that 'overall, Grupo Torras is unlikely in the short term to be able to give the KIO a return on its investment'. It also warns that 'a forced sale in the current European recessionary climate could result in a significant loss of the investment made by the KIO to date'. The new KIO management nevertheless, appears to have decided to make disposals at both Ercros and Prima. The Peat Marwick report contradicts the impression being sown by the new KIO team that Torras's Spanish management was wayward. 'The investments themselves are in large autonomous companies which appear to be managed appropriately,' it says, and chides the KIO for not giving the Spaniards enough support. 'Five Kuwaiti representatives are on the board of Grupo Torras. The complete board has not met for over a year and is not directing strategy. The Spanish management of Grupo Torras . . . are currently disillusioned since they have not been given guidance on the policies of Kuwait.' Peat Marwick suggested the KIO should refinance Torras's bank loans to reflect their equity positions. The KIO now appears to be doing this. Torras owns 91 per cent of Torraspapel, 33 per cent of Prima, 39 per cent of Ercros and 40 per cent of Ebro. Peat Marwick, in December, calculated Torras's debt at Dollars 963m to banks and a further Dollars 501m in outstanding bonds. In November and December this year Torras has to repay loans of Dollars 200m each to Bank of America and Credit Suisse. At the same time as insisting it will only be responsible for debt in proportion to its equity stakes, the KIO has reworked the 1991 Torras accounts, substituting market for book values to show a 1991 portfolio loss of about Dollars 300m and not a small profit as originally reported. This casts Torras in an even worse light, suggesting it may one day be abandoned. The fact that most of the debt of Torras and its affiliates is secured against shares in the affiliates has also sharpened interest in the group's immediate future. The La Caixa savings bank and Sumitomo Bank have loans to Torras worth Dollars 37m secured against Ercros stock and now that the security is in receivership the loans may have to be repaid quickly. Also Torras guaranteed loans worth nearly Dollars 100m to Ercros from Banco Santander, Bankinter and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, which could increase financial pressure on the Spanish holding company. Peat Marwick last year accurately predicted 1991 losses of Dollars 180m at Ercros and warned then that it was 'a major management problem'. So bad, in fact, that it valued Ercros at zero in arriving at a valuation of Dollars 2.9bn for the Torras assets.</p>

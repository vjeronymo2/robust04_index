			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4. Parking garage.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Authority P uses all the proceeds of its bond issue to construct a parking garage containing more than 100 spaces located in the central business district of a large urban area. At least 90 percent of the spaces in the garage will be available to the general public on an hourly, daily, or monthly first-come, first-served basis and the Authority reasonably expects that at least 25 of the spaces will be leased by unrelated individuals. Individual lessees of monthly parking spaces may renew their spaces at then current fair market value rates. The bonds do not satisfy the private business use test because at least 90 percent of the use of the parking garage is general public use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 5. Road improvements for stadium.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> H, a political subdivision, issues its bonds to finance construction of a new exit and entrance ramp from an existing highway onto an adjacent street that will front a newly constructed stadium. The existing highway and street are part of systems that are used on the same basis by members of the general public. The stadium is owned by nongovernmental persons. Although the improvements to the highway and the local street are available to the general public and not limited to persons going to the stadium, more than 75 percent of the use of the ramp will be used in connection with the stadium (that is, employees, spectators, and other users of the stadium). Thus, these improvements are functionally and integrally related to the stadium. Under these facts, however, the ramp qualifies as an insubstantial system improvement and, therefore, the proceeds of H's bonds are not used for a private business use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 6. Airport runway.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Airport Authority I, a political subdivision, issues its bonds and uses all of the proceeds to finance construction of a runway at a new city-owned airport. The runway will be available for take-off and landing by any operator of an aircraft desiring to use the airport. It is reasonably expected that more than 25 percent of the use of the runway (that is, direct use of the runway) will be by private air carriers (both charter airlines and commercial airlines) in connection with their use of the airport terminals leased by those carriers. Use of the runways by the private carriers is not on the same basis as the general public because their lease of property that is functionally and integrally related to the runways (the terminals) results in significant economic benefits from runway use that are not available to other users. The use by these private air carriers is not general public use, and the proceeds of I's bonds are used for a private business use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 7. Airport parking lot.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The facts are the same as in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 6,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> except that several months after the issuance of the bonds to finance the construction of the runway, I issues bonds all of the proceeds of which are used to construct a parking lot at the airport. The parking lot will be used entirely by employees of the airport, employees of the airlines and other businesses that are private business users of the airport terminal, and persons traveling by airplane that depart from the airport. The use of the parking lot by the airlines and other private business users of the airport terminal is not treated as general public use for the same reasons as in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Example 8. Federal use of prisons.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Authority P uses all of the proceeds of its bonds to construct a prison. P contracts with a federal agency F to house federal prisoners on a space-available, first-come, first-served basis, pursuant to which the federal agency will be charged approximately the same amount for each prisoner as other governmental persons that enter into similar transfer agreements. It is reasonably expected that other governmental units will enter into similar agreements. P may terminate the contract on 90 days notice. it is reasonably expected that during the term of the contract, federal prisoners will constitute more than 10 percent of the prisoners at the prison. The bonds satisfy the private business use test because F and any governmental persons using the prison under similar agreements are not members of the general public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 9. Business insurance fund.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Authority deposits all of the proceeds of its bonds in its hazardous business insurance fund and invests all of those proceeds in tax-exempt bonds. The hazardous business insurance fund provides liability insurance to more than 100 operators of different types of hazardous businesses within the meaning of State law. Each of the insured persons is required under State law to obtain this type of insurance as a condition to their trade or business operations. Each participant receives insurance for a term of one year, and it is expected that the fund will be available for renewals. The participants are not treated as members of the general public because the term of the insurance conveys preferential benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 10. Port road.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Highway Authority W uses all $200 million of the proceeds of its bonds to construct a 25-mile road to connect an industrial port owned by Corporation C with existing roads owned and operated by W that are all located within City T. Other than the port, the nearest residential or commercial development to the new road is 12 miles away. Although there may be additional development in the area surrounding the new road, there is no reasonable expectation that the development will occur within the 3-year period following the issuance of the bonds. W does not reasonably expect that more than 25 percent of the use of the new road will be by persons other than employees and other persons doing business with C. The bonds satisfy the private business use test because the road, although available for use by the general public, will have insubstantial general public use and will not qualify as an insubstantial system improvement because the cost of the project is not insubstantial. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

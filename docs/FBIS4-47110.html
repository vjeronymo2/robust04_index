			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Resolution adopted at Second All-Russian CPRF Conference on </F> 24 April 1994: "The Communist Party of the Russian Federation on  the Road to Accord for Russia's Sake"]    [Text] The Communist Party of the Russian Federation [CPRF]  is setting its tactical objectives for the near future in the  knowledge that the general program goals, which can only be  attained in their entirety after the laboring public takes  power, must be accompanied by a specific plan of action, with  consideration for the party's opposition status, and by efforts  to influence the development of sociopolitical events, with a  view to its actual capabilities.  <H5>  New Phase of Crisis </H5>   Russian society has entered a phase of systemic  crisis:    This means, first of all, that the crisis has had a  seriously  injurious effect on all the main spheres of societal life, not  just a few, and that it cannot be surmounted in any of these  spheres without recovery in the others. Second, regressive  changes have almost reached the critical point at which they  could become irreversible and could deprive Russia of its  chances for social and economic progress for a protracted period  of indefinite length.    The continued recession in the economy has led to the  dramatic deterioration of the structure of productive  forces. The first production units to be ruined will not be  the underdeveloped ones, but the most progressive,  high-technology fields of production--precisely those that would  secure the breakthrough to qualitatively new frontiers of  economic development. Our domestic scientific and technical  potential is being destroyed. There has been a disastrous  decrease in the output of the very products on which the  restoration of production with reliance on our own resources  would depend (machines, equipment, and building materials). In  this way, the prospects for intensive and  extensive economic growth have been undermined to a  dangerous extent.    In the sphere of production relations the abrupt  stratification of society along property lines has not created  any new productive classes. This has not been the "classic"  (according to Marx) form of capitalization of societal  relations, but a process of rapid social degradation and the  growth of parasitical declassed strata on all levels, which  subsist on redistribution and conspicuous consumption instead of  the productive accumulation of societal resources. All of this  has had a particularly injurious effect on our youth. We have  witnessed the rapid reduction of labor reserves and loss  of labor skills. Soon there will be no resources for  economic restoration and no one capable of accomplishing it.    The policies of the government are based on a balancing act  between the rising rates of inflation and unemployment. The  balance is maintained primarily by using up all the resources  accumulated in earlier decades with no thought of replacing  them. As the last of these resources are being depleted, the  monetarist methods of economic development are losing even the  semblance of effectiveness.    The cultural and moral potential of society has suffered a  dangerous decline. Russia is the target of unprecedented  ideological aggression for the purpose of suppressing its  cultural and historical features and the continuity of its  development. Their obliteration and replacement with the  mediocre Western brand of "common human" values could lead to  the loss of the instinct of national-state self-preservation and  the will to resist the economic, political, and spiritual  colonization threatening our country.    The coup d'etat the president and his administration carried  out in September and October created a  constitutional-legal vacuum in political affairs. The  real power in the country has been usurped by bureaucratic  executive structures that are free of any effective societal  control and are increasingly likely to rely on violence or  threats of violence. This has been accompanied by the  increasingly confident efforts of organized crime to serve as  the "regulator" of economic and political affairs. These two  structures are undergoing an intense merger, installing the  machinery of a criminal-bureaucratic dictatorship.    This has put every aspect of public safety in  danger: the personal safety of citizens and their property, the  social protection of the laboring public, the technological  safety of production, and the economic and military security of  the country. All of this is constantly diminishing the  state-political unity and integrity of the Russian  Federation.  <H5>  Alternatives </H5>   The experience of recent years has proved unequivocally that  emergence from systemic crisis by means of the  capitalization of the country is impossible. Even if the  processes of establishing "authentic" capitalist production  relations and a civilian society of the bourgeois type are going  on, they are incomparably slower than the related processes that  are destroying the material and spiritual foundations of society  and state. Their clearest reflection is in the subversion  of the bases of civic peace in society.    Today the country is already in a state of torpid civil war,  interspersed with outbursts of increasingly savage brutality  against the people. These destructive processes are resulting in  the gradual disappearance of the actual bases for the  maintenance of civic peace in society.    In connection with this, the possible course of future  events  is becoming increasingly ominous. The most alarming possibility  is the danger that the escalated tension created by the social  degradation and impoverishment of society will turn into an  uncontrollable anarchic rebellion by declassed elements, in a  "war against all" for the remainder of our society's resources.    Communists must be prepared for any turn of events, and if a  particular turn of events cannot be prevented, it will be our  party's duty to give the spontaneous mass movement the most  organized structure possible and direct it into the channels of  conscious class struggle by the laboring public for its vested  interests. We do believe, however, that a civil war, regardless  of how just it may be, will be a tragedy for the country and the  people. There can be no victors in this kind of war under  present conditions. That is why the Communist Party is  certain that the preservation of civic peace and its  consolidation by means of a transition to the socialist pattern  of development are essential conditions for the avoidance of a  national-state disaster. That is our alternative, and it is  completely in the interests of the vast majority of people.    With a view to this and to its own actual capabilities as an  opposition force, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation  has set three strategic objectives:    1. The achievement of civic peace as the main condition  for emergence from the systemic crisis and for the transition to  socialist development.    2. The creation of a broad coalition of leftist,  centrist, patriotic, and national-democratic forces capable of  neutralizing the "civil war party" and then accomplishing its  political, economic, and moral isolation.    3. The assumption of power by the coalition as a result  of an election victory or by other peaceful and nonviolent  means. The organizational and ideological-theoretical  preparation of the party for work following the victory of the  coalition of national-democratic forces.    The successful attainment of these general  democratic objectives and the existence of strong  government by the people and social stability will create the  necessary prerequisites for a peaceful and civilized struggle by  the communists for their less immediate policy goals.  <H5>  The Road to Civic Peace </H5>   The Communist Party of the Russian Federation defines the  state of civic peace as a set of social conditions and political  procedures agreed upon by various social forces for the  resolution of their differences exclusively by peaceful and  nonviolent means. Civic peace does not mean universal harmony  and the absence of conflict in society. The struggle between  different tendencies is natural and inevitable, and there will  always be winners and losers in this struggle, but it must not  lead to the destruction of the state and its economy, social  sphere, and spiritual foundation.    Civic peace is not achieved by the mere signing of a formal  declaration of some kind. It must be based not on declarations,  but on a group of real and perceptible moves directed  primarily at the elimination of concrete sources of civic  confrontation. Today these sources, the main "risk factors," are  the abrupt stratification of society along property lines,  accompanied by uncontrollable recession and inflationary  processes; violation of the socioeconomic rights of the working  public; lack of balance between branches of government; the  growth of corruption and crime and the diminution of public  security and personal safety; spiritual impoverishment and  destruction of the traditional cultural environment; regional  and ethnic separatism; dismemberment of historical Russia as a  result of the collapse of the USSR and the transformation of the  Russian nationality into a divided people.    The most complex group of problems exists in the sphere of  political relations. The political regime that was  installed during the coup d'etat is distinguished by a severe  crisis of legality, monopolization of power by presidential and  executive structures, and deprivation of all other participants  in the political process of any opportunity to influence the  affairs of state.    Elimination of this constant source of political  confrontation will require acknowledgement of the need for close  cooperation by various social forces to surmount the crisis and  establish the kind of interaction by the legislative, executive,  and judicial branches of government and by political parties,  trade unions, associations of producers of goods, and public  organizations that will secure not only a genuine balance and  stronger guarantees of the performance of their functions and  fulfillment of their mutual obligations but also a  considerable augmentation of responsibility for the state  of affairs in the country.    Today the executive branch of government is free of  responsibility because of the virtual lack of oversight, and the  legislative branch is free of responsibility because of its  total lack of power. Augmentation and redistribution of  responsibility will be impossible without redistribution  of powers among the branches of government and reinforcement of  their mutual democratic oversight. This will require the  following:    --elimination of the present separation of the chambers of  the Federal Assembly and the definition of the sphere of their  joint and equal jurisdiction, which will necessarily include  interrelations of the Federal Assembly with the executive branch;    --elimination of the dualism of the executive branch--the  dual subordination of ministries and departments to the chief of  state and the head of government. Establishment of the prime  minister's exclusive jurisdiction over their routine operations.  Clarification of the powers and functions of the president and  his administration in connection with this;    --a move to the principle of government accountability to  representative bodies, and legislative definition of the  government structure and staff by the Federal Assembly. The  assembly's approval of the government program defining its main  goals and the deadlines for their attainment, as well as the  composition of the government staff. The impermissibility of  intervention in the routine work of government on the approved  program, and the possibility of removal of the government by the  Federal Assembly in the event of departures from the program;    --exclusion of agencies in charge of state television and  radio broadcasting systems from the executive branch. Their  creation on an equal basis by parliament, the government, and  the judiciary with consideration for the opinions of political  parties, trade unions, and public organizations. Guarantee of  equal access to the media for representatives of all branches of  government, political parties, trade unions, and other public  organizations;    --restoration of the whole vertical structure of  representative bodies of government, extension of the  accountability of executive bodies to representative bodies to  all levels of public administration, and return of agencies of  local self-government to the system of governmental authority;    --strict delineation of spheres of jurisdiction of different  levels of governmental authority, consolidation of autonomy in  the exercise of their powers, and encouragement of their closer  interaction and cooperation;    --agreement that the highest priority of Russian policy is  reestablishment of the Union state on a new and voluntary basis,  and denunciation of the sections of the Belovezha accords  abrogating the Union Treaty;    --agreement on the need to bring constitutional laws into  conformity with the principles set forth above.    Another important prerequisite for the restoration of civic  peace is a change of socioeconomic policies. A  complete program of national economic recovery and emergence  from crisis can only be coordinated through the joint efforts of  all concerned parties within the confines of the political  procedures described above.    Several measures, however, will brook no delay. They include  the following:    --cessation of predatory privatization and verification of  the legality and economic expediency of all earlier  transactions, and verification of the legal origins of capital  invested in privatization projects;    --legislative guarantees of the priority rights of labor  collectives to own and use public property and to choose  specific forms of denationalization wherever it is economically  justified, and a ban on interference in the economic affairs of  enterprises owned by collectives or groups, particularly in the  agro-industrial complex;    --reimbursement of losses incurred by citizens and economic  organizations as a result of the "shock therapy" and the  planning of ways to resolve the nonpayments crisis, to pay all  back wages, and to make cost-of-living adjustments in savings  accounts--not by issuing more currency but by confiscating  illegally acquired capital;    --legislative guarantees of the socioeconomic rights of the  laboring public to labor, recreation, housing, education, health  care, and social security.    The main governmental-legal and cultural-moral prerequisites  for the preservation and consolidation of civic peace include  the following:    --a more intense struggle against corruption and crime and  against the merger of the bureaucracy with mafia capital, and  the closure of all channels for the theft of societal resources;    --protection of the spiritual and moral environment from the  forcibly instituted cult of vice, violence, and easy money;    --acknowledgement of the purpose and value of all periods of  Russian and Soviet history, and the impermissibility of any  mockery of the people's patriotic symbols, monuments, and  victories;    --renunciation of ideological revenge and all kinds of  prohibitions and discrimination against citizens adhering to  opposition views;    --the institution of all possible measures for the  prevention  of interethnic conflicts, return of refugees, and consolidation  of the friendship and fraternity of all nationalities in the  country;    --maximum effort to enhance the combat capabilities of the  army and its soldiers and veterans, and protection of the high  prestige of citizens discharging their patriotic military duty;    --restoration of our state's prestige in international  affairs and the exclusion of any incidents of betrayal and  neglect of our national interests by diplomatic and other  representatives.    Acceptance of this minimum agenda by all the main classes  and  social groups as the basis for civic peace will prevent  spontaneous social upheavals and keep the political, economic,  and ideological struggle within civilized boundaries.  <H5>  Prospects of Coalition for Civic Peace </H5>   During the struggle for civic peace and under the conditions  of this peace, the opposition will still be the opposition, and  the Communist Party will still be the Communist Party and will  have its own program for the rebirth of the fatherland.    In any discerning analysis of past experience, we have to  note that the opposition acquired its present form at some point  in the middle of 1992. The composition of the opposition forces  stabilized, and their political and mass nucleus acquired  distinct outlines. Sometimes, however, the opposition  tends to be too self-contained. Its meetings and rallies  and its press sometimes seem to perform a venting function,  serving as a means of psychological release instead of  mobilization.    Because of the decline of active public involvement, the  organizational nucleus of the opposition is obviously not strong  enough. The October defeat in 1993 served as evidence of this.  In this context, the pseudo-opposition has been able to  influence public thinking to a considerable extent with the  pseudo-patriotic demagoguery of individuals who were always too  cowardly to join the real struggle and can only discredit the  opposition movement with their behavior.    The opposition's next objectives are the attraction of  potential reserves, reinforcement of its social, material, and  organizational base, and augmentation of the opposition to  the scale of a national and democratic coalition for civic peace  and accord for Russia's sake.    The prospects of this coalition will depend on the success  in  accomplishing the following:    --encouragement of political movements from the centrist and  liberal spectrum to join, as well as trade unions and  associations of industrialists and entrepreneurs;    --delineation of the sphere of mutual consensus on issues  connected with the preservation of civic peace and defense of  the country's fundamental national-state interests without  slurring over differences of opinion in all other areas;    --coordination of the actions of various detachments of the  opposition after determining the special goals and functions of  each;    --consolidation of the political experience of parties, the  organizational potential of trade unions, and the financial  capabilities of industrialists and entrepreneurs for the  attainment of common goals by forming a shadow government and  choosing prestigious candidates for nomination in the  presidential election campaign.    We realize that the coalition's methods of achieving power  will depend on future events in the country.    Although the opposition advocates peaceful forms of  political  struggle, it cannot exclude the possibility of all types of  provocations by the ruling elite and reserves the right to  respond in appropriate ways to the kind of situation this would  create.    These are the steps the Communist Party of the Russian  Federation plans to take on the road to civic peace and accord.  It is ready to make its part of the journey and is hoping for  the understanding and support of all sensible and truly  patriotic and democratic forces concerned about the future of  our motherland.    This document was adopted at the Second All-Russian  CPRF Conference on 24 April 1994.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: HK stocks under pressure STOCKS WITH heavy exposure to Hong Kong suffered extremely heavy selling in a day of frantic activity generated by a significant shift in the trading position of Morgan Stanley, one of the leading US investment banks. Morgan Stanley, which was instrumental in driving Hong Kong stocks higher in the summer, yesterday cut its recommended international equity exposure to Hong Kong from 7 per cent to 5 per cent. Telecoms group Cable and Wireless, which generates much of its income from Hong Kong, was badly affected, the shares hitting a low of 470p before settling 17 off at 473p on turnover of 5.4m. C&amp;W's interim figures are due this morning, with profits forecast to come in around Pounds 500m, against Pounds 378m. Sentiment was further weakened by persistent and long running stories that the Chinese government's investment agency CITIC is poised to make a large placing in Hong Kong Telecom. C&amp;W has a 57 per cent stake in HK Telecom, while CITIC holds a 17 per cent shareholding. HSBC was also mauled, the shares sliding 18 to 734p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 12m. 'There was a flood of selling and it looks as if there is more to come,' said one trader.</p>

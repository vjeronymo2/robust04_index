			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Ready to go federal I HAD A week's holiday last week, so I did what I often do when I need to escape London's clammy clasp. I patted the Rover reassuringly, stowed my flannel and tennis racket in the boot, and headed for Calais. I was bent on using my holiday for one of the most rarified forms of travel possible: mindless travel, travel without maps or mission and almost without purpose, except to roam through countries that are more attractive, more prosperous, more cultured, better managed, better funded and in most ways better teed-up for the next millennium than stuffy little Britain. First I went to Epernay. Then I turned left: Clermont, Baden-Baden, Augsburg, Linz, Krems (in Austria, not far from the Czech border, as far east as I got), Bad Ischl, Salzburg, Frankfurt, Cologne, Antwerp, Brugge, Calais. Eight days and seven nights. 2,251 miles. Travelling mindlessly but with admiration and envy for so much of what I saw as I and the Rover traversed the heart of the apple strudel: the core of western Europe. According to a calculation I made while eating lunch in a small town in Germany, it could be argued that 93 per cent of the world's worth, the planet's purpose, is concentrated in western Europe. South America? Who needs it. North America? How callow. Africa? A lost cause. Asia? Trying hard, admittedly. Australasia? Addicted to sex and whimsy. If I was a Euro-enthusiast before I started my journey, I have become a Euro-fanatic. How I now abominate the Euro-septics. I believe they are rabid. If you ask me, Europe should move to outright federalism as swiftly as possible. I want one army, one navy, one air-force, one parliament, one queen, one president, one chief executive, one flag (very small), one currency, one set of taxes, one language, one summer sport and one winter sport, one main way of cooking estouffade a la provencale, one way of spelling Cologne, one BBC (but with dog-meat-and-gameshow channels permitted regionally), one Archbishop of Brugge, a permanent home for the Olympics (not in Greece), one set of motoring laws, one price of petrol, one opera (which is probably one too many), one school curriculum and one railway gauge. I am serious about this, because it struck me on my journey that this weary, wracked planet is on the lip of a great breakthrough. If western Europe goes federal, there is at least a sporting chance that the rest of the world will follow. It will want to join Europe. We shall have a world government. Also a world army, navy, air-force, queen, currency, flag, opera, etc. On my journey, I made a small discovery that helped convince me that Europe is ready to go federal. The French are not as bad as we think. In a back street in Epernay, I had a flat tyre. I know nothing about such things, but was immediately approached by two Frenchmen. Before I could say Delors], they had changed the wheel for me. They offered me coffee. They looked shocked when I fiddled with money. Their generosity and helpfulness were instantaneous and unqualified. Like you, I have long been speechless at the French talent for getting up the nose. But they are visibly mending their ways. The borders are open anyway. You can drive from Calais to Krems without anyone looking at your passport. In eight days and 2,251 miles, the only person who examined my passport was a government snoop at Dover, when I recrossed the Channel. We had a sharp exchange of words. 'You look surprised to be asked to show your passport,' said this moron. ''Surprised' doesn't quite encapsulate it,' I said. 'Look at it my way. I am a European. I have just crossed from France. They didn't ask to see my passport. Neither did the Germans, the Belgians, nor the Austrians. I have neither left nor entered Europe. I stand for one world, one currency, one queen, one language and a permanent home for the Olympics (not Greece). I am now entering a fringe region - a place of tattiness and snooty accents, of rudeness and suspicion.' The officer's retort was couched in dialect. 'On yer bike,' he snarled.</p>

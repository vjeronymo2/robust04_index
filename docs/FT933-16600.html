			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: HunterPrint shares fall 17p as talks end SHARES IN HunterPrint yesterday fell 17p to 50p after the specialist printer announced that talks with a possible bidder had ended. The Corby-based company, which ousted Sir Ian MacGregor, its former chairman, in August and pushed through its second refinancing package in two years in December, was forced to reveal that it had been contacted by an unidentified potential bidder after a sharp rise in its share price in early May. The board, however, yesterday issued a brief statement saying that 'the talks resulting from these contacts had been inconclusive and have consequently been terminated'. Last year HunterPrint reported Pounds 12.2m of losses on turnover of Pounds 52.2m. However, in the six months to end-March, the group managed a turnround to profitability following the refinancing with pre-tax profits of Pounds 330,000 on sales of Pounds 26.6m. The complex December refinancing package, including a Pounds 20m placing and offer, was put together by Mr Jeff Samson, chairman, and Mr Tony Caplin, chief executive. It raised a net Pounds 18.3m and was mainly designed to reduce lease obligations on printing machinery at the Corby printing plant. New investors, including lessors, picked up 47.1 per cent of the 40m shares issued and as a result of the refinancing, Ferag, a Swiss company which supplied binding machinery to the Corby factory, became HunterPrint's largest shareholder with 6.9m shares, equivalent to an 11.9 per cent stake.</p>

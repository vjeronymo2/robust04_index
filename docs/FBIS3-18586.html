When Polish Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk visited  Paris last Thursday [3 March], the three states agreed to  organize a joint exercise between chiefs of staff followed by  ground maneuvers by army units from each country.    Reliable sources say that these could take place next  autumn,  in all likelihood in Mourmelon [France]. The Polish Army will  place one unit -- probably a company -- at the disposal of the  French-German brigade and the Eurocorps. The principle has been  agreed on, even if, as a matter of procedure, the other members  of the Eurocorps (in particular Spain and Belgium) have yet to  be consulted.    These decisions were announced at the end of a working  dinner  -- the first of its kind -- at the Hotel de Brienne [Defense  Ministry] last Thursday evening and attended by [Defense  Ministers] Francois Leotard, Volker Ruehe, and Piotr  Kolodziejczyk. During that meeting, an assessment was also made  of the military cooperation between France and Poland over the  past three years. [passage omitted]</p>

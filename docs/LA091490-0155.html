			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: LOOKWEST TURNS A FEW HEADS  </P> <P> The Fashion Group of Los Angeles hopes to call attention to local talent when  it showcases nine areas of L.A. design in one grand-scale fund-raising gala,  "LookWest '91," Sept. 24. Honorees for the $75-per-ticket affair include such  international trend-setters as David Hockney, restaurateur Wolfgang Puck and  wife Barbara Lazaroff, architect Jon Jerde, graphic designer April Greiman,  advertising mogul Jay Chiat, fashion photographer Philip Dixon, and a mystery  honoree in the field of entertainment. Expect to see the clothing designs of a  record number of L.A. talents -- close to 150 -- in a mega-fashion show  previewing spring '91. Proceeds will benefit the Rudi Gernreich scholarship  fund. For details, call (818) 985-5477.  </P> <P> PROTECTIVE COLORING: Listen received an update on Mary Rimdzius, who escaped  from Kuwait after she dyed her California blond locks a deep shade of Bedouin  brunette with India ink and a dark brown tint, slipped into long robes and  crossed the border. Rimdzius, who is staying in Long Beach with her daughter,  was anxious to get back to her blond roots. After six hours of retinting and  highlighting at Bezzetti's Master Colorists in Beverly Hills, Rimdzius' tresses  were restored free of charge.  </P> <P> WHO ARE THOSE MASKED PEOPLE?: Grace Jones, Barbara Carrera, Janet Leigh, Cicely  Tyson and Ozzy Osbourne were the odd fellows behind the facial masks recently  at the Georgette Klinger Salon on Rodeo Drive. They all dropped in to try  Klinger's new treatment, Line Solution Facial.  </P> <P> TAILORED FILMMAKING: Giorgio Armani and Martin Scorsese will close the Venice  Film Festival Sept. 15 with "Made in Milan," the lastest Armani/Scorsese  collaboration. The 26-minute documentary is about Armani and his fashion  business. The film was written by Jay Cocks, former film critic for Time  magazine, and filmed by cinematographer Nestor Almendros. Armani does the  narration. "Made in Milan" will be released in the United States at the end of  October.  </P> <P> A BUSH IN THE BIZ: If you think buying clothes is sheer material expression,  you haven't purchased anything with the Karitas label in it. The collection is  a project of the Karitas Foundation, a nonprofit organization that benefits  children. And the force behind it is one of President George Bush's  daughters-in-law, Sharon Bush. (She's married to Bush's son Neil.) She's  coordinating efforts to raise money for homeless and abused children through  the sale of clothing manufactured for the label by Bull Frog and Gund, among  others. Look for the Karitas label at Nordstrom, Sears and J.C. Penney stores.  </P> <P> HOT ROCK WEAR: We haven't seen the clothes yet, but we like the name: Red  Rocker Hyper-Active Wear. The man behind the catchy label is Sammy Hagar, lead  singer of the heavy-metal group, Van Halen. His "loose, fun, casual" clothing  for men (cloned from his own stage wardrobe) will be introduced Sept. 18-20 at  the Action Sports Retailer Convention in San Diego. If all goes as planned, the  "moderately priced" Red Rocker line will be in stores by mid-November.  </P> <P> MODELING MATILDA: Olivia Newton-John and Pat Farrar, co-owners of 13 Koala Blue  boutiques (the other 45 are licensed), will come out of the fashion closet this  fall to appear in ads and catalogues for the company. This is the first time in  the five-year history of the Van Nuys-based concern that the duo has gone  visual with their line. Gloria Teague, chief executive for Koala Blue, says  Newton-John and Farrar, both in their early 40s, "should be very effective,  because they're our customer."  </P> <P> POLO AND AUTOS: Ralph Lauren came up with another winner recently, only this  was one he didn't design. His 1938 Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic (a car) took the  Best of Show Award at the 40th Annual Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (a car  show). Knowing Lauren's penchant for infusing Americana into his clothing line,  Listen won't be the least bit surprised if the Ralph Lauren models are wearing  long travel dusters and goggles on the runways next season. DO NOT CROSS: David  Quirk, an enterprising fashion design student at Iowa State University, has  developed a line of clothing made entirely of orange plastic police barricade  tape. Quirk says the folks in Aimes, Iowa, don't appreciate the nuances of his  designs and mistake him for a traffic cop whenever he wears his special suit.  So he sent photos of his creations to some of his favorite people -- Arsenio  Hall, novelist/screenwriter Hanif Kureishi and MTV's Downtown Julie Brown to  name a few -- hoping they would understand his sartorial vision. But it may  even be too much for the hipsters. Arsenio Hall's wardrobe person liked the  all-plastic-tape suit, but the star passed on it. Julie Brown's only response  was an autographed picture of herself.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LAID-BACK LOOK;  </P> <P> MOTOR COACH TOUR TAKES THE HIGH-LIFE ROAD TO CHRISTMAS LIGHT SHOWS  </P> <P> Frustrated sightseers looking for the season's most colorful displays of  holiday lights often end up seeing red.  </P> <P> That's the color of the unbroken string of taillights ahead of them as carloads  of spectators creep along gridlocked residential streets renamed Candy Cane  Lane and Elf Avenue.  </P> <P> But not everybody fumes over the traffic jams that have become holiday  traditions of sorts in scattered neighborhoods around Los Angeles. The lucky  ones reach for crackers and cheese and another glass of fume.  </P> <P> They are the ones who see the season in style from luxurious motor coaches that  travel to decorated pockets of Pasadena, Altadena, San Marino and Woodland  Hills.  </P> <P> For the past two weeks, a Newport Beach bus operator has offered the holiday  tours to anyone willing to spend $550 to treat friends to a ride up and down  streets lined with rows of plywood little drummer boys and cutout Santa  Clauses.  </P> <P> Those aboard Ralph Simpson's $375,000 kitchen- and bar-equipped Pacific  Motorcoach bus Tuesday night for a day-after-Christmas peek at Christmas came  away with a new appreciation for mass transit. And the neighborhoods' brightly  lit decorations weren't bad, either.  </P> <P> "Look, there's a dark house," joked passenger Bruce Ludwig of Hancock Park.  "Let's stop there and throw Brie at them. They're ruining our night."  </P> <P> Hancock Park residents Joyce and Lockwood Haight invited Ludwig and 13 other  friends along for the tour. At first, the idea left a few of the guests cold.  </P> <P> "I wasn't excited at first about spending three hours on a bus," said Patricia  Frandson of Van Nuys. "When I think of buses, I think of the thing I rode to  school every day when I was growing up in Toledo."  </P> <P> But the passengers ended up impressed by what they saw. "I thought they were  nuts at first to invite us to a bus . . . but I'm glad I came," said Bill Baird  of Hancock Park.  </P> <P> "Did I have to twist any arms? Only 14," Joyce Haight said with a laugh as  driver David Foesch maneuvered the 40-foot bus down Medford Road, a street in  the Upper Hastings Ranch area of Pasadena fully decorated with a Christmas  angel theme. The 44-block neighborhood has been decorated with street-by-street  themes for 34 years.  </P> <P> "If anybody asks, we'll tell them we're Japanese tourists and we're going to  buy their neighborhood," shouted Ludwig from the rear of the bus. "They change  their decoration theme every year here. Why don't we buy last year's stuff to  use in our neighborhood next year?"  </P> <P> The passengers frequently rushed to the windows when the bus passed by  particularly spectacular lights during the tour. The route included the  10,000-bulb-decorated Bailian House in Pasadena, half a mile of lighted cedar  trees along Santa Rosa Avenue and similarly lighted St. Albans Road in San  Marino.  </P> <P> One homeowner in the Upper Hastings Ranch neighborhood, dressed as Santa Claus,  flagged down the luxury coach in front of his house and offered candy to the  passengers. Other residents waved from their front porches.  </P> <P> Wade Wright, coordinator of this year's Christmas decorations for the Upper  Hastings Ranch Assn., said about 900 of his community's 1,100 houses are lit  this month. He said most of his neighbors welcome tour buses -- except for a  few living on Denair Street.  </P> <P> "They've objected to the bus fumes," Wright said Wednesday. "Maybe next year  we'll make that a walking area."  </P> <P> Bus riders are likely to consider that a step in the wrong direction.  </P></p>

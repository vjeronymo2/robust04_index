			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, June 26, IRNA -- Afghan Vice-President  Molawi Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi has called for mediation of  foreign peace missions to end the current infighting in  Afghanistan.    According to a press release, the leader of Afghanistan's  Harakat-e Enqelab-e Eslami [Islamic Revolution Movement of  Afghanistan], also warned that if the current situation  prevailed, the country would never see peace and tranquility  again and would eventually fall into the hands of colonialism.    He accused foreign powers of involvement in the Afghan  crisis  and of pushing the country towards destruction in order to  achieve their own goals.    The Afghan vice president urged leaders of all Afghan  mujahideen groups to sit at the negotiating table and resolve  their dispute through peaceful means.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] San Pedro Sula -- Strong slogans against the Liberal  government, critical of its maladministration, were chanted  during the worker-peasant International Labor Day parade in this  city. Throughout the 15 blocks covered by the parade and at the  rally held at Francisco Morazan Civic Plaza next to the local  stadium, workers and peasants directed their attacks against  Carlos Roberto Reina's government, which they compared to that  of Rafael Leonardo Callejas, for its actions that have  impoverished the working class.    Slogans such as this were chanted during the parade: "Red  Rooster [logo of the Liberal Party] you have shit on the  people," "Blues and Reds, you have shit on the people," "There  is no peace; beans cost more," "What good is the moral  revolution if we are still on a pile of shit," "We are  civilists, not militarists," "The Armed Forces are the people's  armed branch, and the people are in power, ha ha ha," "The  damned revolution brought us devaluation," "We must sell the  F-5's so we can eat."    Before the 1 May rally began, demonstrators burned two  coffins, one symbolizing mandatory military service, the other,  the U.S. Government. They also burned effigies of the current  president and the traditional party.    Contrary to other opinions, the worker and peasant leaders  who led the parade, including Mario Quintanilla, Mauro Gonzalez,  Victor Artiles, Efrain Aguilar, and Israel Salinas, said the  goal of gathering 60,000 people was achieved. Although the  number was not confirmed, the truth is the march covered ten  blocks, causing the coordinators to be satisfied.    In their proposals, the workers described Carlos Roberto  Reina's Liberal government as weak and devoid of a political  definition as it approaches its first 100 days in power. The  workers said the regime of the moral revolution must establish  social justice for all Hondurans, which makes miserable the sad  life of the majority of fellow citizens. [sentence as published]    Therefore, the workers, peasants, and professional  associations demand the current government implement an  emergency food and agrarian reform plan that will guarantee  access to land for peasants, timely credit at low rates, and  technical and state assistance to allow them to commercialize  production. They also demanded the immediate suspension of the  existence of the "ill-called Law of Agricultural Modernization,"  while a new agrarian reform law, which is consistent with the  peasants' real situation and needs, is drafted.    They called for a general wage readjustment for all Honduran  workers because current wages do not satisfy the basic needs of  nourishment, health, education, housing, and recreation, in view  of the monetary devaluation and inflation caused by the former  government.    Concerning the health field, they said social security is a  right of the people. They demanded, therefore, the government  establish legal and financial mechanisms to expand the coverage  and quality of the Honduran social security service. They asked  for hospitals supplied with surgical equipment and the  establishment of public health clinics.    On public housing, it was regarded as a natural right of  human beings, not as merchandise for profit. They demanded an  immediate revision of the social housing fund law.    The workers demanded President Reina establish a labor  policy  that would guarantee the freedom and autonomy of social  organizations, labor unions, peasant, professional, indian,  environmental, and youth organizations. They also demanded  urgent approval of labor code reform, restructuring the Labor  Ministry, and the teachers statute.    Concerning privatizations, they said the Honduran state must  reserve for itself the direction and administration of strategic  utilities such as water, electricity, and telephone service,  provided it is for the betterment of its quality.    They demanded Congress urgently issue a decree on voluntary  military service, social, educational, humanist, and democratic,  with the respective rules in accordance with the law.    They demanded the electoral processes be totally trustworthy  and called for institutions to divest themselves of sectarian  political interests, which have made electoral functions corrupt.    On the crisis through which Hondurans live, the workers  called for a real and effective process of social concord to  unite the interests of all Hondurans, in search of a better  future that will not benefit the powerful minority.    Regarding ecological and environmental aspects, the Honduran  workers pronounced themselves against the installation of a  refinery in Trujillo and the felling of trees. They demanded  the government declare a one-year moratorium on lumber  exportations.    For the organized classes that marched, grouped in the  Regional Northwestern Coordinating Board of Peoples  Organizations [consisting of the United Federation of Honduran  Workers, the Confederation of Honduran Workers, and the  Coordinating Council of Honduran Peasant Organizations]  yesterday was a memorable date because in 1954, 40 years ago,  the first banana workers strike in El Progreso gave birth to the  Honduran worker movement.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras] </F>   [Text] The Council of State decree published in GRANMA  responds to Cuba's current and future needs. It is basically a  matter of having the necessary ministries and organizations and  eliminating superfluity from the administrative apparatus. What  was adopted, following an analysis of our realities, is what is  needed today in a sovereign decision that reflects the people's  political and technical will. What is sought with this measure,  in short, is to begin to shape a more agile, operational,  expedient, and skilled central state administration.    This measure has nothing to do with prevailing neoliberal  guidelines that ask Third World countries to cannibalize the  state to benefit an idyllically conceived and managed free  enterprise supposedly beyond class interests, multinationals,  and global hegemonic hubs of power.    The goal of the reorganization of our central administrative  bodies is to improve the operation of a state which responds to  the interests of the majority with a clear and specific  understanding of the interests it serves, which are none other  than those of the working people. It is obvious that if one of  the basic priorities of the specific reality we face is to  stimulate the economy and boost efficiency, the Ministries of  Economy and Planning and of Finances and Prices have to absorb  certain organizations and institutions linked to those priority  activities.    The same is happening with another priority activity of our  economy, tourism. If, because of current circumstances and in an  irreversible manner, we have to rely on foreign investment under  the conditions established by the Cuban state, including  economic cooperation, this endeavor has to have a dynamic and  efficient ministry to steer this effort.    In essence, the reorganization of the bodies of the state's  central administration is a measure which responds to the  demands of today's reality, the needs we have to face in the  special period in a world we cannot change and into which we  have to incorporate ourselves in terms of trade, finance, and  certain economic relations, without relinquishing our cardinal  principles and the altruistic goals of our sociopolitical  project.</p>

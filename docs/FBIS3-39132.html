			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Giorgio Napolitano, the speaker of the Chamber of  Deputies, has had talks in New York with UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali about the situation in Bosnia following the NATO  ultimatum.    Both men agreed that the NATO decision was a strong  incentive  to resume negotiations, thanks to the military and other  pressure being applied to the Serbs. Nevertheless, Napolitano  and Butrus-Ghali hoped that there would be no need for recourse  to military intervention, and that the political will to find a  solution to the conflict would prevail.    During his two-day visit to the United States, Napolitano  has  met congressmen and members of the Clinton administration as  well as members of the Italian community and those from the  world of economics and finance.</p>

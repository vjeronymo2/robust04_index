			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UK Insurance Consumers are unlikely to feel the new 2.5 per cent tax on insurance premiums which takes effect today. Premiums on some personal lines have fallen by between 5 per cent and 25 per cent since the cyclical peak last year. Given intensely competitive conditions in the industry, the pressure on rates is still downwards and insurance companies will have to absorb the tax themselves. Favourable claims experience in sectors such as theft, weather and fire insurance over the past 2 1/2 years will also put pressure on insurers to reduce rates further. Fears about the sustainability of insurers' income have been the chief factor behind the under-performance of the insurance sector during the past year. Poor conditions in equity and bond markets, from which insurers derive their investment income, have also soured sentiment. The sector is down nearly 20 per cent against the market and the yield premium has climbed to 40 per cent, close to a historic high point. Only tobacco has done worse, and that classification is dominated by BAT, a company with large insurance interests. This performance contrasts oddly with the record profits being generated this year. The insurers are reaping the dual benefits of favourable claims experience and rates which are still a long way above the last cyclical low-point. But investors are rightly worried about the very pace of recovery after three years of losses. The rebound is so pronounced that it has emphasised the accelerating cyclicality of the sector.</p>

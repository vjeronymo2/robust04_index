			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Tunnelling into history: Finance might still be in question, but under the ground and above it the Channel tunnel project is nearly ready THE TRACK is laid, the platforms are in place, overhead power lines have been erected and the first trains have been run between Britain and France. The Channel tunnel has arrived. Most of the construction and electrical installation has been completed apart from the odd bit of concreting, painting, landscaping and, most important, the fitting-out of the control towers. Commercial services are due to start next year. The terminals - at Coquelles in northern France and Folkestone in Kent  - look much as they will when public services are running, down to the foundations and overhead gantries for the toll booths. The main structures, including control towers and amenity and rest areas, have been completed. Facilities for customs and immigration have been provided, even though it is not clear what border controls will be required following the removal of trade barriers between European Community countries. The electricity sub-station at the Folkestone terminal which will provide power - using French electricity - is partially operating. Hiring and training of train crews and traffic controllers started last year. They will be expected to speak fluent English and French. Even toll-booth operators will attend a two-week language course. Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, has hired 1,100 of the 2,650 full-time staff it will need. There will be about the same numbers of British and French workers, with 5 per cent drawn from other nationalities. Some big problems remain. The system has to be tested thoroughly before Eurotunnel can receive an operating licence from a specially established Franco-British inter-governmental commission. Full-scale fire and evacuation tests will have to be conducted underground. Managers will have to be satisfied that control and signalling systems will work properly when connected up and that procedures for loading and unloading vehicles on shuttle waggons will not delay services. Passenger shuttles, each carrying up to 120 cars and 800 passengers, are expected to run every 15 minutes at peak times. The 50km journey will take about 35 minutes, at a maximum speed of 130kph. There will also be mainline passenger and freight trains run by BR and SNCF, the British and French rail networks, which could mean trains entering and leaving the tunnels every three minutes. Delivery of locomotives and wagons has already been delayed. A dispute over costs between Eurotunnel and Transmanche Link, the consortium of five British and five French construction companies building the Pounds 8bn-plus project, could delay further commissioning and testing. The opening date, originally planned for May, has been put back to December and Eurotunnel says it could open either side of Christmas. Some construction companies say it may not open until March or even later next year. No matter who wins in the row over costs, the system is built. Even in the unlikely event that Eurotunnel failed, somebody would take over the project. All that is needed is the passengers and the cars and history will have been made.</p>

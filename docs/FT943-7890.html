			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Scots loan rates to be guaranteed Scottish Enterprise, the official development body for Scotland, is to assist small businesses by guaranteeing the rate of interest on loans from banks. Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Office had to defeat strong Treasury opposition to secure approval for the scheme. It is particularly aimed at smaller companies employing up to 250 people in manufacturing and construction, but is also expected to apply to business services. It is expected that companies will receive a guarantee that the interest rate on loans over two to seven years will not increase by more than 1 percentage point. Scottish Enterprise, which has an annual budget of Pounds 450m, will make up the difference to the banks if interest rates on the affected loans exceed the cap. The scheme is expected to cover Pounds 100m worth of loans and the cost to Scottish Enterprise could be Pounds 5m a year. It has won the backing of the Scottish banks - Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland, TSB Bank Scotland and Clydesdale - and has support from business leaders and providers of professional services. Fears about the volatility of interest rates have proved a disincentive to small businesses to undertake new investment and expand. Scottish Enterprise is also acting to make good the shortage of equity finance for small businesses. It intends shortly to announce plans for the creation of venture-capital funds to invest money subscribed by banks, financial institutions and large Scottish companies. The new funds would be administered by Scottish Development Finance, an arm of Scottish Enterprise. It is targeting its investments at businesses needing less than Pounds 500,000.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: MEPC profits and assets fall 23.5% MEPC, the UK's second biggest property company, yesterday underlined the weakness of property markets across the world by announcing a 23.5 per cent decline in net assets per share from 608p to 465p in the year to September 30. Pre-tax profits fell by 23.5 per cent from Pounds 143.3m to Pounds 109.6m in the period, which Mr James Tuckey, managing director, described as 'a dreadful year for the property industry.' Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, said that there was 'precious little evidence of any improvement in our markets,' although he stressed the resilience of the group, which has three quarters of its UK income secured by leases running beyond the end of the century. Sir Christopher sharply criticised the government's attitude to the property industry concerning issues such as the levy of rates on empty buildings, the proposed register of contaminated land and leasehold enfranchisement. Taken together 'they further threaten the stability of the property market,' he said. The value of MEPC's properties fell by 12.5 per cent overall. The UK properties, which accounts for four-fifths of the portfolio, fell by 12.6 per cent, while those in Continental Europe, Australia and the US fell by 15 per cent, 15.7 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. MEPC said 1992 was a year of consolidation, in which it completed its development programme and reduced its worldwide vacancy rate from 19 per cent to 8 per cent. In particular, MEPC has found tenants for 60 per cent of Alban Gate, its flagship development in the City of London. Concern that Chemical Bank, the largest tenant in the building, might pull out of the development was lessened this week when it began talks with MEPC about eradicating the break clause which allows it to cancel its lease after one year. Although rental income increased by 4 per cent, pre-tax profits fell as a result of lower property trading profits and an increase in finance charges from Pounds 79.7m to Pounds 107.0m. Gearing increased to 82 per cent, despite investment sales of Pounds 127m. MEPC yesterday confirmed that it has sold a building in London's Finsbury Circus to DIFA, a German property fund, for about Pounds 73m. Earnings per share fell by 22.7 per cent from 31.3p to 24.2p. An unchanged final dividend of 14.75p net was proposed, making a total of 20p net for the year. See Lex and People</p>

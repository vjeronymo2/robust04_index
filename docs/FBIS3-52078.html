The official pointed out that the country's economy will be  sufficiently strong to bear this without major problems by 1996  when the effects of this cut will be felt in projects. He  explained that economic programs for 1994 and 1995 will not be  affected.    Orellana pointed out that the effects of the cut will  reportedly start to be felt in 1996, "but by then the country  will be nearly independent due to economic development and an  increase in funds sent to El Salvador by relatives living  abroad."    International aid "has been used to support infrastructure  reconstruction projects and repair damage caused by the  guerrillas during the recent conflict." Orellana pointed out  that funds sent by relatives to El Salvador are a reality of the  country's economy because they constitute aid sent by  Salvadorans working in the United States and this amount will  not decrease.</p>

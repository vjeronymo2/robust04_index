			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEZBOLLAH DENIES IT SEEKS SWAP;  </P> <P> STATEMENT DIMS HOPES FOR HOSTAGE DEAL WITH ISRAEL  </P> <P> The fundamentalist Hezbollah movement denied Saturday having any part in  tentative feelers for a prisoner exchange with Israel, throwing a chill on  faint prospects that the foreign hostages in Lebanon might be part of a deal.  </P> <P> In a message directed pointedly at Jerusalem, the statement again disavowed any  Hezbollah connection with the hostages or their Muslim extremist kidnapers and  said that Israel's abduction of Shiite clergyman Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid "has  ended all possibilities for an exchange."  </P> <P> "The Zionist entity (Israel) has to understand that it has made a mistake,"  said the statement delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut. It  specifically ruled out the release of three Israeli soldiers held captive in  Lebanon. It did, however, specify five Palestinians whom Hezbollah wants the  Israelis to free, along with Obeid and other Lebanese Shiites, without  suggesting a trade in return.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rejection Reaffirmed  </P> <P> Hezbollah had rejected an offer made Monday by the Israeli government to  exchange Obeid, two men kidnaped with him on July 28 and other Shiite prisoners  in Israeli hands for the three Israeli soldiers and the foreign hostages,  including eight Americans. Saturday's statement reaffirmed that rejection.  </P> <P> Initial Israeli reaction was extremely guarded. "This is a war of nerves,"  Eitan Haber, spokesman for Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, told The Times in  Jerusalem.  </P> <P> The message from Hezbollah (Party of God) appeared designed to deal the group  out of any prospective negotiations on the hostages, at least publicly.  </P> <P> "We affirm that Hezbollah has no direct or indirect links with the hostage  issue and with negotiations concerning it," the message said. "The matter  concerns only the kidnapers. Everyone knows that and knows how to get to them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Feverish Activity in Beirut  </P> <P> However, in two days of feverish activity in Beirut since the threatened  execution of American hostage Joseph J. Cicippio was suspended Thursday night,  diplomats kept knocking at Hezbollah's door. On Friday, U.N. Undersecretary  Marrack Goulding and Algerian officials met with Hezbollah's spiritual leader,  Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, in efforts to seek a resolution of the crisis  that has mounted steadily since last Monday, when another American hostage,  Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, was reported hanged by his radical Shiite  captors.  </P> <P> Confirmation of these contacts in Beirut came first in a midnight broadcast on  Algerian state radio, followed by published reports on the comments of Khaled  Hasnawi, Algeria's ambassador to Lebanon.  </P> <P> Hasnawi, the radio reported, had taken part in a series of talks involving all  hostages held in Lebanon, whether "Lebanese, Palestinians, Americans, Europeans  or Israelis." The Algerian envoy met with both Goulding and Fadlallah, whose  fundamentalist organization, according to intelligence reports, maintains ties  to the clandestine groups believed to be holding the foreign hostages. Reports  from Beirut said that Red Cross representatives were also involved in the round  of contacts.  </P> <P> Without further elaboration, the broadcast said: "Progress in this mediation  was accomplished Friday."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coincided With Iran Comments  </P> <P> The activity in Beirut coincided with the declaration in Tehran by Iranian  President Hashemi Rafsanjani that his government was prepared to play a role in  resolving the hostage crisis. "I tell the White House, the problem of Lebanon  has solutions," the newly inaugurated Iranian leader said at Friday prayers.  "The freeing of hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudent solutions."  </P> <P> In Washington, a cautious President Bush, commenting on Rafsanjani's remarks,  said: "I'm encouraged, but I don't want to get the hopes of the hostages' loved  ones up once again to have those hopes dashed. This is a brutal process."  </P> <P> In suspending the threatened execution of Cicippio, the Revolutionary Justice  Organization declared it was acting out of "respect of the intervention by some  states and sides that were asked by the United States to mediate." Iran, along  with Syria, the Soviet Union, Algeria and a number of other countries, was on  the list contacted by Washington officials in their efforts to spare Cicippio's  life.  </P> <P> In related developments Saturday:  </P> <P>  -- Goulding arrived in Damascus, the capital of Syria, which holds military  sway over two-thirds of Lebanon with an army estimated at 40,000 troops. "I  came here to explore what the United Nations might be able to do to help  promote a final solution to the hostage crisis," he told reporters.  </P> <P> An aide said the U.N. official plans to meet today with Syrian Foreign Minister  Farouk Shareh and the visiting Salim Hoss, who heads a Sunni Muslim Cabinet in  West Beirut, a rival government to the Christian Cabinet led by Maj. Gen.  Michel Aoun in East Beirut. Goulding met earlier with Aoun in the Lebanese  capital.  </P> <P> "There does seem to be a widespread feeling that this hostage problem has got  to be tackled fundamentally and this is the time to do it," Goulding said.  </P> <P> Goulding's original mission to Lebanon was to determine the fate of Higgins,  who was serving with a U.N. observer force there when he was kidnaped in  February, 1988.  </P> <P>  -- The Iranian government said it had refused to receive a note sent earlier  in the week from Washington authorities, according to the official Iranian news  agency. The report did not disclose the contents of the note, other than saying  that it was related to events in Lebanon, but it claimed the message concerned  matters "that had nothing to do with Iran."  </P> <P>  -- Father Khalil Abi Nader, a Maronite Christian priest dispatched by Pope  John Paul II, called on Hezbollah leader Fadlallah as part of a mission to  investigate the reported execution of Higgins. Bush had asked the Pope for  Vatican help in the hostage crisis.  </P> <P> Hopes for movement on the crisis were raised Friday when Rafsanjani declared  Iran's willingness to help resolve the issues, combining the offer with a  warning to Washington that its naval deployments in the region, which include  the dispatch of the carrier America to the Arabian Sea off the Iranian coast,  is aggravating the situation. Asked about Iran's role in resolving the crisis,  a Nicosia-based ambassador of one of the countries directly involved told The  Times: "I think he (Rafsanjani) is trying. I think he wants to be more flexible  and more moderate."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focus on Algerians  </P> <P> On Saturday, the focus turned to the Algerians, who were quietly but  principally instrumental in the 1981 release of the 52 U.S. Embassy hostages  held captive in Iran for 444 days. Ambassador Hasnawi, according to press  reports published Saturday, told reporters Friday in Beirut that "the hostage  issue has started to unfold."  </P> <P> Hasnawi said his government has established a team of Algerian political  officials and intelligence agents in the Lebanese capital "to contact the  parties which hold the hostages . . . all the hostages, especially the  Americans." He said that Bush had asked Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid to  intercede.  </P> <P> The claimed execution of Higgins and the death sentence against Cicippio, the  kidnapers said, were both designed to force the Israeli government to free  Obeid.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Great Efforts' Cited  </P> <P> Hasnawi said that he had met personally with Fadlallah and members of the  organization's ruling council, and credited the sheik with "great efforts" to  help forestall the execution of Cicippio.  </P> <P> "Following contacts begun (Thursday) with Hezbollah, in the form of pleading  and entreaties, and after we strongly condemned the abduction of Sheik Obeid,  we counseled patience and self-restraint and called for absention from dramatic  measures and decisions," the Algerian envoy said.  </P> <P> Had Cicippio been killed, he told reporters, "It would have led to a dangerous  reaction. America or Israel would have intervened militarily without anyone  knowing the full scope or nature of such an intervention." The result, he said,  would have been a "major explosion."  </P> <P> The Arab diplomat claimed that frantic diplomatic activity had succeeded in  "cooling off" the situation but warned that a binding solution would require a  broader approach: "We should distance ourselves from bargaining tactics -- a  hostage for a hostage, a hostage for sums of money. We should cure the causes  for hostage taking: the Palestinian question, Israeli kidnapings, attacks  against Lebanon."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Heavy Pressure on Syria  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the hostage crisis drew Syria into the diplomatic picture. It was  not clear what role the Damascus government might have played in easing  tensions, but the White House put heavy pressure on Syrian President Hafez  Assad to help find a solution.  </P> <P> Friday's editions of As Safir, a pro-Syrian Lebanese newspaper, suggested that  the crisis may have a spillover effect on U.S.-Syrian relations concerning the  long-running Lebanese civil war. Cicippio's reprieve, the newspaper reported,  "has flung the doors wide open to an American-Syrian dialogue on Lebanon."  </P> <P> Late Friday night and Saturday, the big guns opened up again in Beirut after  four days of relative quiet. Seven hours of exchanges between Syrian and  Christian artillerymen killed 21 and wounded more than 80, police reports said.  Thirteen people were killed when a Syrian heavy mortar round landed on a  shelter in the Christian sector.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PLAYERS IN CRISIS  </P> <P> Here are some of the new developments in the hostage situation:  </P> <P> ALGERIAThis North African country is now a key player in trying to defuse the  situation. Khaled Hasnawi, the ambassador to Lebanon, held a series of talks  involving all the hostages. Official Algiers Radio said, "Progress in this  mediation was accomplished." Hasnawi met with several people, including U.N.  Undersecretary Marrack Goulding and Hezbollah's spiritual leader, Sheik  Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah.  </P> <P> ISRAELRepeated its offer to swap prisoners with Shiite extremists after  receiving a statement from Hezbollah demanding freedom for five Palestinians,  in addition to Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid and his two associates.  </P> <P> IRANThe government said it refused to receive a note from the United States on  "events in Lebanon." The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted an  unnamed Foreign Ministry official as saying the message was delivered through a  third country and "since the content had nothing to do with Iran, the message  was not accepted."  </P> <P> LEBANONPro-Iranian Muslims paraded in the Shiite slums of south Beirut to  denounce the United States. At weekly prayers before the demonstration,  Hezbollah spiritual leader Fadlallah urged those holding the hostages not to  harm them. "Let's be better than they," he said, referring to the West. "Let's  be loftier. Let's be more humanitarian."  </P> <P> UNITED NATIONSUndersecretary Goulding, after meeting with Fadlallah and  Algerian officials, arrived in Damascus, Syria, which holds military sway over  two-thirds of Lebanon with an army estimated at 40,000 troops. "I came here to  explore what the United Nations might be able to do to help promote a final  solution to the hostage crisis," he told reporters. He planned to meet with  Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh, among others.  </P></p>

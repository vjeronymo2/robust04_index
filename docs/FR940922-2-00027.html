			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Program Description <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> NIST sponsors these grants to encourage basic, measurement-related research in U.S. colleges and universities and to foster contacts between NIST scientists and those researchers in the U.S. academic community who are actively engaged in such work. The Precision Measurement Grants are also intended to make it possible for workers in U.S. academic institutions to pursue new measurement ideas for which other sources of support may be difficult to find. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Matching Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Precision Management Grants Program does not involve the payment of any matching funds and does not directly affect any state or local government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Research Topics <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> There is considerable latitude in the kind of research projects that will be considered for support under the Precision Measurement Grants Program. The key requirement is that they are consistent with NIST's mission in the field of basic measurement science, for example: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Experimental and theoretical studies of fundamental physical phenomena to test the basic laws of physics or which may lead to improved or new fundamental measurement methods and standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The determination of important fundamental physical constants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The development of new standards for physical measurement of the highest possible precision and accuracy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, proposals for experimental research will be given preference over proposals for theoretical research because of the greater expense of experimental work. Proposals from workers at the assistant and associate professor level who have some record of accomplishment are especially encouraged in view of the comparative difficulty aspiring researchers have in obtaining funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Typical projects which have been funded through the NIST Precision Measurement Grants Program include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Measurement of Fundamental Constants Using Three-Level Resonances in Hydrogen,'' Carl E. Wieman, University of Michigan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Quantum Limited Measurement of a Harmonic Oscillator,'' William C. Oelfke, University of Central Florida. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Fine-Structure Constant Determination Using Precision Stark Spectroscopy,'' Michael G. Littman, Princeton University. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``E&ouml;tv&ouml;s Experiment-Cryogenic Version,'' D.F. Bartlett, University of Colorado. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``A Test of Local Lorentz Invariance Using Polarized 21Ne Nuclei,'' T.E. Chupp, Harvard University. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``A New Method to Search for an Electric dipole Moment of the Electron,'' L.R. Hunter, Amherst College. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``High Precision Timing of Millisecond Pulsars,'' D.R. Stinebring, Princeton University. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Precision Optical Spectroscopy of Positronium,'' S. Chu, Stanford University. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Quantum-Limited Cooling and Detection with Stored Ions,'' D.J. Heinzen, University of Texas/Austin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Eligibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Eligible applicants under the Precision Measurement Grants Program are limited to U.S. universities and colleges, professional institutes and associations, nonprofit organizations, and State and local governments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Selection Procedure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> To simplify the proposal writing and evaluation process, the following selection procedure will be used: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the basis of the abbreviated proposals, four to eight semifinalist candidates will be selected by the NIST Precision Measurement Grants Committee and the Outside Review Committee to submit full proposals. The same committees will evaluate the detailed proposals, and on the basis of their evaluation, the two grantees for fiscal year 1996 will be selected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Evaluation Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The criteria to be used in evaluating the abbreviated proposals and final proposals include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Importance of the proposed research to science_does it have the potential of answering some currently pressing questions or of opening up a whole new area of activity? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The relationship of the proposed research to measurement science_is there a possibility that it will lead to a new or improved fundamental measurement method, basic measurement unit, or physical standard? (Or to a better understanding of important but already existing measurement methods, measurement units, or physical standards?) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The feasibility of the research_is it likely that significant progress can be made in a three year time period with the funds and personnel available? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The past accomplishments of the applicant_is the quality of the research previously carried out by the prospective grantee such that there is a high probability that the proposed research will be successfully carried out? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each of these factors are given equal weight in the selection process. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Staff shares 'help attitude' A SIGNIFICANT increase in the number of employee share schemes over the past decade has helped improve workers' attitudes towards work, although they might not be working any harder, a report in today's Employment Gazette, the journal of the Department of Employment, says. Drawing on a survey jointly commissioned by the department, the Inland Revenue and the Treasury, the report says schemes are more common in the finance, banking, insurance and business services sectors. 'An important part of the explanation for this is that awareness of tax advantages and financial matters in general tends to be higher in these sectors,' says the report. Schemes, particularly Save As You Earn schemes, were also more prevalent in large quoted companies, the report adds. Employee involvement was the most important effect sought by companies that introduced share schemes.</p>

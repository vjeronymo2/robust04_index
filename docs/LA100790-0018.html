			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF: ;  </P> <P> ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> *** Robert Cray Band, "Midnight Stroll," Mercury. A stinging guitarist, a  smokin' vocalist, a true brown-eyed handsome man, young Cray revamps his band,  adds the semi-legendary Memphis Horns and checks in to the Cheatin' Place with  yet another solid album of nether soul noir blues. "The Forecast (Calls for  Pain)" and the title track -- with its inside aside about "Howlin' Wolf on the  radio" -- are the standout songs, but Cray's sinewy, Sam Cooke-in' vocals cut  through the now-familiar shadowy ambience like the light reflecting off a  freshly drawn knife.

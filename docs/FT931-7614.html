			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (7): Generating capacity glut - A look at Ontario's powerhouse ONTARIO HYDRO, the powerhouse of Ontario's industrial might, is taking a dramatic shift in direction to cope with zero demand growth. The utility, owned by the provincial government, has long been a North American technical leader and chief salesman for Canada's heavy-water nuclear reactors. But more recently it has had to withstand withering criticism from industry and consumers for steeply rising power rates. Heavy cost overruns and start-up problems at its CDollars 15bn 3,600MW Darlington nuclear plant near Toronto have raised questions about its technical competence and financial management. Ontario Hydro's planners over-estimated demand growth for the 1990s. They were caught on the wrong foot when the Bank of Canada warned in 1988 it was aiming for zero-inflation even at the risk of serious recession. The result is a glut of generating capacity expected to last through the year 2000, together with a 30 per cent three-year jump in electricity rates, caused partly by financing Darlington over a 14-year construction period without offsetting revenue. Since 1989, during the worst recession since the 1930s, Ontario has seen power demand shrink from a 5 per cent annual average increase to an actual contraction. Far from buying more power from Ontario Hydro, industrial consumers such as Falconbridge, the world's second biggest nickel producer, and Chrysler Canada, with proportionately more output in Canada than Ford or General Motors, want to build co-generation plants to fill their own needs at lower cost. 'Hydro's been an excellent supplier for our mine and mill, helping us to save energy, but it's done a terrible job on prices and we can generate the power ourselves at lower cost,' says Mr Warren Holmes, president of Falconbridge's Kidd Creek division. Industrial users complain that the steep rise in rates is making the recession worse and robbing Ontario of one of its key economic advantages: low-cost energy to compensate for higher labour, construction and borrowing costs, higher taxes and a cold climate. Hydro, with assets of nearly CDollars 50-bn, debt of about CDollars 36bn and total system capacity of 33,000MW, says that Darlington's technical problems are over and all four reactors should be operating fully by summer - four years late. Furthermore, moves to adapt operations to slow or zero load-growth are now being speeded up. Mr Maurice Strong, former business executive and organiser of the 1991 United Nations Earth Summit in Rio, took over as chairman late last year, just as the utility was caught in the eye of a political storm over its rates. Mr Strong admits Ontario Hydro is 'in crisis', but says it is moving swiftly to put its financial house in order. 'In a few years we could be looking back to 1992-93 as the key transition point.' The utility has scrapped its demand forecasts, cut capital spending and trimmed its manpower. It is working on an overall cost-cutting programme. Mr Strong promises that rate rises will be reined in to current inflation or less, and that ways will be found to ease the CDollars 3.5bn annual interest burden. A CDollars 3bn refurbishing of the Bruce A nuclear plant is being reviewed, and some fossil-fuelled capacity is being mothballed. A CDollars 13bn multi-year power purchase agreement with Manitoba Hydro has been cancelled - and with it a large Western hydro-electric project. The utility is trying to reduce its long-term uranium fuel costs. A discussion paper will soon open the issues of privatisation and supply monopoly to public debate. Britain's experience is being closely watched. But the present social-democratic Government says it is not ready to support privatisation. Private-sector co-generation projects, where surplus power would be sold to Ontario Hydro, have been frozen, while industry and municipal projects are considered. For the first nine months of 1993, Ontario Hydro's revenues were CDollars 5.59bn - up 7 per cent, mainly because of higher rates. Sales of electricity were stagnant. Operating costs rose modestly, but financing charges were sharply up. Final net profit was CDollars 209m against CDollars 121m. The utility borrowed heavily in domestic and international markets in 1992, partly for refinancing at lower rates. Net new borrowing was about CDollars 2bn (it will decline in 1993 to about CDollars 1.4bn). With Darlington on full stream, and existing coal and oil-fired and hydro capacity, the nuclear component would meet 60 per cent of present demand. Mr Allan Kupcis, the president, says that going ahead with 60 private power projects would only put upward pressure on rates, because of the heavy cost of closing equivalent Ontario Hydro capacity. 'We must hold the line on current rates, and urgently rethink our cost structure. I mean a major culture change. We're working frantically to change direction.' He says the utility is suffering from the legacy of Darlington and poor timing on investments in new plant. 'But surplus generating capacity, after providing the normal reserve, is about 2,000MW - quickly absorbed with new economic growth. I don't have any mega-projects in view.' Capital spending is now running at about CDollars 2.5bn a year. The focus is turning to refurbishing and upgrading the transmission and distribution system.</p>

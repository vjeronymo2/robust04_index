			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Economist is president of Slovakia Mr Michal Kovac, 62, an economist and former chairman of the Czechoslovak federal parliament, was elected president of Slovakia yesterday, ending some of the political uncertainty over the newly independent state's future. In an earlier round of voting last month, none of the candidates won the necessary three-fifths majority of the votes needed in the 150-seat Slovak parliament to elect a president. Mr Kovac, who was backed by the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), was the only candidate in this round of voting, and won comfortably with 106 votes. His election will come as a relief to Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak prime minister, following last month's inconclusive vote when another leading HZDS member failed to win after two days of voting. Those elections were followed by bitter recriminations within the ruling party, with threats of a split caused by a dispute between the prime minister and Mr Milan Knazko, foreign minister, who had urged MPs not to vote for the party's own candidate. Slovakia became independent on January 1 when the former Czechoslovak state was dissolved. Uncertainty about the country's future political and economic direction were exacerbated by rows over Mr Meciar's leadership, and caused a hasty end to the currency union with the Czech Republic earlier this month.</p>

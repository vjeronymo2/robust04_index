			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BERNSON ASKS L.A. TO HELP PAY FOR BRIDGE  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson on Wednesday proposed that the city  help finance construction of a bridge across Aliso Canyon with $2 million left  over from another bridge project.  </P> <P> The Aliso Canyon bridge is a key part of a proposal to develop 1,300 acres in  the Porter Ranch area of Chatsworth.  </P> <P> If the city approves the proposed 3,000 residences and 7.5 million square feet  of commercial space, Porter Ranch Development Co. could be required to pay much  of the cost of the bridge, which would allow completion of an unfinished 2-mile  stretch of Sesnon Boulevard. The bridge and street extension are expected to  cost $9.5 million.  </P> <P> "It's not a question of if it should be built, it's a question of when,"  Bernson said of the 700-foot-long bridge. Bernson's motion Wednesday was to  help fund the bridge with the $2-million surplus from a separate bridge  project. That bridge is being built to eliminate a jog in Nordhoff Street  between Tampa and Corbin avenues in Northridge.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sent to Committee  </P> <P> The motion was referred to the council's Public Works Committee for  consideration in the next several weeks. The council ordinarily abides by the  wishes of a member on projects in his or her district.  </P> <P> The developer's Porter Ranch plan cites an "urgent need" for the bridge but  does not specify how or whether the company, run by Beverly Hills builder  Nathan Shapell, would be required to pay for it.  </P> <P> If the development is approved, Shapell is "obviously going to fund part of the  cost of the bridge," said Joseph Lucas, San Fernando Valley district engineer  for the city's Bureau of Engineering. "There has been a lot of discussion and  nothing has been finalized" about how much the developer might have to pay, he  said.  </P> <P> At a February public hearing on the Porter Ranch plan, some residents  complained that the Aliso Canyon bridge would open their neighborhoods to  commuters trying to avoid the crowded Simi Valley Freeway.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Negotiable'  </P> <P> But Bernson said his support for the bridge is "not, in my opinion,  negotiable." No matter what sort of development is approved in Porter Ranch and  elsewhere in the north Valley, the bridge is a needed transportation  improvement, he said. It will also improve access for firefighters in an area  where 15 homes were destroyed and 25 damaged by a brush fire in December, he  said.  </P> <P> Bernson has not taken a formal stand on the entire $2-billion Porter Ranch  plan, the product of negotiations between the developer, city planners and a  citizens committee that Bernson appointed. But he said he will disclose his  position April 13 when the city Planning Commission holds a public hearing on  the plan.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, city planners recommended that the proposal be changed to  hold the developer to 1.5 million square feet of commercial space until the  state funds an extra lane in both directions on the Simi Valley Freeway.  </P></p>

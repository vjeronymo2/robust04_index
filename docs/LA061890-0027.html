			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE MET 'RING': A MIGHTY KITSCHY MINISERIES  </P> <P> Don't swallow all that hype. Television has suddenly invented neither the wheel  nor the "Ring."  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Opera broadcast of Richard Wagner's mighty, massive,  sprawling, swollen, poignant, exasperating, uplifting tetralogy, "Der Ring des  Nibelungen," which begins tonight on local PBS stations, is a milestone neither  for mankind nor for TV.  </P> <P> We have seen it all before. And we have seen it in a more compelling version.  </P> <P> A decade ago, PBS traveled to Bayreuth to document Patrice Chereau's  provocative, even revolutionary staging of the daunting cycle. This was a  modern production that actually took the drama seriously. Chereau cared and  dared to explore the sociopolitical implications of the epic as well as the  obvious mythological convolutions.  </P> <P> The Bayreuth "Ring" was filmed under studio conditions, not at actual stage  performances. It was shown in this country with weeks separating each  installment. Still, a hundred years after the premiere, it did offer home  viewers a vital demonstration of Wagner's unique prowess as composer and  dramatist.  </P> <P> The Met "Ring," though taped, can claim the dubious advantage of documenting  "live" performances. The Met "Ring" can claim the definite, domestically  unprecedented, advantage of presentation on four consecutive nights. Still, it  looks like a stylistic step into the dark operatic ages.  </P> <P> The production, staged by Otto Schenk and designed by Gunther  Schneider-Siemssen, is dull and lazy. It represents a fairy-tale trivialization  of the momentous plot. At best, it is picturesque and quaint. At worst it is  silly.  </P> <P> Forget the ageless, timeless discourse on greed, the corruption of power and  the redemption of love. Here is a naive charade in which overworked singers  must carry spears, sport funny helmets and endure caricature breastplates while  emitting lusty noises.  </P> <P> It is possible -- unlikely, but possible -- that a Spielberg or a Disney could  make the "Ring" magical for contemporary audiences on its own literal terms.  The magic here, alas, harks back to hoary cliches perpetuated by provincial  German opera houses in the 1920s.  </P> <P> Brian Large, the television director, unwittingly accentuates the negative with  close-ups that expose too much smoke, greasepaint and scenic fakery. Even  worse, he often trains his cameras at the wrong face or place at a crucial  moment. Adding verbal insult to visual injury, the clumsy English subtitles  occasionally distort intended meanings ("Wo weilst du, Wotan. . . ?").  </P> <P> If this 17-hour, four-night mini-series has a hero, it must be the Met  orchestra. The virtuoso ensemble dazzles consistently under James Levine's  knowing, sometimes ponderous, often majestic leadership.  </P> <P> The cast is patently uneven. Nevertheless, it adheres for the most part to the  best current standards.  </P> <P> James Morris is splendidly mellifluous if unincisive as Wotan. Hildegard  Behrens offers much emotional, little vocal force as Brunnhilde. Though he  fakes some top notes and runs out of steam near the end of the climactic love  duet, Siegfried Jerusalem introduces an extraordinarily intelligent, imposing  Siegfried, brilliantly offset by the Mime of Heinz Zednik (a Chereau alumnus).  </P> <P> The ever-heroic Jessye Norman plays an ungainly Sieglinde to the bear-like  Siegmund of Gary Lakes. Christa Ludwig, though past her prime, remains a  sympathetic Fricka. The lower depths are well staffed by Ekkehard Wlaschiha's  straightforward Alberich, Jan-Hendrik Rootering's sad and sonorous Fasolt,  Matti Salminen's fierce Fafner and Kurt Moll's formidable Hunding.  </P> <P> "Gotterdammering" was not available for advance screening. Performances seen at  Lincoln Center last year suggest, however, that the denouement will contain no  surprises.  </P> <P> This "Ring" is worth seeing, kitschy flaws and all. Any project of such  magnitude is worth seeing. Still, it remains a "Ring" better heard than seen.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMONSTRATIONS BY OPERATION RESCUE  </P> <P> At the ripe age of 50, I joined my first demonstration. I was one of the  counter-demonstrators, supporting Planned Parenthood, "defending" a clinic on  March 25 against the illegal blockade by the Operation Rescue zealots.  </P> <P> For me, the catalyst was quite simple. A small, driven minority, no matter how  sincere, is using illegal tactics to impose its religious views on a majority.  Further, their movement is controlled by men on an issue which primarily  affects women. One ayatollah is enough, and there is no place for another in  our midst.  </P> <P> As to "Paul" of Torrance (mentioned in the March 26 article), if he is so  intent in saving babies what does he do to help the abandoned ones, the abused  children, the homeless ones, the runaways and child prostitutes?  </P> <P> I will continue to support Planned Parenthood by available legal means to help  stop this insidious attack on the democratic process.  </P> <P> CHARLES VORSANGER  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Travel: An Italian secret to be shared - Alan Ponsford enjoys an unpolluted Mediterranean shoreline It was like coming home, except that we did not paint a wall or prune an orange tree or unstop a drain. But, driving down from Fiumicino airport, we felt the familiar wonder that we should be among the few foreigners who knew - had half lived in - the special corner of Lazio so beloved by Italians. In nine years we commuted along those 70 miles dozens of times. Passing Latina, we would watch the terrain changing. From there it distends, as flat and nearly as green as a snooker table, westwards to the beaches below Anzio, inland across the Appian Way to collide abruptly with the mountains, and south to where they drop into the sea at Terracina. This great plain was for centuries the putrid, mosquito-infested Pontine marshes. It was drained and invigorated by Mussolini in the 1930s to more lasting effect than his efforts with the trains. Soon we would look eagerly for the incongruous eruption that rears on the horizon, seemingly a rugged island, which in pre-historic times it was. Nowadays the coast, skewing east, embraces the craggy, 1,700-ft high saddle of Monte Sirceo, so that one flank is turned to the abundant sun. Falling to rocks and clear, clean water, this is one of the most beautiful, balmy and unpolluted shorelines of the Mediterranean. Scattered white houses peep out of verdant vegetation. Nearly all, including the one we still presume to call our house, are the second homes of Romans. The scene never changes, for this is a national park with strict controls. At one end, the mountain serves to shield the two-tiered town of San Felice Sirceo. The medieval walled part, astride a hill-top, is officially sign-posted as Centro Storico; locals never call it anything but the Paese. It commands the newer, sea-level district of La Cona, with its shopping centre, promenade, beaches, seafront hotels and man-made port. At the other end is the stylish hotel and villa complex of Punta Rossa, draped over the point of that name. We had always assumed it to be above our station. Now here we were spending Pounds 900 to rent one of several apartments - virtually a little house - at the foot of the hotel for two weeks. Perched a few feet above the sea, it had some pluses over our house. We could be snorkeling among shoals of small fish in moments. We were used to trekking down the garden path, amid lemon, orange and apricot trees, oleanders, hibiscus and masses of bougainvillaea, strolling along a lane and descending exactly 100 steps to gain a rock perch. At weekends, when exuberant youths arrived with radios, we were miffed that Italians should invade our territory. If the sea was petulant, an alternative was the La Cona beaches, most of which are kept pristine in season by concessionaires - at a price. We preferred to drive round the Circeo to the superb sands and dunes that stretch 15 miles north from abeam of Sabaudia. There development is restricted to a few beach houses and bars. At Punta Rossa we had another option - an adjacent sea-water pool, gouged into a vertical cliff festooned with greenery. We usually had it to ourselves. And that exemplified the dilemma of such elegant hotels in southern Italy. With two or three months of hot sun remaining, the ascending gardens, the guest rooms above, the elevated restaurant with magnificent views on three sides, were nearly deserted. For this was the beginning of September, the time called sereno, when August's excesses of heat and humidity have exploded in spectacular thunder storms, leaving the sea warm and generally placid. But the tide of visitors, virtually all Italian, which starts to rise in late July, streams out on the last Sunday of August. Only for a few more weekends will San Felice bulge. Ten years ago the cordial San Feliciani readily accepted us into their community as an Anglo-Saxon minority of two. We are still a bit of a novelty. For this is no Costa del Sol, or Provence, or even Tuscany. No expatriate parties here, no golf courses, hardly any private swimming pools. How smug we were. Occasionally stray fellow-countrymen would appear in Carletto, La Sona's small supermarket. Inglesi we would hiss from the sides of our mouths as we dodged behind the pasta shelves. Along the main street many friends would shake our hands when we returned from even a brief visit to Surrey. Like Claudio, in the Sant' Andrea cantina, who fills your five-litre damigiano from a cask for Pounds 3 as you sample his several varieties of wine. And Pita, always smiling, dispensing pasta all' uovo, filled and unfilled. On Friday evenings the street is in turmoil, double-parked Masseratis, Ferraris and Range Rovers with Roman number-plates disgorging big spenders in very dark glasses and shoulder-slung jackets. A place of somewhat grim fascist architecture, Sabaudia is in fact a lively place with smart shops and several restaurants worth the 15-minute drive from San Felice. La Pineta, for instance, does wonders with fresh mussels, clams and scampi. San Felice has adequate eating places, many combining a pizzeria with the restaurant. But our favourite outings for Sunday lunch are along the coast. We always feel euphoric eating seafood in the sunshine at an outside table on the quayside at Anzio, with a sweeping view of the harbour and fishermen selling their catches nearby. On the way back, digestion is much assisted by an espresso or an ice-cream in adjoining Nettuno, a good-looking town with handsome villas, a big marina and a highly-organised beach. Our other choice is La Campania on the beach at Terracina. Further on, Sperlonoa, an attractive combination of hill-top alleyways and golden sands, makes a good day-out. Indeed, so does Rome - preferably by rail. From Fossanova, a 25-minute drive inland from San Felice, trains to Rome take an hour, though it can be worth missing one to visit the 13th century abbey along the road from the station. A mere 90 minutes from Rome, San Felice will nevertheless continue to hide from foreigners. This is fine with us - but what a waste.</p>

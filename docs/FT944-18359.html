			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: J Sainsbury J Sainsbury's acquisition of a stake in Giant Food is consistent with the strategy of careful diversification away from UK food retailing which began nearly 20 years ago. By acquiring 50 per cent of the voting rights in the Washington-based Giant and just 16 per cent of its equity, Sainsbury has capped potential risks while paving the way to take full control in due course. Giant will make a good fit with Shaw's, the New England food retailer which became a full subsidiary in 1987. Combined, the two companies will have turnover of Dollars 6bn and a strong position in seven out of 10 of the US's most prosperous states. There is scope for geographical expansion and possible synergies on the buying front and systems development. The scope for rationalisation is however limited: at 4.8 per cent Giant's operating margins are lower than those Sainsbury achieves in the UK but are significantly better than Shaw's. The full benefits will only come when Sainsbury has full management control. The sooner this takes place, the better. It took five years for Shaw's to become a 100 per cent subsidiary. This delay arguably contributed to its poor earnings performance. In the short term, the deal will not contribute materially to earnings. Nor does it answer the big strategic question of how Sainsbury can maintain earnings growth when UK food retailing is stagnating. A really significant diversification will require Sainsbury to abandon its usual caution.</p>

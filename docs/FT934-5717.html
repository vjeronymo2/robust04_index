			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Abortive initiatives go back more than 20 years The history of the IRA's campaign against the British government is littered with abandoned initiatives and meetings between serving politicians and republican leaders. Discussions since the early 1970s have been veiled in secrecy because of the sensitivity of both the unionists and successive Irish governments. Lord Wilson, when leader of the Labour opposition, met IRA leaders in Dublin in 1971 and again the next year in England. The first meeting was described as an 'act of treachery' by Dr Garret FitzGerald, the then Irish president, and a 'waffling session' by Mr Joe Cahill, one of the IRA leaders present. The most direct formal talks between a government and republicans came in June 1972 when Lord Whitelaw, as secretary of state for Northern Ireland, held secret and abortive talks to try to arrange a ceasefire with a group of six republican leaders in London. The republicans, including Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president who had been interned in Long Kesh, and Mr Martin McGuinness, his deputy, were flown out of Belfast by the RAF and escorted in great secrecy to the Chelsea house of Mr Paul Channon, Whitelaw's junior minister. The IRA team, led by Mr Sean MacStiofain, the then Provisionals' chief-of-staff, demanded the right to national self-determination for the Irish people as a whole, a declaration by the government to withdraw troops within 2 1/2 years and an amnesty for political prisoners. Lord Whitelaw declared afterwards in his memoirs that the meeting was a 'non-event'. He wrote: 'The IRA leaders simply made impossible demands which I told them the British government would never concede. They were in fact still in a mood of defiance and determination to carry on until their absurd ultimatums were met.' Mr McGuinness admitted that his team had concluded they had not reached a position at that time where they could do 'serious business' with the British government. During 1974 and 1975, under the then Labour government, senior officials regularly met Sinn Fein leaders at Laneside, a large government-owned house to the east of Belfast. These meetings, authorised by Mr Merlyn Rees, then Northern Ireland secretary, helped establish local channels of communication with the IRA in Belfast, used to discuss arrangements for the ceasefire of 1975. Other, less formal contacts, have been established from time to time. Mr Douglas Hurd, now foreign secretary, was a frontbench spokesman on European affairs when he met Mr Adams and Mr Danny Morrison of Sinn Fein in Belfast in 1978. Mr Hurd stressed that he was acting as an individual. Informal and formal meetings alike have generally caused unease in the Irish republic. Dr Garret FitzGerald, the former Irish prime minister, said in his memoirs: 'The contacts that had taken place had had the effect merely of prolonging violence by deluding the IRA into believing that a British government would eventually negotiate a settlement with them.'</p>

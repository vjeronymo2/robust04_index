			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAMES SPELL AN END TO LAST WORD IN ART DECO  </P> <P> The Pan Pacific Auditorium had flirted with death for years -- death from fire,  death from neglect, death from bureaucratic indifference.  </P> <P> It was not always so.  </P> <P> From the day it opened on May 18, 1935, and for more than 35 years thereafter,  the Pan was one of the biggest gathering places in Los Angeles, and the last  word in Art Deco. Its western facade, 228 feet long with four upswept  fin-shaped towers, was a magnificent piece of Streamline Moderne that  epitomized a 1930s America enamored of flight, speed and dynamism.  </P> <P> Before the Music Center, the Sports Arena and the Convention Center ever  existed, it was the Pan that embraced in its cavernous hall the home and auto  shows, the ice hockey games, the Ice Capades and political rallies. The 28-acre  park included a theater, a bowling alley and an ice rink, the latter of which  prompted a neighbor to sue for damages from the constant rumbling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> From Stokowski to Elvis  </P> <P> In 1936, Leopold Stokowski conducted in its all-wood auditorium. Twenty-one  years later, Elvis Presley played the Pan just before he entered the Army, and  police reportedly warned him to keep his act clean.  </P> <P> In 1947, a dozen years after it was built at a cost of $125,000 to host a  Depression-era national housing show, the Pan's stockholders -- among them Gen.  James Doolittle, orchestra leader Kay Kyser and actors Walter Pidgeon, Dick  Powell and Joan Blondell -- sold it for $2.25 million to auto magnate E. L.  Cord, whose magnificent cars matched the Pan's sleek facade for aerodynamic  chic.  </P> <P> Ten thousand people showed up in 1945 for the broadcast of the radio program  "Queen for a Day"; only 6,000 could be seated. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower spoke  to more than 20,000 people at the Pan, a month before the 1952 election that  made him President.  </P> <P> For Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who saw the fire from his home four blocks  away, the blaze swept up pleasant memories. "I saw my first basketball game  here, the Harlem Globetrotters, my first indoor tennis match, my first ice  skating contest.  </P> <P> "There are probably several hundred thousand people in Los Angeles County who  grew up with this as the main indoor arena."  </P> <P> By 1972, a year after the Los Angeles Convention Center opened, the Pan was  closed, left behind as an outmoded shell. Behind the glorious facade was a  less-distinctive and less-than-salable 100,000 square feet of space.  </P> <P> </P> <P> On Historic Register  </P> <P> By 1978, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, which did  not seem to impress the vandals and drifters who hacked at it, painted it, set  it on fire once or twice. Around Los Angeles, around the country, the Pan was  more talked about than tended. Architectural historians lauded it, and managed  to hold off the wrecking ball, but in the end, the Pan was a place many people  talked about but few really did anything about it.  </P> <P> Endless proposals came and went. The Pan seemed perpetually on the brink of  being torn down, or perhaps just falling apart on its own. In 1981, its  operating owner, Los Angeles County, solicited proposals for the space. The one  they embraced would have made it a cultural and commercial center with  theaters, a hotel, boutiques, and restaurants -- including a kosher kitchen.  </P> <P> As late as last November, the Board of Supervisors was still trying to revive  it, voting this time to negotiate with a developer to put in an ice rink, and  theater.  </P> <P> Robert Winter, co-author with David Gebhard of "Architecture in Los Angeles,"  which praised it as "probably the city's most photographed and painted  monument," was in his office at Occidental College in Eagle Rock when he saw  the faraway smoke.  </P> <P> "What a disaster," he mourned when he learned the source. The Pan, he said, was  "incomparable. . . . Nobody took it seriously because it was just a plaster  facade, but it spoke of the '30s like nothing else I know."  </P></p>

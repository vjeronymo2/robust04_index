			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / The Property Market: Farmers' barren landscape - The long-term outlook for agricultural land values remain uncertain Have Agricultural land prices in the UK hit bottom? After three dismal years, some agents believe the land market is set for a tentative recovery. 'The feeling is that we are at a turning point,' says Mr Jim Ward, head of research at Savills, the chartered surveyors. Farm values have dropped by as much as 50 per cent in real terms since their 1980s peak but as the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says, 'there are signs that the recent decline in farm values is coming to an end, as lower interest rates relieve the burden on hard-pressed farmers.' Any recovery will be from a low base. Values are at their lowest for a decade and, in real terms, at their lowest for 30 years. But the decline has been far from steady: agricultural land has been a particularly volatile sector of the property market. In the 1970s, land values rose steeply as a result of a large increase in farm profitability, stemming from increased production yields and higher EC support for farm prices. Land values were forced up by greater demand for land from financial institutions, largely in the belief that property was a good hedge against inflation. But by the early 1980s, the EC's Common Agricultural Policy was producing food mountains - and a constant stream of criticism. Brussels instigated reforms in an effort to control production and curb costs, leading to progressive cuts in the prices of farm produce. The resulting constraints on farm income, coupled with lower inflation, sharply reduced potential investors' appetite for land. This decline in demand for land was briefly reversed in 1988, when land values shared in the general inflation of asset prices. Values were boosted by new investors who relished the prospect of life in the country. Prices paid for residential farms in the south and west of England rose by 40 per cent between 1987 and 1989. But once recession took hold in 1989, drying up the supply of new investment, prices began to nosedive. At first, this decline was reinforced by further pressure on farm incomes. But in 1991, there was a modest improvement in incomes; the Ministry of Agriculture calculates that in 1991 farm incomes rose by 1.1 per cent, a drastic revision of its earlier estimate that incomes had fallen by 14 per cent to their lowest level since 1945. Farmers' fortunes again improved last year. Poor weather, uncertainty about CAP reforms and the stalled talks on liberalising world trade under the Gatt Uruguay Round resulted in a mood of despondency among farmers. The gloom was, in part, ill-founded. Farmers' incomes rose by 23.6 per cent as a result of a devaluation of the 'green pound' - the currency used in EC farm trade - following the UK's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September and the subsequent easing of British interest rates. A lower interest burden transformed the profitability of many farms. But the respite may be temporary. The agricultural land market is still in the throes of immense uncertainty and change. The benefits from the devaluation will be eroded in the next few years as inflationary pressures on imports drive up costs. Longer term, there is concern about the level of subsidies to farmers. The set-aside scheme introduced last year by the EC (designed to take 1.5m acres of farmland out of production, an area slightly larger than Lincolnshire) involves large subsidies to compensate farmers. In the long term, some farmers are concerned about how long this official support can be sustained. The future of farming subsidies is a complex issue concerning EC policy, international trade negotiations and public finances. Any possibility of withdrawing support creates alarm in the farming lobby, which argues that falling prices could make farming uneconomic in some areas and lead to its abandonment over large parts of the country. 'Agriculture cannot be turned on and off like a tap,' says the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Once farming has been run down and farmland abandoned, it would be difficult to reverse the situation in the event of an upswing in demand.' But critics of the set-aside subsidy believe that falling land values would merely cause temporary hardship while the removal of subsidies could lead to less intensive and more environmentally-friendly farming. Cheaper land would reduce farmers' needs for such high returns, according to the Council for Protection of Rural England. Likewise, Friends of the Earth, the environmental lobby group, argues that the real problem is not a surplus of land but rather that land is farmed too intensively. Friends of the Earth is opposed to taking land out of production because of uncertainty about climatic change, the possibility of a national emergency, and the likelihood that intensive methods of production may be severely eroding topsoil and contaminating ground water. 'We do not believe we should be relaxing strategic reserve of land in the UK,' says Mr Robin Maynard, countryside campaigner for FoE. Conservationists are also concerned about the alternative uses to which land is put once taken out of production. They are fearful that allowing more development in the countryside would create a knock-on demand for new roads, housing and shops. But others believe that agricultural land can be put to better use. 'Are we right to agonise over every last acre of rural land when, after the CAP reform package is implemented, so much will lay idle?' asked Mr Christopher Jonas, president of RICS in a speech in the House of Lords in December. Mr Jonas criticised the 'almost pathological fear of development in the countryside. 'All evidence points to the fact that most of us would prefer to work in a more rural environment. With improved transport links and new technology, this is increasingly practicable,' he said. The trend is to permit more uses for agricultural land as businesses and people move to the countryside. This view won official support early last year when the government told local authorities that 'little weight need normally be given' to the loss of farm land of moderate or poor quality - which makes up two-thirds of Britain's agriculture land - when councils draw up their development blueprints. The government's attitude to development in the countryside shows that the value of agricultural land is not wholly dependent on the state of the agricultural industry. This, together with brighter prospects for farm profits over the next few years, might give some support to land values. But hopes of a revival are tentative. And looking ahead, there is immense uncertainty about the prospects for rural land values.</p>

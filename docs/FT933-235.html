			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Brussels outlines its South African policy THE European Commission yesterday outlined a 'rolling programme' for full normalisation of relations with South Africa, but warned that a new trade accord should not be signed until after democratic elections set for April 1994. The policy is a response to this month's agreement between the Pretoria government and the African National Congress on establishing a transitional executive council to pave the way to an end of white minority rule. The announcement in Brussels yesterday comes nine days before President F W de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the ANC, are due to come to Brussels to address the EC/African, Caribbean and Pacific Joint Assembly. Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela are expected to outline ideas on how to develop EC-South African trade links. These are likely to take place outside the Lome Convention, the trade deal between the EC and the 69 ACP countries. Michael Littlejohns adds from the UN in New York: Foreign ministers of the Organisation of African Unity last night approved the lifting of all economic sanctions against South Africa, except for the mandatory arms embargo, a voluntary ban on oil sales and nuclear-related trade.</p>

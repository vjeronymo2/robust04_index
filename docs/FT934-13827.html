			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Japanese-owned plants sell to China A JAPANESE-OWNED factory set up in the UK to serve the European market for ball bearings has won its first orders from the Far East because of the strength of the Japanese yen. The NSK Bearings plant at Peterlee, County Durham, set up in 1976, was one of the first inward investments in the north-east. Its Tokyo-based parent company has now switched orders from its Japanese factories to the UK. The Peterlee plant is to supply bearings for white goods industries in China and Indonesia. Mr David Smith, human resources director at Peterlee, said: 'We are naturally delighted to win these orders. The uncompetitive yen exchange rate meant our parent was going to have problems in profitably serving some Asian markets.' The order highlights the problems for Japanese manufacturers caused by currency factors, as well as high domestic costs, over the past two years. Many of them are considering exporting more of their output to overseas plants. Japanese manufacturers are also seeking to source components needed for their domestic production plants from overseas. Komatsu, the biggest Japanese construction equipment producer, recently announced that such purchases would increase for its Japanese plants, with suppliers to Komatsu UK being added to its procurement list for the first time. Komatsu also manufactures in the north-east, producing hydraulic excavators from a former Caterpillar plant at Birtley near Newcastle. NSK's Peterlee operation - four plants employing about 820 people - normally exports about 80 per cent of its bearings to continental Europe, with the rest sold in the UK. The recession in continental Europe has forced the company to reduce operating volumes. But the Asian orders have helped avert an extended Christmas break at Peterlee for the first time in two years. 'Peterlee was chosen to supply China and Indonesia because our quality is high enough to take the place of Japanese-manufactured ball bearings,' said Mr Smith. However he added that the UK company could not rely on the Asian business in the long term and Europe continued to be very depressed, dragged down mainly by the poor state of the German economy.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Letter: Future of the European Commission Sir, In the Brussels discussions about the future of political and monetary union, one important item has been left out: the future and effectiveness of the European Commission. The Commission seems to have few friends in high political places. It is therefore worth bearing in mind how vital an effective Commission is to the Community's well-being. The Commission is the only European institution which represents the interests of the Community as such, rather than those of the nation states. There are times when all states benefit from the assertion of this wider perspective. The Commission has played a crucial role in the remarkable progress we have made towards a single market. Further, we would not be as close as we are to agreement about monetary union if it had not been for the Delors Report and the efforts of M Delors himself. Whatever the nature of the new constitution which emerges from the inter-governmental conferences, the role of the Commission is likely to be more important than ever. There will be more majority voting in the Council, which enhances the Commission's role; there will be new fields in which the Commission will acquire the right to make proposals, a right which has been in part the basis of its influence. But if the Commission is to perform these enhanced duties effectively, it must function better than it does now. The number of commissioners is too large. I am told that on important issues a preliminary tour de table takes two-and-a-half hours. And there are doubts about the cohesion of the Commission as a body. In 1979 the Spierenburg Committee (of which I was the British member) was set up to review the working of the Commission. Two of its central recommendations were to reduce the number of commissioners and to split the duties of the presidency. We recommended that there should only be one commissioner per member state. There are now 17, two for each of the larger states. If and when Austria, probably Sweden, and possibly others join, the college will become unmanageable. We also recommended that, to relieve the burden on the presidency, there should be a deputy president. The president would be concerned with strategy and represent the Commission on important matters inside and outside the Community; the deputy president would be responsible for organising and co-ordinating the Commission's internal work. These recommendations are as relevant as ever. They should be revived as an important practical contribution to the future of the Community.

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 9 FOR THE '90S;  </P> <P> BE THEY 9 OR 89, INDIVIDUALS HARBOR STRONG IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS;  </P> <P> 2 MAJOR WORRIES  </P> <P> When Rosalind Wyman, 59, a community activist and former member of the Los  Angeles City Council, looks to the future, "two things come to mind that worry  me. One is the American educational system.  </P> <P> "I think we are falling down terribly, and I have great concern about the  future of the people who have to run this world," says Wyman, who has racked up  an impressive list of firsts in politics and public service.  </P> <P> At 22, and just out of USC, she was the first woman elected to the Los Angeles  City Council. She then became the first woman on the Coliseum Commission and  the first woman to be acting mayor.  </P> <P> In 1973, she was the first woman to chair a Democratic congressional  fund-raising dinner, and the first to raise more than $1 million at such an  event. In 1984, she became the first woman to head a major political party  convention when she became chairwoman and chief executive officer of the  Democratic National Convention in San Francisco.  </P> <P> "In the next decade," she says, "if we don't upgrade and realize that our  educational system is failing, how can we continue to be leaders in the world?  </P> <P> "That brings me to the second major concern: the environment we live in. It's a  most critical concern. The air, the water, the transportation: How do we make  those things better?  </P> <P> "If we don't make them better in the next 10 years, I think you'll find many  systems that we're used to living with will just break down and become  nonfunctional," Wyman says.  </P> <P> On the positive side, she adds, "one really good thing is that I'm going to be  a grandmother for the first time.  </P> <P> "Another good thing is that in the last year of this decade, the abortion issue  has awakened the consciousness of American women. I am hopeful that in the next  decade women will emerge as caring leaders of this country." BETTIJANE LEVINE  </P></p>

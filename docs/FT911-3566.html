			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE OPTIONS market was subdued yesterday as dealers waited for an announcement from the London Traded Options Market and the London International Financial Futures Exchange on the merger of the two markets. None was immediately forthcoming, but the market was alive with speculation about its future. Floor dealers were resigned to some upheaval in the depressed traded options market, but reports of the plan to move all equity options on to a screen-based system still caused surprise. Turnover remained depressed on the options market with total business just 24,467 contracts. Analysts reckon LTOM needs 30,000 contracts traded per day to break even. Shell July 550 call options were actively traded as the shares advanced following strong figures by US oil majors. A total of 2,201 options changed hands, equivalent to 2.2m shares. Marks and Spencer traded 1,547, mostly April 260 calls. Hanson was boosted by activity in May 220 puts. On the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract finished 21 points up at 2,527. But its premium to the spot index ended at just 21 points, against the 30 points brokers estimate is necessary to take account of futures dividend payments and financing cost.</p>

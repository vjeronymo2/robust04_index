			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> Farrell's Last Dance: Ballerina Suzanne Farrell, who made a triumphal return to  the stage in January, 1988, after a hip operation, will dance her last dance  with the New York City Ballet Nov. 26. The 44-year-old ballerina, who inspired  choreographer George Balanchine to create some of his greatest dances for her,  will perform in the Der Rosenkavalier section of "Vienna Waltzes," created by  Balanchine in 1977. Farrell, who joined the ballet company in 1961, announced  she would retire in 1986, but the company then said she would wait to see how  she felt after hip-replacement surgery. She has danced in three ballets since  then. "If my dancing has been able to express even a fraction of what Mr. B.  gave me, I will consider myself very fortunate indeed," Farrell said of  Balanchine. "My last bow will always be to him."

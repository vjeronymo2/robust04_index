			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S., SOVIETS OPEN TRADE TALKS  </P> <P> U.S.-Soviet talks on a new long-term grain pact began today with U.S. officials  saying several sessions are likely before a pact is forged, but that the talks  were infused with goodwill from the Malta summit.  </P> <P> "We didn't come with the expectation that we're going to reach agreement this  week," said Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Julius Katz, head U.S. negotiator.  "This is really an initiation of the process," he said.  </P> <P> The current grain trade pact, first signed in 1983 and extended a year ago  after nine months of fruitless negotiations, expires in December, 1990. Major  issues in those negotiations included minimum purchase levels and Soviet  eligibility for U.S. crop export subsidies.  </P></p>

Signing the memorandum for the Lao side was Himmakon  Manotham, deputy minister of communications, transport, posts,  and construction and head of the Lao negotiating team. The Thai  side was represented by Charat Phuachuai, deputy minister of  communications and head of the Thai delegation. The document  was signed in the presence of Bouathong Vonglokham, minister of  communications, transport, posts, and construction; Phouthong  Seng-akhom, deputy mayor of Vientiane Municipality;  representatives of other concerned ministries; chiefs, deputy  chiefs, and technical officials from the two ministries;  representatives of state and private enterprises; and a large  number of Lao and Thai reporters.

The two sides agreed to establish a warehouse for  transit goods in Vientiane under the joint supervision of the  LPDR Ministry of Communications, Transport, Posts, and  Construction and the Thai Express Transport Organization. The  two sides also agreed to recognize the validity of drivers  licenses issued by the two countries for driving in the border  provinces. Drivers travelling to areas outside the border  provinces will be required to have an international drivers  license.    The two sides will set up a joint committee to oversee the  future implementation of these regulations based on the  principles of solidarity, friendship, brotherliness, and mutual  benefit.</p>

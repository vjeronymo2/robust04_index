			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / US pledge on role in Europe's defence THE US yesterday assured Britain that its military commitment to Europe's defence would not be affected by disagreements with the European Community in the Gatt trade liberalisation talks. Both President George Bush in Washington and Vice-President Dan Quayle, who had talks in London yesterday with British leaders, stressed there was no connection between the issues. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said after dinner last night with Mr Quayle that they had discussed the 'absolutely imperative importance in making sure the round is completed and completed successfully and as speedily as possible'. The confusion about US policy arose out of remarks made by Mr Quayle in Munich last weekend, when he appeared to establish some kind of linkage between the Gatt talks and the US military presence in Europe. He later denied that had been his intention. In talks yesterday with Mr Douglas Hurd he left the British foreign secretary in no doubt about the strength of the US military commitment, but officials declined to say how large it would be. The US is widely believed to be planning to cut its troop strength to below 100,000. Foreign Affairs, Page 17</p>

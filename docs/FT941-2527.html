			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Bank of England offers variable-rate gilt issue: Bond aimed at banks and building societies The Bank of England is launching its first UK government bond with a variable rate coupon - rather than a fixed interest rate - in nearly 20 years. The Bank is keen to offer investors a wider range of financial instruments, and expects the new gilt to appeal primarily to banks and building societies which buy floating rate paper for short-term liquidity purposes. Money market funds are also expected to buy the paper. However, yesterday's announcement is seen as particularly opportunistic, given the recent bouts of nervousness in the world financial markets. The gilt-edged, European government and US Treasury bond markets have all seen sharp falls since February 4, when the US Federal Reserve hitched up short-term interest rates. The markets have been especially nervous about US inflation prospects and the possibility of further rises in US interest rates, and have experienced heavy selling by investors, particularly the US-based hedge funds. A few borrowers have responded to the uncertainty over interest rate movements this year by issuing floating rate notes, either in US dollars or sterling. Some gilt analysts pointed out that the Bank was hoping to take advantage of investor uncertainty about the direction of UK interest rates and the fact that some existing floating rate issues are expected to mature this year, creating a shortage of such notes. 'Some investors clearly think that UK interest rates may have bottomed out or be close to their lows, and that a floating rate bond would enable them to take advantage of a rising interest rate scenario,' said one analyst. The fact that the new gilt issue is targeted at banks and building societies may also help - indirectly - to iron out the sharp fluctuations in money market interest rates. Since the Bank changed its funding rule in March 1993, the banks have bought substantial amounts of gilts. However, the Bank is keen to encourage them to buy more gilts so that they build up large holdings of government paper which can be used as collateral in certain of the Bank's money market operations - known as repos - and which could help to smooth out the volatility in the commercial banks' overnight interest rate. The last time the Bank issued bonds with a variable interest rate, the exercise was not deemed a success. It sold three issues, of Pounds 400m each, in 1977 and 1979, which matured in 1981, 1982 and 1983. Investor demand was poor, and was not helped by the coupon-setting mechanism which was seen as too complicated. It was set retrospectively, based on an average for the UK Treasury bill rate over the previous six months. The new gilt issue will be sold at auction on March 30, and details of the amount, maturity and coupon will be announced by the Bank on Tuesday. The coupon is likely to be set using the London interbank rate, the common method of setting the coupon on floating rate sterling bonds. The Bank said earlier in the week that its auctions would be in the Pounds 2bn-Pounds 4bn range, but market participants suggested that the Bank is likely to err on the lower end of the range. The gilt market reacted positively to yesterday's announcement, recovering 3/4 of a point in the afternoon. However, dealers said this was partly in relief that the Bank was not issuing conventional bonds against an unfavourable market background. See Lex</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. ASKS NATO TO HELP FERRY TROOPS  </P> <P> The United States made an "urgent" appeal today to its NATO allies to help  ferry U.S. soldiers and equipment to the Persian Gulf region, officials said.  </P> <P> The pitch for help from North Atlantic Treaty Organization members in ferrying  troops to the gulf was made by NATO envoy William H. Taft IV at the Brussels  headquarters of the alliance, officials said.  </P> <P> European allies have already provided some troop-transport assistance, but the  new request centered on the need for passenger planes, said a U.S. official at  the NATO mission, speaking on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> There are about 230,000 American troops in the gulf region now; 200,000 more  are to arrive in coming weeks.  </P> <P> The U.N. Security Council will probably meet next week on a resolution allowing  force against Iraq, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said today.  </P> <P> "Soon, probably next week, the Security Council will consider a draft  resolution authorizing member states to use force to bring about the reversal  of the Iraqi aggression," he told reporters in London. It was the first  indication that enough support had been gathered to call the meeting before the  end of the month.  </P> <P> The urgency is due in large part to the fact that Yemen, which has tilted  toward Iraq in the past, takes over the rotating chairmanship of the Security  Council from the United States in December.  </P> <P> China and the Soviet Union were said today to be in favor of a political  solution to the gulf crisis, implying that they are not yet ready to back a  U.N. resolution on the use of force.  </P> <P> "Both sides stand for a political solution to the gulf crisis on the basis of  relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions," the official New China News Agency  said after talks between the two countries' foreign ministers.  </P> <P> Iraq, underscoring its readiness to fight to keep Kuwait, began calling up  battle-hardened military reservists today. It also lifted a curfew in the  conquered emirate, insisting "normal life" is resuming -- and implying that the  Kuwaiti resistance has been beaten down.  </P> <P> The latest Iraqi call-up, announced in a Defense Ministry communique broadcast  on Baghdad radio, involves reservists in their 30s, including battle-tested  veterans of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.  </P> <P> They apparently will be among 150,000 reservists and draftees that Iraq said  earlier this week will be sent to Kuwait, along with about 100,000 other  regular army troops.  </P> <P> Iraq's official news agency said it was canceling an overnight curfew in Kuwait  because the emirate is calmer now. The news agency, monitored in Nicosia,  Cyprus, said the move was meant to "confirm the return of normal life" to  Kuwait, which Iraq has declared to be an Iraqi province.  </P></p>

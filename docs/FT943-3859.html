			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / A test-flight towards prize on the horizon: Method of Lufthansa issue clears way for Deutsche Telekom Lufthansa, the German national airline, has striven hard over the past two years to cut costs, shed labour, streamline operations and move out of the red. It is against this background of a return to profitability that international investors are being wooed by banks to take up the shares offered in the airline's DM1bn (Pounds 400m) privatisation issue. But while the consortium of banks, led by Dresdner of Germany, are confident that Lufthansa's recovery story is a convincing one - the shares have doubled over the past year to more than DM200 - the implications of the issue go well beyond its likely acceptance by investors. They concern future privatisation issues, German companies' attitudes to new methods of promoting investor interest and the way in which big German banks are being forced to relax some of the cosy practices of which foreign banks have often complained. By international standards, the Lufthansa issue, with the price to be fixed on September 29, is relatively small. Thus at first sight, the scale of international attention focused on the imminent sale of the German government's shares in the airline may seem overdone. After all, the airline is already partly privatised - the government's stake is 51.4 per cent with other state bodies holding a further 5.5 per cent - so investors can readily buy shares in the market. Not all investors are persuaded that Lufthansa is as attractive as the banks say. The shares' sparkling performance has raised worries in some minds of buying at the top of the market. 'It will require a revision of earnings estimates to get investors interested,' said Mr John Legat, senior portfolio manager at GT Management in the UK. So why has the Bonn government placed so much importance on involving international investors in this transaction? And why are so many banks (28 in all) keen to participate in promoting and selling the issue? One reason is that there is a much bigger prize hovering temptingly over the horizon - the partial privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the state German telecommunications concern. The size of this issue could exceed DM10bn. If the Lufthansa issue is a success, it will bode well for the Telekom offering which will have to be organised on a much larger scale. For the first time in a German privatisation, the bookbuilding method is being used. Investors' bids are collected for the shares, thus helping to establish the most appropriate selling price. By matching demand and supply in the shares on offer, bankers hope to avoid excessive volatility when trading starts in the secondary market. Through bookbuilding, the banks aim to favour potential long-term investors over those likely to sell early. It is a transparent method which has already been used in Germany to varying degrees for issues such as Wella, the hair care company, Daimler-Benz, the motors and aerospace group, Dresdner Bank and Buderus, the engineering group. The DM600m sale of 25 per cent of the shares in Hanover Re, the German reinsurance company, will be the next German issue in which bookbuilding will be used. But other German companies - now more comfortable with the idea of having non-German shareholders - are also intrigued by this method of selecting high-quality investors, especially for issues with a foreign appeal. 'There has been a very positive echo from German corporations,' said one Frankfurt banker involved in the Lufthansa deal. 'German firms used to offer a 20 per cent discount (when raising capital). If they can get close to the market price of the shares, they can raise more cash.' In the share issue carried out abroad by Dresdner Bank this April, which raised DM1.1bn, bankers estimate bookbuilding meant a near 15 per cent gain over what would otherwise have been obtained. 'You can separate the wheat from the chaff,' said one. Because the emphasis is placed on the quality of the investors and shares are not simply allotted according to a bank's status or links with the issuing company, issuers clearly benefit. For the big German banks, this is quite a change. In the past, new share issues sometimes failed because banks were unable to place the shares they had been allocated (based on their underwriting quota) in firm hands. This meant shares were sold in the market, depressing the price after the issue. Bookbuilding is designed to avoid this; the lead bank funnels shares to those consortium banks who can call on the best long-term investors. 'The traditional German methods have outlived their time,' said a German banker. 'German companies have got to be much more capital market-aware and take account of shareholders' wishes. This is what bookbuilding is all about.' But much depends on the way it is carried out. Some bankers are critical of the 'ring-fencing' approach in which banks - apart from Dresdner and Deutsche Bank as lead manager and co-lead manager - are restricted to fixed geographical areas in placing the Lufthansa shares. Other German banks are irritated at being held to their home base. 'There should be no regional limitations with Deutsche Telekom,' said one banker. Also, some bankers dislike the fact that no global co-ordinator has yet been appointed for the Telekom issue, expected in 1996. Now that German banks are shedding their conservatism and have embraced bookbuilding, they are keen to see the job done properly.</p>

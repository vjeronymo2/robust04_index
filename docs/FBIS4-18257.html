			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas received Ambassador Robert  Lamb, U.S. special coordinator on Cyprus affairs, today.  Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur;  Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense Atay Ahmet Rasid;  Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozer Koray; presidential  advisers Necati Munir Ertegun and Ergun Olgun, and U.S.  Ambassador Richard Boucher attended the meeting, which lasted  for nearly an hour and a half and continued during a working  luncheon.    In a statement before the meeting, Ambassador Robert Lamb  said that the objective of his contacts was to ascertain the  views of the Turkish and Greek Cypriot sides on the package of  confidence-building measures [CBM's]. He stressed that he did  not intend to submit new proposals to the two sides. Describing  the CBM's as a very important opportunity for Cyprus, Lamb said  that the United States is determined to do what is necessary to  eliminate any possible difference of views between the two sides  on the CBM's.    Speaking after the meeting, President Denktas said:    [Begin Denktas recording] Mr. Lamb informed us of the  meeting  he held with Glavkos Kliridhis. Nothing has changed on the  Greek Cypriot side. The Greek Cypriots have not changed their  viewpoint. Our viewpoint is clear. We have discussed that.  With Good will, a way can be found to resolve the matter. I am  forced to reiterate that we cannot make any progress if the  Greek Cypriot side maintains the attitude that it is the  government and can say that it does not agree to this or that.  [end recording]    President Denktas replied to correspondents' questions as  follows:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr.  President,  the UN officials have damaged the CBM's with their interim  proposals. Furthermore, they have used pressure to force you  to agree to their proposals.    [Denktas] They are approaching both sides.    [Correspondent] Are they taking sides?    [Denktas] No, they say that they are trying to help the two  sides.    [Correspondent] Have they submitted new proposals?    [Denktas] No, but they tried to learn our viewpoint on  whether or not this or that can be changed. Naturally, the  changes called for depend on what the Kliridhis Administration  agrees or disagrees on.    [Second unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, you  disclosed yesterday that you are being forced to hold a  referendum. What conditions compel you to do so?    [Denktas] We shall wait to see the [UN secretary general's]  report. We shall wait to see what else will be done. If we say  something, it should not be taken to mean that we shall do it  the next day. We are trying to convey certain hints on where  the matter is going. We have to wait for the report. What will  the UN Security Council do later? Will it adopt a new  resolution? We shall wait to see all that.    [Correspondent] The report may be postponed?    [Denktas] Yes; I read a newspaper report on that, but we  have  no official information.    [Third unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, will the  developments on the CBM's depend on the Greek Cypriot approach?    [Denktas] The solution of the Cyprus problem depends on the  Greek Cypriot approach. Naturally, the ball will always be in  the Greek Cypriot court if they continue to say: We are the  legal Cyprus Government; things have to be done the way we want  them; we are justified in demanding everything; nothing happened  between 1963 and 1974; the Cyprus problem began in 1974; and  Greece and Cyprus can adopt joint decisions and cooperate on  this or that.    [Fourth unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, there was  a danger of a deadlock in the talks at the beginning of the  week. You said that the package had been pierced and that a  state of uncertainty existed.    [Denktas] They are trying to find a way.    [Correspondent] Have new proposals been submitted?    [Denktas] No, new proposals have not been submitted. They  are trying to establish whether the two sides can agree to alter  their positions on several basic issues and to what extent are  they prepared to do so. It is quite clear that there has been  no significant change in the positions of the two sides thus  far. Therefore, efforts will probably continue. [end recording]</p>

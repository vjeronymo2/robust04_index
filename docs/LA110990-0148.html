			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: EARTH MOVES, BUT NO TEAM COMES FORTH  </P> <P> The gold-plated spades dug into the earth, but they might as well have been  shoveling cash. One hundred million dollars for the construction and operation  of Anaheim Arena. They weren't just breaking ground Thursday, they were  breaking the bank.  </P> <P> Rest assured, this will be no white elephant. That's what the Anaheim Arena  planners, with no NBA or NHL franchise in tow or in sight, kept telling the  congregation at the corner of Douglass and Katella, where Thursday morning's  kickoff ceremonies were held.  </P> <P> No, the color scheme also includes beige and green.  </P> <P> Happy talk and gaudy promises made the rounds, along with plastic cups of  orange juice-and-champagne -- just as tasty, and just as disposable.  </P> <P> "We feel very confident that we'll have both hockey and basketball franchises  by the time we're ready to open," said Neil Papiano, project coordinator for  Ogden Corp., the financial heavy hitter in this operation. "We are currently in  intense discussions with existing teams in both sports."  </P> <P> "The teams are coming," proclaimed Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter. "The economics  are here, the standard of living. The economics are crying out for professional  hockey and basketball teams in Orange County."  </P> <P> "We're in an absolutely great market," said Anaheim City Manager Jim Ruth. "One  franchise will get us very close to breaking even. With two, we'll make money  from Day 1. The Ogden and Nederlander corporations wouldn't be putting up $100  million if they weren't optimistic."  </P> <P> Optimism and realism, though, live in different time zones, and getting there  from here won't be easy. The NBA has just completed its latest round of  expansion, having added four teams the previous two years. The Clippers are  apparently set on a long-term living arrangement with Los Angeles. And on the  risk scale, the idea of three NBA teams competing for the same Southland dollar  ranks right there with the Denver Nugget defense.  </P> <P> Hockey is a difficult proposition, too, what with the NHL's eye-popping  expansion fee of $50 million. Why, for the cost of two expansion teams, you  could buy another Anaheim Arena.  </P> <P> But an interesting presence at the arena groundbreaking was Bruce McNall, owner  of the Los Angeles Kings and member of the NHL's expansion board. McNall is the  Johnny Appleseed of West Coast hockey. Tired of the isolation in the California  hinterlands, McNall lobbied hard for the San Jose Sharks, who begin operation  next season. He'd also like another West Coast rival, preferably in San Diego,  but in a pinch, he could be talked into Anaheim.  </P> <P> "The game plan of the NHL is to add seven teams by the year 2000," McNall said.  "I'm in favor, definitely, to expand to the West Coast. This is a bit close to  home, but we have to take a look into it.  </P> <P> "The market is certainly there. I'm friendly with all the people at Ogden. I  think we can work out an agreement on the territorial rights."  </P> <P> Therein lies a major obstacle for Anaheim in its pursuit of the pro franchise,  be it hockey or basketball. As owner of the Kings, McNall could block any  proposed move into Anaheim. Likewise, Laker owner Jerry Buss could block a  similar move by the NBA.  </P> <P> Now, here's the catch.  </P> <P> Buss is an applicant for the San Diego/Orange County NHL entry. McNall would  like to add an NBA team to his collection.  </P> <P> They soon could be in position to scratch each other's back.  </P> <P> "We have a situation in the New York area where people are supporting three  teams -- the Nets, the Knicks and Philly," McNall said. "It's possible here,  too. I might personally look into it. It would depend on Jerry Buss granting  the territorial rights."  </P> <P> Right after, of course, McNall grants Buss the territorial rights.  </P> <P> "There are certain possibilities there," McNall said, grinning.  </P> <P> McNall still has doubts about the hockey end of the deal. He knows this is no  hockey hotbed. His Kings play to sellout crowds now, but it took an  extraordinary measure -- trading for Wayne Gretzky -- to get it done.  </P> <P> There's only one Gretzky.  </P> <P> Are there another 20,000 hockey fans out there?  </P> <P> "That's a question," McNall conceded. "I don't know for sure. Maybe it would  help with a rivalry situation. Would a rivalry help us attendance-wise once  Gretzky's gone?  </P> <P> "I still have to look into season-ticket applications, printouts, demographics  -- to see what kind of impact it would have on the L.A. market. Right now,  roughly 20 to 25% of our fans come from Orange County. That's some significant  support.  </P> <P> "Would we miss it? That's something I have to take a look at."  </P> <P> Some factors recently have moved in Anaheim's favor. The stiff $50-million fee  has scared off one prime expansion site, Milwaukee, and is currently shaking  some knees in Seattle. San Diego is having trouble putting together the land  deal for a new arena.  </P> <P> If blind zeal means anything, Anaheim could have a chance.  </P> <P> It had better hope so. According to Ruth, Anaheim Arena will need to schedule a  minimum of 162 dates per year to break even. With no hockey or basketball, how  many WWF cards can you book?  </P> <P> Anaheim Arena is expected to open in March of 1993. It is expected to be state  of the art, with lean architectural lines, a sleek arching entrance and plush  private suites.  </P> <P> Will it be all dressed up, with nothing to show?  </P></p>

During the recess this morning, 119 deputies of  the Socialist Party of Serbia again proposed Zoran Arandjelovic  as chairman of the republican parliament, while 30 Depos  [Democratic Movement of Serbia] deputies again proposed Gvozden  Rosic. Some deputies have expressed the view that this is a  stalemate situation. There is a possibility of neither of the  two candidates being elected, as was the case last night. The  Serbian Assembly is currently in recess. The session is  scheduled to resume at 1430.</p>

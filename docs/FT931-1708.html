			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bridon back in the black with Pounds 1.2m BRIDON, the maker of ropes and other engineered products, returned to profit in the year to December 31 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m compared to restated losses of Pounds 4.9m. Although turnover was down at Pounds 316m (Pounds 319.3m), reflecting recession in the UK and European markets, an elimination of rationalisation costs, which led to a Pounds 2.6m charge in 1991, saw operating profits rise from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 5.2m. Mr Brian Clayton, chief executive, said the company, which sells mainly to the construction, mining, fishing and offshore oil and gas industries, had seen an improvement in orders in the early months of 1993. He said the company was concentrating on developing its high-technology products with higher added-value, and was seeking to improve marketing of core products such as general purpose wire ropes. He said Bridon had this week confirmed a Pounds 6m contract with Norsk Hydro for a mooring system for a drilling platform in the Troll field in the Norwegian North Sea sector. He added, however, that the outlook remained patchy. Although the company was benefiting from the weaker pound, especially in the US, this was balanced by poor growth prospects in France and Germany and the continued negative effects on new contracts of the political scandal in Italy. Earnings per share were 1.9p (losses of 8.3p). The final dividend is 2.75p, holding the total at 4p.</p>

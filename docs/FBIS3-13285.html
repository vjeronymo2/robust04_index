He said houses continue to be stormed, arrests made, and  some  citizens denied employment at the orders of the security organs.  He added that passports are withheld and various forms of  harassment are practiced, and this radically conflicts with the  tenets of democracy.    In a statement to AL-SABIL, he said the security organs  claim  to have arrest warrants from the general prosecutor, but in fact  these organs have empty arrest warrant forms that do not contain  the names of the people carrying out the arrest, the person who  should be arrested, or even the general prosecutor. All this is  taking place at a time when King Husayn expresses eagerness to  maintain democracy and says democracy is an irrevocable option.    Dr. 'Uwaydah recalled that King Husayn recently said, in an  address to the House of Representatives, that he wants the  Jordanian and Arab citizens to feel that they are human beings.  Deputy 'Uwaydah asked: How can all these practices be  described?    Dr. 'Uwaydah witnessed the arrest and search of the house of  Engineer 'Abd-al-Majid Diyyah, secretary of the Islamic Action  Front's branch in Suwaylih. He said he saw with his eyes an  empty arrest warrant after he asked to read Diyyah's arrest  warrant. He said he saw a security man filling out the arrest  warrant.    Dr. 'Uwaydah said political parties and forces are not  immune  from the official organs' pursuit. He asked: What is the  meaning of seizing books and leaflets that belong to the Muslim  Brotherhood taken from Diyyah's house?    He added that if a citizen is brought to account for having  a  book that is available in the market and that is approved by the  publication authorities, and if that book deals with a group  that is officially licensed, then what liberties are left?</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Ofwat calls for higher rebates HOUSEHOLDS should receive higher compensation for poor service from water companies, Ofwat, the water industry's economic watchdog, told the government yesterday, Bronwen Maddox writes. Ofwat said that customers had made only limited use of the compensation rules introduced in September 1989 when the 10 water authorities of England and Wales were privatised. Ofwat now recommends that the compensation rate should double to Pounds 10 if the water company fails to: Keep service appointments. Give written notice the day before any planned interruptions lasting more than four hours. Install a meter requested by a customer within 15 working days. Repair leaks or bursts in strategic mains within 48 hours (not 72 hours as now). Restore supply after unplanned interruptions within 24 hours.</p>

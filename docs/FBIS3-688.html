There has hardly been a break in the delicate  negotiations, except over the Christmas holiday period, and  UNITA's foreign affairs spokesman Jorge Valentim has told  reporters in Lusaka that they are almost exhausted, as Joy  Mwinga reports in this telex from Lusaka.    Jorge Valentim said the pace of discussion at the  UN-brokered  talks was so fast that there was a danger that the two sides  would end up with what he called another bad agreement that was  incapable of resolving Angola's future crisis. He complained  that the two delegations were not being given time to consult  their leaders at home about the issues and he warned that UNITA  would not hasten the pace of talks just to accommodate the  agenda of the UN security Council. Mr. Valentim said that no  one had the right to force the two sides to work faster. The  Security Council is scheduled to meet next Tuesday to discuss  the Angolan crisis.    Considerable ground has been covered in the talks, with the  two sides last December agreeing in principle to a cease-fire.  This morning, they had resolved all but five, out of the 17  issues considered crucial if national reconciliation is to be  achieved, including the decentralization of government and  UNITA's participation in the economy. They have yet to agree on  UNITA's participation in government however, the most critical  item on the agenda. Last week, UNITA dismissed government  proposals on this front as a smooth joke.</p>

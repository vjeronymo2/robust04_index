			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date Newscast"] </F>   [Text] A group of Democrats in the U.S. House of  Representatives who observed the elections in El Salvador today  called for the retention of U.S. economic aid until anomalies in  the voters' registration lists are overcome.    Representatives from New York, Illinois, and California  reported in the United States that they witnessed the courage  and perseverance of Salvadorans, as well as widespread confusion  and irregularities in the elections. The observers' spokesman  said that the problems in electoral registries must be corrected  by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] so that the run-off  election, scheduled for 24 April, can be clean and credible. In  addition, the group asked that the United States link the  delivery of $55 million in economic aid to the correction of  errors detected in the electoral registries.    Such a request prompted diverse reactions among the  presidential candidates who headed Sunday's election results:  Armando Calderon Sol noted that the request lacks any basis.  Meanwhile, Ruben Zamora said that it was a normal reaction in  view of the expectations placed on the electoral process.    The discontent of certain U.S. legislators, who observed the  number of errors that marred Sunday's elections, became evident  today, when they asked that the economic aid to El Salvador be  retained until the anomalies in the electoral registry are  corrected.    The presidential candidates interpreted this petition  differently:    [Begin recording] [Zamora] Everyone was told that this was  the election of the century, and yet, 47 percent of the people  could not vote. Locally, this was frustrating to many people.  But, internationally, it was also disappointing for many people  and thus, they are reacting.    [Calderon Sol] I think that this lacks any basis. I do not  know the gentlemen who made this request, but when they hear  what the United Nations and the international community said, I  think they will change their minds completely. [end recording]    The two candidates met with TSE magistrates on Wednesday. At  the meeting they explained their points of view with regard to  Sunday's elections and their proposals for the correction of  irregularities to speed up the final count.    [Begin recording] [Zamora] There are problems that,  obviously, cannot be solved in one month, such as the  approximately 300,000 people without voter registration cards.  However, we can again begin a period to issue cards. But there  is also the problem of what to do so people can find their names  on the lists. [end recording]    [Calderon Sol] I think that we should be pleased that the  TSE  has taken the attitude of welcoming our help and to show a will  to overcome the problems. [end recording]    The candidates trust that the TSE will correct the mistakes  made on Sunday so that the run-off election can be carried out  normally. They also suggested that a new period to obtain  voters' registration cards be established.</p>

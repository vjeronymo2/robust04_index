			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] More than 20 warships of the Black Sea Fleet began  exercises as scheduled on Wednesday [26 January], a Fleet source  told INTERFAX. These are intended to coordinate operational  command at sea and on land and train the newly-arriving recruits.    More than 8,000 young sailors were recruited last autumn,  with 4,500 of them swearing allegiance to Ukraine.    However, the source does not link the current maneuvers to  Ukraine's command post exercises.</p>

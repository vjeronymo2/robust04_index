			<p>BFN     [Text] The U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets  conducted a war exercise for a Northward invasion and aerial  espionage.    According to military sources, on 6 May, the U.S.  imperialists dragged squadrons of fighter planes from its  overseas bases into the skies above South Korea and conducted  again a provocative aerial war exercise for a Northward invasion.    That day, the squadrons of fighter bombers and  pursuit-assault planes that moved out from U.S. bases in the  Pacific area to the skies above Yongwol, Pyongchang, Taejon, and  Yechon frantically waged a surprise attack exercise against  strategic targets in the Northern half of the Republic.    Mobilized to this war exercise were those airplane squadrons  from overseas bases and some 180 various fighter bombers,  assault planes, observation planes, and reconnaissance planes of  the U.S. occupation Air Force in South Korea and of the puppet  Air Force.    This frantic war exercise under the command of E-3 airborne  warning and control planes that flew from a base in Okinawa,  Japan was aimed at examining the practicality [hyonsilsong] of  cooperation among airplane squadrons from overseas bases, the  U.S. occupation Air Force in South Korea, and the puppet Air  Force; and examining their capability of making a surprise  attack for a Northward invasion.    On the same day, An RC-135 tactical reconnaissance plane  flew  from an overseas base into the skies above the area near the DMZ  and then carried out electronic reconnaissance on strategic  points in the northern half of the Republic while flying at a  high altitude for a long time.    At the same time, A P-3 off-the-shelf aircraft [panjamgi]  belonging to the Seventh U.S. Fleet flew into the skies above  the East Sea of South Korea and then ran wild in carrying out  espionage on our side's coastline and sea. A U-2 high-altitude  strategic reconnaissance plane madly photographed and carried  out electronic reconnaissance on areas in the Northern half of  the Republic while flying day and night in the skies above an  area near the Military Demarcation Line [MDL].    In the meantime, the South Korean puppets were frenzied in  firing bombs near the MDL in the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ], as  well as increasing armed troops there. On 6 May, the South  Korean puppets mobilized and deployed several tens of  large-caliber gun units in Kumsan-ri, Puju county, with their  barrels turned toward Songdong- ri, a western area of the front  line in front of us, and moved hundreds of rascals with heavy  arms [chungmujang aktangdul] forward from Hyon-ri, Imje county,  an eastern area of the front line, and deployed them in an area  adjacent to the DMZ.    On the same day, after occupying firing positions at  Chongja-ri in Paju county and Kangnae-ri in Yonchon county, the  puppet Army's large-caliber artillery units showed off a war  frenzy by firing tens of bombs at an area near the DMZ.    These war maneuvers are a grave challenge to detent and  peace  on the Korean peninsula.</p>

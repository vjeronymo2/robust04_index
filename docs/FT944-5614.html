			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: GrandMet details Pounds 280m charge - Directors seek to calm investors' fears of possible third pill 'We've really swallowed a pill two years running and I do not intend to swallow another,' Mr George Bull, Grand Metropolitan's chief executive, said yesterday, explaining the latest restructuring charge. He and other senior executives of the food and drinks group went to great lengths to reassure investors that there was not a third pill on the horizon. GrandMet announced a Pounds 175m charge in September 1993 to reorganise its US foods business and a Pounds 280m charge this autumn for its global drinks and European food businesses. 'We can't see a darned thing left' which warranted a third big charge, said Mr Dave Rickard, group controller. The door had been left open, however, for small items as they arose. Analysts remained cautious given the group's fondness for such accounting practices. Moreover, they were puzzled by the reason for the long shopping list of projects wrapped up in the latest charge and spelt out in detail for the first time yesterday. 'It looks like a lot of soft capital expenditure, which should have been paid for along the way,' one analyst said. Mr Bull said: 'We knew we had a number of very specific jobs to do, so we did a complete review world-wide.' The bulk of the charge, Pounds 143m, covers IDV, the drinks business. About 40 per cent of that represents asset writedowns and the rest a string of projects costing a few million pounds each to rationalise offices, plants and distribution in various countries, particularly in Europe. The European foods charge of Pounds 55m is split in three equal tranches for restructuring production, rationalising support services and closing some shops and sales offices of Haagen-Dazs, its ice cream business. Burger King, the fast-food restaurant chain, took a further Pounds 31m charge to, for example, move more of its headquarters staff in Miami out into the field. The balance consists of a plethora of small items, such as closing some shops in the Pearle opticians chain. Although the programme will cut costs and bring a better focus to the businesses, analysts remain concerned about the direction of the European food business. It is small, lacks strong brands, has struggled to transfer to Europe successful products from abroad and faces further investment in Haagen-Dazs. The best asset is a German company involved in canned ready meals and soups, which accounts for about one-third of European food sales. It has growth potential in eastern Europe. European sales of Haagen-Dazs grew by 35 per cent last year to Dollars 170m (Pounds 104m) but it is still unprofitable. Significant progress is needed to help justify expensive distribution. Management acknowledged yesterday that all but small European food acquisitions were unlikely and the division's recovery lay in cost cutting and organic growth. Their real ambitions lie in the US and Far East. Thus, the City is betting that the division will be refocused around the German canning business and Haagen-Dazs. The rest will be put up for sale, leading perhaps to further writedowns.  --------------------- RESTRUCTURING COSTS  ---------------------               Pounds m  --------------------- European food       55 Burger King         31 Drinks             143 Others              51 Total              280  ---------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As has already been reported, in connection with  the unconstitutional and illegal decisions by the Crimean  Supreme Soviet regarding the peninsula's status, Ukrainian  Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko sent letters to foreign  ministers of other countries and leaders of foreign  organizations. The international community, alarmed by a  negative development of events possible in the Crimea, voices  its unequivocal support for the position expressed in the letter  by the Ukrainian foreign minister.    Anatoliy Zlenko today received William Miller, U.S.  ambassador to Ukraine, at his request. The American diplomat  handed over to Mr. Zlenko a personal message from U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher which, in particular, noted that the  United States recognizes and highly praises Ukraine's  responsible and peaceful position on the developments in the  Crimea. In response to destabilizing processes in the Crimea,  Ukraine acts according to high principles of the CSCE, with  which all of us seek to comply. Any other actions could lead to  confrontation, which would not suit the interests of all sides.  The United States, the message emphasized, supports the  sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine  in its present borders. The United States seeks to expand and  deepen relations with Ukraine, and would like to move forward  quickly in assisting Ukraine through economic incentive programs  that would be useful for the whole country, including the Crimea.</p>

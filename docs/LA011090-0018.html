			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHECKING OUT IN REAL STYLE  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian took office seven years ago as a man who seemingly had a  difficult time saying yes to anything. But in Sacramento Tuesday, the governor  delivered a final State of the State address to the California Legislature that  made him sound almost like a newly confirmed political activist. The speech was  a veritable laundry list of positive initiatives involving a gas tax increase,  mandatory insurance programs, a government-sponsored plan to help first-time  home buyers and a proposal to make it easier to pass local bond issues for  year-around school use.  </P> <P> Only once did the Republican governor talk about cutting back government, a  vague allusion to restricting entitlement programs like welfare and health care  for the poor to keep them from outgrowing available state revenues. But even  then, he promised to work with the Democratic leadership of the Legislature --  for as long as it takes -- in order to forge a compromise. An agreement may not  be possible, because maintaining such programs is a fundamental Democratic  stance. But at least Deukmejian made the offer to work with lawmakers in the  spirit of cooperation that unexpectedly bloomed and prevailed during last  year's legislative session.  </P> <P> Mind you, George Deukmejian has not turned into a Mario Cuomo or a Ted Kennedy.  But at least the governor finally seems to have sensed the need for state  government to grapple with problems before they elude solution through their  very enormity. Significantly, he said passage of an $18.5-billion  transportation program at the June primary election is absolutely essential --  yes, that was the precise phrase he used -- to the economic future of  California and its quality of life. These were welcome strong words from a  chief executive who originally had to be tugged and pulled into accepting the  plan's proposed doubling of the state gasoline tax, from 9 cents per gallon to  18 cents, over a five-year period.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's desire to leave a positive legacy as governor was apparently the  cause of his sudden spurt of energy and willingness to work with the  Legislature last year. So it could be that too many have been too quick to  write Deukmejian off in 1990 as a lame duck, incapable of having much effect on  issues. Aides said that he is determined not to limp out of office this year.  </P> <P> The legislative session will not be all roses. As always, money will be a  sticking point between Deukmejian and Democrats. That shoe will drop today when  Deukmejian sends his last budget -- California's first $50-billion spending  plan -- to the Legislature. But his Tuesday address provides a worthy -- and  challenging -- invitation to the lawmakers for cooperation on a variety of  issues of substance. If the governor follows his words with action and  involvement, as he did in 1989, his final year can be a positive one for  California.  </P></p>

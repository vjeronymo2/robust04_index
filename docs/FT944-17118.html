			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / The Markets: The invisible hand - Global Investor The invisible hand has been at work again in the Japanese stock market. Not the one identified by Adam Smith, but a rather less dextrous instrument, the far-from-gentle touch of Finance Ministry officials attempting to prop up share prices as the market threatens another slide. Traders first noticed it a few weeks ago, spotting an unusual renewal of buying interest in the market on the part of public fund managers as the Nikkei 225 dipped towards 19,500. This week they appeared to be at it again. The authorities' target is immediate and specific. On October 27, 436,666 shares in the privatised Japan Tobacco will be offered to the public, the largest equity issue this year. Since the share price was announced at a staggeringly high Y1.4m (Dollars 14,220) last month, the market has been overwhelmed by fears that the issue will flop. That would not only be yet another disaster for the government's privatisation programme, but would deal a sizeable blow to stock market confidence just as the collapse of JR East last October sent the market into a three-month tailspin that saw it decline by 20 per cent. Concern about a repeat performance seemed misplaced last month when it was announced that 8m investors had oversubscribed the offer by a multiple of 50. But the time lag between that initial application and the issue itself, together with Japan's rather odd rules on tenders, have heightened the sense of alarm. The applications already made were merely tentative. Under listing rules, those who have applied have until tomorrow to pay for the shares. If they do not like the look of the stock closer to the impact day, investors can simply let their applications lapse by not stumping up. At the end of last week, brokers offices in and around Tokyo were alive with rumours that the number of applicants who had not paid was running at about 75 per cent. Many investors appear to be running scared of the general malaise that has gripped the market in the last month. They have also learned a salutary lesson from another bungled offering - last month's Japan Telecom debacle, where the shares are now trading at nearly 20 per cent below the offer price. So the authorities have turned to intervention to shore up the market and avert a catastrophe. But these attempts to buy temporary stability in the run-up to the issue will probably come to nought. If the issue goes better than seems probable, the intervention will presumably stop, since the listing will be safely away. The market will then be free to resume its downward path. If, on the other hand, the worst fears are confirmed, the shock to confidence is likely to be so great that the weight of adverse sentiment will punch right through the government's support level. In other words the real problem is not in fact the price of the issue, nor the circumstances of its listing, though once again these could have been better handled, but the simple fact that the market is in no mood to absorb this massive injection of equity. The JT cash call of about Y960bn comes on top of a succession of convertible bond issues in the next few weeks that may take another Y400bn. With average daily trading values at not much higher than Y250bn, this is an impossible burden for investors to bear. Individuals, on whom most hopes for equity market recovery are pinned, have been heavy net sellers in the last few months, in advance of the JT listing. That is likely to get worse. According to Mr Jason James, chief equity strategist at James Capel Pacific: 'Individuals may not stabilise until November - by which time the performance of Japan Tobacco is likely to have put some of them off.' Of course, none of this necessarily means the market will repeat its slump of a year ago. The coming half-year reporting season is expected to help prices. But these supply-driven difficulties, by dealing a further blow to individual investor sentiment, have probably postponed yet again a lasting recovery for Japanese equities. Interest Rates Amid the mayhem, the economy continues to emerge from its permafrost recession at a suitably glacial pace. Second quarter gross domestic product figures came as a rude shock to some analysts who had hoped to see the first quarter's rapid growth sustained. That was never likely though, since the first three months' figures were themselves inflated by a sharp downward revision to the previous quarter's data. This confusing roller-coaster picture is not a true and fair representation of the economy's performance, of course. The longer term, more reliable figures suggest first half growth of about 0.4 per cent, which should mean full-year growth for 1994 of a little below 1 per cent, picking up speed to perhaps 2.5 per cent next year. This would be a painfully slow recovery even by British standards, but by Japanese experience it is almost imperceptible. All the less reason then for the bond bears to continue to dominate as they have - yields rose this week close to the 5 per cent level. The discount rate has now been held at the historically low 1.75 per cent for more than a year and the steeper yield curve suggests that the market is expecting an increase in short term rates soon. It would be unwise to count on it. Bond yields shot up in the first half of the year along with those in the rest of the world. However, in Japan, the strong recovery on which that increase was predicated has not materialised, but yields have yet to adjust accordingly. All the inflation data points to stable or falling prices - unemployment continues to rise; figures last week that showed the first fall in nominal incomes for 44 years; and the yen stays stubbornly high  - suggesting that monetary conditions should be tight enough even for the most predatory inflation hawk. Indeed, should the recovery continue to show scant sign of strengthening, another cut in the discount rate should not be ruled out. What is more, a new governor of the Bank of Japan will take office in December. It is difficult to imagine that he could be tougher on inflation than Mr Yasushi Mieno, the current incumbent, who raised interest rates three times within eight months of taking office four years ago, bringing down the curtain on the unlamented bubble economy, but bringing with it Japan's longest postwar recession. His successor is not likely to emulate that.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 6/10/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  % change over period                        US    Japan    Germany    France    Italy    UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                 0.09     0.05      0.09      0.10      0.16   0.10 Month                0.41     0.21      0.42      0.46      0.70   0.42 Year                 3.50     2.44      5.88      6.19      8.50   5.63  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                -0.33    -0.51     -0.38     -0.34     -0.89   0.25 Month               -1.29     0.34     -0.62     -0.14      1.58   0.14 Year                -2.98     0.62      1.16     -0.47      0.40   0.09  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                -0.62    -0.89     -0.85     -0.93     -2.36   0.37 Month               -2.50     0.30     -0.53     -0.77      1.87   0.15 Year                -7.99    -0.69     -4.40     -7.56     -8.04  -3.97  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                 -2.1      0.2      -3.8      -1.7      -6.3   -0.4 Month                -3.8     -1.7      -9.0      -6.1      -1.7   -6.9 Year                  0.9     -3.0      -1.3      -9.5       7.7    0.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

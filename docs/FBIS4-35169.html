			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 26 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Cuban  authorities announced a new massive transportation system for  Havana based on modified locally manufactured trucks to relieve  the serious transportation shortage.    Cuba will attach cargo and dump truck cabs to the chassis of  conventional buses to create a "super train-bus" ["super  tren-bus"] with a 315-passenger capacity, according to the  official plan disclosed here. The "super train-bus,"  manufactured at an industrial plant on the outskirts of Havana,  operates in a limited fashion in the city and is known by the  people as a "camel" due to a sort of "hump" resulting from its  peculiar assembly.    With the new system, which covers seven main thoroughfares  in  Havana, the authorities expect to turn around the shrinking  capacity of the 2.1 million inhabitants of this capital to  mobilize. In the past three years, the Cuban transportation  system has been strangled by the currency deficit and the lack  of batteries, spare parts, accessories, and tires. Public  transportation in Havana was reduced from 30,000 daily trips at  the beginning of the decade to approximately 7,500, according to  an official assessment.    Some 500,000 bicycles that circulate in the Cuban capital  reduced the transportation shortage but are not enough to  resolve the demand of 4.2 million [figure as received] people  who, according to the authorities, mobilize everyday in the city.    The plan foresees adding 260 "super train-buses" by the  middle of next year and refurbishing approximately 200  conventional passenger "Ikarus" buses, which were made in  Hungary. The remaining bus routes that are still operating in  Havana, but with growing limitations, will be reorganized so as  to support the "camel" thoroughfares.    The total fleet of passenger vehicles in the capital is  1,176, with an average of 437 in working condition. For next  year, the goal will be to have 1,145 available, of which 916  will circulate.</p>

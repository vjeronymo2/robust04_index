			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COURT LIMITS STATE POWER TO PUNISH MEDIA;  </P> <P> AWARD AGAINST PAPER THAT PUBLISHED NAME OF RAPE VICTIM VOIDED  </P> <P> The Supreme Court, in a case stemming from publication of a rape victim's name,  today limited the power of states to punish the news media for reporting  truthful, lawfully obtained information.  </P> <P> By a 6-3 vote, the court threw out a $97,500 award against a Florida weekly  newspaper won by a rape victim whose identify was included in a published  report about the crime.  </P> <P> The justices said the award violates free press rights protected by the  Constitution's First Amendment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Crime in Florida  </P> <P> Florida law makes it a crime to "print, publish or broadcast" the names of  victims of sexual offenses.  </P> <P> "Our holding today is limited," Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote for the court.  </P> <P> "We do not hold that truthful publication is automatically constitutionally  protected, or that there is no zone of privacy within which the state may  protect the individual from intrusion by the press," he said.  </P> <P> The decision also did not preclude the possibility of a state punishing  publication of a sex offense victim's name, Marshall said.  </P> <P> "We hold only that where a newspaper publishes truthful information which it  has lawfully obtained, punishment may lawfully be imposed, if at all, only when  narrowly tailored to a state interest of the highest order."  </P> <P> That interest was not present in the Florida case, Marshall said.  </P> <P> The Florida Star, a newspaper that primarily serves the black community in  Jacksonville, could have been put out of business if forced to pay the award,  its lawyers had told the justices.  </P> <P> The Star obtained the rape victim's name, identified in court documents only by  the initials B.J.F., from a report posted in the Sheriff's Department press  room in the fall of 1983.  </P> <P> Most news organizations, including the Florida Star, have policies against  publication of rape victim's names. But publication of B.J.F.'s name occurred  erroneously, the newpaper's lawyers said.  </P> <P> In another case today, the court gave a partial victory to the Internal Revenue  Service in its legal battles with the Church of Scientology.  </P> <P> The justices ruled 8 to 0 that judges can privately examine communications  between lawyers and clients to determine whether such information should be  turned over to the government.  </P></p>

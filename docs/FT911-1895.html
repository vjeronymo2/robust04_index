			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Stores' legal skirmishes likely to continue: An Appeal Court decision making the law 'virtually unenforceable' MORE shops are likely to open this Sunday as a result of Tuesday's Appeal Court judgment. But the long-running Sunday trading debate looks as though it will stagger on for many months to come. The Appeal Court ruling that councils could not ban Sunday opening at specific shops without guaranteeing to meet sales losses if a court eventually ruled against the ban may have meant the 1950 Shops Act is 'virtually unenforceable', but it still does not change the fundamental law in England and Wales, as Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, pointed out yesterday. No new legislation is going to emanate from the government this side of a general election to clarify the situation, and the two camps will therefore have to continue their skirmishes through the courts and the newspaper columns. The great unknown in the debate is how any repeal of the law would affect the number of shops trading on Sundays. Would a change in the law open the floodgates? The Keep Sunday Special Campaign (KSSC) argues that unrestricted Sunday trading would lead to higher prices and a reduction of competition as a result of the eclipse of the smaller independent traders. It points to an Institute for Fiscal Studies report from 1985 which suggested that longer opening hours would be likely to accelerate the trend of the disappearance of the independent retailer. The KSSC also refers to a speech made by Baroness Young, a non-executive director of Marks and Spencer, in the House of Lords in 1989, when she argued that Sunday trading would only mean that six days' trading would be spread over seven days. A 1989 report on the implications of Sunday trading, released by the free-market Adam Smith Institute, suggested that any changes in retailing as a result of Sunday trading were likely to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary. It accepted small traders might be squeezed, but questioned if this would be a bad thing. 'All economic change must involve, of necessity, gainers and losers. Small shopkeepers would lose, but consumers would gain from lower prices or more attractive shopping environments,' it said. A study of the Swedish experience of 20 years of Sunday trading confirms the impression that some smaller players find difficulty in competing. In Sweden about 80 per cent of all department stores and hypermarkets now open on Sundays, compared with the 22 per cent that opened in 1972 when trading restrictions were first repealed. Over that period, the hypermarkets and larger supermarkets have increased their share of the market, as have the small convenience stores. The medium-sized shops have been squeezed in between. But the report, which was challenged by the trade unions, showed that deregulated shopping hours had led to 'increased downward pressure' on consumer prices. Mr Kevin Hawkins, corporate affairs director for WH Smith, the multiple retailer that jointly owns the 220-store Do-It-All chain with Boots, said that as a result of the Appeal Court judgment it would open those stores where it had previously undertaken not to trade. 'Where we have closed a store we have found that the trade we lose on a Sunday is not recouped on any other day of the week. It is purely discretionary trade which knocks on the head the view that there is just so much money that can go around,' Mr Hawkins said. 'If we had complete freedom it would be a case of suck it and see. The important thing is that we would be able to open and close according to consumer demand - which would vary seasonally and locally.'</p>

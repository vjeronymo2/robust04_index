			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Cuts 'would have hit consumers' China would not have been the only casualty of US threats to cut its textile quota by up to 30 per cent - US consumers would also have paid dearly, according to a study by a leading Washington trade-policy institute, David Dodwell, World Trade Editor, writes. The quota cuts would have cost US consumers about Dollars 1.1bn a year, according to Mr Gary Hufbauer at the Institute for International Economics, who has just published a study of the cost of US protection.* US textile producers would have captured gains of about Dollars 570m, but the rest of China's 'loss' would have been snapped up by textile exporters elsewhere in Asia and Latin America. Quota cuts would have saved an estimated 8,000 jobs in the beleaguered US textiles industry, but the cost per consumer of saving each job would have amounted to about Dollars 136,000. * Measuring the costs of Protection in the US, by Gary Hufbauer and Kimberly Elliott, published by the Institute for International Economics, Washington.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Travel: Unruffled in Barbados THE governor-general of Barbados ate my duckling. The theft, if I may so damningly describe the incident, took place on my flight to Barbados when the stewardess announced that duck was fully subscribed. The governor-general sat in the row ahead of me, idly peering through the window, quite unaware - or so she would have me believe - of her crime. I mention the episode because it was the most traumatic event of my five-day trip to Sandy Lane Hotel, Barbados. Guests of Sandy Lane, more of a Caribbean institution than a hotel, are not used to being ruffled or disappointed. But then, if I were paying Pounds 350 a night for a standard room, I would not want to be ruffled or disappointed either. Sandy Lane Hotel and Golf Club was the brainchild of Arthur Ronald Lambert Field Tree, an Anglo-American and one-time Tory MP who put his roots down in Barbados after visiting it on holiday. Tree's hotel was not to be run-of-the-mill. In the words of its architect, a certain John 'Happy' Robertson Ward: 'When I was designing Sandy Lane Hotel, I put myself in the position of a well educated English Gentleman of the late 18th century going to the West Indies to build a Great House.' He constructed a classically elegant building of white coral stone, a material which not only shimmers spectacularly at night, but which also breathes, helping to keep the interiors cool in the scorching heat. The hotel's central rotunda curves around two stately mahogany trees. Above is a terrace with ravishing views of the Caribbean and the gently curving bay. Each of the 121 bedrooms has beds large enough, as I discovered, to sleep in sideways and its own verandah. The marble-floored bedrooms, upgraded as part of a recent Pounds 7m refurbishment, struck me as a little characterless, like upmarket fitted kitchens. Nonetheless, the English gentlemen for whom Sandy Lane was designed - those that remain - continue to be lured. The rest of the hotel's guest list is made up largely of Americans. Sandy Laners are not the most adventurous holidaymakers. One couple, visitors of many years' standing, admitted they had never ventured outside the hotel save for the brief drive to and from the airport. The hotel manager once held a cocktail party for repeat guests by the swimming pool at one end of the extensive gardens. He was astonished to hear one confess that, in all his years at the hotel, he had never realised there was a pool. Sandy Lane boasts three staff for each room. Consequently, guests temporarily forget the sensation of opening doors unaided, pouring drinks, or hauling their towel down to the beach. Perhaps the sort of people who stay here do not ever perform such menial tasks. Once on the beach, reputed to be one of the best on the island's west coast, guests are discouraged from yelling for service or coarsely clicking their fingers. At Sandy Lane waiters are beckoned by placing a large flag upright in the sand. If such sybaritic living wears thin, one can always turn to sporting exertions. The hotel has floodlit tennis courts and offers complimentary waterskiing, windsurfing, snorkeling and hobie cat sailing. The chief sporting attraction, however, is the 18-hole championship golf course. Green fees (normally Dollars 75) are waived for Sandy Lane residents, though hire of clubs and golf carts is extra. In a discussion about Sandy Lane's high room rates, which incidentally do not include service charge or local tax, a friend quoted the manager of an equally exclusive hotel. Asked how he justified the room rates, he had replied: 'Sir, we don't justify them. People pay them.' Sandy Lane is the same. David Pilling stayed c/o Sandy Lane Hotel &amp; Golf Club and travelled c/o BWIA International. Half-board at Sandy Lane in the high season costs Dollars 700 (Pounds 380) a night for a double room with an ocean view.

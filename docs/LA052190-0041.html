			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BROKEN VOWS TRIP UP MINORITIES AT UCSD 'BOOT CAMP';  </P> <P> HIGHER EDUCATION: PROMISE OF ECONOMIC SECURITY WHILE RIGOROUS PROGRAM PREPARES  THEM TO COMPETE PROVES TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.  </P> <P> The offer seemed too good to be true for the diverse group of blacks and  Latinos hungry for academic advancement:  </P> <P> An intensive one-year academic "boot camp" at UC San Diego to improve their  math, reading and writing skills so they could then continue as regular  students through a four-year undergraduate program -- preferably with a science  major -- and graduate. Better yet, the university would provide full financing  for at least the first year -- $9,500 in grants as well as campus housing -- so  that students would not have to work and those who had jobs could quit them and  spend full time on studies.  </P> <P> And, as the first year nears completion, many of the 16 students who started  the program believe it was indeed oversold. Four dropped out and the 12  students who remain have lost a good deal of the excitement they began with  last September, in large part because of broken financial promises and  haphazard administration of its two special academic courses.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, many of the students believe they have benefited academically  from the program, although it remains unclear whether their expectations for  academic success will be fulfilled by the year of special preparation.  </P> <P> The moving force behind the program, veteran UCSD biology professor Stanley  Mills, resigned as director last month after angry complaints from students  that money promised as grants in some cases became small loans, causing  financial headaches that distracted from their rigorous math and writing  assignments.  </P> <P> Although Mills designed the faculty-run experiment to have at least a  three-year evaluation, there is no question that problems from the first year  have complicated his original goal: a program not only to increase the small  percentages of black and Latino students on campus but to have them better  prepared to tackle different science majors and graduate in greater numbers.  </P> <P> "It is a good education for those who don't have a chance other than to enter a  junior college somewhere," said Jose Cruz, 19, who plans to major in  engineering. "But Mills made the program sound like a fantasy" when the  students were recruited, "saying that everything would be taken care of. I  think all the financial pressures have taken a real toll on us."  </P> <P> Added 27-year-old Maurice Carlisle, recruited for the program after completing  a stint in the U.S. Marine Corps: "There's been an incredible amount of hassles  and financial pressures, and I think most of us have decided that we simply had  to be willing to suffer through this first year because we want a college  education."  </P> <P> "We made mistakes," Mills admitted last week, conceding that the student  complaints contain a good deal of truth. "These students are not woolly-eyed  lunatics. . . . I did misinterpret certain (financial) data, and we've had  problems from just shaking down the program."  </P> <P> But both Mills and Joseph Watson, who, as vice chancellor for undergraduate  affairs, funded the program this year with about $80,000, asked that criticisms  of Mills' management and his misstatements to students not overshadow the  effort to try something different to help more minority students succeed at  UCSD.  </P> <P> "We are testing an approach different from present programs," Watson said. "We  have doubts about our present programs," which provide tutorial and other  support for minority students admitted to regular undergraduate programs but  which have been inadequate in improving minority retention rates and increasing  grade averages.  </P> <P> Mills said he fears colleagues will interpret his resignation "as saying that  the program failed. But, even though I have resigned, the program still exists,  and I think it can still work."  </P> <P> The Computation and Language Skills program (CALS), designed by Mills and  approved by the UCSD Academic Senate, calls for intensive courses in math and  writing/reading, taught by graduate students or lecturers and supervised by  tenured professors. Each course would involve daily instruction from two to  three hours, substantial one-on-one assistance and a large dose of homework  nightly. Mills based the concept on an intensive summer program he helped run  for minority students from Lincoln and Morse high schools admitted to UCSD in  the mid-1960s.  </P> <P> Mills recruited math professor Leonard Haff and English professor Charles  Cooper, who has designed writing projects for the state Department of Education  and San Diego city schools, to oversee the two course components.  </P> <P> Mills and Watson at first decided to target former military personnel in their  planned recruitment of 20 students last summer for the first year, reasoning  that persons with such background would have self-confidence and maturity  levels useful in tackling a fast-paced, disciplined academic schedule.  </P> <P> But, because of the short amount of time given Marine Corps administrators at  Camp Pendleton, the major point of contact, there were few Marines eligible for  the program who would be leaving the service in time to begin studies in  September, 1989.  </P> <P> As a result, the two instructors selected for the classes were asked to beat  the bushes for potential students, using contacts at community colleges and  other agencies.  </P> <P> "We essentially played God," said Robert Curtis, a UCSD graduate student in  mathematics who taught the math course until he quit in December in anger over  student hardships resulting from the financial complications. "We really had no  standards other than finding students who seemed suitable. . . . most of them  were enrolled on the spot after brief oral interviews with Mills."  </P> <P> When first contacted by Mills, Luis Lopez had already begun his second week of  study as a junior at San Diego State University, buoyed by a $1,400 grant and a  $1,000 scholarship for being an outstanding Hispanic student transfer from a  community college.  </P> <P> Lopez, along with three other persons, met with Mills "and, after just a little  meeting of 10 minutes or so, he admitted all four of us right there. And then  he began telling us about all the great things we would have financially --  tuition, dorms and no need to work so we could study."  </P> <P> Although Lopez suspected he might be overqualified for the first year of  remedial-type courses, he nevertheless took Mills' advice to drop out of San  Diego State immediately and enter UCSD. "I took his word, even though I never  had anything in writing. I figured that I had everything paid for the first  year and a guaranteed four years at a prestigious university like UCSD."  </P> <P> But Lopez and the other students soon found out that, despite the promises from  Mills, all students had to qualify for any financial aid through the regular  application process. And, as such, income from the jobs they had quit at the  urging of Mills or aid from parents they no longer lived with was considered in  figuring out what they would eventually receive.  </P> <P> Not only did aid packages end up substantially less than what Mills had  detailed, the money was delayed because of processing. One former Marine,  married and with children, had his auto repossessed and dropped out of the  program. Remaining students were forced to borrow money from friends and from  Curtis. UCSD's housing director arranged for meal tickets to be advanced to the  students and found dormitory space, albeit in the university's highest-priced  graduate complex, a converted condominium, at $800 a month per double room.  </P> <P> "When I got stuck with a $4,000 loan, no grant, no money for food, I said,  'Hey, minority students have had it hard enough without going through all of  this,' " Lopez said.  </P> <P> Given that the course work was basically too elementary for him, he left the  program and, through the special efforts of UCSD Registrar Ronald Bowker, was  able to re-enroll at San Diego State this spring despite not meeting  application deadlines. But he lost both his $1,000 scholarship and $1,400 grant  from SDSU, and still remains $1,300 in debt to UCSD.  </P> <P> Monica Lopez, the older sister of Jose, quit a well-paying job at Children's  Hospital, sold her car and left a UCSD preparatory program at City College.  Subsequently, she has had to move several times to find housing she can afford  given the small amount of aid provided her. Her cousin, Maria Borrayo, left the  program, unable to support herself without a job.  </P> <P> "Why did I join? I was told by Mills that this was the ultimate program,"  Monica Lopez said. "But, in retrospect, it isn't that exceptional, unless  you're really someone who has blown a lot of (academic) chances before."  </P> <P> Carlisle, the ex-Marine, ended up having to leave his wife and children with  relatives in Ohio for the year. Kevin Earl, recruited from a job at the United  States Homeless Mission in Southeast San Diego, said the bitterness of many  students resulted "especially from a lack of money provided us during  transition" to the campus.  </P> <P> Student Phillip Harris said, "After being told that all our needs would be  taken care of, to just come to school and study, we'd get back to the  (dormitory) and there would be a three-day-to-pay-or-be-evicted notice. So  you'd spend half a day trying to get that cleared up. There was a tremendous  amount of stress."  </P> <P> Bruce Jackson, a former Navy man, noted that many of the CALS students had  never received loans before, and they worried incessantly about "owing other  people money. . . . I mean they were really distraught." As the oldest student,  Jackson, 38, helped counsel other students to stick with the program despite  his own inclination at times to quit.  </P> <P> Mills said last week that "I didn't understand how (financial aid) was handed  out." Watson agreed with student complaints that the money was "both handed out  quite late and that some things were said (to them) that were wrong.  </P> <P> "Yes, if they were misled, we have moral obligations to meet our stated  commitments, but we can't forgo the regular financial aid procedures. . . . I  can't order the financial aid office to do that." Watson did point out that  many students have had their financial aid packages revised this spring to  include more grants and fewer loans.  </P> <P> Mills and Watson believe the program will improve in its second year. Before  Mills resigned, they already had recruited 14 students for next fall, including  nine from the military, and say they have been careful to explain financial aid  requirements.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the academic success of CALS remains up in the air. Curtis, the  former math instructor who has kept in contact with most of the students, fears  that the math course is inadequate to prepare all the students for the rigorous  UCSD calculus course required of all freshmen.  </P> <P> "I fear that some may get slaughtered," Curtis said, partly because he believes  the CALS course was unable to address the wide range of student preparation,  where some needed basic algebra instruction at the beginning while others  already new some trigonometry.  </P> <P> Haff, the math professor who oversees the course and who is now the overall  program director, said the students "on average" are a motivated group, but, in  terms of their chances next year, "I want to let the results speak for  themselves. . . . Our hope is that they will be able to do the course."  </P> <P> English professor Cooper is confident that his literature instructor, Aida  Mancillas, has improved both the skills level and self-confidence of the  students in reading and writing.  </P> <P> "Not only has she done a wonderful job with the course, I believe she has  provided the students with a lot of personal support and advice, and really has  gone well beyond simply teaching the course well to be a key person in holding  the program together," Cooper said.  </P> <P> But both Cooper and Mancillas had differences with Mills over the content of  the literature program, with Mills wanting more traditional grammar-based  instruction. As a result, Cooper and Mancillas don't know whether they will be  part of CALS next year.  </P> <P> "I haven't decided on that," new director Haff said.  </P> <P> Mancillas said that Mills and Haff dislike her agitation on the part of  students, in particular by helping them draft several letters to Watson  demanding that Mills be dismissed form the program. "In any other format, the  university would welcome such initiative, but not in this case," Mancillas  said.  </P> <P> Despite the financial problems, most of the students look forward to continuing  at UCSD next fall, and they feel vindicated in part by the resignation of  Mills.  </P> <P> "I'd recommend it to others as long as they are aware of the financial aid  limitations," Harris said. "I've been exposed to a lot of new things, and the  review of math and writing has been really helpful."  </P> <P> Added Kevin Earl, who rooms with Jackson, "We're as diverse a group as you  could ever find, and the university has played on our decency. You always know  that nothing comes for free, but it has been worth it academically."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 12 Jan (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the Srpska republic assembly, said today that NATO  has no reason to demand that the Serb side release the Canadian  battalion from Srebrenica, because the Serbs "are not holding  members of the Canadian battalion under blockade".    "The Serb side allows the forces to be replaced at any  moment  because they arrived there with our permission," Krajisnik told  Radio Yugoslavia in response to the NATO summit in Brussels,  which ended yesterday.    Concerning the request to open Tuzla's airport, Krajisnik  stressed that the Serb side has nothing against that, so long as  peace is signed first.    "We cannot allow Tuzla's airport to be opened because it  would be used for the arming of the Muslim side," Krajisnik  said. He recalled the negative experience with Sarajevo airport  which the Serbs handed over to the UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR] on 1 July 1992.    "We clearly let UNPROFOR know that they abused the opening  of  Sarajevo airport because they allowed the Muslims to dig a  tunnel under the airport," Krajisnik said. "The United Nations  and the forces deployed at the airport and other areas allowed  the Muslim forces to arm themselves through channels exclusively  controlled by UN forces."    A request for the reopening of Tuzla airport -- at a time  when peace and the signing of a peace plan for former  Bosnia-Herzegovina are in sight -- can only prolong the war,  Krajisnik concluded.    As for the decision on NATO's involvement if Sarajevo is  attacked, it is superfluous in Krajisnik's view, because the  Serb side "is not the one strangling Sarajevo, as they keep  saying."    He also denied accusations that Serbs are obstructing convoy  movements and humanitarian aid deliveries to the Muslim side.    "We are letting the humanitarian convoys through all our  checkpoints. All that is needed is that those who are bringing  in the humanitarian aid do this according to the agreement and  protocol signed between humanitarian organizations and the  Srpska republic authorities," Krajisnik stressed.    Despite these unjustified conditions conveyed to the Serb  side from the NATO summit in Brussels, Krajisnik said that a new  approach to the Bosnian crisis gained ground, since the  ultimatum-style tone, used until now to constantly force the  Serbs to make territorial concessions to Muslims, has been  abandoned.</p>

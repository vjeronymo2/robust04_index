			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTRODUCING: DANISH HOME, U.S. SOUND  </P> <P> The Sandmen.  </P> <P> Personnel: Allan Vegenfeldt, vocals; Stefan Jensen, guitar, Ole Wennike, bass  and harmonica; Michael Rasmussen, drums; Sam Mitchell, guitar.  </P> <P> History: Vegenfeldt, Jensen, Wennike and Rasmussen met through the  punk-oriented Copenhagen, Denmark, club scene three years ago, sharing a  disdain for Danish pop music and a love for such Anglo or American acts as the  Rolling Stones, Lou Reed and the Sex Pistols. Performing only in English, the  band built a following on the Danish club circuit, drawing the attention of  Swedish label owner Peter Yngen, who started a new Danish company, Garden  Records, and signed the band. An EP was released in 1987, followed by an album,  "Western Blood," in 1988. By this time, Mitchell, an Englishman whose credits  included a stint with Rod Stewart, had become a full member after being called  to help with some guitar overdubs. Yngen recommended the Sandmen to Aaron  Jacoves, a Los Angeles-based talent scout for A&amp;M Records, who flew to  Copenhagen and signed the band. Four new songs were recorded then for the  American version of "Western Blood," released in February.  </P> <P> Sound: On first listen you'd most likely assume the Sandmen hail from somewhere  like Ohio or Arizona rather than Copenhagen. Second listen too. And third,  fourth, fifth and last. Not only is the music more in line with Boston's  neo-blues Treat Her Right than with such Scandinavian posters as Abba, A-Ha or  even Iceland's bold Sugarcubes, but there's nary a hint of national origin, not  even a touch of accent in Vegenfeldt's sturdy singing. That aside, the Sandmen  have forged a solid and varied take on American rock styles.  </P> <P> Show: Thursday at the Whisky. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

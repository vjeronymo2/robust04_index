			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Doctors endorse charter sentiments THE GOALS of the Patient's Charter will require additional manpower and funding, the British Medical Association told the government yesterday. Delegates at the association's conference in Nottingham endorsed the sentiments behind the charter but insisted that investigation of patients' complaints must be comprehensive and establish the real causes of troubles 'including faults in the system'. The conference accused the government of artificially distorting hospital waiting lists by measuring them from the time a consultant placed a patient on a list. Waiting time should, the BMA said, be measured from the time a general practitioner referred a patient to hospital.</p>

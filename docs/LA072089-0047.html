			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> BILL HENDERSON: FISHING FOR THE RIGHT BACKUP  </P> <P> By the end of his opening set Tuesday at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill, singer  Bill Henderson was wishing it was the end of his two-night stay.  </P> <P> "That was the worst set, night of my entire . . .," he said in his dressing  room after the set. "Nothing was happening."  </P> <P> Henderson, who came to fame in the 1950s with a recording of "Senor Blues" with  pianist Horace Silver and further established himself with Count Basie, had  indicated before the set that he would be trying some new and different things  with his new trio. Unfortunately, the trio wasn't able to keep pace with the  singer or provide Henderson with even the bare basics for his work.  </P> <P> The opening tune offered the first indication of trouble. "That Old Black  Magic" had Henderson singing in his usual, heavily syncopated style. To be  effective, the band should have provided a smooth backdrop of easily loping  swing for contrast. It didn't, and it got worse with the first ballad offering  of the evening, "I've Got a Crush on You."  </P> <P> Another swing tune failed to swing before Henderson turned back to the ballad  and instructed bassist Jerry Watts Jr. and drummer Mike Shapiro to lay out.  With Steve Bach at the piano, Henderson was finally in his element on Rodgers  and Hart's "It Never Entered My Mind."  </P> <P> And so the evening went. An up-tempo blues was murdered by Watts' overbearing  bass and Shapiro's feet-dragging drumming; then salvation came in the form of  "Sleeping Bee," the first of two ballads from the pens of Truman Capote and  Harold Arlen. "Say That You'll Be Mine" was supposed to swing and didn't, nor  did "Tulip or Turnip." But the ballads "Sophisticated Lady" and "Prelude to a  Kiss," both from the Duke Ellington song book and accompanied only by pianist  Bach, were gorgeous efforts that had Henderson at his lyrical best, his  phrasing as on-the-money as ever.  </P> <P> Oddly enough, the band came to life during a closing "The More I See You." But  just as strangely, the band's wake-up call seemed to be for another date at  another place with another singer.  </P> <P> Chalk it up to a bad night? Of course, but Henderson is too good to work with  inferior players. Pianist Bach showed himself a capable player -- a good catch,  as it were. Henderson should throw the others back.  </P></p>

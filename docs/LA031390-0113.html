			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RUB IN A HAIR REMEDY;  </P> <P> HEALTH: DOES A DRUG THAT BATTLES BALDNESS FULFILL A MAJOR HEALTH CONCERN, OR  HAS IT SIMPLY BECOME THE FOCUS OF A SLICK MARKETING CAMPAIGN?  </P> <P> When Howard Hintz looks in the mirror every morning, he sees a guy with a full  head of hair. Maybe it's not quite as thick on top as it was when he was 18,  but neither is it as thin as it was a few years ago -- and Hintz has a morning  and evening ritual to keep it that way.  </P> <P> "I'll continue to use it until something else comes along. Or until I get to a  point where I'm too old to be bothered," said the 31-year-old Los Angeles chef.  </P> <P> The secret to Hintz's rebound from baldness is minoxidil, rubbed in the scalp  twice a day. Under the brand name Rogaine, the drug has been touted over the  last year as "the first and only product that's proven to grow hair."  </P> <P> It's a product to meet a health need that is more mental than physical, and  American men have been slow to accept it. But there has been a slow, steady  increase of Rogaine users, including some women who were losing their hair  because of genetics or medical treatments.  </P> <P> From its beginnings in sober medical propriety 1 1/2 years ago, Upjohn Co.'s  marketing campaign for Rogaine has moved from aiming at doctors to directly  appealing to consumers.  </P> <P> On the sports pages and on posters at the barbershop or hair salon, American  men are seeing explicit ads about what Rogaine can do for them.  </P> <P> In a twis t on supermarket coupons for cereal and cat food, the ads even  contain a coupon worth $10 toward the cost of visiting a doctor for a Rogaine  prescription.  </P> <P> And the recent Los Angeles Marathon featured a 5-K run sponsored by Rogaine:  its first move into sports sponsorship to get name recognition for a cosmetic  that can be sold by prescription only.  </P> <P> A product that was seen as a sure-fire hit before it received FDA approval in  August, 1988, Rogaine began looking like a pharmaceutical Edsel in the first  few months after Upjohn made it available in November of that year. Sales that  some market analysts had predicted would hit $200 million in the first year  totaled less than a third of that in 1989.  </P> <P> In short, it has taken some work to persuade American men to spend at least  $600 a year for a vanity product they must use for their lifetimes. Most  pharmacies fill only a handful of Rogaine prescriptions each month.  </P> <P> One of the notable exceptions is -- where else? -- in the center of Southern  California's good-looks industry, Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Mickey Fine Pharmacy, 433 N. Roxbury Drive, Beverly Hills, sells at least 144  bottles of Rogaine every month, said owner Ted Buchalter. He estimates that 10%  of those bottles go to women.  </P> <P> The men, who don't like to admit they're using Rogaine, "are mostly yuppies,  young executives, people who are in a position where they have to make the good  appearance. If they get bald, they look a little older," Buchalter said.  </P> <P> Nearby, at the hair transplant center of the Bosley Medical Group, 8447  Wilshire Blvd., patients use about 100 bottles of minoxidil a week, said clinic  administrator Charles Ihling. The drug is thought to promote hair growth that  the trauma of the transplant operation might temporarily disrupt.  </P> <P> Seven other centers in California and three other states bring the Bosley  Medical Group's monthly consumption to about 1,000 bottles, Ihling said.  </P> <P> "We've been told by Upjohn that we're the No. 2 purchaser of Rogaine in  California and among the top 10 in the United States," Ihling said.  </P> <P> Upjohn will not release sales figures, saying only that 2 million men worldwide  have tried Rogaine.  </P> <P> What that doesn't say is how many men quit using the drug because it didn't  seem to work or because -- once confronted by having to rub it on twice a day,  forever, and at a cost of about $50 a month -- men decide they'd rather go  bald. Dr. Rhonda Rand, a Beverly Hills dermatologist, said about half of her  patients who try Rogaine stick with it.  </P> <P> Minoxidil has been used in the United States since 1980 to lower blood  pressure. When doctors testing the drug in the early 1970s noticed that some  men taking the pills started growing hair on their heads and upper cheeks,  Upjohn began researching it as a baldness remedy.  </P> <P> The tests found the drug useful against male pattern baldness, the hereditary  type that begins at the top of the head and can eventually leave a man with  only a horseshoe-shaped fringe of hair around his head. About 30 million  American men have some degree of male pattern baldness.  </P> <P> The study concluded that 39% of men experienced moderate to dense hair  regrowth; 37% had minimal regrowth; 13% grew only small, soft, colorless hair,  and 11% had no regrowth.  </P> <P> The studies also showed that minoxidil requires a four- to six-month commitment  of twice-daily applications before early results can be seen. And, although  early hairs often resemble "peach fuzz," sometimes they are replaced later by  more normal-appearing hairs.  </P> <P> The earlier in the balding process a man is, the better the results seem to be.  And, even when hair doesn't become denser, some men find that minoxidil "holds  the line" against further hair loss. Once minoxidil treatment is stopped,  though, balding will begin again.  </P> <P> The current formulation is a 2% solution of minoxidil, but Upjohn recently  launched a study of whether increasing the concentration to 5% would improve  the results, said Kaye Bennett, spokeswoman for the firm.  </P> <P> Some doctors also tell their patients to use minoxidil in conjunction with  Retin A, the "anti-aging" drug.  </P> <P> The major side effect from Rogaine is skin irritation, which occurs in about 5%  of men. Because minoxidil is absorbed through the skin, close monitoring is  needed if Rogaine is used by a man with hypertension, coronary heart disease or  a predisposition to heart failure. Its use should be avoided by pregnant or  nursing women.  </P> <P> Before Rogaine was approved, American men were spending about $200 million a  year on various remedies for hair loss, Upjohn says. In January, the FDA banned  the promotion of various long-standing over-the-counter remedies for baldness,  calling them ineffective -- and leaving Rogaine as the only approved  nonsurgical alternative.  </P> <P> Surgical options include transplanting small plugs of hair from the back of the  head to the top, moving flaps of hair over balding areas, and scalp reduction  surgery that decreases the bare area.  </P> <P> Although Upjohn and others are researching the mechanism of minoxidil's action,  no one is sure how it works. Male pattern baldness is known, however, to result  from hair follicles reacting abnormally to the presence of androgens, male sex  hormones.  </P> <P> Another drug currently being tested for its hair restoration properties,  Cyoctol, acts against androgens. A very small study for a Los Angeles firm  showed that Cyoctol blocked the action of testosterone on the scalp, preserving  the hair, but further studies are needed.  </P> <P> Women could present the market of the future for Rogaine because they are more  concerned when hair loss occurs and more likely than men to consult doctors,  drug market analysts believe.  </P> <P> "It would more than double the market," said Richard Stover, who analyzes the  drug market for Alex Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in New York.  </P> <P> Early results of Upjohn tests indicate that hair growth in women with thinning  hair was 50% better with minoxidil than with a placebo.  </P> <P> Actually, women already play an important role in the market, even when they  aren't using Rogaine themselves, some say.  </P> <P> Many inquiries about the drug come from women who are asking on behalf of  husbands who are too embarrassed to call attention to their baldness, said  Dianne Narron, a Raleigh, N.C., hairdresser. Narron chairs an education  committee for the National Cosmetology Assn.  </P> <P> "It tickles me. A lot of mothers whose sons are college-age or older ask about  Rogaine," Narron said. "One lady noticed her son was getting some hair loss and  offered to pay for it if he would go to the doctor. She thought he had such a  wonderful head of hair and, if something could help it, then she wanted him to  do it."  </P> <P> Upjohn gives hairdressers posters and other information about Rogaine as a way  to help them advise customers about the drug.  </P> <P> But, even as advertising tries to convince men that their baldness is something  to treat medically, UCLA health researcher Michael S. Goldstein suggests that  men's slowness to accept Rogaine is one of the few positive byproducts of men's  reluctance to consult doctors.  </P> <P> "Most of the research on men's health habits tends to make men look bad,  because they don't respond to (medical) symptoms," Goldstein said. "But hair  loss isn't a genuine symptom in the way it's commonly thought about. It's a  created symptom and a need that's being artificially created. So if men aren't  responding, it's a sign of their mental health, not ill health."  </P> <P> Upjohn's latest effort to woo male customers is a new television commercial  being tested this month in Youngstown, Ohio; Rochester, N.Y., and New Orleans.  It is the first time Rogaine's name is being mentioned in a broadcast  advertisement, said Upjohn spokeswoman Bennett.  </P> <P> Previous attempts talked about a new medical remedy for baldness but did not  name the drug. The new ads talk about Rogaine but aren't specific about what  it's for.  </P> <P> The FDA requires that if both the name of the product and the condition it  treats are mentioned, the ad must also contain details about the drug's  effectiveness and side effects. In print ads, this is solved with masses of  fine print, but that option is not practical for TV.  </P> <P> The ultimate solution to this advertising dilemma -- and a boon for men worried  about baldness -- would come if the FDA approves making topical minoxidil an  over-the-counter medication. Market analyst Stover says there is a "high  probability" of this happening by 1995.  </P> <P> In that case, many companies could market anti-baldness minoxidil solutions,  but Rogaine would have the name recognition that Bayer has for aspirin or  Tylenol has for acetaminophen, he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, men will have to consult a doctor before they can obtain Rogaine to  see if it works for them. Because the results vary from man to man, Howard  Hintz advises men to come to terms with the idea of being bald before trying  Rogaine:  </P> <P> "You shouldn't do something when you're crazed about it, but when you're more  or less comfortable with going bald. Then if it works, it works, and if it  doesn't, it doesn't."  </P></p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (4): Analysts sceptical - The Stock Market THE Korean stock market remained tantalisingly out of reach for overseas investors during the high-growth years of the 1980s. Those who wanted to profit from Korea's enviable economic performance had to be content with investing through country funds and convertible bond issues, while continuing to press for direct access to one of Asia's most exciting markets. In January 1992, their wish was granted. Restrictions on direct ownership were relaxed, but the opening up of the market could hardly have been less auspicious. Overseas investors were confronted by cumbersome red tape, less-than-generous limits on ownership and a market in decline. The Korea Stock Price Index (KOSPI) started the year at 624.23 and tumbled to a low of 459.07 on August 21, well below the all-time high of 1007.77 seen on April 1, 1989. Worries about the slowdown in economic and corporate earnings growth and the trade deficit lie behind the fall. With such a lacklustre performance, foreigners were reluctant to rush in at first. Net foreign investment reached Dollars 1.27bn in the first 10 months, well short of the Dollars 2-4bn initially predicted. Limits on foreign ownership were set at 10 per cent for most companies, although some - such as the Korea Long-Term Credit Bank - are free to raise the threshold to 25 per cent if they wish. So far, the foreign ownership quota has been met by only 70 or so out of a total of 680 listed companies. About 15 of those 70 companies have reached the upper limit through direct portfolio investment, according to the Securities Supervisory Board. The remainder reached their 10 per cent limit through joint venture or direct investment agreements. The limits pose serious problems for international investors, diminishing their appetite for Korean stocks. The main problem is liquidity. Big investors who want to buy or sell Dollars 3-4m in one stock are restricted in their choice. In addition, global fund managers tend to be guided by international indices when allocating assets. Korea, which is not a completely free market, has only 20 per cent of its market capitalisation included in the Emerging Market Free Far East Index provided by Morgan Stanley Capital International, whereas countries such as Indonesia and Thailand are included at 100 per cent. 'At 10 per cent the market is still effectively closed to foreigners,' says Mr Torquil McAlpine, branch manager of Schroders in Seoul. Foreigners hope the Ministry of Finance may soon raise the limits to 20 to 25 per cent for most listed companies. Such a move would 'be a shot in the arm for the market and would send a message to international investors that Korea is adopting a more open attitude,' says Mr Peter Thorn, branch manager of W I Carr in Seoul. That Korea needs to send such signals to global investors is clear. A recent Euromoney survey of investor interest in the emerging markets showed Korea trailing behind other Far Eastern emerging markets such as Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia. Analysts claim that many of the risk capital investors who would once have been wooed by Korea are now turning to the next generation of Asian tigers such as China and Vietnam. The government has tried to encourage investors with a string of rescue packages aimed at reversing the stock market's decline. In December 1989, Korean investment trust companies were told to borrow funds from banks and invest the money in the stock market. In May 1990, a 4,000bn-won stock market stabilisation fund was set up. The proceeds - provided by listed companies - were intended for equity investment. The measures provided only short-lived relief in the market, which then continued its decline. The most recent support measures, announced shortly after the market hit its low this year, were intended to force institutions to buy stocks. Institutional investors must remain net buyers, with bank trust accounts, insurance companies and pension funds instructed to invest a specified amount within a set period. Additional measures were proposed to woo back individual investors, increase liquidity and reduce market interest rates. The market has since shown signs of recovery, helped by the fall in interest rates, the decision to lift restrictions on foreign ownership of shares in Posco (the iron and steel company) and Kepco (the power group), as well as the feeling that the stock market was looking cheap. As a result, the index has recently risen to levels seen at the start of the year. Many investors are hoping the winner of December's presidential election will propose measures to boost economic growth which would provide further impetus for the stock market. However, analysts remain sceptical about the extent to which the market can recover, primarily because banks, brokers and financial institutions are sitting on an estimated Dollars 10-15bn (out of a total market capitalisation of about Dollars 75bn) in shares due to the assorted market-support measures. There is no doubting their desire to offload the stock as soon as a suitable opportunity arises, and it is this overhang of stock which analysts believe could hold the market's rally in check.</p>

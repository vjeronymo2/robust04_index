			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber pact extended Members of the International Natural Rubber Organisation have agreed to a year's extension of the existing world rubber pact. A meeting here of Inro, which groups six rubber exporting nations and 21 consumer countries, decided that the extension was necessary for the 'final negotiation of the new agreement'. Whether to grant an extension to the existing rubber pact, which stabilises prices through a buffer stock system, or negotiate a new agreement has been argued between producers and consumers for several months. However, producers concerns have been tempered by a recent upsurge in natural rubber prices. Tight supply and growing demand, particularly China, have pushed prices to the highest level for six years. At its meeting Inro said it was concerned that high prices had created a very volatile market and that heavy speculation by some traders had resulted in contract defaults. It said positive action was needed to restore order, confidence and credibility in the market.</p>

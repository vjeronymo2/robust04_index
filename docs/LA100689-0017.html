			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: CAFE COYOTE'S DISHES DON'T LIVE UP TO MENU'S  PROMISE  </P> <P> Sopapillas, posole, jalapeno tortellini, duck breast in juniper berry marinade  -- these are all on the menu at the new Cafe Coyote in Old Town, and they all  sound interesting.  </P> <P> But then, just about everything at the Cafe Coyote looks or sounds interesting.  It's the reality that falls short.  </P> <P> Novelties like grilled halibut tacos and duck-stuffed tamales exist alongside  such accepted standards of Southwestern cuisine as black bean chili, blue corn  chips and fajitas. And the restaurant itself, upstairs at the Old Town  Esplanade, flatters the eye so effectively that after sampling some of the  dishes you could be forgiven for assuming that all the creative effort expended  upon the place went into the decor.  </P> <P> Cafe Coyote is not related to the famous Coyote Cafe in  trendy-chic-upscale-clever Santa Fe, N. M., although a disingenuous-seeming  menu note describes Santa Fe as the hometown of the restaurant's imaginary  coyote mascot (artsy-craftsy wooden carvings of coyotes in various poses abound  throughout the restaurant). The cooking style also is advertised to be the new  Southwestern style developed in Santa Fe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tackling a Tough One  </P> <P> That may be true, although if the virtually unchewable beef in the fajitas and  tacos and the asphalt-like dough of the Pueblo Indian pizza are typical of  Santa Fe cooking, the only conclusion that could be drawn would be that the  residents of this favored city are equipped with teeth sheathed in stainless  steel.  </P> <P> Southwestern cuisine, like California cuisine, cuisine nouvelle, la cucina  novella and all the other updates, is artificial, which is not a criticism,  because all these styles also represent thoughtful elaborations and  modernizations of traditional cooking styles. Cornmeal, cumin, pine nuts,  chilies of various strengths and tomatoes thus play major roles, but in  combination with ingredients that the original Southwesterners did not know,  including fresh ocean fish and shrimp, which reason tells us could not have  appeared on New Mexico tables until the advent of refrigeration. Cafe Coyote's  pastas, seasoned with Southwestern flavors, are obvious examples of this  reinterpretation of traditional cooking.  </P> <P> Make no mistake, some items are both inventive and tasty. The house quesadilla,  for example, goes well beyond the cheese-covered tortilla favored in San Diego  to include a savory stuffing of svelte oyster mushrooms, pungent pine nuts and  fashionable, sun-dried tomatoes, with a spoonful of fresh mango salsa plopped  in the center to underline the overall cleverness of the thing. The grilled  pasilla pepper, which imitates the more familiar chili relleno in all respects  except the cooking method (chilies rellenos are fried), is similarly  exceptional, the cheese stuffing quite suave and the red chili sauce and mango  salsa serving as provocative counterpoints.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Happier Offering  </P> <P> The scampi chalupa also was among Cafe Coyote's happier offerings. Pizza-like  in appearance, it consisted of a toasted tortilla tantalizingly topped with  Tabascoed tomato puree, black bean chili, grated cheese, avocado and plump  shrimp, an effective layering of ingredients that resulted in a satisfying  dish. (Black beans repeat endlessly on this menu, both as topping and as side  dish, and generally to good effect.)  </P> <P> However, other dishes that were as visually attractive were disagreeable,  beginning with an order of beef fajitas, garnished with peppers, onions and  mushrooms, that included chunks of beef that no amount of chewing would render  palatable. The experience of chewing leather soles or lengths of rubber hose  may not be dissimilar to that provided by a chunk of this restaurant's fajitas.  Nor was this wretched beef an isolated incident, because beef tacos served two  nights later included equally tooth-defying meat. These tacos were filled with  bits of steak rather than the locally familiar shredded beef, which would have  been fine, except that many pieces were both tough and raw.  </P> <P> Things went so badly on the second visit, in fact, that one guest finally  tossed down his fork and declared, "This place is the pits." Several dishes  arrived stone-cold on super-heated plates, suggesting that they had been  prepared too soon, and that an ineffective attempt to reheat them had been  made. The good, fragile corn chips and demure salsa that arrived gratis with  the menus on the previous visit never appeared, and all but one of the desserts  were unavailable, but there was one thread of consistency between the two  dinners: Sopapillas, the famous fried, puffed bread of New Mexico cooking, were  not to be had on either occasion. They appear at the head of the menu (the  description mentions orange honey and honey butter), and they may be good, when  they're on hand.  </P> <P> To base a Southwestern-style pizza on a cornmeal crust seems a natural, but  this one was so dry, thick and hard that it seemed like half-baked clay -- the  topping of fresh tomatoes, three cheeses and crumbled chorizo was wasted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spiced Tomato Sauce  </P> <P> The blend of cornmeal and hominy that encased chunks of moist duck and mushroom  in the tamales, on the other hand, was soft and succulent, and nicely picked up  by the spiced tomato sauce that blanketed the dish. A highly-seasoned stew of  fresh corn accompanied the tamales and was, all in all, one of the restaurant's  best preparations.  </P> <P> A sleeper on the menu is the "lemon peppered" linguine, which tasted of neither  lemon nor pepper but did offer the soft, seductive flavor of saffron in every  bite. A smooth, creamy and light dish, this was an example of Southwestern  updating headed in the right direction. The menu also offers a second pasta, of  noodle pockets stuffed with sage-scented chicken.  </P> <P> Among other dishes are gazpacho, posole (a stew of chicken and hominy), halibut  tacos, barbecued salmon, rib eye steak (with a "pistachio Dijon pesto" that  sounds like a classic among culinary mixed metaphors) and a peppered chicken  salad.  </P> <P> The menu mentions four desserts, but only the apple raspberry pie was available  on the night dessert was desired. The term "half-baked" may have been invented  in anticipation of that piece of pie, and, at $4.50 a slice, there are better  ways to spend money.  </P> <P> </P> <P> * CAFE COYOTE  </P> <P> 2461 San Diego Ave.  </P> <P> 291-4695  </P> <P> Dinner served nightly.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, including a glass of wine each, tax and tip, $38 to $60.  </P></p>

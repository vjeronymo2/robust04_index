			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Brussels reaches for a tougher trade weapon The European Commission is poised to drop its inhibitions about using countervailing duties as part of a tougher approach to tackle illicit trade practices by third countries. The new policy stems from small but significant changes in European Union trade regulations which have been tacked on to rules to be adopted as part of the Uruguay Round, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade global trade accord. It also fits into a wider pattern of Europe slowly but steadily strengthening its trade weaponry, a process accelerated by the need to harmonise trade rules within the EU as a result of the single market and the Gatt agreement itself. Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, outlined the changes last week in a speech to the toy manufacturers of Europe in which he claimed that Europe had been 'too shy' in using countervailing duties to combat unfair traders. 'This is no longer the case and the Commission will react quickly to complaints lodged under the new countervailing regulation,' he promised. In future, the Commission intends to adopt a US-style definition of subsidies which will focus on the 'benefit' to the company concerned. Present European rules mean that the Commission assesses the 'cost to the government' of providing subsidies. Officials says this last definition is harder to calculate and usually leads to a lower valuation of damages. 'We (the Europeans) were always hampered because the Americans had a tougher definition of subsidies,' a trade official said. However, other Brussels officials acknowledged that the EU had rarely used countervailing duties for fear of provoking retaliation against Europe's heavily subsidised farm exports. The Uruguay Round agreement to cut export subsidies in agriculture meant Brussels would be less inhibited about using this line of attack. In similar vein, the Commission intends to make it easier for individual companies to seek redress against unfair trade in goods, services, and intellectual property in markets other than the EU. In the past, companies were asked to raise complaints through their umbrella industries. The Commission said the new measures were 'absolutely categorically different' from the controversial Section 301 trade weapon which the US has used to prise open markets. It emphasised that the EU would resort to retaliation, only after exhausting the disputes procedures set out in the new World Trade Organisation. The WTO is due to come into force after the Gatt agreement is ratified, with the target date falling in December. As part of the Gatt deal reached last December, the EU agreed to strengthen trade weapons, allowing the Commission's preliminary decisions to use anti-dumping or anti-subsidies to become definitive by a simple majority vote in the Council of Ministers. Previously, Commission action could be blocked by a minority of free-trade leaning countries, led by the UK and Germany. Also, ministers made it harder for free-traders to block Commission use of safeguard measures against imports with which the EU has preferential trade arrangements. Blocking minorities are still required to invoke safeguard measures against countries with non-preferential arrangements and in the area of textiles.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Observer: Taking the Mickey? Guess who's coming to Disney? That grand old trouper Sidney Poitier, who has spent over 40 years in show business and starred in more than 40 films, has popped up on the board of The Walt Disney Company. Poitier's reputation has stood the test of time better than Disney's. The first African American to make it big in Hollywood - he was knighted by the Queen in 1968 - Poitier has gone from strength to strength in his later years. Not so Walt Disney, which seems to have lost its stock market magic. Euro Disney continues to turn in hefty losses, attendance is sagging at US theme parks, and the death of Frank Wells and the noisy departure of Jeffrey Katzenberg put a big question mark over the group's top management. Not surprisingly, Disney is keeping us in suspense about Poitier's latest role. The official release says that the academy-award winning entertainer will fill the unexpired term of the late Frank Wells, Disney's president. Does this mean that he is Wells's replacement? And how old is Poitier? Disney says 67, the history books say closer to 71. Disney chief executive Michael Eisner was enjoying the Thanksgiving holiday yesterday, like the rest of the US, so no one was able to elaborate on his odd comment that 'Sidney's talent is more than screen deep'.</p>

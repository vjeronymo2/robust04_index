			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Inland Revenue assessment error - At a Glance Taxpayers would be well advised to study their assessments closely this year following a highly critical report released yesterday from the National Audit Office on the work of the Inland Revenue. Of the roughly 5m Schedule D (self-employed) and Schedule E (pay-as-you-earn) taxpayers who currently receive assessments, 3.2m had to receive at least one revised assessment - in most cases because they had been asked to pay too much tax. In the majority of cases, the reasons for the problems were the fault of the taxpayer: providing wrong information or failing to supply it on time. But for 500,000 taxpayers, it was the Inland Revenue that was at fault. And taxpayers or their professional advisers were at least as likely as the Revenue to notice the error and request adjustments. In 62 per cent of these cases, the cause was incorrect allowances and reliefs made by inspectors, and in 22 per cent a failure to use information already provided. A further 11 per cent was put down to miscalculation of income and 3 per cent to incorrect deductions. The Revenue has pledged to tighten checks and improve levels of accuracy, as well as to publish new quality targets.</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MATTINGLY'S 2 HOMERS HELP YANKEES DOWN WHITE SOX, 10-7  </P> <P> Last season, the New York Yankees had three All-Stars -- Dave Winfield, Rickey  Henderson and Don Mattingly. Now, with Winfield on the disabled list and  Henderson having been traded to the Oakland A's, Mattingly is viewed as the  team leader.  </P> <P> He responded in proper fashion Thursday, two home runs -- for the second time  in 11 days -- in the Yankees' 10-7 victory over the Chicago White Sox in New  York.  </P> <P> "That Mattingly is unbelievable," said Chicago Manager Jeff Torborg, a Yankee  coach for seven seasons. "I used to like him."  </P> <P> Mattingly's three-run homer in the second inning gave New York a 4-0 lead.  Then, after Jimmy Jones and new Yankee Greg Cadaret had squandered a 6-1 lead,  Mattingly tied the score with a leadoff homer in the seventh off loser Shawn  Hillegas (3-7).  </P> <P> "I hit a high fastball and a slider in," Mattingly said. "I think the slider  was what he wanted. I don't know about the fastball."  </P> <P> Mattingly has 10 homers this season, all in Yankee Stadium. It was the 13th  multiple-homer game of his career.  </P> <P> "I keep trying to keep the ball down," joked Mattingly, who didn't hit his  first homer of the year until May 24. "It seems we've done a little bit better  since I've been swinging the bat better. Our offense seems to have come around  a little bit."  </P> <P> Cadaret (1-0), was the beneficiary of Mattingly's power, gaining his first  victory since last Sept. 18.  </P> <P> Cadaret was acquired from Oakland on Wednesday with Eric Plunk and Luis Polonia  in the trade for Rickey Henderson. The three former A's took an overnight  flight from California and got to New York early Thursday morning.  </P> <P> "I thought Cadaret threw the ball pretty well for being in strange territory  and getting here an hour before we were supposed to be dressed," Yankee Manager  Dallas Green said.  </P> <P> Dave Righetti relieved at the start of the eighth and finished for his 12th  save.  </P> <P> Green, however, was unhappy with Jones, who allowed nine hits and five runs in  4 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> "The White Sox are not exactly a version of the '27 Yankees," Green said. "When  you're a professional pitcher, especially when you have runs to work with, you  should be able to get people out. That's elementary."  </P> <P> After Mattingly tied the score, Mel Hall doubled with one out. Jesse Barfield  then walked and, one out later, Tom Brookens, who had three hits, hit an RBI  single.  </P> <P> Third baseman Steve Lyons failed to handle center fielder Dave Gallagher's  throw and the ball bounced into the dugout, allowing Barfield to score.  </P> <P> Ken Phelps added a run-scoring single in the eighth.  </P> <P> New York out-hit the White Sox, 15-13. Gallagher led Chicago with four hits.  The Yankees' Steve Sax had three hits for the fourth time in six games.  </P> <P> Cadaret replaced Jones with one out in the fifth after Daryl Boston's three run  home run, his second of the game, pulled the White Sox to 6-5.  </P> <P> Cadaret gave up two runs in the seventh as Chicago went ahead, 7-6. Catcher Bob  Geren threw away a bunt for an error, allowing the tying run to score, and Greg  Walker followed with an RBI single.  </P> <P> Chicago outfielder Ivan Calderon left the game in the fifth inning after  reinjuring his chest and may have to be put on the disabled list.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 3, Kansas City 2 -- Rob Deer's two-run homer tied the game in the  ninth and Greg Brock's fielder's choice in the 10th scored the winning run as  the Brewers rallied at Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Deer hit his homer off Kansas City relief ace Steve Farr (0-3).  </P> <P> Farr had retired Brock to open the ninth, but Glenn Braggs doubled and Deer  followed with his 17th homer.  </P> <P> "I knew I hit it pretty good but the way the wind was blowing in I just took  off running," Deer said. "I saw (Willie) Wilson go back to the fence and saw  him jump for it and I said, 'No, we've been out here too long.' "  </P> <P> In the 10th, Paul Molitor doubled to center with one out and Robin Yount was  walked intentionally. When Gus Polidor singled to left to load the bases, the  Royals put Bill Pecota into the lineup to give them a five-man infield.  </P> <P> Brock then hit a grounder to Frank White. The second baseman got Polidor on the  force at second despite bobbling the ball, but shortstop Brad Wellman's throw  to first was not in time to get the sliding Brock as Molitor scored the winning  run.  </P> <P> Chuck Crim (7-4), pitched the 10th inning, replacing Ted Higuera, who gave up  six hits in nine innings. Higuera also struck out six and walked three.  </P></p>

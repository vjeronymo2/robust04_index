			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned that most of our people think that  North Korea's true intention for proposing a North-South summit  is aimed at getting out of the present crisis and that it would  be very difficult to hold a summit. However, they absolutely  support a North-South summit.    The result of a telephone poll conducted by Media  Research--a  public opinion survey organization--among 1,000 men and women  above the age of 20 throughout the country, except Cheju Island,  showed that concerning the true intention of North Korean  President Kim Il-song for proposing a North-South summit, 76.3  percent of the respondents said his proposal is a one-time  [ilsijogin] proposal aimed at getting out of the present crisis,  including sanctions against North Korea.    Regarding the possibility of the actual holding of a  North-South summit, 50.8 percent, over half of all of the  respondents, gave a negative reply. In particular, 64.7 percent,  the absolute majority, responded that UN sanctions against North  Korea should be continually pushed ahead. Thus, a considerable  number of people showed a wait-and-see position on the summit.    Meanwhile, concerning the holding of a North-South summit  itself, 92.8 percent, the absolute majority of the respondents,  support the holding of the summit, and 65.7 percent assessed  that the North-South summit would bring about positive results  for a solution to the nuclear problem and for attaining  cooperative relations between the North and the South. Moreover,  56.1 percent of respondents replied that the summit would make  positive contributions to the issue of national reunification,  thus showing considerable expectations for the North-South  summit.</p>

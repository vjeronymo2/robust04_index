Mr. Akashi said that he was "deeply concerned  about the reluctant and negative reply" from the international  community to the reinforcement request for Bosnia.    Meanwhile, General Cot criticized NATO's attitude because of  its readiness to send troops to Bosnia only after a  comprehensive peace agreement has been reached. It is "a funny  and not very brave decision," he said. "Anyone can change their  minds and send troops to Bosnia tomorrow morning. I really  would like the United States to send troops tomorrow morning,"  he added. "I need men immediately, but the nations which could  dispatch troops immediately can be counted on the fingers of one  hand," said Cot, who mentioned the United States, Great Britain,  and France in this regard.    "Plans were drawn up by NATO providing for 100,000 troops.  This was then reduced to 50,000. Today, I am asking for 10,000  men. If one does not want everything that has been achieved in  Sarajevo at the cost of incredible efforts to be completely  undone, then those troops must come immediately," the French  general stressed. "If they do not come rapidly, I am afraid  that what has been won will be quickly lost."</p>

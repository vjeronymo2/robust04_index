			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] As elections draw nearer--they are  scheduled for 30 September-1 October--a progovernment weekly has  criticized Slovak writers for being heavily involved in partisan  politics. Commentator Nina Hradiska, writing in the 2 May NOVE  SLOVO BEZ RESPEKTU, charged that unspecified writers are  becoming increasingly vocal in support of their candidates and,  "forgetting their proper social mission," some of them are  acting as unabashed partisan activists. "With great zeal, they  are turning into politicians...day in and day out, they display  the irresistible urge not only `to be with it' but also `to be  in it.'" This misplaced enthusiasm, according to Hradiska, is  particularly noticeable when there is an opportunity "to get  publicity and an equally important chance to get lucrative  rewards." This, she said, reminded her of a popular joke from  the communist period: "Why do we build socialism with such  enthusiasm? Because it is easier than to work!" She concluded:  "Today the easiest thing is to dabble in politics."    A recent article printed in the weekly LITERARNY TYZDENNIK,  published in Bratislava by the Syndicate of Slovak Writers, an  organization leaning ideologically toward former Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar, seems to bear out Hradiska's critical  contention.    Writing in the 29 April issue of LITERARNY TYZDENNIK, the  veteran novelist and essayist Vladimir Minac attacked by name a  number of prominent Meciar opponents who support the current  anti-Meciar coalition. With emotion, Minac rejected their  political credentials and characterized them as turncoats, who  have abandoned "the cause of Slovak freedom. " He found them to  be a peculiar kind of "political transvestite," without  principles and conscience, who shun daylight and public  disclosure, preferring "to change their clothes and their makeup  under the cover of darkness, often behind the castle walls [an  allusion to the residence of the Slovak president], because they  hate it when people catch them while they are changing their  disguise; they would much rather appear in public already  freshly remade, complete with their old speech defects and their  brand new faults."    One after another, Minac presented his fanciful character  sketches of Ludovit Cernak, Roman Kovac, Michal Kovac, and Peter  Weiss. Cernak and Roman Kovac were described by him as musclemen  showing off their newly acquired muscle power. Michal Kovac--the  name in Slovak means "blacksmith"--is presented as attempting to  shoe an unruly, kicking horse (Meciar), while Peter Weiss,  previously "the humble servant of the working man," was  portrayed sporting the "armor of power," which prevents him from  "hearing the voices of his neighbors."    The brunt of Minac's derision was reserved for the KDH  [Christian Democratic Movement] chairman, Jan Carnogursky, who  was presented as "the senior master of Slovak political  transvestitism." Minac accused him of hypocritically pretending  to be a champion of Slovak independence while exerting great  effort to extinguish it." In a cryptic and bizarre reference to  Carnogursky's involvement with the German Adenauer Foundation,  Minac also charged Carnogursky with being in the service of the  Order of German Knights," which for many centuries efficiently  and charitably kept exterminating Carnogursky's dear neighbors,  the Poles." Carnogursky, suggested Minac, "either has no  historical memory or is a man...without norms and thus also  without conscience."    Minac summed up his observations by charging that the  contemporary Slovak "political scene is rapidly being victimized  by bolshevism" and that "lies are becoming rampant in it." He  branded the present "broad" governmental coalition of left and  right parties "a fusion of black cassocks with pink panthers," a  political arrangement that is bound "to accomplish the full  rebolshevization" of the country. Should it succeed, warned  Minac, "that would be it, amen, darkness." He then proceeded to  criticize also the Slovak media, which he accused of  subservience and a lack of moral convictions. Slovak  journalists, charged Minac, "are literally outdoing themselves  in enjoying their new mercenary role as they provide the new  ministers [of the Moravcik government] the most fitting answers  to appropriately chosen questions--the same way it used to be  during the dullest times of the old regime." He concluded: "They  find themselves in a state of bliss because now they have  available a great number of new orifices they can crawl into.  Transvestites dance to their own peculiar music. That is why  transvestite politicians need their own transvestite media."</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Signs of revival in executive recruiting EXECUTIVE recruitment is showing signs of recovery with the highest growth for five years recorded in demand for staff, the latest quarterly survey by MSL, the human resource consultancy, shows, Robert Taylor writes. Overall senior recruitment rose by 15 per cent but the biggest growth in demand has been in the high technology sector, which rose 117 per cent in the quarter to September, followed by sales and marketing with a 73 per cent improvement. There was a 50 per cent increase in the demand for senior managers in retailing, 48 per cent in energy related industries, and 27 per cent in general management. The survey's quarterly index - which began in 1959 - is based on the monitoring of advertised demand for executives and managers. The trend for the first six months of the year was flat although this was an improvement on the previous 17 months of steady decline.</p>

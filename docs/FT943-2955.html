			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): New research on proteins Scientists working for the Medical Research Council's cellular immunology unit in Oxford have found that the interactions between proteins on cell surfaces of the immune system are far weaker than had been assumed. The research team has been examining proteins, known as adhesion molecules, which are distributed on the T lymphocyte, a white blood cell which patrols the bloodstream looking for viruses, bacteria and foreign materials, known as antigens. The findings, which were disclosed in this week's Trends in Biochemical Sciences, are expected to be important in the design of drugs based on inhibiting adhesion molecules, in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis where the immune system mistakes the body's cells for antigens.

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: MULLEN NEW CHIEF OF MAY CO., CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> May Department Stores Co. has appointed David P. Mullen to succeed Kenneth F.  Sokol, who is retiring as president and chief executive of its Los  Angeles-based May Co., California division.  </P> <P> Mullen, previously was president of Filene's, a 19-store May Department Stores  division based in Boston.  </P> <P> He will assume his new position on Jan. 15. May Co. California includes 37  stores in Southern California and Nevada.  </P> <P> Mullen, 56, began his career with the Cleveland-based Higbee's department store  chain, serving in a variety of merchandising positions before joining the  Washington-based Woodward &amp; Lothrop department store chain in 1972. He was  named president of Woodward &amp; Lothrop in 1972. He joined the St.  Louis-based May Department Stores in 1988 as president of the Phoenix-based  Goldwaters department store division, relinquishing the post the same year to  take the position at Filene's.  </P> <P> Sokol, 62, is retiring after a 31-year career with May Department Stores.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Khuzin: "On the Theatre of Party Activities"] </F>   [Text] Our newspaper sometimes reports on the  political forces of the oblast. What kind of forces are these,  and what specifically do they do, for example in the electoral  campaigns? --V. SHARKOV, Sysertskiy Rayon.  <H8>  The time of inception </H8>   The first and last elections of USSR people's deputies in  1989 led to a bipolarization of our civil society. For  Sverdlovsk Oblast specifically this meant a conditioal division  of its residents into the "party of the Month" and the "party of  Kudrin." The personified "multiparty system" was one of the  stages of its birth. The groups supporting the candidates for  deputy became that germ of future parties whose inception  occurred specifically during the time of introduction of  alternative choice into the country's political system. Not even  9 months had passed after the elections to the union parliament,  and the first child was born in the Central Urals--the  "Democratic Choice Movement" (DCM).    The next elections, to the Russian parliament, also took  place under conditions of bipolarity of civil society, but it  was already of a higher level. There was a transition from the  personified "bipartisanism" to an organized one--the CPSU  [Communist Party of the Soviet Union] and the DCM competed  against each other. And so, finally, the elections in December  of 1993 demonstrated the polycentric party system. For the first  time in many years, we saw voting according to party lists.    In Russia, as we know, they are slow to hitch up the horses,  but then they ride rather fast. And so it was in the question of  a multiparty system, the country will evidently soon find itself  "at the head of the entire planet." According to the lists of  the RF Minyust [Russian Federation Ministry of Justice], over  120 organizations had the opportunity of participating in the  December elections. Over 50 of them decided to exercise this  opportunity, but only 35 engaged in gathering of voter  signatures needed for participation in the elections under the  proportional system. Twenty-one organizations gathered the  required number of signatures. However, our very rich traditions  of "holding and not letting in" allowed only 13 electoral  associations to enter the final stretch. Moreover, "quite by  accident" it happened that one of the primary political  associations--the National Patriotic Association--"left" the  arena of struggle. This, specifically, may explain the  phenomenon of the Liberal-Democratic Party, which received the  greatest number of votes.    The process of mutual development of political pluralism and  the electoral system for the present day is still far from its  conclusion. This is true of the multi-party system, where the  increase in numbers no longer facilitates the development of  quality. This is true also of the system of elections, where we  have noted shameless administrative intervention in the process  of certain subjects of the electoral campaign. If we take  specifically Sverdlovsk Oblast, we see the immaturity of the  system of elections to the oblast Duma and the organs of local  self-government prior to elections under the proportional  system, or according to party lists.  <H8>  `Bumps and bruises' from past elections </H8>   The December elections to the RF [Russian Federation]  Federal  Assembly are still fresh in our minds. Undoubtedly, their  dominant factor was the activity, agitational and  organizational, of the parties, movements and blocks, which  facilitated the continued re-structuring of civil society.  However, it is not difficult to note their main  peculiarity--weak social roots, a strong cadre-oriented  character, and a non-systematic method of work.    Even before the elections, it was quite obvious that the  upcoming campaign would lead to changes in the power ratio  between the center and the regions, in favor of the former. The  elections by party lists gave an undisputed priority to the  candidates from Moscow and St. Petersburg. Even the introduction  of the standard on the right to break down the party list of  candidates for deputy into regional groups did not help. Plus,  by some inscrutable administrative means, the electoral  districts in the center turned out to be smaller in their number  of voters than those in the provincial regions. And this meant  that there were relatively more of them. Why should we now be  surprised when around 62 percent of the deputies in the State  Duma are from Moscow?    Another rather new situation for us is the change in the  relationship between the role of the individual and the  organization. The introduction of party lists made it possible  for individual candidates to seemingly hide behind the curtain  of the party or the leader of their block, as a result of which  there has been a depersonification of the candidate corps. Many  of those who "did not get the light" of mandate got into the  Duma.    The next peculiarity which we cannot discount is the fact  that the "apical nature" of parties conditions the formulation  of a certain eliteness of the elections. A sort of closed system  (group of persons) is formed, which by the method of a periodic  "shuffling of the cards" holds in its hands the authority of  power. To this one might object: What is so bad about that?  After all, the formation of a stable elite in society  facilitates its stable development. Furthermore, politics is not  a matter for housewives. However, there is another side to this  coin: Our elite, as a rule, is far from being uniform, and  periodic "bulldog fights under the rug" cannot facilitate the  development of true democracy, i.e., people's power.    12 December for Sverdlovsk Oblast, as, we might add, also  for  many other oblasts, became a notable day: For the first time,  the majority of voters did not come to the electoral districts.  Thus, one of the most widespread, age-old and chronic illnesses  of traditional democracies--absenteeism (the refusal to vote in  the elections) came also to our parts. It is interesting that  preliminary polls conducted by the Committee on Relations with  Public Associations under the oblast govenment showed that 42-54  percent of the voters intended to participate in the voting.  There were some hopes placed on the "undecided" voters,  particularly since no more than one-fourth of those surveyed  categorically refused to vote. Nevertheless, the result was  somewhat surprising--51 percent of the voters on the average  throughout the oblast refused to vote.    We may cite many reasons why this happened, and far from the  last one of these is the factor of great polyvariation of the  political choice. Many with whom we had occasion to speak since  12 December said just that: There were so many parties and  candidates that it was impossible to sort them out, and  therefore there was no sense in voting.    Our sociological surveys came to the same conclusion. In  mid-November, only one in ten respondents considered himself  informed on the platforms of the parties and candidates.  Approximately four out of five persons surveyed in different  parts of the Central Urals noted that they did not know about  the draft constitution, the statute on elections and the  programs of those hoping to be elected to the Federal Assembly.  <H8>  So what is the choice? </H8>   According to the all-federal party lists, there were 37  people nominated from Sverdlovsk Oblast. Among them: From  "Choice of Russia"--10; from the Democratic Party (Travkin)--5;  from the "Future of Russia--New Names" block--5; from the  Movement for Democratic Reform (Sobchak)--3; from PRES [Party  for Russian Unity and Accord] (Shakhray)--3; from "KEDR"--3; two  each from the LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia], the  Agrarian Party and the "Civic Union", and one each from the  Russian Communist Party and "Yabloko." Thus, out of 13 blocks  our oblast countrymen were represented in 11 of them.    Altogether by territorial okrugs in the oblast there were 34  candidates presented. Of those, three were from the  double-mandate district to the Federation Council, 22 were from  blocks and parties, and 12 were from the groups of electors to  the State Duma.    And so, what choice did we make?    Most apparent is the rather small percentage of those who  voted against all the electoral blocks--only 3. We may assume  that the main mass of those who did not come to the polls was  also "against everyone."    The political breakdown of forces among the oblast's voters  may easily be expressed in a table, grouping together all the  electoral blocks and groups: The pro-presidential ("Choice of  Russia," Yabloko, PRES and RDDR [Russian Movement for Democratic  Reform); the centrist ("Future of Russia--New Names," "Civic  Union," the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia], "Dignity and  Charity," "KEDR," and "Women of Russia") and the opposition  (CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation], APR [Agrarian  Party of Russia], LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia]).  The results of the voting by percentage of voters were as  follows:    District           Pro-presidential     Centrist     Opposition     Against                                                                      all                                                                      blocks   Artemovskiy        32                   13           37             5   Verkh-Isetskiy     57                   14           17             5   Kamensk-Ural       44                   19           23             5   Nizhnetagil        47                   17           22             5   Ordzhonikidze      58                   14           17             4   Pervouralsk        40                   18           28             5   Serovskiy          45                   19           24             6   All                46                   17           24             --      As we see from the figures presented above, the fellow  countrymen of the first RF [Russian Federation] President on the  whole retain their ties. The elections to the Federal Assembly  also showed an exceptional weakness and erosion of the political  center and a considerable polarization of society. Evidently,  the times of the centrists have not yet come, and the logic of  the "revolutionary" situation and civic opposition remains in  force. The weakness of the center is explained by its  fragmentation, by the high degree of differentiation of these  forces, by the absence of a unifying organizational principle  and an outstanding individual capable of organizing the center.    Unlike the blocks of general political forces, the elections  showed the weakness of the functional blocks which are oriented  toward a certain social group or social problem. The only  exception to this was the "Women of Russia," which won 8 percent  of the votes.    Such a peculiarity of the elections as lack of  correspondence  of political affiliations of many voters in voting on different  bulletins also did not escape the eye of the specialists. For  example, in the Artemovskiy Electoral District, where the  candidates for the State Duma represented the most varied  political forces, by party lists the LDPR was victorious, by the  single-mandate district--the candidate from the Agrarian Party,  and the majority upheld the presidential draft constitution. And  the same voters were voting on all of these.  <H8>  The main characters </H8>   There are already over 700 public associations registered  with the oblast justice administration. The most numerous group  of these is represented by various funds--around 15 percent.  Sports and cultural organizations comprise approximately the  same amount.    Twelve percent of those registered are youth organizations,  the largest of which is the oblast organization of the Russian  Union of Youth, the Association of Student Youth, the section of  the Russian Union of Young Entrepreneurs, and the Association of  Youth Organizations.    A large relative share is comprised of organizations of  former military servicemen and veteran's organizations (around 8  percent), invalids (around 5 percent), and women (around 2  percent). Of the ecological organizations (around 4 percent),  most are territorial sections of the "Chernobyl" Union.    The dominant role among professional organizations belongs  to  the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Sverdlovsk Oblast,  aside from which there are the Independent Trade Union of  Miners, the Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the  Partnership of Trade Unions of the city of Yekaterinburg.    The Sverdlovsk Oblast Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs was the most influential among entrepreneurial  organizations.    Cossack associations comprise the registered Cossack  stanitsas [villages], which are affiliated with two primary  organizations: The Yekaterinburg section of the Orenburg Cossack  Troops [OCT] and the Isetskiy section of the OCT.    There are around 50 organizations registered with the oblast  justice administration which have a clearly expressed political  character. These comprise over 6 percent of the overall number.  One in every three has all-Russian status, one in six has oblast  status, and every other one has city or rayon status. One in six  speaks out as a political party, and one in four--as a rights  protection organization.    The absolute figures are not presented here for one  reason--their make-up is constantly changing: Some "fade into  history," others register again, and still others re-register  under new names.    By the beginning of March the oblast electoral commission  had  registered 29 public associations which wanted to take part in  the elections. These may be divided into specifically political  (party and non-party) and functional (corporative) groups.    The political group is made up of about 12 organizations  which are usually called "democrats," 4 centrist organizations  ("Transformation of the Urals," "Ural Center," DPR, and RSM  [Russian Union of Youth], and finally, 7 opposition  organizations--of communist, socialist and national-patriotic  directionality.    The second group is comprised of associations which have a  clear function of reflecting the interests of a specific  category. The "Russian Fund for Charity and Health," the "Beer  Lovers Society", etc. may also conditionally be classed in this  group.    Many socio-political associations have for a comparatively  long time been preparing for the struggle for seats in the  oblast Duma and the organs of local self-government. The  temporary statutes on elections which were ratified by the head  of administration clearly did not suit them by the very  procedure by which they are held as well as by the number of  seats in the representative bodies and the functions of these  bodies.    The definite dissatisfaction with the rules of the  pre-electoral struggle nevertheless did not decrease the number  of those wishing to participate in them. The change in  principles, according to which the elections will be conducted  on 10 April, defined a certain re-grouping of the political  forces. One of the main determining factors will evidently  become the multi-mandate districts.    The political blocks which had consolidated before the 13  December elections began to break up in order to try to win the  maximum number of mandates in the multi-mandate districts. Thus,  for example, "Choice of Russia" "fell apart" into "Choice of  Russia" proper, the Fund for Support of the First RF President,  "Our City," "Rebirth of Self-Government and Regions," "Action,"  "Rebirth," the Party of Economic Freedom and the Republican  Party.    The opposition forces had not joined together in the last  elections, and they are also speaking out individually at the  upcoming ones. The rise in the ratings of the communist and  socialist organizations which has recently become apparent  organizationally inspires the leftist opposition embodied by the  oblast organizations of the CPRF (V. Novoselov), RCWP [Russian  Communist Workers' Party] (V. Sarvarov), the "Rabochiy"  ["Worker"] association, as well as the association of workers.  The national-patriots will be represented at the elections by  "Russian Union" (V. Ilyish).    Around 70 percent of the oblast residents polled in February  of this year had already decided which political forces they  would vote for. Thirty spoke out in support of the independent  candidates. Naturally, the results of such a survey do not yet  warrant far-reaching conclusions. However, they did illuminate  certain tendencies and proportions. We may assume that the  future oblast Duma will be divided into four parts: One-fourth  will represent the democratic orientation, one-fifth--the  centrist, another one-fifth--the opposition, and one-third will  remain with the "independents." The final breakdown of forces in  the Duma, of course, will depend on the degree of "independence"  of the latter, and one conclusion is apparent already today: The  deputies of this Duma are simply doomed to cooperation, and this  will require of them a high degree of political and purely human  tolerance.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nuri Talabani, university law professor in Iraqi </F> Kurdistan: "Persecution of the Kurds by Surrounding Them With a  Suffocating Blockade"]    [Text] It is regrettable that the crimes of the Iraqi  regime did not lead to punishment of the perpetrator or even to  international condemnation until the regime invaded Kuwait and  mounted another attack on Kurdistan, which resulted in about 2  million Kurds heading toward the mountains and toward  international borders compelling the UN Security Council to  issue its Resolution 688 on 5 April 1991 concerning guaranteeing  human rights in the Kurdish area in particular and in Iraq in  general. But the Iraqi regime has continued its hostile policy  in violation of the provisions of the above-mentioned UN  resolution even after it was issued. We refer, in particular, to  the regime's imposition of the economic blockade on the  liberated area of Kurdistan, which currently includes the  governorates of Irbil, Dahuk, al-Sulaymaniyah, as well as part  of Kirkuk, and its continued implementation of the policy of  forced relocation and Arabization [of Kurds] in the Kirkuk and  Khanaqin areas and the Kurdish areas in al-Mawsil, which are  presently under the control of the Baghdad government. The  regime is also continuing to arrest Kurdish citizens in these  areas and to execute many of them without trials. In addition to  all this, the regime is continuing to follow a policy of  genocide against the people of southern Iraq, is draining their  marshes, and is mounting constant military campaigns against the  inhabitants and using chemical weapons against them.    All of the UN Security Council resolutions dealing with  Iraq,  including Resolution 688, were issued because of the regime's  aggressiveness and violation of the precepts of international  law, as well as human rights in Iraq. There are lots of measures  that the international community could take against the Iraqi  regime in order to ensure compliance with the above-mentioned  resolution, and they include the following:    1) Lifting the international economic blockade against Iraqi  Kurdistan.    In order to justify keeping the international economic  blockade against the liberated areas of Iraqi Kurdistan, some  people quote the fact that these areas are part of Iraqi  territory and that one should not lift the blockade against them  as long as a blockade was imposed against Iraq in its entirety.  This pretext is nothing more than a pure formality, resembling  the pretext for non-intervention in the internal affairs of  sovereign nations, even if human rights are violated.  Fortunately for persecuted peoples, this pretext ended with the  end of the Cold War and violations of human rights are now  considered grounds that permit intervention under any  circumstances and conditions.    The issuing of any law or piece of legislation, whether  domestic or international, takes place because of particular  reasons, which are usually called "compelling reasons for  legislation." As we know, the compelling reasons for the  Security Council's issuing its resolution dealing with the  imposition of the economic blockade against Iraq were to punish  the Iraqi regime and to force it to comply with other  resolutions that the Security Council had issued. The inclusion  of the liberated areas of Kurdistan in the resolution imposing  the blockade against Iraq is a tremendous injustice against the  Kurdish people. The reason for this is that the Kurdish people  have never been part of this regime, but rather they have always  been among their fundamental victims.    Even with regard to the second war in the Gulf, which  brought  on the imposition of the blockade against Iraq, it is a fact  that the Kurdish people participated in it only incidentally.  This is because most of the Kurdish soldiers gradually left the  ranks of the Iraqi armed forces after Iraqi forces entered  Kuwait. During the attack against the Iraqi forces on the night  of 17 January 1991, most of the Kurdish soldiers had already  left the ranks of the army. As we know, it is not right to  punish a person or a party for a deed that that person or party  has neither committed nor participated in committing, especially  if the person or party is one of the foremost victims of the  perpetrator--which, in this case, is the Iraqi regime.    The Iraqi regime that began its invasion of Kuwait at the  beginning of August 1990 had already begun its aggression  against the Kurdish people starting in the latter part of March  1975 by destroying its cities and villages and waging genocide  against them. The result of this policy by the regime was the  destruction of more than 4,500 Kurdish villages and dozens of  their principle towns, the killing of more than 100,000 Kurds in  the notorious looting operations, chemical attacks on Kurdish  cities and towns, and the forced relocation of tens of thousands  of Kurdish families to southern Iraq where they were forced to  live in compulsory "collectives." The imposition of the  international economic blockade on Kurdistan has led to  punishing the victim instead of the criminal who has gotten off  scot-free, except from the blockade--the effects of which are  being suffered only by the Iraqi people in general, and the  Kurdish people in particular because they are not included in  the scope of government supply operations.    One of the strange ironies is the fact that the Iraqi regime  does not consider the liberated area of Kurdistan to be part of  Iraq and treats it as if it were a hostile country. For this  reason, the regime has proceeded to impose still another  economic blockade on this area and is preventing food supplies,  fuel, and fuel supplies from reaching Kurdistan. Recently it  agreed to sell fuel and fuel supplies to the government of the  territory of Kurdistan through the international aid  organizations, which undertook to pay the Iraqi Government for  these materials in U.S. dollars at official prices. The Iraqi  Government took another despotic measure against the territory  of Kurdistan when it made the decision to cancel the 25-dinar  denomination of Iraqi currency in May of 1993 and then prevented  people from Kurdistan from going to Baghdad to exchange the  25-dinar bills that they had in their possession. This hurt  people very badly and inflicted great damage on Kurdistan's  economy--to the tune of hundreds of millions of Iraqi dinars.  The Iraqi regime once again proved that it does not consider the  people of Kurdistan to be Iraqi citizens, but rather as hostile  foreigners. A Kurdish citizen feels this look of hostility when  he is forced to cross the government "control points" where he  is subjected to harsh treatment that is experienced only by  foreigners who are from a hostile nation. There is absolutely no  justification for the world community's insistence on  maintaining the international economic blockade against  Kurdistan on the pretext that it is part of Iraq. This is why we  see numerous international circles and parliamentary figures and  bodies in many countries demanding that the world community lift  this blockade against Kurdistan, particularly since the creation  of a safe zone in Kurdistan for the purpose of protecting it  from the aggression of the Iraqi regime has given an  international dimension to Resolution 688 in order to grant it  international protection.    2) Compelling the Iraqi regime to lift the state of siege  that it has imposed on Kurdistan.    The imposition of the economic blockade against Kurdistan by  the Iraqi regime was a despotic decision that is in violation of  Security Council Resolution 688 both in letter and in spirit.  The regime's aim in imposing this blockade is to starve the  people of Kurdistan and to drive them away from their homeland  again. The [Security Council] resolution was supposed to prevent  this. Ever since the Iraqi regime imposed the blockade against  Kurdistan in early September of 1991, we were expecting the  international organization to take the initiative to warn the  Iraqi regime and tell it to lift the blockade, particularly  since the leaders in Kurdistan demanded that this organization  intervene with the Iraqi authorities in order to get the  blockade lifted, especially with regard to fuel and fuel  supplies. The Iraqi regime's decision to prevent fuel and fuel  supplies from reaching Kurdistan has led to skyrocketing prices  for these materials. Before the blockade, gasoline used to cost  200 Iraqi fils per gallon, but now, after the imposition of the  blockade against Kurdistan, a gallon of gasoline costs 60 dinars  and sometimes even more. The Iraqi regime's continual prevention  of fuel and fuel supplies from reaching Kurdistan has led to the  cutting down of trees in the forests in order that the wood be  used as fuel during the long and very cold winters, and this has  resulted in damage to the environment there.    Lifting the international and Iraqi blockades against  Kurdistan would make it easier to rebuild the economic  infrastructure that the regime previously destroyed, and would  make it easier for people to go back to working in their fields,  factories, and businesses and not be solely dependent on the  humanitarian aid that international aid organizations are  providing to them.    3) The return of the tens of thousands of Kurdish families,  which were relocated by force, to their Kurdish areas which are  under the control of the Iraqi regime.    The rebellion of 1991, which took place in all parts of  Kurdistan, resulted in the liberation of all of Kurdistan,  including the areas of Kirkuk, Khanaqin, and the Kurdish areas  in al-Mawsil. Then the Iraqi regime mounted a counterattack in  which it used all types of heavy weapons and combat helicopters,  and this enabled them to recover and reoccupy some of the  Kurdish areas, particularly Kirkuk, Khanaqin, Shaykhan, Sinjar,  and other areas. Ever since the regime reoccupied these Kurdish  areas, the Kurds there have been subjected to very bad  treatment. There are mass arrests and kidnappings, they are  killed and their bodies are not even handed over to their  relatives, and whole residential areas are destroyed and their  inhabitants are driven away. The security forces in these  Kurdish areas are also expelling the Kurds and forcing them to  head for the liberated areas of Kurdistan after all their  possessions have been taken away from them. Then Arab bedouins  are brought in to occupy their houses and businesses.  Intervention by international bodies to protect the Kurds in  these Kurdish areas would be considered legitimate intervention  within the framework of the concept of Resolution 688.    The authorities have prevented these families, estimated to  be in the tens of thousands, from returning to their homes in  spite of the agreement that was signed by the Iraqi government  and Kurdish leaders in May of 1991 and in which the regime  committed itself to allowing all Kurds to return to their  original places of residence. Among these Kurds, there are a lot  of people who are afraid to return to their homes because they  were soldiers who deserted or they took up arms against the  regime during the March [1991] rebellion. All of these  families--totalling more than three-quarters of a million Kurds  who live in the liberated areas of Kurdistan--depend on the aid  provided to them by the international aid organizations in order  to survive.    One of the basic aims of Resolution 688 is the return of all  of these Kurdish families to the city of Kirkuk and the other  Kurdish areas that are under the control of the Iraqi regime.  For this reason, action should be taken to implement this humane  demand before these people start slowly dying off. We should  bear in mind that thousands of them have already died as a  result of the spread of diseases and malnutrition, especially  children and older people. But, if they return, this should be  done under the permanent protection of international observers.  This is something that the Iraqi regime has rejected so far,  even though this measure is included in the concept of  Resolution 688.    4) The holding of general elections in Iraq under  international supervision.    In practice, Resolution 688 dealing with guaranteeing human  rights in Iraq can be carried out only by a government that  represents all the people as a result of the holding of free  elections in all parts of Iraq, but under international  supervision. In this context, there should be a change in the  current elections law, and the electoral districts in Iraq  should be redistributed. The reason for this is that the current  law was set up especially to have members of the ruling Ba'th  Party become members of the National Council. For example,  Paragraph 2 of Article 14 of Modified National Council Law No.  55 of 1980 stipulates that a candidate for the above-mentioned  council "have completed military service or have been exempted  from it and not have committed the crime of desertion or failure  to show up for military service during the time period of  Saddam's al-Qadisiyah [Iraq's war with Iran]." According to  Iraqi law, this is considered to be a major crime punishable by  execution in accordance with Law 137, which was issued on 13  December 1983. Paragraph 5 of the same article stipulates that a  candidate must "not have been convicted of the crime of  conspiracy against the revolution of 17-30 July 1968 or the  ruling regime, or the crime of attempting to overthrow it, or  the crime of being in contact with foreign groups." Paragraph 9  of this article makes another stipulation, previously referred  to, concerning the necessity that the candidate believe "in the  aims and principles of the glorious revolution of 17-30 July."    These conditions naturally lead to keeping out all those who  do not share the opinion of the ruling party concerning the war  with Iran, "Saddam's al-Qadisiyah," and the second Gulf war with  Kuwait.    Furthermore, the above-mentioned law stipulates the  agreement  of the "higher body that supervises elections" to applications  for candidacy, and this higher body includes leading members of  the ruling Ba'th Party and some ministers and national leaders.  The above-mentioned body determines the names of the candidates  and has the right to omit from the list of candidates any  candidate who, in their view, "does not believe in the aims and  principles of the glorious revolution of 17-30 July." Any person  whose name is removed from the list of candidates has the right  to protest this within three days before the Revolutionary  Command Council, whose decision will then be final.    From all of the above, it appears that it is impossible for  non-members of the ruling Ba'th Party and persons who do not  support its policies to become candidates for membership in the  current National Council. For this reason, National Council  Elections Law No. 55 of 1980 should be completely changed.  Furthermore, the electoral districts should be redistributed and  there should be a return to the Chamber of Deputies elections  law which was in effect before 1958, or else a new law should be  legislated.</p>

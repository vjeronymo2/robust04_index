			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brigadier General Nhean Manou, Khmer Royal Armed  Forces [KRAF] General Staff spokesman, said on the afternoon of  22 March that the KRAF is able to attack effectively and occupy  Khmer Rouge-controlled areas to end their secession.    Commenting on a BANGKOK POST report saying that the  government forces had used chemical weapons in the Pailin  onslaught, the KRAF spokesman said the royal government has  never purchased any chemical weapons and that no chemical  weapons have ever been supplied by another country during the  war. He pointed out that in the Anlung Veng and Pailin areas as  well as in (?Kompong Thom Province), more than 10 KRAF  combatants have died after drinking water from streams and ponds  poisoned by the Khmer Rouge.    Regarding the Khmer Rouge strategy, the general said after  the attacks on Anlung Veng and Pailin, their biggest  strongholds, the Khmer Rouge have regrouped at Malai in order to  plan their last- ditch strategy to further their destructive war  against the nation as they have done in the past.</p>

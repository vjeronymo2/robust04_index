			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FIRM'S TECHNOLOGY COULD HERALD NEW GENERATION OF CELLULAR PHONES  </P> <P> When comic strip hero Dick Tracy needed to call the police chief, he never  bothered rifling through his pockets for loose change. The famous detective  simply pushed a few buttons on his two-way wrist radio and, voila, he had  headquarters on the line.  </P> <P> The comic strip's creators could not have known just how sophisticated  telephone communications would become in the 1990s. But a young San Diego  telecommunications company is developing technology that some say will herald a  new generation of cellular telephones that could make Dick Tracy-like  communication affordable to the masses.  </P> <P> Pacific Communication Sciences in Sorrento Valley is working on a digital voice  processor that could allow cellular service providers to squeeze more  conversations onto the already crowded cellular radio waves and thereby bring  down the cost of owning and using portable and mobile phones.  </P> <P> The 70-employee company, founded in 1987, is by no means the only one working  on digital technology. But it achieved a major coup earlier this month when it  landed a $2-million contract with Uniden America, the U.S. subsidiary of Uniden  Japan, one of the world's largest cellular phone manufacturers. The contract  calls for Pacific Communication Sciences to create an integrated circuit-based  voice processor that will go inside Uniden's new digital cellular phone.  </P> <P> If successful, the contract could give Pacific Communication Sciences a  strategic connection to industry leader Uniden and lead to millions of dollars  in business, either from licensing its technology or manufacturing components,  said Michael L. Lubin, executive vice president and co-founder.  </P> <P> The technological leap the cellular phone may soon take would improve service,  increase capacity and eventually make the expensive device affordable to a much  broader market, engineers and industry analysts say. The advance involves a  digital voice-processing technology that is much more efficient than the  analog-based system now used in cellular phones.  </P> <P> "Digital is the wave of the future," said telecommunications analyst Fred Moran  of Moran &amp; Associates in Greenwich, Conn. "The costs (of cellular phones  and service) would come down even without it, but, with digital, they will be  able to provide services to everyone. Eventually, they'll all be digital."  </P> <P> The $2.5-billion cellular telephone industry nationwide is expected to expand  substantially when the price of owning and operating a cellular phone comes  down. The number of cellular phone subscribers, now estimated at about 3.5  million nationwide, is expected to grow to as many as 20 million by 1995,  according to a study by Herschel Shosteck Associates in Silver Spring, Md.  </P> <P> The development of digital technology is key to being able to put that many  people on the system, Shosteck said. Any company that wants to stay in the  cellular industry is looking toward the digital revolution, he said. But the  number of companies with the technical competence to make that transition is  surprisingly small, he added.  </P> <P> "You have an analogy with what happened to long-distance and international  rates when (U.S.) Sprint came onto the market with optic fiber cable," Shosteck  said. "Today, people use the long-distance network 10 times more, and carriers  have had a fourfold increase in revenue."  </P> <P> As a result of the new technology, cellular phone users in major metropolitan  areas will be less likely to get busy signals when trying to make a cellular  call during peak hours. The new telephones, which eventually will require a  complete revamping of the costly cellular ground systems now in place, could be  available for sale as early as 1991.  </P> <P> "I think what you're seeing is the first step toward true personal  communications, meaning that your telephone can accompany you wherever you want  to go," said David Lyon, president of Pacific Communication Sciences. "What  market researchers tell us is that once any of the system manufacturers add  digital, almost all of the (cellular phone service providers) will demand to  add this capacity. It will have an avalanche effect."  </P> <P> For now, the cost of cellular phone service is beyond the reach of most people.  Local providers charge their customers 40 cents a minute during weekday peak  hours. That rate, combined with a $35-a-month service charge, means a typical  customer ends up paying more than $100 a month.  </P> <P> The price of cellular phones, however, has dropped significantly. In 1983, the  lowest-priced phone cost $2,600, Shosteck said. Six years later, the same phone  costs about $525.  </P> <P> Cutting the high cost of cellular phones was one of the challenges that spurred  five ex-M/A-COM Linkabit engineers to found Pacific Communication Sciences in  April, 1987. When M/A-COM's telecommunications division decided to sell off a  satellite project the engineers had helped develop from scratch, they decided  to leave and start their own business.  </P> <P> "When it became clear we didn't know where our future was going, we decided we  wanted a little more control over our destiny," Lyon said.  </P> <P> The five founders put in about $1.5 million of their own money and since have  raised about $8 million in venture capital to get the business off the ground.  Advancing previous innovations at M/A-COM Linkabit, the company soon  established a reputation as a leader in quality voice-compression technology, a  key aspect of digital communication.  </P> <P> That technology went into the creation of Clarity, a digital communication  system made by Pacific Communication Sciences that cuts the costs of  interoffice communications for corporations with overseas offices.  </P> <P> The company's technology also won for the company a soon-to-be-announced  contract with the U.S. government to create a scrambling system that would make  public safety radio channels invulnerable to eavesdropping.  </P> <P> Pacific Communication Sciences' revenue is now running at an annualized rate of  $6 million, mostly from sales of Clarity, Lubin said. The company projects its  1990 revenue at $8 million to $10 million.  </P> <P> The Uniden contract, announced Jan. 3, represents just a fraction of Pacific  Communication's existing business, but could mean millions of dollars in future  sales, Lubin said. Heading the Uniden project is George M. Peponides, an  electrical engineer who joined the company after working at Hughes Network  Systems for five years.  </P> <P> The contract is strictly for research and development, and the terms and  conditions of supplying the digital components that may be developed have yet  to be worked out, Lubin said. But, according to Tom Kawada, executive vice  president of Uniden America, the company will probably buy the rights to the  digital component from Pacific Communication Sciences and manufacture it at  Uniden's Ft. Worth plant.  </P> <P> The new phone, which will first be created for the car phone market, will be  more expensive to manufacture than current models, but those costs probably  will not be passed on to the consumer, Kawada said, adding: "It's kind of a  funny market. Right now, we sell our phones to the service providers for $450.  But they typically sell them for $299. The telephone company gives rebates to  the retailer."  </P></p>

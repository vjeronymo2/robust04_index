			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DINKY THE RAT GIVES PUPILS LESSON ON DEATH, LIFE  </P> <P> Compared to her street-dwelling cousins and country relatives, Dinky the rat  has enjoyed a pampered life.  </P> <P> As the class pet for Scott Leaman's third-grade students at Trabuco Mesa  Elementary School, the brown-and-white rodent has lived two of her 2 1/2 years  in an air-conditioned building with smooth, palm tree-lined walkways, carpeted  classrooms and a spectacular view of the Saddleback Mountains.  </P> <P> Leaman, who brought Dinky to Orange County when he moved from Carlsbad to  Rancho Santa Margarita, uses the gentle animal to teach his students about the  responsibilities of caring for another living creature. Students take turns  feeding him and cleaning the cage, and some are allowed to take Dinky home  during the holidays.  </P> <P> Dinky lived a quiet life, the object of affection and curiosity, until she  developed two large, life-threatening tumors.  </P> <P> Leaman said he was faced with the prospect of preparing the children for the  death of something they loved.  </P> <P> "I was afraid Dinky would have to be put to sleep," Leaman said. "I had to get  the children ready for that, so I read them a story called 'Ten Good Things  About Barney,' in which a cat dies and everyone talks about their good memories  of him.  </P> <P> "So we discussed the good things we would remember about Dinky," he said. "We  also made a decision as a class about what to do with her, and agreed that we  would do whatever the doctor said."  </P> <P> "I was sad," said student Melissa Chapin, 8. "If she had to be put to sleep, we  said it would be the best thing."  </P> <P> The lesson never had to be learned.  </P> <P> Local veterinarian Dr. Ron Kelpe was able to save Dinky by surgically removing  a 1 1/2-inch tumor from her mammary glands and a 3/4-inch tumor from her neck,  at no charge to the school district.  </P> <P> After a nearly two-week convalescence, Dinky was recently returned to the  classroom amid cheers from her pint-sized guardians, who share the chores of  feeding their pet and cleaning her cage.  </P> <P> "I see it, but I don't believe it," said Billy Glas, 8, yelling, "All right,  buddy!  </P> <P> "I've never had a class pet before," Glas explained, his wide-eyed, freckled  face turning serious. "She's one of the best rats I ever knew."  </P> <P> Kelpe showed up for the reunion to give an impromptu science lesson, snipping  Dinky's nine stitches as the students crowded around a table to watch. Some  winced and asked why she didn't scream, but Kelpe assured them that their pal  felt no pain.  </P> <P> Dinky, on the other hand, sat calmly through the ordeal, twitching her whiskers  as if it was an everyday occurrence.  </P> <P> "Believe it or not, Dinky will actually lick your face," Kelpe said. "She is  such a nice little rat."  </P> <P> Now that she has recovered, Dinky is back in her glass cage on a countertop in  the corner of Leaman's classroom, sitting under a huge computer-printed sign  introducing her by her full title, "Dinky C. Reeboks."  </P> <P> "The C stands for Chainsaw," Leaman said of the name concocted by his former  elementary school students in Carlsbad, Dinky's classroom birthplace.  </P> <P> "The boys all wanted Chainsaw and the girls wanted Reeboks," Leaman explained,  laughing at the memory. "I liked Dinky the best, so we used all three names."  </P> <P> Although Kelpe rated Dinky as "strong and healthy," he warned that the tumors  could recur because they are common as rats near the end of their average  three-year life span.  </P> <P> "But if you were a rat, it would be a pretty good life," he said.  </P></p>

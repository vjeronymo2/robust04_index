He called on  all electors, regardless of their ethnic origins, to vote for  those who "will be promoting in parliament ideas of market  economics, for those who stand for a powerful executive branch  and presidential government." He also appealed for support for  the candidates he had proposed.    Nazarbayev expressed the confidence that the people of  Kazakhstan would not "swallow the bait of shallow carpers,  persons pursuing narrow nationalistic personal aims or  populists." Otherwise "we will end up with total discord in  parliament, the kind we see in the `near abroad,'" he said.    In his view, Kazakhstan has a chance to overcome its present  crisis faster than any other CIS country, due to the diligence  of its population, its tremendous natural resources and its  extensive export opportunities. He said some progress had been  made with economic reforms and that gold production had somewhat  gone up. By 1996, he said, the republic would have enough gold  to keep its currency stable without large dollar infusions. The  loans provided by foreign business would top $2.5 Bn [billion]  in that year, he said.    The president also said it was essential to strengthen  political stability in Kazakhstan. "What explains  (international) interest in our state and its influence in the  international arena are not only its natural wealth and  strategic position but also the stability of its social and  political life," he said. In this connection, he called for a  serious attitude to the problems of migration, citizenship and  language and expressed support for the idea of convening an  assembly of peoples of Kazakhstan.    Nazarbayev suggested making amendments to the Constitution  that would authorize parliament to dismiss the president and  would give the president the right to dissolve parliament. He  said he would like the new legislature to be bicameral.    The president said he would urge the new parliament to  launch  an onslaught on crime. He said murderers, rapists and heads of  criminal bands should be put to death without fail. He believes  that citizens of other states who have committed a crime in  Kazakhstan must bot be extradited to their home countries but be  punished in Kazakhstan on the basis of the Kazakh law.    He said stronger penalties were needed for the theft of  motor  vehicles, burglary and robbery, and that the population should  be allowed to keep weapons to defend their homes and property.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / International Company News: SMI slips to L12.2bn despite sales surge SOCIETA Metallurgica Italiana (SMI), the Italian company which is now Europe's biggest maker of semi-finished copper and alloy products, more than doubled group sales to L3,013bn (Dollars 2,437.70m) last year from L1,495bn in 1990. The surge in sales stemmed from SMI's long-awaited acquisition in December 1990 of Kabelmetal, the German non-ferrous metals producer formerly owned by MAN. However, buoyant profits from Kabelmetal - thanks to continuing strong demand in Germany - failed to prevent a sharp fall in SMI's group earnings last year owing to falling product prices and recession in a number of European markets. Net group earnings after minority interests slipped to just L12.2bn from L12.7bn in 1990. Profits before minorities rose to L30.3bn from L15.7bn in 1990. In spite of the profits fall, SMI stressed its confidence in the business by dipping into reserves to pay an unchanged dividend of L35 for ordinary shares and L70 for savings shares. Mr Luigi Orlando, chairman and controlling shareholder, said Spanish and French operations had lost money last year, while Italy had held its own. He blamed the results on poor demand and severe price competition, particularly from state-owned competitors. SMI also suffered from heavy interest charges, which amounted to around L100bn at group level last year, said Mr Sergio Ceccuzzi, managing director. Much of the borrowing stemmed from funding the Kabelmetal purchase, which was originally intended to have been paid in stages over a number of years, but was subsequently renegotiated. Mr Orlando said SMI's priority now was to exploit economies of scale and bring down its cost base. Only when earnings were clearly improving would it be possible to turn to shareholders for new capital to bring down debt, now standing at around L900bn, he stressed.</p>

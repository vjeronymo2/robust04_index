			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FREE CLINIC GETS EMERGENCY GRANT  </P> <P> The South Bay Hospital District has approved a $60,000 emergency grant for the  beleaguered family planning program at the South Bay Free Clinic in Hermosa  Beach. But it declined to approve additional money to support services for two  years, saying that insufficient information was presented to justify the need.  </P> <P> The clinic, which expects to lose as much as $350,000 in family planning and  matching grant money as a result of state budget cuts, had asked for $226,600.  </P> <P> Philip Valera, hospital district executive director, said the board granted the  money to cover the clinic's cash-flow problems. Craig A. Vincent-Jones, clinic  development officer, said $60,000 is a "significant help."  </P> <P> The hospital district's action came one day before the free clinic closed its  Teen Advocate program, which had been funded with family planning money.  </P> <P> That program trained teen-agers to make school presentations on pregnancy  prevention and counsel other teen-agers.  </P></p>

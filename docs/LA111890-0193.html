			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOW, IT'S BAGHDAD BETTY CALLING THE TUNE  </P> <P> The music has improved, but Iraq's propaganda pitch to American soldiers  remains the same: You're risking your life and wasting your time in Saudi  Arabia.  </P> <P> In daily broadcasts on what is now called the Voice of Peace, Baghdad Radio's  English-language programming contains warnings to GIs that they risk coming  down with "craziness" from long spells in the desert.  </P> <P> Announcers, who include a woman dubbed Baghdad Betty by the troops, tell them  that their Arab allies will turn their guns on U.S. soldiers instead of Iraqis.  The messages also raise doubts about the U.S. role in the region.  </P> <P> GIs say they listen to the music but tune out the commentary.  </P> <P> In the tradition of Tokyo Rose during World War II and Hanoi Hannah in Vietnam,  Iraq started its blend of music, news and propaganda when the U.S. military  buildup began after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> In the beginning, the hourlong programs interspersed Arabic music and Western  big-band sounds with taunts.  </P> <P> "To the American soldier in the Saudi Arabia desert," a voice would say. "Would  you like to be one of the cripples who are only lamented in the charity  ceremonies?"  </P> <P> Now, the programs are three hours long and the music is top-40 contemporary  rock and oldies-but-goodies from the '60s and '70s.  </P> <P> The female announcer dubbed Baghdad Betty or a male colleague occasionally  interrupts with comments.  </P> <P> The other day, for instance, an announcer said: "One of your pals even killed  himself a week ago, feeling terribly lonely. And two GIs quarreled with each  other, and one of them shot his colleague after they used to be good friends.  </P> <P> "This is only normal. For one who is not accustomed to live in the desert, and  is forced to do so for so long a time, could easily be driven to craziness.  Then, suicide is the only way out."  </P> <P> The announcer apparently was referring to a U.S. soldier found dead in a shower  on Nov. 8 and the shooting death of a Marine the next day. Military officials  acknowledge the apparent suicide but say the shooting was accidental.  </P> <P> Listening to the radio is one of the few diversions available to the U.S.  troops in Saudi Arabia. The Americans say they listen to Baghdad Betty and her  band but are not unnerved by the propaganda.  </P> <P> Said Staff Sgt. Joseph Herald, 34, member of a field artillery unit from Ft.  Lewis, Wash.: "As long as she plays good music, who cares what she has to say?"  </P></p>

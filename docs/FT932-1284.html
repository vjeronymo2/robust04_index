			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Observer: Exposed Everything's 'new' under the rising sun with the fragmentation of Japan's ruling Liberal Democrats prompting breakaway politicians to set up parties of their own. Earlier this week came the New Harbinger Party, and yesterday leading rebel Tsutomu Hata brought the New Birth Party into the world. Or, at least, that title is one possible translation of the party's homeland name Shinseito. Thanks to the variable meanings of the constituent Japanese characters, it could equally be rendered as the New Raw Party - exposing it to jibes that, in contrast to the New Deal given to the US by Roosevelt, Hata is offering his country the Raw Deal. If Japanese-literate readers can come up with alternatives free of such hostages to fortune, Observer will reward the best with a bottle of malt whisky.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Baijia (4545 4102 1367): "A Shift to the South in </F> Focus and Fulcrum--a Noteworthy Change in Sino-U.S. Relations"]    [Text] Chairman Jiang Zemin and President Clinton had a  formal meeting in the second half of last November in Seattle.  The two leaders agreed that Sino-U.S. relations were very  important. The relations concerned more than bilateral ties;  they should be looked at in a global context, with the focus on  the 21st century. Details of the talks were not revealed, but  the choice of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference  as the venue for the meeting for the two state leaders after an  almost five-year break was itself profoundly significant.  <H5>  Security Considerations Replaced by Economic Factors </H5>   When China and the United States normalized their relations  22 years ago, leaders of the two countries were looking at the  north of Asia. Despite the then ongoing Vietnam war, the two  countries, mainly motivated by a desire to ward off the  hegemonism of the former Soviet Union, improved their relations.  Twenty-two years later, when leaders of the two countries are  thinking of and discussing their relations, they are looking at  the dynamic region of Southeast Asia (including China). The  truth is, the shift of their focus was prompted by the shift of  the overlapping interests (mutual or conflicting) between the  two countries. The shift was reflected not only in geographical  changes, but also in the changed proportions of various key  factors in overall Sino-U.S. relations. Twenty-two years ago,  security was almost the sole factor in Sino- U.S. relations.  Today, the new economic factor is becoming increasingly bigger.  The shift toward the south in Sino-U.S. relations has just  started, but its impact on bilateral relations, multilateral  relations in the Asia-Pacific region, and the future multipolar  world cannot be ignored.  <H5>  The Three Causes Behind the Shift Toward the South </H5>   Why have Sino-U.S. relations shifted toward the south?  Stated simply, there are three causes: First, it was a result  of recent changes and developments in the global political and  economic situation. I do not intend to repeat the arguments as  the movement of the post-Cold War global political world toward  multipolarity and the lone brilliant performance of the  Southeast Asian economy amid the yet-to-recover global economy  have been covered by many articles.    Second, for four years, China stood up to pressures from the  West, increased the pace of reform and opening up, actively  developed relations with countries sharing common borders and  its Asian neighbors, and scored a series of significant results.  As the understanding and trust between China and these  countries grew, an "Asian" political and economic cooperation  distinguished by political independence, economic  interdependence, a fading of ideological differences, mutual  tolerance, and an Asian concept of human rights different from  the West's is taking shape. The entry of China into the East  Asian economy and the considerable growth of its trade ties with  Japan, ROK, and ASEAN countries, injecting new vitality into the  region, made Western countries look at China with a new eye.    Third, the shift toward the south in Sino-U.S relations was  also a result of the new approach toward China adopted by  Clinton since he came to power. In the last few months, the  United States has made relatively important adjustments in its  policy toward China, the most important of which was Clinton's  realization that the Asia-Pacific is a region with great hopes,  a great future and great vitality, one having a vital bearing on  U.S. interests. To solve its domestic economic problems, the  United States needs to strengthen further its ties with the  Asia-Pacific region. To do that, it has to value China's role.  In Clinton's own words: "You cannot isolate a country as big  and important to the world's future as China."    Such a change in U.S. policy should be welcomed. The  disintegration of the Soviet Union and the rapid victory in the  Gulf War created a feeling of invincibility among some Americans  and Westerners and an illusion that with the passing of the Cold  War, it was no longer necessary to maintain strategic  cooperation with China, which explained why they applied  sanctions to China under numerous pretexts. They were  imprisoned in their Cold War mentality. However, to their  surprise, China remained stable politically and more open  economically, and developed just as rapidly. And the problems  confronting the world were not as simple as they thought. U.S.  foreign policy suffered a series of setbacks on the problems of  Russia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and Haiti, showing that the  United States could no longer do what it wanted, and that it  needed to cooperate with China and other countries in dealing  with various thorny world issues. In particular, when they  looked at the southern part of East Asia and found the  prosperity there, the United States and other Western countries  realized that they could no longer afford to neglect the role of  China in the Asia-Pacific region and to pass up the economic  opportunities in China. This can be reasonably described as a  realistic attitude.    The Need To Consider Seriously Two Problems [subhead]    Whether or not Sino-U.S. relations will develop smoothly,  the  shift to the south in the political and economic relations of  the two countries may already signify the beginning of a new  stage demanding that we scrutinize Sino-U.S. relations with a  new eye and perspective.    In this new stage, both sides will encounter some old  problems; for example, whether or not the United States can  abide by the various principles in the three Sino-U.S. joint  communiques; whether or not their differences on problems of  trade, human rights, and arms sales can be properly bridged;  whether or not frictions can be kept at a low level so that they  will not jeopardize overall bilateral ties; and so on. The  general belief is that in the near future, there will be  improvement in Sino-U.S. relations, though not at any fast rate;  and there may also be some complications.    One problem that we should be thinking about, however, is  under the new situation, what kind of new elements may emerge  from, and what kind of new problems we may have to face in  future Sino-U.S. relations. In my view, the following two  points are important:    First, cooperation between the two countries is absolutely  necessary, though competition will run alongside it. In the  early days of improvement in Sino-U.S. relations, the security  interests were clear, easily seen, and mutual. And given the  then limited economic ties, there were no trade frictions.  Cooperation then was relatively smooth. But the situation  began to change in the early 1980's and looked quite different  by the 1990's. When the center of bilateral relations shifted  to the southeastern part of Asia, China and the United States  still shared a common interest in maintaining the security and  stability of the Asia-Pacific region, but on specific issues  their interests began to diverge and even clashed. The Western  media hype about "threats from China" on the Taiwan issue was a  case in point. Another key factor was the increasing  proportions of economic and trade and technological  considerations in Sino-U.S. relations. In economic relations,  what is inevitable is competition. Although China, the United  States, Japan, and other Asia-Pacific countries strongly  complement each other economically, it is plain to see that in  many areas there is competition, and that it is increasingly  fierce. Apart from the economic factor, the Clinton  administration's adjustment of its Asia policy, and its great  concern for it, was also prompted by political considerations.  How to face this cooperation-competition situation in future  Sino- U.S. relations is an important subject we must think  through.    Second, multilateral ties between China, the United States,  and the Asia-Pacific region mean that there will be more  international factors acting as constraints on Sino-U.S.  relations. The "macrotriangular relations" between the United  States, China, and the Soviet Union in the Cold War era were  relatively simple. With the end of the Cold War, the center of  Sino-U.S. relations moved south and exercised far greater  influence on the stability and development of the entire  Asia-Pacific region and made all kinds of relations much more  complicated. On the one hand, the ups and downs of Sino-U.S.  relations will impact on their respective relations with other  Asia-Pacific countries; and on the other hand, developments and  changes in any of their respective relations with Asia-Pacific  countries will bounce back on Sino-U.S. relations. The  prospects for Sino-U.S. relations is a great concern for Asia-  Pacific countries. Lee Kuan-yew recently suggested to the  United States that it take China as its "strategic partner." A  noted Australian personage also criticized the U.S. Government's  attempt to impose its own human rights concepts on Asian  countries. All these illustrate the problem well. Therefore,  how to make use of channels arising from bilateral and  multilateral relations to foster positive development in  Sino-U.S. relations and multilateral relations with the  Asia-Pacific region is another key subject we should think about  and pursue in action.    Of course, describing the shift of the center of Sino-U.S.  relations toward the south does not mean that there are no  common concerns and significant common interests for China and  the United States in Northeast Asia. It is still true to say  that situations in Northeast Asia still stir and sway Sino-U.S.  relations.    I have not intended to conduct a full review of Sino-U.S.  relations in this short article. What I wanted to stress was  the ongoing change of a background factor in Sino-U.S.  relations. The argument that the center of Sino-U.S. relations  has shifted to the south calls for another look. However, I  hope that by offering this argument I can provide a new  perspective in observing and making forecasts on Sino-U.S.  relations.</p>

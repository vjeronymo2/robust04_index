			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Personal view: A fairer way to fund public transport The financing of British public transport is in a mess. More investment is desirable because demand for public transport grew unexpectedly fast in the 1980s, while projects such as the Channel Tunnel and the redevelopment of London's docklands will give rise to even more demand. But these projects have failed to attract significant private funds as the government had hoped; at the same time the government's desire to control public expenditure has limited the amount of public capital that it is prepared to invest. Many believe that public expenditure on transport should be increased. The Labour party has proposed that public corporations should be able to borrow directly from the private sector. But there must always be some limit on public expenditure; merely changing the method of borrowing does not alter its economic consequences. The real requirement is to make the investment more profitable, and the way to do so is to collect more payments from those who benefit. The paradox of investment in public transport is that it can create substantial benefits, especially around cities, yet produces low financial returns because the operator cannot charge many of the beneficiaries of its investment. The users of new or improved services can be made to contribute to the cost in fares, but they cannot be made to pay all the costs of a new underground line, for example. The cost of construction is so high that profit may be unattainable. But the other beneficiaries, the landlords and developers who own property in the area served by the the service, can rarely be made to pay anything for their gains. These gains are represented by increases in the value of property from improved access, or decreases in value avoided by preventing deterioration in access. Property owners in cities have for decades been subsidised by the private and public sector financiers of transport systems, who have made possible the expansion of city-centre activities but have not profited from their pains. Where a large new development is undertaken, such as that at Canary Wharf in London's docklands, specific improvements in transport will be essential to the commercial success of the project. One or a few developers can then be identified as the beneficiaries from the improved transport, and they can then be expected to pay for their gains. The government has recently attempted to apply this principle by seeking contributions from developers towards the cost of extending London Transport's railway system into docklands, but the amounts collected have been small. The extension of the Jubilee line is expected to increase the rents achievable at Olympia and York's Canary Wharf development; but Olympia and York and British Gas - which owns land that the extension will serve - have contributed only 17 per cent of its cost. Olympia and York has also contributed about 40 per cent of the Pounds 110m spent on improving the Docklands Light Railway, which will be the only railway serving Canary Wharf when it is completed. Substantial contributions can only be obtained if negotiations start before either the developer or the transport authority have committed themselves to any expenditure. If the developer is to be expected to pay much, he must understand that the improvements will not be made without his support; and if he is to pay for them, he needs to know what they will cost when forecasting his profits. Once a commitment has been given to build a new line, little can be collected from developers along its route. Improving the sources of finance for general investment in urban public transport depends on some means of collecting the smaller benefits which each landlord receives from the existence of such a system, and from any subsequent improvements. These small benefits cannot easily be identified or collected from landlords. A tax paid by landlords therefore seems the most suitable method of appropriating a share in these benefits for the operator of the transport system. Such a property tax would be a supplement to the business rate, but paid by the holder of the head lease or the freehold of each property. The size of this charge should be determined locally, not nationally, because its level would represent a choice between burdens on local travellers and burdens on local landlords, which would best be decided by the representatives they elect. Increased property values in a city created by improvements in local transport are likely to reflect transfers of business to that city from other parts of the country, rather than any increase in the national level of output. These benefits are therefore more appropriately financed by local than national taxation. If national taxes are used to support transport in cities, funds will be transferred from the poorer to the richer districts and individuals in the country, and to companies which - outside the present slump - have been among the more profitable. The proposed method of financing public transport would ensure that it was paid for by those who benefited from it. Such a system would be efficient as well as equitable; the beneficiaries could influence the level of expenditure through their payments and their elected representatives. Transport operators would invest if their expected revenue from fares, the property tax and any direct payments from developers would make the investment profitable. Developers would only launch big projects if they would be profitable after contributing to the cost of the transport they would need. The author is an economics consultant</p>

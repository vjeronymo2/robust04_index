			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 11 Apr (EFE) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina today invited Peruvian businessmen to invest in Cuba,  and added that his country has opened its doors to foreign  capital by granting juridical and constitutional support.    Robaina, who arrived in Peru on 10 April on a two-day  official visit, today held a working meeting with 200 private  businessmen to inform them about the incentives that the Cuban  Government is granting to foreign capital.    Robaina said that the Cuban opening is "generally considered  a priority, but within this perspective we want to prioritize  Latin American investments."    Explaining the Cuban juridical framework that regulates  foreign investments, Robaina said that "it is sufficiently clear  and flexible so as not to cause any mistrust."    He added: "This can be certified by investors from Spain,  Canada, Italy, France, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia,  countries that have already invested in Cuba and with which we  maintain good relations."    Robaina also said that Cuba "is not asking anyone to adopt  its political ideology as a precondition for the establishment  of economic ties, because these foreign investments are in line  with Cuban national interests."    Commenting on current Cuban economic problems, Foreign  Minister Robaina said "they are the result of many factors, but  the greatest obstacle is undoubtedly the U.S. commercial  blockade."    Robaina today held a meeting with Peruvian Foreign Minister  Efrain Goldenberg, with Congress President Jaime Yoshiyama,  while tonight he is scheduled to hold a news conference.    On Tuesday, the last day of his visit, Robaina will carry  out  private activities. He is scheduled to resume his South American  tour, which started last week in Montevideo and also includes  Argentina and Paraguay, on 13 April.</p>

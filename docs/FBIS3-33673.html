			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Some Western newspapers, primary among which is the  French LE MONDE, have disseminated a report that Algeria has  suspended payment on external debt servicing. This report was  denied yesterday by sources close to the government. The  sources said that Algeria has been continuing to service its  foreign debt. Nasira Bouzid reports:    [Bouzid] Algeria continues payment of its external debts by  the required time. Sources close to the prime minister's office  have told APS that Algeria has paid in succession $900 million  and $600 million as debt principal and services, for the  payments due in December last and this month, January, alone.  Likewise, in December 1992 and January 1993, Algeria paid in  succession $911 million and $694 million.    The same sources said that the reorganization of debt  management procedures in order to improve them had led to a  purely administrative delay. The prime minister's office  stressed that Algeria continues to make all efforts to preserve  its policy of respect for foreign commitments. The same sources  thereby denied the reports carried by some Western newspapers,  especially LE MONDE, which had a headline on its front page  yesterday saying: Algeria Suspends Payment of its External Debt.  The government sources described these reports as groundless.</p>

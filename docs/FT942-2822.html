			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Explanation on abuses needed Sir, if Mr Kit Jebens, chief executive of Lautro, the life assurance industry regulator, believes that 'the level of abuses is now at a more acceptable level' - as quoted in your article, 'When he dies my dear, all this will be yours' (June 11) - then could we please be informed what is this acceptable level. How does it compare with what Lautro thinks is an acceptable level of abuse in other professions? A Joseph, White House Farm, Tenholme Bar, Northallerton, Yorkshire DL6 3LQ</p>

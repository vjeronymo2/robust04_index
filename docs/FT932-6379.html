			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Lack of interest in RJB Mining THE PUBLIC has subscribed for only 20 per cent of the 6.7m shares offered to them in RJB Mining, the group formed in a management buy-out to take advantage of opportunities following British Coal's privatisation. RJB is the first company this year to fail to attract widespread public interest. Last year the market experienced a series of public flops including Taunton Cider, The Telegraph, MFI and Anglian Group. Institutions were more enthusiastic about prospects for RJB, however. The company said yesterday institutional demand had exceeded the number of shares available. Some 20m shares had been placed with institutions at 125p. Of those, 6.7m were subject to clawback to satisfy retail demand, but the public subscribed for only 1.3m. The applications were met in full. Trading will start on June 7 with institutions holding 85 per cent of the equity, retail investors and management 5 per cent and Mr Richard Budge, chief executive, 10 per cent. Mr Budge said the lack of interest from the public was largely due to the gloomy headlines on British Coal. 'Too many people read what happens to British Coal as what is happening to the coal industry and that is not true,' he said. There were plenty of opportunities and RJB intended to compete with world coal prices. RJB planned to bid for the Easington colliery, one of four pits which British Coal announced yesterday that it would put up for sale. RJB did not intend any share issues in the near future to fund purchases of British Coal pits. The public response to RJB's flotation will have been strongly influenced by the problems British Coal is experiencing in selling coal to the electricity generators.</p>

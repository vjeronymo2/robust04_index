			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bozhidar Spasov: "2d Army Dissociates Itself From </F> Rakovski Legion Petition"]    [Text] Under the leadership of Major General Gancho Denev,  a meeting was held at the Plovdiv Military Club of the officers  and commanders of the 2d Army, the subordinated units and  detachments, and commanders of the Air Force Corps. Deputy  Defense Minister Vladimir Penchev, Defense Ministry  parliamentary secretary Nencho Nenchev, and Lieutenant General  Lyuben Pekhlivanov, deputy commander of the Bulgarian Army  General Staff, were also present.    Two issues were discussed -- the declaration of the Rakovski  Bulgarian Officer Legion and the petition organized by the  legion's officers and members in connection with the defense  budget, which has already been adopted.    Colonel Stefan Dervishev, commander of one of the units,  said  that no more than 10 officers in the Khaskovo Division are  members of the officer legion. He urged the participants not to  connect the opinion of the officers in the division and the  garrison with the opinion of a few officers.    The commander of the 2d Army said: As a member of the  Military Council of the Bulgarian Army General Staff, the Ground  Troops Military Council, and commander of the 2d Army, I think  it is high time to stop speculating about the Army, and 2d Army  personnel support that position. The officers of our Army do  not rebel. A difficult year lies ahead, and our main concern is  combat training -- more specifically, how to conduct training  with the means that we have been allocated. Deputy Defense  Minister Penchev thinks that most of the officer legion members  who signed the petition have done so with a pure heart and a  desire to help. However, he dissociated himself from the form  utilized by the legion members.</p>

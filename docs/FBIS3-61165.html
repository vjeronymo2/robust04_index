The five-year old popular movement had done  its job. In connection with this, it would be appropriate to  recall what the People's Front has accomplished.    Let's recall that in 1988 Estonia was faced with a situation  where it needed to make itself visible to the world, and to let  the world know that we existed. We knew that the world will take  seriously only those who do exist, who have to be reckoned with,  and those with whom one needs to enter a dialogue.    We had to create alternative structures, through which  to mobilize the multitudes, reorient the awareness of the  people, and select new leaders. This had to be done in such  a democratic fashion that would not arouse protest against us  elsewhere but, instead, earn us the support of world public  opinion. We realized that supporting a popular movement that had  already earned the support of world public opinion would be too  difficult to avoid even by the pragmatic politicians of the West.    The goal was to bring Estonia into big-time  politics. This could have been accomplished in only two  ways: By expressing the will of the state or of the people. We  did not have a state yet. Among the people, however, 1988 saw  the unleashing of processes that the whole democratic world had  to reckon with. One could say that we involved the world in  Estonia's cause, by signaling that what was happening in Estonia  was bound to have an impact on world politics.    This is how the People's Front was born, ushering in the era  of movements in Estonia. It was a time of emphatic denial of  what existed, and an absolute majority was in agreement on that.  A situation emerged where everyone knew what they did not want  for the present time. What they wanted for the future, however,  and what kind of a positive program to follow, had not been  sorted out between the different groupings. Only some vague and  relatively general ideas existed.    The emergence of large popular movements was not only  characteristic of Estonia, or the Baltic states, for that  matter. The popular movements became the moving force that  managed to break up the Soviet empire throughout the entire  territory of the former Soviet Union and its socialist satellite  states in Central Europe. Sociologists have recorded as many as  70 oppositional mass movements over the former Soviet territory  and Central Europe.    Estonia's People's Front had close ties with popular  movements in Central Europe, although our delegation was not  admitted to the German Democratic Republic, for example. That's  how dangerous it thought to be. One could also recall the  greeting received from the 'official' Popular Front of  Czechoslovakia to the First Congress of Estonia's People's  Front. It was very conservative, if not stagnationist. I think  there were things at that time that the Czechs could have  learned from Estonia's People's Front. We sent telegrams to  Czechoslovakia demanding that Vaclav Havel be freed, we  protested against the dictatorial regime in Romania, etc.    It should be admitted that the goals of popular movements  taking place in Central Europe were, in a sense, more  restricted, compared to those of Estonia. In East Germany, the  goal of the popular movement was to demolish the Berlin Wall  and, when that was done, disperse, without any clear formation.  In Czechoslovakia, the Citizens' Forum set itself the task of  getting rid of the Husak regime installed by Brezhnev. In  Poland, the mission had a wider range, including the protection  of economic interests, and basic spiritual values (derived from  Catholicism) of the people.    By far the mightiest of Central European popular movements  was Poland's Solidarity. This name was chosen very carefully, as  the existing regime was based on lack of solidarity between  people. People were separated from each other and made dependent  on the state. There was no sense of rubbing elbows or, even if  there was any, it was subordinated to loyalty toward the state.  The Central European popular movements juxtaposed loyalty to  solidarity.    All Central European movements where largely anti-Soviet  (attempting not to copy the Soviet Union, demanding that Russian  troops be removed etc.). They were ahead of us on economic and  national issues. In the economic sector, this was due to the  realization, after numerous attempts at restucturing the  economy, that partial reforms were leading nowhere.    The nationality issue did not have a high priority for  Central European movements, and that for two reasons. First,  there was no threat to national identity in these countries.  There was practically no immigration, only emigration. Secondly,  nationality had been made a legitimate part of the 70-year old  Communist regime in Poland, Romania and some other countries,  even though this was not emphasized.    In contrast to the Central European countries, nationality  was vital to us because, through it, we compensated for the lack  of all other structures (our own state included). Besides, our  old administration was clearly anti-nationalist and its goal was  to suppress nationalism. This is why nationality became one of  the key issues of our popular movements.    By now, the popular movements of Central Europe have run  their course, their goals have been met. The Communist satellite  states have become independent states, with a developed civilian  society. I think one of the reasons why the popular movements  fell apart there was that the classical Western-European system  of parties took hold rapidly. Locally initiated and in many ways  amorphous popular movements were no match to the professional  party machinery imported from the West, often at high cost. The  intellectual elite, sustaining the popular movements, burned out  fast.    The popular movement was, after all, a movement for the  intellectuals that was, at one point, joined by the people. It  was this cerebral component that became both the strength and  the weakness of the movement. Intellectuals, with their high  self-esteem, have always been a poorly organized segment of a  society, where everyone demands a right to one's individual  conscience, and where there is no political guile, or arrogance.    A popular movement is organized out of a sense of mission, a  party is formulated with the idea of seizing power. A movement  is headed by the intellectual elite of the nation, the parties  are headed by professional politicians, often backed by a  power-hungry mediocrity.    The significance of People's Front, and the Baltic popular  movements in general, was that they revealed the presence of  massive opposition. A format was created that helped the  opposition to organize and people to stick together, without  running into direct conflict with the powers that be. It was  essentially through the popular movement that opposition seeped  into the society, itself striking a balance between legal and  illegal.    Secondly, with the advent of People's Front, new, public  ground was broken in the society for sprouting other movements,  groupings and factions. Up to that point, the regime had been  based largely on fear. Thanks to the popular movements, people  lost their fear of authority. It was that overcoming of fear  that made it possible to break the Communist monopoly on power,  to organize the first democratic elections in 1990, where the  candidates of People's Front received the greatest number of  votes.    Thirdly, processes (IME [economic] project, disclosure of  MRP  [Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact] secret protocols, etc.) were  initiated, without which the Baltic quest for independence would  have remained incomprehensible, or seemed illegal, perhaps, even  after the August coup of 1991. It was in this struggle that the  general requirements for independence were met, forcing the  Moscow regime to make some very clear choices after the August  coup.    Fourth, an example was given, along with some help, for  starting other mass movements elsewhere in the Soviet Union. I  am sure that people in different parts of the empire still  recall the myths circulating about the emissaries of People's  Front, who were feared, and had to be warned against. The  activity of the Baltic popular movements made life for central  authorities even more difficult, and thus increased the pressure  bearing on them.    Fifth, the popular movements in the Baltic countries served  as a conduit of sorts between Moscow and Central Europe.  Although this topic warrants a separate study, one can say with  confidence that many new ideas and attitudes found their way  across the Baltic countries. We had our share in helping the  definitely democratic ideas of perestroyka get to Central  Europe, and reform experiences from there to get back to Russia.  We showed to the West that the Soviet Union was not the  monolithic monster it seemed to be from far away.  <H5>  [24 Nov 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text]    The Fifth Congress of People's Front became the  congress to end the movement. It generated a hankering for the  unity and ideals of the past among one-time activists of  People's Front, as they asked: Has the time really come?    The principal goal of People's Front has undoubtedly been  achieved--Estonia is a free state. At the same time, we cannot  really say that Estonia has a civilized society, and a political  system consisting of strong, democratic parties. To the  contrary, development toward a civilized society seems to be  thwarted. The parties are getting weaker, not stronger. More and  more political decisions are being made outside the control of  the public. We do not have a normal political life yet.    In my opinion, the political development experienced so far,  could be divided into three stages: The first of these was  dominated by the politics of People's Front; the second by  fictional party lines and simulation politics; and the third,  which we are entering now, is ruled by unabashed money politics.  This is the corporate period that signifies the lack of a public  political life.    The task of developing a civilized society is far from  completed but, then again, completing this process would be  outside the ken of the People's Front. This is because  social stratification in Estonia (differentiation of wealth  etc.) is taking place faster than the development of a civilized  society. The Estonian society is no longer a swarm of bees. Five  years ago, we were together, indeed, and could sense the  movement of each other's wings. Now, the society has separated  itself, groups have formed whose interests collide or are at  odds with each other, hence what we have here and now is  no longer the era of People's Front.    A popular movement can be effective and successful only as  long as no significant statification has occurred within the  society, and as long as everybody is more or less poor, or  making do on a modest scale. Once problems arise between owners  and renters, employers and employees and other social groupings,  the massive popular movements will no longer hold together. As  more and more strength and energy is spent on settling internal  conflicts, it will no longer be possible to maintain a  coordinated policy. The policy of the popular movement becomes  more vague and loses its attraction.    The present condition of our society is also not conducive  to  maintaining People's Front because people lack the two  necessary resources for participating in politics: They no  longer have the time or the money to spare. To that are  added political alienation and general fatigue.    What next? It is not quite clear yet if our parties are an  integral part of the universal structure of society, or merely a  historical phenomenon we want to impose on our politics, in an  effort to imitate the democratic countries. The parties of  Western Europe were formed under circumstances that were  different from what we have now. I think that in a society of  mass consumption, the mentality of people is different, as are  the ways in which the society is organized, and this is what  makes a rapid process of forming classical parties unthinkable  in Estonia. Right now, what we do is more of an imitation of  political activity by means of parties, than the real thing.    For our future political development, I can see three  options. The first of them would preserve the  political ambiguity for a long time, leaving everything up in  the air, which is very similar to what happened in the 1920's.  It will be like one Liviko scandal after another, with no end in  sight.    By the way, the current scandal of purchasing weapons from  Israel is very similar to the affair of selling ships to Peru  during the first Republic of Estonia. Back then, the ships were  sold at an exceptionally low price. Now, the weapons were  purchased at an exceptionally high price. One could presume that  then, as now, someone pocketed the difference. By the year of  1934, the earlier of these events had lead to a dictatorship of  corporations under the leadership of 'Isamaaliit' [Fatherland  Alliance].    The second option would be to restructure the  party system to match the emerging interest groups. By now, only  three interest groups have organized themselves in our society:  Lawful owners, farmers and, to some extent, pensioners. Yet to  be organized are new owners, lease-holders, wage earners,  renters and many other groups of people with common interests.  The development of interest groups and their awareness is also  hampered by the fact that there is no group solidarity. Those  who make it, become haughty and separate themselves from others.  It seems, however, that this is a passing phenomenon of  property-based capitalism.    I am afraid that most of today's parties lack the internal  strength to renew themselves or to join with other parties. The  first to wither will be those who do not have a clear long-term  orientation to understand on whose behalf, and for whose benefit  they function. They will be replaced by new political forces,  who have a clearly established policy and a long-term  socio-political orientation. Estonia's political landscape will  be covered fully by three or four major parties that will  eventually dominate.    The third option covers factions that are not  capable of developing into independent entities of political  activity, and will rely on clans. The parties will be preserved  in form only, while the actual decisions are made by the clan,  who will command a sizeable portion of the society. To oppose  that, sooner or later, a new democratic movement will  emerge within Estonia's society. The way I see it, it will  be neither leftist or rightist. It is more likely to be a  general democratic movement, carried primarily by small property  owners and less affluent groups who, because of lack of  property, cannot have their say in the society otherwise.  This would be a classic case of an anti-monopoly movement,  demanding an effective anti-monopoly law, reorganization of  banking, and funding to support private enterprise.    These are only some of the possibilities for political  development. At any rate, ending the activity of People's Front,  does not end political activity in Estonia.    I would like to thank all these thousands of  people who, for the past five years, have been with People's  Front and supported it who--in fact-- were the People's Front.  To thank them for being the first to overcome fear in 1988. Only  in retrospect does everything People's Front did back then seem  so simple and so self-evident. But I am sure there were also  those who preferred to hide in the bushes. But the bravest, the  most enterprising and the most self-confident of them did join  People's Front.    To be involved in People's Front often meant putting aside  one's own personal affairs. The only ones capable of doing that  were those who saw the potential, who were not only thinking of  themselves, but those who also thought of the fate of their  fellow members and the whole society.    I fully understand that many of them now feel that their job  is done and that they are no longer needed. It is also a feeling  of disappointment, in a way, because the subsequent course of  events was always pictured a little differently than what we see  now. But I think our job is far from being done. Five years ago,  we had idealistic individuals joining the People's Front and  these are the very same people who will now stand up to all  kinds of clans and profiteers.    There is no reason to think that the experience of People's  Front will not be needed in the future. To the contrary. Looking  at the latest EMOR surveys, one can see that People's Front  enjoyed the most stable base of supporters within the Estonian  society. Those who chose People's Front a year ago remember  that, and would probably choose People's Front again today.  People's Front had the most cohesive membership in Estonia's  society and, even if someone did drop out on occasion, new  strength would come from somewhere else.    Completely new groupings are being formed. Recently, I got  word from Parnu that an organization has been formed there  for the protection of renters. Such things are encouraging and  show that specific interest groups are beginning to make their  mark. And thus, the politics trying to represent them, will also  be more successful.    For the time being, the public does not yet know the  individuals who will be heading the organizations for renters  and rental agents, employers and employees, owners and  lease-holders, and those dealing with consumer protection. The  leaders who emerged during the 'singing revolution' are much  better known. However, this situation is going to change very  rapidly--new times and new problems will bring along new  people to solve these problems.    The People's Front has run its course, and closing it down  on  November 13 was the most natural thing to do. Every party will  come to an end, eventually. And the period of People's Front in  Estonia was a party--the party of political liberation.  Liberation is always a party in the souls of people!</p>

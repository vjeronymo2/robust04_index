			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MORE SMOKES, CRABBY FOLKS  </P> <P> For once the news was good: 2 million imported cigarettes had been unloaded  over the weekend in the nicotine-starved Soviet capital.  </P> <P> Muscovites rushed out this morning to buy them.  </P> <P> But many kiosks sold out by afternoon, leaving desperate smokers who have  already lived through a monthlong shortage even angrier.  </P> <P> "My God, this is the fifth time I have stood in a cigarette line, and I have  nothing to show for it," said one distraught woman after a kiosk closed.  </P> <P> One man was lucky -- he reached the open kiosk window and because he was on  crutches, he was allowed to buy seven packs instead of the normal limit of  five. But he was hardly in a better mood.  </P> <P> "For the past three or four days I have been smoking cigarette stubs I  collected on the street," said Vyacheslav Borisov.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Finns Believe in Economic Upswing; </F> Half for EU Membership"]    [Text] The Finns have become convinced that the upswing in  the economy has gotten under way. Today it is only 53 percent  who think that the country's economic situation reduces  security, while just six months ago this figure was 78 percent.    Concerning a Finnish membership in the European Union [EU],  currently 48 percent of Finns are in favor, compared with 41  percent six months year ago.    These results appear in an opinion poll that the Finnish  Gallup organization has conducted for the Planning Commission  for Defense Information. To find out views of Finns regarding  security policy issues, Gallup conducted personal interviews  with around 1,000 individuals during April and May.    Unemployment was considered by 50 percent to be a factor  diminishing national security, compared with 80 percent with  this view six months ago. Thirty percent of Finns would raise  defense expenditures, whereas six months ago, 27 percent would  have liked to see them raised, and a year ago 14 percent. Half  of those interviewed would like to maintain defense  appropriations at the present level, and 17 percent would reduce  them. A half year ago the figures were 51 and 19 percent,  respectively.    The attitude toward defense spending is now the same as it  was before the Great Depression.    Men continued to be more amenable to raising defense  expenditures than women. Thirty-four percent of men favored  raised appropriations, contrasted with 25 percent for women.    The opinion barometer also indicated that the proportion of  EU proponents has also increased. Currently, 48 percent of  voters are positive toward it, compared with 41 percent six  months ago. Thirty-one percent oppose membership today, while 36  percent opposed this six months ago. Twenty percent were  undecided, compared with 22 percent in the previous poll.    The figure regarding the national security situation has not  changed. Over half of Finns, or 57 percent, see the future as  uncertain over the next five years. Six months earlier, this  figure was 55 percent. A fifth of those surveyed do not think  the situation is going to change, and another fifth think the  future will be more secure than formerly.    When those interviewed were given clear alternatives to  factors or phenomena affecting national security, 87 percent  replied that nuclear power facilities in Russia is the thing  that is most responsible for reducing security in Finland.</p>

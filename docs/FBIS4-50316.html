			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, May 13 (XINHUA) -- China today urged the  developed countries to provide more concessionary funds to the  African states.    In a statement issued at the end of the 30th African  Development Bank (ADB) and 21st African Development Fund (ADF)  annual meetings in Nairobi, temporary governor for the People's  Bank of China Yin Jieyan said that Africa's development relies  on the unremitting endeavours by the governments and peoples of  African states, but the international community also bears a  significant responsibility for this.    Yin Jieyan, who is also the head of the Chinese delegation  attending the meetings which started officially on Wednesday [11  May], said the founding of the ADB embodies the aspirations of  the African people in pursuing economic independence.    Yin Jieyan said ADB in the past 30 years has surmounted  various difficulties in her efforts to promote the industrial  and agricultural development on the African Continent, to  improve the living standard of the African people, and to  enhance the close cooperation among its member countries.    He noted that for promoting the economic development in  Africa, the ADB had adopted positive policies, including forest  development and population control.    Referring to difficulties the African countries are facing  in  economic development, Yin Jieyan said Africa has been developing  at a low speed for several years, the balance of payments has  shown a sustained deficit, the terms of trade have been  deteriorating further, the debt service ratio has exceeded 25  percent in several consecutive years. Other difficulties  include the natural disasters and trade protectionism of the  Western countries, he said.    On China's commitment to the African Continent, the head of  Chinese delegation said while developing her domestic economy,  China has never forgotten her duty to support Africa's economic  development. "China is ready to continue making due  contributions to Africa's economic development through the ADB  and ADF, which we consider the most important financial  institutions in Africa," he added.</p>

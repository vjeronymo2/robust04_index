According to  reports, 30 organizations have agreed to go in this direction.  The group will of course include the Lebanese Hizballah Party.  It will also include delegates from the Sudanese organization  headed by Hasan al-Turabi, several branches of what is called  "the Islamic Jihad," in addition to representatives from Hamas.  It is not yet known whether rejectionists like the Ahmad Jibril  group and Abu Nidal group will also join the movement.    A number of struggle "professionals" from various Western  countries will also be present. They come under the  fundamentalist group known as the "East Wimbledon." They are  individuals fashioned along the lines of the star of a new  English play. The star is an unemployed man, who, after having  fallen on hard times for a long time because of the economic  recession, hits on the idea of getting himself circumcised and  joining the active fundamentalist groups in Wimbledon.    During this month we will see in Tehran a group of people  who  would tell us that 'Arafat is a "traitor of Islam" and that the  Palestinian problem is so important and vital that it should not  be left in the hands of the Palestinians, for there are people  there who are more Catholic than the Pope.    We became somewhat familiar with the tone that will prevail  at the demonstration in Tehran through the official media and  sermons of clerics who usually reflect the government views.  Many political Middle Eastern cliches are in circulation, such  as treason, conspiracy, surrender, impostors, imperialist  agents, backstabbing, demonic plan, and blood-shedding and so on.    Fiery and angry speeches are used in order to prevent any  serious discussion of the deal, since those attending the  conference did not tell the public what the pros and cons of the  deal are in their view.    A method such as this will encourage the use of man's  ability  at criticism. This is a very serious matter for the demagogues,  because once people start using their brains, then they will  quickly discover the deceit of the "rejectionists" of all types.    It is not difficult to compile militant slogans,  particularly  for those who are not directly affected by the Palestinian  tragedy. Also, it is not difficult for Tehran to sign a few  documents for its political agents here and there. Also it is  not difficult to plant a few bombs and fire a few Katyushas. It  is also very easy to claim heroism at the expense of others, and  for one to become a revolutionary struggler from a distance and  let the others fall martyrs so that tears will be shed for them.    What's difficult is to produce alternative, harmonious, and  cohesive policies. It is for this reason in particular that the  various "rejectionist fronts," which were established in the  past five decades, have failed, bearing in mind that at a  certain time Yasir 'Arafat was a member of some of them.    The question now is: Can the "Gaza and Jericho first" option  be a good beginning to realize the Palestinian people's  legitimate aspirations? The answer in my view is no. I am  convinced after having closely followed the peace process during  the past two years that the Palestinians could have obtained a  better agreement. But I have no right, nor does any foreign  party, to try to undermine the agreement. The final decision is  up to the Palestinian people and their leadership.    If this agreement has any positive aspects, one of them is  that for the first time since the mid-forties the Palestinians  have taken an initiative on their own behalf. In other words,  the Palestinian people have cut the umbilical cord that linked  them to the so-called "Arab World," which often exploited their  problems in order to serve its own interests.    Therefore, what is required from the groups meeting in  Tehran  is to ask themselves a simple question: How far are they  prepared to go in order to blow up an agreement they consider  bad?    Discussion and debate are useful and not harmful. The  Palestinian parties opposing the agreement have every right to  remove 'Arafat by political means and propose an alternative  strategy for peace and justice.    But what is not permissible is to sow the seeds of a civil  war in the name of defending the Palestinian problem. For we all  have seen the grave consequences of this kind of foreign  intervention in many parts of the world. The massacres being  committed in Afghanistan are committed by Afghan hands. But  foreign forces serving their own interest are the manipulators  behind the scenes.    The emergence of Tehran as leader of a new opposition front  will cause harm rather than good. Iran has absolutely no  national interest in attempting to blow up an Arab-Israeli  settlement. Also it is not in its interest to appear in the Arab  world as a leader of an organization whose strategy is based on  violence and on suspect ideologies. Iran is a major and regional  power and, therefore, has to behave accordingly. It is not a  desert and isolated country like Libya so that it would become a  laboratory for analyzing the crazy ideas of some people.    Finally, it is said that the most serious mistake in  politics  is for a politician to do something that he does not need to do.  This applies to Iran, since nothing is compelling it to embrace  politicians like al-Turabi and Jibril and the fundamentalists of  "East Wimbledon."</p>

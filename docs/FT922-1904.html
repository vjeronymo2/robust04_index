			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Japanese companies step up Welsh R&amp;D JAPANESE companies in Wales are increasingly undertaking research and development work in the principality and increasing the 'local' - European Community - content of their products. Those are the principal findings of an investigation of the economic and social consequences of Japanese investment in Wales. Three academics at Cardiff Business School - Mr Jonathan Morris, Mr Max Munday and Professor Barry Wilkinson - found that nine out of 23 manufacturing companies surveyed had undertaken 'limited design work' with one consumer electronics manufacturer 'intending to transfer major development work from Japan in the next two years'. The nature of the R&amp;D varied from the basic - using only three employees - to companies such as Sony, Calsonic and Hitachi, with 'major design departments employing upwards of 50 people'. Four years ago a report by Mr Morris led to angry recriminations over his finding that Japanese investment had largely led to the creation of assembly work, for a mainly female workforce, having a limited effect on the rest of the Welsh economy. The new report shows job creation among men has increased materially - 47 per cent of the workforce in the plants that provided figures. Of the 42 Japanese companies operating in Wales, 29 are in manufacturing, with a heavy concentration in consumer electronics. The rest cover interests such as golf-course ownership, property development, musical instruments and distribution. Takiron, the first company to come to Wales, arrived in 1972 to make PVC corrugated sheeting. The largest, Sony, now employs about 2,500 people - more than that traditional Welsh industry, coal. Other big names include Hitachi, Matsushita, Brother Industries and Sharp. The survey says local content of the manufacturing companies' products was more than 50 per cent in over half the manufacturers surveyed, with a 'common range' of 60 per cent to 80 per cent in the large producers of consumer electronics. The highest level of local content was in chemicals and plastics, where three of the companies bought more than 95 per cent in the EC. The survey adds: 'The majority of companies were actively seeking to increase local content levels over the next five years.' Slightly more than 200 of the 13,400 employed by the Japanese in Wales are Japanese nationals. One company, Sekisui - which opened in Merthyr Tydfil in 1978 - had a completely non-Japanese workforce. Social life for the Japanese can be difficult. The men tend to bury themselves in their work. Some managers said they worked the same long hours as they had done in Japan. 'Typically I work 8am to 10.30pm. I worked 3,300 hours in 1991,' one manager told the researchers. Many of the Japanese wives speak little or no English and isolation is accentuated for some when companies spread employees around the community 'as part of a policy to aid integration'.

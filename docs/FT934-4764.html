			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Now time for a post Budget notebook What an absurd British institution Budget day is. The real Budget is not the chancellor's speech - which is a political showcase - but the Financial Statement and Budget Report, popularly known as 'the Red Book'. This is now 143 pages. Yet it is issued only just before 5pm when the chancellor sits down in the House of Commons. And to tell a secret, the first editions of most newspapers have to be ready two or three hours later. Thus it all turns into a great obstacle race; and a magnificent job is done in the circumstances. Editors congratulate their staffs; and the Treasury has even been known to congratulate editors. It is no doubt very British to turn a heavyweight political and financial occasion into a sporting contest. But how absurd and how unnecessary. A seriously unified Budget would be in two parts. The first would contain the main tax and spending decisions. The second, a couple of days later, would contain the detailed expenditure decisions and, if necessary, the more technical changes emanating from the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise. Both would be issued at 9am. And if courtesy to the Commons meant that the latter body met in the morning, it would do MPs no harm. As usual I went to the House - not to witness a parliamentary occasion but because it gave me the chance of picking up my copy of the Red Book a few minutes earlier. What struck me from the question time exchanges before the Budget was how little debate there really is. The Labour leader, John Smith, asked the prime minister why Britain's budget deficit was worse than that of Japan, the US, Germany and seven other countries. John Major made no attempt to answer, but reeled out different facts about exports, unemployment and growth. The opposition leader in turn ignored these and denounced 'mismanagement' of the deficit. The prime minister then rather easily responded by asking what Labour would cut. No one answered anyone else; nor was expected to. Ministers and their shadows are judged by how snappily they reel off prepared briefs, irespective of the question asked. A European federal assembly could not be worse. * * * The best summary of the political economy of the Budget comes from the accompanying chart. What would the proverbial Rip Van Winkle, awakened from the late 1920s, make of it? He would, first, have to be told that the gap between government expenditure and tax revenue does not all represent the budget deficit, but that some of it represents nationalised industry profits, oil revenues and other receipts. Having swallowed this much, Mr Van Winkle might assume that a Labour government had come into office around 1979-80, determined to lever the tax burden upwards. He would see a temporary recession-induced fall-off in that burden in the early 1990s, which the government was correcting as soon as it could. Seeing, however, that public spending was also under gradual downward pressure, he would come to an additional conclusion. This was that Philip Snowden - the highly orthodox Labour chancellor whose budget-balancing economies at the onset of the Depression brought down the 1929-31 Labour government - was, after all, still in office. * * * Further study of the Red Book confirms one's initial impression. Take together Norman Lamont's 1993 Budget, which covered taxation only, and Kenneth Clarke's November Budget. Then compare 1993-94 with 1996-97. We see a planned fiscal tightening of Pounds 20bn per annum, or 3 per cent of GDP. Of this, Mr Lamont's Budget contributed Pounds 9 1/2 bn. Of Mr Clarke's additional Pounds 10 1/2 bn some Pounds 6bn comes from higher taxes and Pounds 4 1/2 bn from reductions in earlier spending plans. The spending side is tricky to assess. Nearly half comes from lower government debt interest and cyclical social security, which reflects lower inflation and the modest economic recovery so far rather than heroic tussles with the spending departments. Most of the rest is accounted for by a lower reserve for contingencies. This is normal enough. But the bottom line consists not of cuts but of determination to make existing spending guidelines - including the freeze on departmental wage bills - effective. * * * What of the principles of economic policy? There were none in the Budget speech; and I do not entirely blame Mr Clarke for avoiding doctrinal hostages to fortune. But there are none so theory-bound as those who think they are pragmatic; and it is a commentator's duty to look at the criteria for policy. Three main planks can be discerned. There is short-term economic forecasting  -which becomes more important every time a chancellor tries to talk it down. Second, there is the budget-balancing view of fiscal policy and, third, a naively monetarist attitude to interest rates and inflation. The economic forecasts are still based on adding up obvious components of demand - all put into volume terms with inflation taken out. The relationships are based on what might be called anti-Victorian values. If people try to be more thrifty and save more, then output and employment are reduced. Lady Thatcher would have had a fit if she had realised how the forecasts were drawn up. It would be hypocrisy for me to disagree with the underlying logic - except for the treatment of inflation, which is not now central. My objection is to the substitution of crystal ball gazing for thought. The panel of independent forecasters (not, not the 'wise men') has turned out to be a giant step backwards. The Treasury uses the panel quite explicitly in the Red Book to show that its own predictions are near to, but slightly more pessimistic than, the average of the independents on both output and inflation. None of this is much use, however. For when the forecasters have made the most harmful errors, they have usually erred together; and if the Treasury simply wants to show how near to the consensus it is, why bother to have an in-house team at all? The policy doctrine in force is, however, the opposite of what might be inferred from the forecasting methods. Something very like the old Treasury view, which Churchill - to his later regret - advocated in the 1920s, prevails. This is that the object of fiscal policy is to balance the budget and that the government cannot or should not stimulate demand and output by spending more or taxing less. Indeed, Mr Clarke has frequently said the upturn is not as vigorous as he would like, and then spoken in the next breath of the need to put the public finances in order - which means cutting both public and private spending. There is nothing peculiarly British in this combination of under-consumptionist forecasting and fiscal puritanism. It is a notable feature of IMF reports. The Treasury now publishes variants, showing that with even slightly slower growth than envisaged, public sector borrowing would be much higher. But of the policy implications - whether to tighten for fiscal reasons or lessen to stimulate the economy - we are not told a single thing. Finally, there is the view that the Bank of England has a special hot line to inflation which it can fix by shifting interest rates without any intermediate effect on economic activity. I used to shudder at this view, as a caricature of monetarism, which discredited what was valuable in that doctrine. But this caricature is very close to the words of the Budget speech. A similar black magic view is held by many of those now advocating an independent Bank of England as a panacea - as if the Bank could directly eliminate inflation without affecting the rest of the economy. A better reason for Bank independence is to make that institution accountable, which it is not at present. As Adam Smith said, there is a lot of ruin in a nation. Whatever the headline doctrine, the Bank of England tries to manage nominal demand and does not just drive for zero inflation at all costs. There are also more self-correcting mechanisms in the world and British economies than forecasters envisage. Moreover, there are political inhibitions on fiscal rectitude. But I still worry that if there were a Great Depression - or even a prolonged stagnation - neither the Treasury model, nor the forecasting panel would expect it; and that the policy response would be between inadequate and perverse.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- GENERAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE (excluding privatisation proceeds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Changes from previous plans/projections Pounds m                        1993-94         94-95         95-96  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Central government expenditure    3,400           400         2,600 Local authority expenditure         900          -500          -600 Financing requirements of   nationalised industries          -430            30          -420 Reserve                          -4,000        -3,500        -3,000 Adjustment                         -300             -             - New control total                  -400        -3,600        -1,500 Cyclical social security         -1,100        -1,500        -1,500 Central government debt interest      0        -1,000        -1,500 Accounting adjustments              400             0           500 General government expenditure   excluding privatisation   proceeds                       -1,100        -5,700        -3,600  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Red Book  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

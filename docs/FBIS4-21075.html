			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fernando Perez Chavez] </F>   [Excerpts] Morelia, Michoacan--"There is no resurgence of  drug trafficking in the country, and the recent confrontations  between Federal Judicial Police personnel and `narco' rings show  that it is being attacked and fought." This assertion was made  here today by the republic's attorney general, Diego Valades.  The official claimed that the drug traffic has not infiltrated  the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR],  remarking: "We shall fight to prevent that."    He made these comments after a private meeting with Governor  Ausencio Chavez and officials from both the state attorney's  office and the federal department itself. The meeting was held  to assess the effort being expended against the drug traffic in  Michoacan. [passage omitted]    He also announced the initiation, within the next few days,  of a national system for complaints and charges against the PGR,  "because we are striving to combat impunity and abuses, which  will not be allowed in the department. Also, with that system,  the citizens will be able to contact us free of charge to report  abuses."    Subsequently, Diego Valades also denied that there were  "informers" in the Federal Judicial Police, claiming that the  municipal policemen assigned to that force are only cooperating  with the institution. "However, if they commit a crime, they are  punished according to law, just as the agents in that department  are." [passage omitted]    On another subject, the attorney general refused to give  statistics on the number of personnel killed in action during  recent months in their confrontations with the "narco" rings.  Nor did he specify the area in hectares that was confiscated  from "narcos" in the country because it was being used to grow  marijuana. [passage omitted]    He claimed that good results have been accrued in the  permanent campaign against the drug traffic in Michoacan,  praising the work done by the Mexican Army in this respect.    Concluding the interview, he declared that the action  against  drug planting, cultivation, and marketing will be intensified.  In support of this, PGR local offices have been opened in the  municipalities of Huetamo and Apatzingan, where the incidence of  crimes against health is high.</p>

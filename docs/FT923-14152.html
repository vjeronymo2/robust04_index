			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Firmer biotechnology sector lifts Nikkei A LATE rally in the biotechnology sector pushed up share prices, and the Nikkei average, which had been initially depressed by Tuesday's fall on Wall Street and concerns about financial problems at construction companies, closed higher for the first time in four days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed up 140.71 at the day's high of 16,600.26, having fallen to the day's low of 16,271.68 in the morning session on small-lot arbitrage selling. Volume rose to 190m shares from 160m. Domestic and foreign institutions refrained from action. 'The foreigners are sitting tight,' said Mr Robert Wicks at James Capel. He added that apart from dealers and a few individuals trading 'theme' stocks, the flow of new money into the market had stopped. Advances led declines by 548 to 377 with 148 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 2.98 to 1,274.13 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.45 to 1,000.10. Dealers tried to generate activity by trading speculative theme stocks in the afternoon. Issues which have been previously sought on the 'Aids theme', and the 'blue-fin tuna theme', advanced. Meiji Milk Products was the most active issue of the day, rising Y34 to Y985, while Fujisawa Pharmaceutical advanced Y19 to Y989 and Taiyo Fisheries Y15 to Y517. However, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, regarded as a benchmark for market sentiment, fell Y7,000 to Y622,000. Construction-related issues continued to fall as investors remained pessimistic about the sector following an announcement by Royal Construction, a small construction company listed on the over-the-counter market, that the company had dishonoured bills, and would seek court protection from its creditors. The Japan Securities Dealers Association said Royal Construction would be eligible for trading on the OTC market for the next six months as an issue not registered with the association. Trading in shares of Sanyo Kokusaku Pulp and Jujo Paper was halted in the afternoon, after reports of a merger between the two companies. The companies later announced that the merger will take place next April, creating the largest company in the industry with annual sales of around Y700bn. Buying orders surged on the reports, Sanyo Kokusaku rising by Y27 to Y578, and Jujo adding Y26 to Y536 before the suspension. Retail issues continued to weaken, with Ito-Yokado down Y30 to Y3,890. Ms Victoria Melendez, retail analyst at Jardine Fleming, said poor domestic sales together with losses at Southland, Ito-Yokado's consolidated US subsidiary, was hurting the share price. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 87.25 to 19,221.76 in volume of 6.9m shares. Roundup WALL STREET exerted a persuasive influence on most of the region yesterday but Hong Kong and, to an extent, New Zealand had other ideas. Bombay stayed closed. AUSTRALIA ended lower after the Reserve Bank delivered a long-awaited, but smaller-than-expected cut in official interest rates. Banks led the way down as the All Ordinaries index slipped 9.1 to 1,651.4. Westpac and ANZ each lost 9 cents to ADollars 3.39 and ADollars 3.95 respectively, while Commonwealth fell 5 cents to ADollars 7.33. The gold index firmed 2.1 to 1,175.3 after bullion prices leapt above Dollars 347 an ounce. Pacific Placer rose 8 cents to ADollars 2.78, while Kidston climbed 5 cents to ADollars 1.57. TAIWAN was pulled down by heavy selling in the last hour after the central bank said that it had no plans to cut official interest rates. The weighted index plunged 102.91 or 2.3 per cent to 4,329.31 in active turnover of TDollars 26.93bn after TDollars 25.7bn. Construction shares were hit by fears that the government would crack down further on land speculation. Cathay Construction fell TDollars 2.50 to TDollars 63.50. MANILA continued to fall as investors stayed on the sidelines to assess the performance of the new government. The composite index fell 14.51 to 1,481.82 in combined turnover of 581m pesos, up from 211m. HONG KONG closed higher on renewed buying as the market discounted the failure of Sino-British talks over funding for Hong Kong's new airport. The Hang Seng index jumped 69.99 or 1.2 per cent to 5,981.91 but turnover fell to HKDollars 2.88bn from HKDollars 3.56bn. Blue chips were sought after, with HSBC topping the most active list and gaining 50 cents to HKDollars 49.50. NEW ZEALAND ended unchanged after recouping an early loss of 1 per cent. The NZSE-40 capital index dropped 14 points at the start, overshadowed by the overnight fall on Wall Street, but closed 0.54 better at 1,570.70 in turnover of NZDollars 33m.</p>

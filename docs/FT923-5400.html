			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (7): The dinosaur wakes - Philips overhauls a telecommunications factory THE STAIRWAYS at Philips' telecommunications factory in Bautzen still bear the unmistakeable look of the old East German style of industry: crumbling concrete and a few faded photographs of local landscapes. But inside the offices, and in the main assembly shop, it is obvious that an important overhaul has already taken place. New computer terminals stand on the desks, new carpets line the floors, new paint covers the walls and, in the assembly shop, there are new production lines. Little expense has been spared to transform the scruffy old plant producing transmission equipment for the Soviet and Comecon markets into a new operation catering for the mighty Deutsche Telekom's rather more demanding requirements. From the moment unification became a reality, it was obvious that telecommunications would be one of the first and biggest markets to be opened up for western suppliers. The East German network lagged far behind the west in both density and sophistication, its development hampered by western restrictions on technology exports and East Germany's mania for keeping communications under the control of its security services. Deutsche Telekom plans to spend DM55bn by 1997 to bring the new federal states up to the level of the old. PKI (Philips Kommunikations Industrie) - the Nuremberg-based German telecommunications subsidiary of the Dutch multi-national, already an important contractor to Deutsche Telekom - could have easily produced the necessary transmission equipment back in the west. It decided instead to invest in the east. 'It was clear from the start that whoever wanted to be in there would have to get a base in the east,' says Mr Uwe Bartsch, administration manager at the plant. 'Deutsche Telekom decided it would favour those contractors who had investments in the region.' This was undoubtedly the most important reason why Philips came to Bautzen. A second consideration was the prospect of opening up new markets in eastern Europe. 'Before unification, the factory in Bautzen exported up to 80 per cent of its products to the rest of Comecon. They had excellent contacts with the East, where we had no real contacts at all,' Mr Bartsch said. So Philips bought RFT Fernmeldewerk in Bautzen from the Treuhand privatisation agency for an undisclosed sum, promising to keep at least 350 jobs of the 1,000 employed there, and drawing up an investment programme totalling DM75m. Today the plant has been substantially modernised and about DM36m of the investment cash has been spent. The second reason for Philips coming to Bautzen has not worked so well: instead of expanding, the eastern markets have collapsed. Russia and the former Soviet republics are buying only about 25 per cent of what they used to buy, because of the shortage of foreign exchange. Although Russia and Germany have finally agreed on export credit guarantees, 'we are still waiting for the Russians to decide what they want in concrete terms,' Mr Bartsch says. However, he is convinced Philips does not regret its move. Although productivity is lower than in the west, so are wage costs - at least until 1994. With the investment subsidies available, that provides a big cost reduction. The work force still lacks the support system needed to match western productivity, but Mr Bartsch reckons it will catch up by next year.</p>

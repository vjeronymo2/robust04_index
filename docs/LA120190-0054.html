			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SELECTION FOR WASTE BOARD JOB PROTESTED;  </P> <P> APPOINTMENTS: ENVIRONMENTALISTS URGE STATE SENATE TO BLOCK GOV. DEUKMEJIAN'S  CHOICE OF FORMER COUNCILWOMAN NAN DRAKE.  </P> <P> Representatives of the Sierra Club and other environmental groups are urging  the state Senate Rules Committee to reject the appointment of former Ventura  City Councilwoman Nan Drake to a position on the state's Integrated Solid Waste  Management Board.  </P> <P> Members of the groups say that Drake, who was defeated in her bid for council  reelection in 1989, is unqualified to fill the $90,000-a-year job because she  has never served as an official of a nonprofit environmental group, as required  under board bylaws.  </P> <P> "Nan Drake is a fine person and is familiar with sanitation issues," said Mark  Murray, the policy director for Californians Against Waste. "But she does not  have an impressive record on the environmental issues . . . and she does not  meet the criteria for serving on the board. We can't turn the other cheek."  </P> <P> Drake could not be reached for comment Friday. A spokesman for Gov. George  Deukmejian said the governor is standing by his appointment and is urging the  Senate committee to confirm Drake's position when it meets on Monday.  </P> <P> The governor appointed Drake to the board Oct. 17 after the state Senate failed  to confirm John E. Gallagher of Orange because environmentalists said he also  did not meet the criteria.  </P> <P> Spokeswoman Anita MacKenzie said the governor believes that Drake's involvement  in Ventura's recycling program as well as other local sanitation committees  would make her a valuable member of the board, which oversees the state Waste  Management Department.  </P> <P> "We are going forward with the process," MacKenzie said.  </P> <P> But Murray and Gordan Hart, the Sierra Club's California recycling lobbyist,  said the appointment is a "slap in the face" of environmentalists and the  Legislature.  </P> <P> "We don't understand what the governor is doing," Hart said. "His animosity  seems to stretch so far that he can't bring himself to appoint someone who  meets the criteria. This is a grossly irresponsible act by the governor."  </P> <P> But Ventura City Manager John Baker on Friday defended Drake's appointment.  Although she might not be an environmentalist, she would do a fine job on the  board, Baker said. He said that without Drake's dedication, Ventura would not  have the comprehensive recycling program it has today. She served on the  Ventura City Council from 1985 to 1989.  </P> <P> "Given her background and her intensity, she would do a good job," he said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Ventura County environmentalists say while they respect Drake for  her recycling efforts, that does not mean she should be appointed to the board.  </P> <P> "That slot is supposed to be filled by an environmentalist," said Cynthia  Leake, member of the Los Padres chapter of the Sierra Club. "Nan never was an  environmentalist and she never will be. She is just not the right person for  the job."  </P> <P> Other groups that have come out in opposition to Drake's appointment include:  The League of Women Voters, the California League of Conservation Voters, the  Environmental Council of Sacramento and the Environmental Coalition of Ventura  County.  </P> <P> "We're hoping Deukmejian will give Pete Wilson a shot at appointing someone to  the board," said Neil Moyer, the president of the Environmental Coalition.  </P> <P> The state board was recently established under a comprehensive recycling bill  sponsored by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto). It includes six full-time  positions -- four appointed by the governor and one by each house of the  Legislature.  </P> <P> The bill specifies that one of the governor's appointments be a representative  of the trash-hauling industry and that another "has served as an elected or  appointed official of a nonprofit environmental protection organization whose  principal purpose is to promote recycling and the protection of air and water  quality."  </P></p>

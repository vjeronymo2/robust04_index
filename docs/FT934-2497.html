			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Allied Dunbar will resist Revenue Allied Dunbar, the financial services subsidiary of BAT, is expected to resist attempts by the Inland Revenue to clamp down on the self-employed basis used by its managers on commission payments. The company's advisers will soon enter detailed discussions with inspectors from the Revenue's inquiry branch, which began to examine its affairs more than a year ago. One big insurer said yesterday that tax officials were 'picking off' new sales consultants over the tax treatment of loans received from the company in advance of commission payments. It said the Revenue was pressing for the loans to be treated as income from the date of the loan, rather than from the dates of the commission payments. The Revenue last night denied that it was conducting any 'campaign' against the life industry, or against the self-employed. Allied Dunbar said it had already concluded separate discussions with the Revenue on the subject. The company is preparing a series of reports to be submitted early next year focusing on two significant areas which are dealt with in varying ways across the divisions of the company. The first is the treatment of 'soft commissions' or payments in kind through the donation or use of equipment by brokers and marketmakers in exchange for business. Advisers to Allied Dunbar may request capital allowances if the Revenue clamps down on the way these commissions are treated as income. The second issue deals with bonuses awarded to managers in recognition of commissions earned by their sales staff, which are currently treated as self-employed income. A move to the pay-as-you earn system would provide quicker and simpler tax collection. Prudential and Legal &amp; General, two of the largest life houses, said their sales managers received no payments on which they were taxed as self-employed. Advisers to Allied Dunbar said the sums under dispute were not very large. It is believed that it has so far received no assessments for the past tax year on the topics under investigation.</p>

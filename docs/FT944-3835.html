			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: 'That's just what I've always wanted' - Gift ideas for the person with a special interest, here are a number of suggestions that you might not have thought of . . . / The Skier What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas. But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some suggestions . . . Expert skiers are often obsessed with finding out how many vertical feet they ski. The Avocet Vertech Ski wrist watch will tell them to the nearest five feet. All you need to do is set it before your first run and it will automatically calculate vertical feet and the number of runs you ski all day long without you having to touch it again. The following day you can either start your tally again or keep a running total. The Avocet which works on aviation technology using barometric pressure, will clock up 299,000 vertical feet (more than enough for most skiers' holidays) before returning to zero. But if you keep a running total, remember to turn it off after each day's skiing or the watch will keep calculating your vertical drop when you are driving or even walking downhill. The Avocet, which has a stopwatch and displays altitude, highest skiing speed, barometric pressure and of course, the time, costs Pounds 119.95 from Snow + Rock, 188 Kensington High Street, London W8 7RG, Tel: 071-937 0872. One criticism of the so-called 'Fat Skis' designed to make powder skiing easier is that they are not so hot on piste. Now Porsche has come up with a design it claims works just as well on or off piste. They are black and as sleek as a fat ski can be, and they retail at Dollars 850 (bindings Dollars 175 extra) from Porsche Design, Corporate Office, American PD Company Inc, 331 South Rio Grande Street, Suite 105, Salt Lake City, Utah 84101. Tel: 0101 801 575 8815. For the ultimate Christmas gift, what about hiring the most famous mountain in America: Aspen's Ajax. The day after the ski season ends on April 15, it could be yours for Dollars 100,000. For that you could take up to 100 guests, who would each ski free and have their own instructor for the day - plus lunch of course. You could even groom whichever slopes you choose at no extra cost. The fee would be divided in two, with Dollars 50,000 going to your favourite charity and the other Dollars 50,000 going to Aspen Skiing Company's favourite charity.

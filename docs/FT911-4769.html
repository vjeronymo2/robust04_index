			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / World Trade News: UK business campaigns to double sales to Japan A CAMPAIGN to double British exports to Japan during the next three years was launched yesterday by chairmen and chief executives of some of Britain's biggest companies. Companies will be encouraged to establish offices and manufacturing capacity in Japan. Previous sales campaigns supported by the UK Trade and Industry Department have concentrated on promoting exports, rather than investment, in Japan. The aim is to raise the value of British exports to Pounds 5bn, compared with Pounds 2.63bn last year, said Mr Michael Perry, vice-chairman of Unilever and chairman of the Priority Japan campaign. 'An important objective over the next three years will be to increase market share as well as the value of exports.' The campaign - launched yesterday by Mr Perry, Sir David Plastow, chairman and chief executive of Vickers engineering group, and Sir Paul Girolami, chairman of Glaxo pharmaceuticals group - is being supported by the DTI and the British Overseas Trade Board. Mr Peter Lilley, Trade Secretary, said the government would provide financial support of Pounds 400,000 during the first year of the campaign.</p>

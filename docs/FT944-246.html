			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Need to achieve a better balance in social policy in Europe and the UK (1) Sir, Mr Peter Cooke (Letters, December 29) maintains that 'the economic value of EU membership should be shared partly in the form of improved social benefits for workers where those can be delivered without prejudicing competitiveness'. Few would argue with that. But the problem with many of the social measures brought forward by the European Commission - including the European works council directive - is that they do compromise competitiveness, and at a time when Europe's share of world trade is falling. Unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, has been worse as a result. The problem is that social policy has been too much concerned with the rights of those in employment and too little directed towards what would help the 20m out of work in the EU find jobs. The result has been both inflexibility in labour markets and high social costs for every person employed across much of Europe. That undermines competitiveness and the creation of jobs. Employers are well aware of this, but it is also being recognised now by other objective observers, notably the OECD in its recent jobs study. It was an inevitable consequence of the general approach of harmonising social provisions at the most generous - and therefore the costliest and most restrictive - level applying anywhere in Europe. The social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, with its provision for majority voting in place of unanimity on a wider range of topics, threatened more of the same - rather than the radical rethink required. That affects British businesses and jobs. UK companies value the social chapter opt-out accordingly. Some welcome signs of a shift in the Commission's thinking have emerged during the past 12 months, not least Commission president Jacques Delors' recognition of the competitive challenge to Europe, and social affairs commissioner Flynn's promise of no new raft of legislation. A better balance in European social policy may now emerge. But whether that would have happened - and whether it will yet prevail - without vigorous advocacy from British ministers aimed at persuading their Continental colleagues must be open to question. There are, indeed, still ostriches hiding from the challenge of change and arguing for the old approach, though they are more commonly found in Brussels than Westminster.

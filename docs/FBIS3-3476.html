			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng's  government work report has been revised according to opinions  and suggestions raised by deputies to the Eighth National  People's Congress (NPC).    The additions deal with reducing peasants' burden, the  modern  enterprise system, the promotion of socialist ethics and  culture, and the Hong Kong issue.    The revised government work report was adopted at the  closing  meeting of the NPC second session here today.    Reducing peasants' burden and increasing their income was a  daily topic during the 13-day NPC session. The report adds  "special handling of outstanding issues" after stressing  continuous implementation of measures to reduce peasants' income.    Establishment of a modern enterprise system is the direction  for reform of state-owned enterprises. The report adds  "actively summing up experience and gradually forming standard  implementation methods to facilitate their dissemination" after  the content of launching pilot programs adopting the modern  enterprise system in accordance with the company law.    On socialist cultural undertakings, the report adds  "opposing  and resisting bad works that hurt people's unity, social  progress and physical and mental health of juveniles."    As extravagance and waste remain widespread at present, the  report adds "being diligent, thrifty, practicing economy and  working hard."    On the Hong Kong issue, the report, according to opinions of  some Hong Kong and Macao deputies, adds a sentence: "Hong Kong  compatriots are expected to work together with the whole nation,  make concerted efforts and contribute to Hong Kong's stability  and prosperity."    At its conclusion, the report replaces "hard struggle" with  "blazing new trails, self-reliance and hard struggle."    Compared with similar reports in the past, this year's  report  has fewer revisions because opinions and suggestions were  solicited from various circles during the drafting process.    Since mid-December of last year, the political bureau of the  Chinese Communist Party central committee and the State Council  held many meetings to discuss the draft report. Premier Li Peng  invited leaders of the democratic parties, persons without party  affiliation, representatives of science, technology, education  and culture fields, officials of grassroots administrative and  judicial departments and leaders of enterprises and institutions  for five meetings and heard their opinions and suggestions.</p>

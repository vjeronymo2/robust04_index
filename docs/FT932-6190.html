			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Siren voices for Mr Clarke IN THE 1960s, the name of the would-be hero was Reginald Maudling; in the 1970s, it was Anthony Barber; in the 1980s, far more unluckily, it was Nigel Lawson. Is it to be Kenneth Clarke in the 1990s? In each of the three previous decades, a Conservative chancellor of the exchequer has inherited an economy suffering from high unemployment. Each time he has found good reasons to 'go for growth'; each time the experiment has been welcomed; but each time it has subsequently been condemned, along with its begetter. To make this mistake once was perhaps a misfortune. To do so twice already looked like carelessness. But to do it a fourth time, would, in a just world, discredit the Tories completely. This is, however, the trap into which a self-confident, yet economically untutored man like Kenneth Clarke is most likely to fall. He will be advised by his political friends to ignore orthodox advisers discredited by past failures. It would take a mixture of a saint and a hero not to ignore only the uncomfortable messages. With only the financial markets as discipline, the choice will be largely up to Mr Clarke. His position within the government must be as strong as any chancellor's in living memory. Unlike Mr Lamont, hapless servant of his predecessor and boss, Mr Clarke may decide for himself. But first he has to listen. Whispers in his ear 'Growth is what we need, old boy,' his party colleagues must already be whispering in his ear. 'Ignore that fellow Portillo, far too Thatcherite. Already discredited by that kite about prescription charges for the elderly. It will be bad enough keeping to existing spending plans, never mind cutting them further. 'It's all very well for Major to talk about protecting vulnerable groups in society. Vulnerable groups don't vote for us. Most of them don't even vote. The vulnerable group that matters is us. Can't bash our voters with the longest recession since the 1930s, falling house prices, negative equity, unemployment and then make them pay university fees for their kids. Abolish their mortgage interest relief, child benefit and state pensions? Suicide. 'What's that about higher taxation? Lamont threatened an extra Pounds 10bn two years hence. That's quite enough. Higher income tax? You haven't been on the job very long. You'd have to double the income tax take to get rid of this year's Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement. Raising the basic rate of tax to 30p gives a measly Pounds 8bn. Game's not worth the candle. 'We have to offer our bit of the great British public more of what they want, not less. Growth's what we need. 3 1/2 per cent a year for a few years and that deficit will just melt away. What about inflation? Don't worry about that. Leave the worrying to Mr George at the Bank of England, so long as you don't let him do anything about it. Wages? We need higher wages. It makes people feel good. Two to three years of fast growth, another election, big majority; then the hair shirt, if you must.' Inflation target The same points, more elegantly expressed, are to be found in the press. So which advice will Mr Clarke listen to? Will it be the siren voices? Will it be his orthodox advisers? Ideally, it will be neither. Once it becomes obvious that the chancellor has a target for economic growth, expectations in the labour market will shift. So will expectations in the gilts markets. But financial markets cannot be trusted to see the danger in time. They did not in the 1980s. Yet the time to worry about inflation is not at the end of the next expansion. The time is now, at the beginning of a recovery. The chancellor should delay interest rate cuts. He should confirm the 1-4 per cent inflation target. Ideally, he would also take a leaf from the German economic book he is supposed to admire and push for an independent central bank. Where he should part company from his advisers is over their apparent view that the exchange rate is just a tool of counter-inflationary policy. Real exchange rates matter, since they determine the prospects for all businesses subject to international competition. His aim should be to use his present, possibly brief window of opportunity to rebalance policy aggressively and, if necessary, subsequently offset tighter fiscal policy by lower interest and exchange rates. The unified Budget due in November is his chance. If the government is to be safe from all mishap, it must double the size of the phased fiscal adjustment Mr Lamont proposed last March. Mr Clarke can be another 'go for growth' hero of the hour or he can build on the low inflation achieved by his predecessors. To choose the latter course is politically and even economically risky. To choose the former is not risky at all, since the ultimate result is quite certain. No prudent chancellor would act on the assumption that the UK economy will float away from its troubles on a tide of rapid growth. The next six months will show whether Mr Clarke is going to be a prudent chancellor, or another gambler.</p>

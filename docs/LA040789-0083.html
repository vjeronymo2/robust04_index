			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> EVANGELISTS SELL HOMES  </P> <P> Criticism of a lavish life style by Oklahoma-based evangelists Oral and Richard  Roberts has prompted the sale of their two Southern California vacation homes,  valued at more than $1 million, Richard Roberts said. The younger Roberts said  the criticism resurfaced since his father asked followers to sell unneeded  valuables to help raise $11 million by May 6 to keep his 41-year-old ministry  afloat. Richard Roberts said he and his father sold their homes in Rancho  Mirage in the last year. "There was a perception that just having the house was  bad," the younger Roberts said. "I didn't want to do anything that would  reflect negatively on the ministry."  </P></p>

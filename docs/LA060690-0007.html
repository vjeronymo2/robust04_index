			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY ADOPTS PLAN TO CUT THE COST OF LEGAL DEFENSE  </P> <P> The San Diego County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted to cut legal  expenses by creating a new county legal department and expanding the duties of  the Public Defender's Office.  </P> <P> The unanimous action creates a county office to handle criminal court cases in  which the public defender has a conflict of interest. It also significantly  expands the number of public defender deputies handling juvenile court cases.  </P> <P> Under the current system, the county pays hourly fees to about 350 area lawyers  in private practice through the Department of Alternate Defense Counsel,  commonly known as the "conflicts office." Most of those cases involve multiple  defendants or, in juvenile court, any number of a child's relatives. By  replacing private attorneys with salaried county lawyers, county budget  planners project an annual cost savings of $7 million beginning in fiscal year  1992.  </P> <P> The Constitution requires that poor defendants in criminal cases and some  persons involved in juvenile court cases be provided with free counsel.  </P> <P> The county will immediately begin seeking lawyers for the new legal office in  anticipation of taking over some cases as early as September and all cases by  December, the county staff said.  </P> <P> The department was created over the opposition of private lawyers who stand to  lose a large source of revenue.  </P> <P> Before Tuesday's vote, several attorneys, including representatives of the  county Juvenile Justice Bar Assn. and Women's Criminal Defense Bar Assn.,  criticized the plan for the new department as flawed and based on inaccurate  projections of court caseloads and legal bills.  </P> <P> However, it was the soaring fees paid to private lawyers that prompted the  county to act.  </P> <P> County planners had projected that fees paid to attorneys in  conflict-of-interest cases would be $2.3 million for fiscal 1990. It is now  projected that cost will be $14 million.  </P> <P> The 609% increase is due, in part, to the rise in drug-related cases and the  difficulty in predicting caseloads in a given year.  </P></p>

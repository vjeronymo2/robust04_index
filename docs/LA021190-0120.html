			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE EMERGENCY OF PARAMEDIC USER FEES  </P> <P> I am a paramedic/fireman for a department in Orange County. I live in an area  serviced by Orange County.  </P> <P> Recently the Orange County Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance that would  begin charging for paramedic services. In lieu of a charge for each use of the  paramedic service they offered a subscription fee for an annual, unlimited use  of these services.  </P> <P> I feel that this is wrong for several reasons. Let's call it what it really is.  A user tax. Another end run around Proposition 13.  </P> <P> Not all who use the service will pay or even be able to pay. Statistics have  shown that other paramedic services have a collection rate as low as 50%. This  will become an administrative nightmare. Early fire services used to be run and  managed by private insurance companies. You paid for fire protection to an  insurance company to protect your home or business. Each building had an  identification plaque. If you had not paid and did not have an identification  plaque, the building was often left to burn while fire companies sat in front  and watched. We have come a long way since then and have realized our folly.  Paramedic services, however, seem to be regressing back to that level of  service. Oh, we will still respond and render aid, but eventually the level of  service rendered will diminish for those who do not subscribe. That will happen  despite the disclaimers from our politicians.  </P> <P> The Orange County trauma system's days are numbered. Too many people used the  service and didn't pay. Paramedic services are declining every day with  reconfiguration of delivery systems. We cannot foresee when we will need these  services. Accidents, fires and life-threatening medical problems can happen to  anyone regardless of prosperity or ability to pay. When these services are  needed you cannot shop around to get the best price.  </P> <P> First-rate emergency medical services are expected and wanted by most Orange  County residents. The emergency medical system has become a safety net to catch  us when we have a heart attack, car accident or other medical emergency.  Because our elected officials do not have the moral fiber to call a tax a tax  and fund these programs, the very fiber of that safety net rots more and more  every day. Some days that net catches us, but more and more often it is too  weak to hold us and we fall through, dying or suffering needlessly.  </P> <P> ROBERT A. PINGLE  </P> <P> El Toro  </P></p>

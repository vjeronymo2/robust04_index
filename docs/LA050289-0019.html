			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DEAF JURORS WIN 8-YEAR BATTLE FOR INTERPRETERS  </P> <P> Los Angeles County broke a sound barrier Monday that will enable deaf and  hearing-impaired citizens to serve on juries in municipal and superior courts.  </P> <P> "At least deaf people now have the option of serving on a jury just like  everybody else," said Nathan Shapiro, 57, a prospective Van Nuys Superior Court  juror who on Monday became the first person with hearing problems to be  assigned a sign-language interpreter at county expense.  </P> <P> Shapiro and the Greater Los Angeles Council for the Deaf began fighting for  interpreters for jurors nearly a decade ago.  </P> <P> Previously, people with hearing problems were excused from jury duty. With the  addition of the new interpreter program, hearing problems will no longer be  reason enough not to serve, said Ed Johnson, director of interpreter services  for the county's courts.  </P> <P> "We hope this will encourage other deaf and hearing-impaired people to become  jurors," Johnson said. "We now have seven others in our jury pool waiting to be  assigned to a court."  </P> <P> The new service will cost the county $30,000 for a full-time coordinator plus  $171 a day for each interpreter.  </P> <P> Interpreters will be available in municipal and superior courts in Van Nuys,  Torrance, downtown Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Pasadena, Johnson said.  </P> <P> The service is the result of a settlement reached last October in a federal  class action lawsuit filed in 1981.  </P> <P> The Council for the Deaf filed the suit after Shapiro, a Northridge engineer  who has had hearing difficulties since birth, hired an interpreter in 1980 to  help him serve as a juror in San Fernando Superior Court.  </P> <P> Shapiro billed the county about $4,000 for the interpreter's fee. But the  county refused to pay.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Refused to Pay  </P> <P> When Shapiro was summoned for jury duty in 1987, county officials again refused  to pay for an interpreter, which led the Council for the Deaf to press even  harder for settlement of the lawsuit, said Marcella Meyer, council executive  director.  </P> <P> "It's about time that deaf people had the right to serve as jurors if they want  to," Meyer said. "This is one step forward."  </P> <P> "It's been long overdue," said Karen Bowman, 29, of Northridge, who was hired  earlier this year to coordinate the sign language service. "There are many,  many people who could serve as well as hearing people."  </P> <P> Bowman, who has been deaf since birth, read the standard jury orientation for  Shapiro in sign language Monday.  </P> <P> Benita Maupin, an interpreter with the county courts, will provide  sign-language interpretation if Shapiro is selected as a juror.  </P> <P> Maupin, who can hear, said she learned sign language before she learned to  speak.  </P> <P> "Both my parents were deaf," Maupin said. "So you could say English is my  second language. Sign language is my first."  </P> <P> Maupin said the courts traditionally have provided interpreters for deaf or  hearing-impaired witnesses and defendants, but not for jurors.  </P> <P> When other deaf or hearing- impaired people learn of the new service, Maupin  said, she believes many will want to serve on a jury.  </P> <P> </P> <P> He Isn't Called  </P> <P> As for Shapiro, he failed to be called for a jury panel on his first day of  duty but said he hopes to serve on a case. He said it doesn't matter whether  the trial is civil or criminal.  </P> <P> "It's a very important process," Shapiro said of the American jury system.  "That's why I've put so much into it."  </P> <P> He said he hopes many other hearing-impaired jurors will follow him.  </P> <P> "I hope I'm not the last one called," he said.  </P></p>

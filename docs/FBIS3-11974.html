According to Figueres' Foreign Minister-designate Fernando  Naranjo, one of his main tasks will be to improve the  deteriorated relations.    "We have viewed with concern a deterioration of relations  with the United States. This country is definitely our main  economic partner and has been our political ally for many  decades," Naranjo highlighted in an interview with LA REPUBLICA,  in which he explained the main goals of his tenure.    The future foreign minister said in a decisive manner: "We  do not like the cooling of diplomatic relations between the two  nations, and we deem it necessary that we will be able to talk  with the United States as friends and to overcome any  differences. This will permit us to have a close and respectful  relationship."    Since last year, a series of differences have cooled  relations with the United States. However, according to  experts, the situation started when the administration of  President Calderon Fournier endorsed former U.S. President  George Bush in the election won by Democrat Bill Clinton.  <H5>  Moment of Tension </H5>   Tensions soared in February of last year, when the United  States threatened to block a package of credits from the  Inter-American Development Bank because of delays in settling  land expropriation payments for U.S. citizens, particularly  those related to the Santa Elena Farm.    Additionally, in July 1993, the U.S. Commerce Department  ruled it would process a suit filed against the Costa Rican  Government over alleged labor rights violations.    The litigation was suspended because of a visit to  Washington, D.C., by Presidency Minister Rolando Lacle, during  which he pledged to fulfill a series of demands presented by the  powerful AFL-CIO.    This year, the threat of economic reprisals continues  because  of the legal dispute involving cellular telephones and the  Millicom Corp., as well as the resumption of the lawsuit by  national unions over alleged noncompliance with proposed  legislation.    Anticipating a scenario that could turn critical for the  national economy, Naranjo stressed: "We are going to work with  different ministries. If there is a labor problem, the Foreign  Ministry will work with the Labor Ministry. If there is a  commercial problem, we will work with the Foreign Trade  Ministry. Also, we will analyze any problem concerning  intellectual property rights with the Ministry of Justice or the  Ministry of the Presidency."    Naranjo added: "We are not trying to replace other  ministries, but these coordination efforts must be led by the  Foreign Ministry."    The strategy to be implemented with the United States will  be  one of improving political ties, because "people settle their  differences by talking to each other. If one speaks and makes  proposals, there will be an understanding, while if no  discussion is held and one's arguments are not explained, there  will be disagreement and relations between the nations will tend  to deteriorate," Naranjo asserted.    Naranjo said that along with improved relations with the  North Americans, he will promote a national dialogue on the  impact of Costa Rica's possible integration into NAFTA.    He said: "We have to think seriously about whether or not we  should join the trade agreement, because it would mean seriously  reforming the environment, labor laws, and the property system."    He added: "I have the impression that some people are  nonchalantly recommending we join NAFTA without thinking about  the cost of doing this. This is why I think there should be a  national consultation. Only after we have discussed this matter  with every sector can we engage in suitable negotiations."    Naranjo said he personally believes it will be good for the  country to join NAFTA because it would offer guarantees to  investors and open new markets. "The question is when and how  this should be done," the economist said.    Naranjo said the next government will make "great efforts"  to  strengthen its economic and commercial ties with Central America  but will remain opposed to a political union.    He said: "In the face of the challenges ahead, a small  country such as Costa Rica can do very little by itself. We  believe that there is strength in unity and that we must push to  secure regional agreements on important issues, such as the  marketing of bananas and coffee, as well as trade relations with  Europe and NAFTA."    The idea is, he said, "to consolidate Central American  positions" on these issues by way of trade talks being held with  other Latin American countries, such as Colombia and Venezuela.    Regarding the rejection of political integration on the  isthmus, Naranjo said it should not be sought until there is a  national agreement on it, something that does not exist now.    According to experts, Central American resentment toward  Costa Rica derives from the current government's decision to  separately initiate international efforts toward agreements,  such as a trade pact with Mexico and the United States.    At the past summit of Central American presidents in  Guatemala City, it was decided, as a conciliatory measure, that  those nations participating in regional integration efforts must  inform the other countries in the region whenever they initiate  trade talks with countries outside the region.    The future Costa Rican administration will seek the  formation  of a bloc to discuss financial and economic issues of interest  to 30 million Central Americans.</p>

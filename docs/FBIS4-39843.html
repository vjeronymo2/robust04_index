			<p>BFN     [Text] Almaty, 9 Jun -- President Nursultan Nazarbayev  addressed this morning's Supreme Council session. The president  spoke about of ways of strengthening Kazakhstan's statehood, and  its domestic and foreign policy for the near and distant future.    Touching upon the causes that led to the current situation  in  the Republic, which is characterized mainly by negative  processes and instability, economic crisis, decline in  production, and growing inflation, the head of state then  continued to dwell upon the best ways of developing market  reforms and democratizing society. This path has been  deliberately chosen by the people. We should focus our  attention on monetary and credit policy and bank reforms, and  should take into account the needs of a sovereign state and of  the market economy. Its main task is to combat the galloping  inflation and strengthen the national currency. "We should,"  the president said, "strengthen financial discipline both in the  budget and in the sphere of activities of banks and enterprises.  Otherwise, it will result in uncontrolled hyperinflation, the  last [words indistinct]."    He thinks that all the country's spending, except for the  most important, should be cut down--such as allocations for  paying wages, pensions, and social benefits [words indistinct].  Limited credits should be granted only under efficient programs  and projects. Enterprises operating in the red should be made  bankrupt in the near future. All benefits with regard to taxes  and dues should be cancelled. The government should not pay any  dubious debts and nonpayments of enterprises and banks, and  minimize spending on maintenance of the state bodies.    Along with this [words indistinct] of the major foreign  investors to participate in reforming the basic branches by  means of holding international tenders. Prices should be  released for all types of goods and services, including bread  prices. The low income families would be paid the difference.  The Finance Ministry should exercise tough control over the  revenue and expenditure parts of the budget. Any kind of  lobbying should be excluded. The National Bank should be freed  from supervision by the legislative and executive bodies, [word  indistinct] aimed at stabilizing the tenge.    "It will not be easy," the president said, "a great number  of  enterprises will come to a standstill, the number of unemployed  will increase, as well as a number of unhappy people, who will  call for demonstrations and blame [words indistinct]. We will  have to withstand all this. There in no turning back."    In addition to all these, we will have to address new issues  in the area of privatization and developing the private sector  and competition, he said. We should encourage production and  labor [as received] and create an efficient and powerful  mechanism for social protection of the population. Legal reform  should support economic reforms.    Of great importance is the creation of [words indistinct],  the atmosphere of stability in the Republic, and national and  civil accord. If we do not achieve all this "then we will be on  the verge of disaster." In connection with this, the head of  state [words indistinct] "those who are trying to rub people the  wrong way, disrupt national accord and civil peace, should bear  responsibility for this in strict compliance with the law of our  country." He criticized [word indistinct] approach to migration  processes, which have to be studied and managed so as not loose  a skilled and active part of the population, and suggested  adoption of a new law on languages and to abandon discrimination  of the Russian language. [passage indistinct]    Nazarbayev paid a good deal of attention to the issues of  citizenship. He reminded of the decree that was adopted this  year in February on making amends to the relevant decree on  simplifying the procedure for acquiring citizenship and reducing  the time needed for this. Apart from this, a memorandum on  citizenship was signed at the end of March during the visit to  the Russian Federation by the head of our state. Now, "the  settlement of this issue depends on Kazakhstan and Russian  parliamentarians," Kazakhstan is unique in terms of the number  of ethnic groups that are living here. The president said that  a unique cultural space exists in Kazakhstan -- Russians and  Kazakhs being the main groups. Therefore, we should pay equal  attention to the development of the two but, at the same time,  we should not ignore the others. According to Nazarbayev, we  can achieve this if only "a legal basis is [words indistinct]  for the development of culture. We should eradicate race  discrimination and create equal opportunities for all  Kazakhstanis."    The leader of Kazakhstan urged parliamentarians to adopt a  package of documents that will take into consideration the  interests of every ethnic group and national interests. Only by  doing this can we strengthen and build interethnic accord and  ensure civil peace.    Nazarbayev put forward a number of other proposals aimed at  achieving consensus between [words indistinct]. Two of them  exclude each other. "All parties, movements, and mass media  should reach an accord on strengthening peace, friendship, and  stability in the Republic, especially at this difficult  transitional time, and second, to legalize and introduce tough  sanctions against those who encroach on sociopolitical  stability, be it citizens, political, public movements, or the  mass media." According to the president the first one is more  advantageous.    The president also spoke about the Euroasian union, further  reforms in legal, executive, and juridical branches of power,  deepening market reforms, cutting inflation, and raising the  living standards of people. He also spoke in favor of the  two-chamber parliament that will oust the discredited practice  of adopting laws. Nazarbayev thinks that it is necessary to  carry out comprehensive reforms in the Judicial Branch of power  already this year. In particular, he thinks that it is  necessary to abandon the division between arbitrate courts and  [word indistinct], to legalize the principles of unchangeability  of judges, and to introduce the norms [word indistinct].    With regard to the recent Supreme Council session which  expressed a vote of no-confidence in the socioeconomic and legal  policies of the government, the head of state urged  parliamentarians not to rush [passage indistinct] At the same  time, we should exercise tough control over its activities, and  if need be we should render it relevant support and correct its  mistakes.</p>

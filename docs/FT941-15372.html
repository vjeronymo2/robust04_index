			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Adams fails to lift ban as Ulster talks continue Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, yesterday failed in his appeal against an exclusion order keeping him out of mainland Britain. The move came as the London and Dublin governments signalled their determination to press ahead with talks on the province's future irrespective of whether the republican movement agrees to embrace the UK-Irish peace initiative. Mr Adams said the decision to retain his ban was 'a gratuitous reaffirmation of John Major's arrogant refusal to engage meaningfully and positively' in the peace process. Republican leaders have still not given a definitive response to last month's Downing Street declaration. The British government now believes that the odds are stacked heavily against an early end to IRA violence. Downing Street said yesterday that talks - co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister - had continued this week with a meeting with the Ulster Unionists. Mr Ancram is to meet representatives of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party later this month. A 40-minute meeting at Downing Street between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, yesterday failed to bridge differences between them over whether London should respond to Sinn Fein's demands for clarification of last month's joint declara-tion. But Mr Hume left the 'very constructive' meeting in a relatively upbeat mood. He was 'very, very encouraged' by the fact that Ulster remained at the top of Mr Major's agenda. Appealing for patience, Mr Hume said he still thought peace was very possible. He added: 'I do not have a gloomy prospect.' Downing Street said it welcomed Mr Hume's strong support for the joint declaration. Mr Major was keeping in close contact with leaders of the other constitutional parties. Mr Hume confirmed that his contacts with Mr Adams to discuss possible progress on the peace process would continue.</p>

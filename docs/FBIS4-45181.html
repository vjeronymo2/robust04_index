			<p>Drug   Charges   <F P=102> PA2105201294 Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1742 GMT 21 May 94 </F> <F P=103> PA2105201294 </F> <F P=104>  Panama City ACAN </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 21 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Four Guatemalan  children were rescued by the police from a secret nursery in the  home of a U.S. citizen who was arrested and charged with drug  trafficking.    Police sources reported today, Saturday, that the children  were found in a home owned by U.S. citizen Sara Matzar in  Pabnjachel in the northwestern department of Solola. The  residence was searched following the issuing of a judicial  order, and a woman identified as Martina Matzar Sapin, who was  caring for the children and is related to Sara, was arrested.    The children were identified as twins Joaquin and Rigoberto,  five; Marcela Mercedes, three; and Eva Noelia Peron, five.    Martina Matzar said the four children are Sara's adopted  children. She is being held in a prison in the Guatemalan  capital, accused of alleged drug trafficking. Her extradition  has been requested by the U.S. Embassy.    Police are investigating to determine the origin of the four  children who, according to Martina Matzar, are from Santa  Catarina Palopo, Solola.    There have been two incidents in 1994 involving two U.S.  citizens accused by Guatemalan residents of being child  snatchers, although the charges turned out to be false.    The U.S. Embassy has denied that its citizens are involved  in  the kidnapping of children.</p>

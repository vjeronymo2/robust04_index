			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cuts offset weak sales at Pharmacia Pharmacia, one of the world's top 20 drugs groups in terms of sales, said yesterday that underlying operating profits rose 18 per cent to SKr4.43bn (Dollars 602.2m) in the first nine months of the year. Cost cutting enabled the group to improve its performance, against increasing competition and health authority clampdowns which reduced sales of some of its leading drugs. Year-on-year comparisons were distorted by one-off gains and the group's acquisition of the Italian pharmaceuticals company Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Fice) in May 1993. Pro-forma figures show underlying sales up 3 per cent at SKr19.87bn and operating costs down 4.2 per cent at SKr14.84bn. One-off gains of SKr842m helped lift operating profits to SKr4.43bn, up 61 per cent from last year's SKr2.74bn. Income after taxes and minority interests was SKr2.66bn. In the third quarter, operating profits rose to SKr1.66bn from SKr996m. However, excluding one-off gains of SKr658m, the figure was just SKr12m higher than a year ago. Pharmacia, privatised by the Swedish government in June, has mounted a cost-cutting drive since its Fice purchase. The programme aims to trim annual costs by SKr1.2bn by 1996 and lift the operating margin to 20 per cent. In the 12 months to September 30, the margin reached 16.7 per cent, compared with 14.7 per cent for the full 1993 year. Sales development has been less successful. Sales of Genotropin, the company's growth hormone drug, fell 6 per cent over the nine months, to SKr1.96bn, due to tougher competition in some markets and cost-containment measures in Spain, Australia and Italy. Sales of Healon (cataract surgery) were 4 per cent lower at SKr1.18bn after being hit by tougher competition and lower prices in the US and Japan. The anti-blood clotting agent Fragmin has been hit by changed reimbursement rules in Japan. Its sales were 9 per cent lower at SKr592m. The group's anti-cancer products, Farmorubicin and Adriamycin, showed a favourable development, with sales rising 13 and 7 per cent respectively.</p>

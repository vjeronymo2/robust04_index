			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> CALLING CARDS LEFT IN BAR BY HORSES  </P> <P> Police were looking Friday for a couple of mischievous beer drinkers -- and  their horses -- who got carried away in an Ojai bar earlier this week. But they  are not quite sure what to charge them with if they are found.  </P> <P> A man and a woman on horseback stopped by The Hub in the 200 block of East Ojai  Avenue on Wednesday, said Bonnie Dohrn, a dispatcher for the Ventura County  Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> While the woman waited outside, the man ordered two beers to go, Dohrn said.  Then they rode off, leaving horse droppings behind, she said. Patrons of the  bar cleaned up the mess in front of the building, she said.  </P> <P> Lt. Larry Weimer said about 10:30 p.m. the couple trotted their horses into the  bar, ordered two beers to go and "how can I say this? The horses made a mess on  the floor." Then they left through the back door.  </P> <P> "They're still trying to get the stains out of the carpeting," said Jim Beard,  husband of bar owner Leah Beard.  </P> <P> Beard said he and his wife know the man on horseback but identified him only as  "Old Cowboy Jack." The Beards do not plan to press charges.  </P> <P> "We've been friends with him for 25 years. He's a real nice guy. Well, he can  be a jerk too," Jim Beard said.  </P> <P> Beard said Cowboy Jack was trying to impress his new girlfriend.  </P> <P> "I thought it was funny," Beard said. "He's 52 years old. He knows better."  </P> <P> Although police say the case is still under investigation, Weimer said, "I'm  not sure that there's even a violation of a law unless it's a health and safety  law."

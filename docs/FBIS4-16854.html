			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By KHOVAR agency correspondent Negmat Ochilov for TASS] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe April 19 TASS -- "Tajikistan strives for a  new political and economic system and plans to conduct an  open-door policy to pull out of the dire crisis," Tajik Premier  Abdulmadjid Samadov told a news conference in Dushanbe on  Tuesday.    Replying to journalists, he said that the republic "firmly  abides by the position of pooling the monetary systems of  Tajikistan and Russia". This notwithstanding, bank notes with  national symbols will appear in the republic in May.    According to the premier, they are called upon to serve the  needs of the domestic market. This measure is temporary,  Samadov stressed, and the reason for it is "that Tajikistan is  now at an intermediary stage of pooling the monetary systems of  the two states".    The meeting with journalists was arranged in connection with  the opening of a national strategic research centre which is  called upon to prepare true information on the situation in  various spheres and to carry out examination of the most  important decisions taken by the republican leadership.    The centre is also instructed to work out the government's  position on major economic projects.</p>

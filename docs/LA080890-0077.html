			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE WARNED OF MIDEAST FALLOUT  </P> <P> The California Legislature was told Tuesday that although the state imports no  crude oil from the Middle East, it is hardly immune to the economic  consequences of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Together, Iraq and Kuwait produce 8% of the world's total oil supply -- and if  this amount is not available, "that's a heck of a big shock to the worldwide  market," state Energy Commission member Richard A. Bilas testified.  </P> <P> Because the worldwide pool of oil is bought and sold on the changing global  market as a commodity, Bilas said, California or any other state or nation  cannot "lock up" a chunk of the supply for its own uses.  </P> <P> As a result, Bilas told a special hearing of the State Senate Energy Committee,  the ripples of Middle East oil economics affect the pocketbooks of Californians  to some extent even though California does not import oil from the Arab world.  </P> <P> At a hearing called to take a preliminary look at the impact of the Persian  Gulf crisis on California, Bilas said the state produces 47% of the crude oil  it uses and imports 46% from Alaska. The other 7% comes from Indonesia.  </P> <P> "The fact that California imports (little) of its oil from foreign countries  does not mean that we are independent from supply disruptions in other areas of  the world," he told the committee. "Oil is sold in a worldwide market. So  disruptions any place will, of necessity, affect the state of California."  </P></p>

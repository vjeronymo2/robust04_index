Nastase mentioned that these consultations have only an  exploratory character and that it is difficult to accomplish  several steps in a brief time, given the big differences between  parties in approaching various issues. However, for the time  being it is very clear that the revitalization of the executive  is necessary because the only realistic formula today is a  monocolor, reshuffled PDSR government, meaning that it will be a  government that has acquired a greater degree of competence and  efficiency.    The parliamentary forces on both sides of the political  spectrum will be able to support such a government in accordance  with the initiatives that the executive is going to suggest.    Adrian Nastase did not wish to mention for the time being  which are the portfolios that will be affected by the reshuffle,  but stressed that the modifications in the government team could  be carried out very soon.    Mircea Cosea, state minister and president of the Council  for  Coordination, Strategy, and Economic Reform, also talked about  negotiations between political parties during an interview  broadcast on Bucharest Radio this morning. He mentioned that  there is a very encouraging development on this subject, meaning  that the mutual accusations of anti-reformism have disappeared  and the sides reached a stage where they accept reform as the  only chance to come out of the current impasse. Likewise, the  Chamber of Deputies and the Senate have given positive signs in  connection with the memorandum concluded with the IMF and there  is justified hope that in a reasonable time, the few laws that  are still to be passed by the parliament and which are  unquestionably necessary for the implementation of the  memorandum will be adopted and will serve as a basis to  reformulating the prognosis for 1994, an activity to start as  early as next month.    Mircea Cosea warned the population that this year no  economic  miracle or a radical improvement of production and life  conditions should be expected, but rather a gradual, step by  step accumulation and a positive tendency, which would permit  the revival of economic activity. Privatization will have to be  accelerated indeed because it is high time to move on from words  to facts. Thus, as of May 1994, the enterprises put on sale  will be auctioned and thus a secondary market will be created  for ownership certificates.    Cosea also announced that Iacob Zelenco was appointed  secretary of state at the Privatization Agency on the basis of  his experience and competence.    As far as the issue of attracting foreign investors is  concerned, substantial progress has been achieved in  negotiations with important firms such as [?Credit Bank] and  [name indistinct] and finalization of accord is expected with  the latter during President Ion Iliescu's upcoming visit to  South Korea.    Mircea Cosea also approached the issue of inflation and  increase of prices, which he considered as being normal for the  present situation, when the issue of exchange rate is being  worked out. He added that certainly, in the second half of this  year, a more adequate rate of inflation will be reached as wel  as a relative decrease of prices.    His conclusion was that our country has reached a phase of  real and irreversible reform, which consists of a more alert  pace of privatization and restructuring but also a more careful  evaluation of social costs of transition.</p>

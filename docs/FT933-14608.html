			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Moroccan unionist pardoned Mr Noubir Amaoui, the secretary general of Morocco's influential trade union, the Confederation Democratique du Travail (CDT), was released from prison yesterday after being pardoned by King Hassan, writes Francis Ghiles in London. He had been sentenced to two years' imprisonment for allegedly 'insulting the government' in an interview published 18 months ago. Mr Amaoui is a member of the ruling council of the Moroccan opposition party Union Socialiste des Forces Populaires (USFP). Three weeks ago the USFP won 48 seats in elections considered by observers to be the fairest in many years.</p>

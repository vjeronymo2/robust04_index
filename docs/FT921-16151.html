			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / International Equity Issues: Balance sheet repairs and privatisations revive sector and which brought a new burst of equity issues in the international market place. The value of international share issues in 1991, at Dollars 20.3bn, was more than 50 per cent up on the previous 12 months. And with the US stock market roaring ahead, dragging others behind it, the queue of issuers waiting to raise fresh equity capital points to a record start to 1992. Demand for international equity investment bounced back in 1991, after a year in which institutional investors had largely turned their backs on the stock markets. There was plenty of supply on tap: companies in the US and UK, seeking to rebuild their balance sheets after the debt-laden 1980s, and global privatisation offerings from countries which had barely tapped the international markets before, led the list of new issues. During 1990, net cross-border equity flows reached just Dollars 11bn, according to Salomon Brothers. In 1991, by contrast, the US investment bank estimates that net flows topped Dollars 50bn. US and continental European investors have led the new wave of international investment, taking over from the UK and Japanese investors, who were behind the previous boom in international investment at the end of the 1980s. Early in 1991, demand focused largely on convertible issues, rather than straight equity. Offers from leading UK and US companies, including Hanson and American Brands, helped take the issuance of convertibles in the international market in the first six months to nearly Dollars 6bn, more than the whole of any of the previous three years. A steady flow of new shares from US companies, at more than double 1990's Dollars 2.5bn, was the dominant factor behind the strong supply of equity last year. The continuing supply of UK shares in the international market, accounted for largely by the Dollars 2bn international tranche in the BT privatisation during the autumn, was also notable. However, it was the newcomers to the international market place which stole the show. Foremost among them was Mexico, which confirmed its return to favour among international investors with Dollars 3.5bn of new issues. A Dollars 2.2bn transaction from Telmex led the way, followed later in the year by deals from Televisa and Vitro. Other unfamiliar issuers came from South Africa, Israel and New Zealand. Bankers report that issuers from other so-called emerging markets - including India, Pakistan, Brazil and Argentina  -are likely to come to the international market next year. Other countries which generated substantial new issues included France and Italy. The international offerings from French companies Elf and Total, and the sale by the Italian investment group, IRI, of holdings in Stet and Credito Italiano, also pointed towards further international issues from these countries in the coming year. This list of companies gives some idea of the sectors which commanded the interest of international equity investors: telecommunications and energy, with a considerable volume of issues for food and drinks groups as well. Each is seen by investors as a sound defensive sector in times of uncertainty. Telecommunication issues dominated, with utilities from the UK, Italy, New Zealand and Mexico all mounting substantial international offers. Given the volume of new issues from the US, and the importance of US investors in driving international investment, it is perhaps not surprising to see US investment banks dominate the league tables of lead managers last year. However, this alone cannot account for the remarkable 32 per cent market share achieved by Goldman Sachs, which was recorded by Euromoney - nor the strong performance of Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers International, Salomon Brothers, and Morgan Stanley. Rather, the investment made by these institutions in developing their international investment banking divisions in recent years has clearly begun to pay off. These five banks were responsible for no less than 60 per cent of the new international equity issues last year - up from around 30 per cent during the much quieter 1990. Only Credit Suisse First Boston, with a market share of 11 per cent, putting it second to Goldman, could challenge this US dominance.</p>

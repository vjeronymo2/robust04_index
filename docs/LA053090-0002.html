			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA'S CUP PANEL FAILS, FOR NOW, TO GET $10 MILLION FROM PORT  </P> <P> The San Diego Unified Port District agreed "in concept" Tuesday to enter into a  three-year "public-private partnership" with the America's Cup Organizing  Committee but stopped short of giving the sponsors of the international sailing  regatta any of the $10 million in public money they say they need.  </P> <P> Milford Portwood, chairman of the Board of Port Commissioners, opened the  meeting by pointing to the America's Cup trophy and saying to Malin Burnham,  president of the organizing committee: "Mr. Burnham, we at the port appreciate  your turning the Cup over to us."  </P> <P> Burnham's immediate retort was: "There's a price to be paid."  </P> <P> Burnham and three other speakers took turns extolling the benefits that three  years of preparing for and staging the event will mean to the local economy.  </P> <P> Burnham said the regatta would bring the city $43 million "in tax revenue  alone" and that the port would make $90 for every $1 it spends in funding the  event.  </P> <P> An economist from the University of San Diego estimated the countywide economic  impact as $911 million, which Burnham said would not be realized without the  best effort possible.  </P> <P> "The finals of this race are in May of 1992, and I submit to you that after  that time, this community will never again be the same," Burnham said. "We can  make it work for us, or we can fall flat on our face."  </P> <P> Burnham said the $10 million needed from the port will go toward a media center  (to accommodate 4,000 journalists), an international broadcast center, race  headquarters, an America's Cup village (for shoreside viewing) and an America's  Cup museum. He said part of the $10 million will go toward youth educational  programs.  </P> <P> But the item that seemed to surprise and confound some of the commissioners was  Burnham's request for another $5 million to refurbish and develop the 10th  Avenue Terminal -- if needed -- for three to five racing syndicates that  private boatyards may be unable to accommodate.  </P> <P> Previously, members of the organizing committee had said private shipyards and  marinas could probably accommodate all teams entered in the race.  </P> <P> Burnham said that 20 international challengers from 15 countries and 10  American defenders had entered the competition. Eight of those teams have never  before sailed in America's Cup events.  </P> <P> "It's wonderful to see all this enthusiasm," said Commissioner Lynn Schenk.  "But we have to set enthusiasm aside. We have to set boosterism aside. I read  somewhere that a member of the organizing committee said Port money was  'quasi-public money.' I suppose he said that because it isn't tax money, but it  is public money.  </P> <P> "We have to look at this thing in a hard, businesslike way and ask a lot of  questions about how the money's being spent."  </P> <P> "I didn't realize when I was cheering you on the past two years," Commissioner  Delton Reopelle said to Burnham at one point, "that you'd then turn around and  dig so deeply into our pockets."  </P> <P> Tom Mitchell, a spokesman for the organizing committee, said the sponsors need  $10 million from the port "to do the job correctly, but when we sit down with  the commissioners and the port (staff), we may find the figure going up or  down. Maybe the port will want to spend more than the $10 million we're asking  for. Our budget is very, very fluid, simply because it has to be.  </P> <P> "This isn't like a Super Bowl, where you have a set number of teams and  players, and that's that. At this point, we can't just establish a firm figure  for what race preparations will cost."  </P> <P> Asked why corporate or private donors couldn't come up with the $10 million,  Burnham said he preferred to use the money from "the Coca-Colas and Marlboros  of the world" to fund the syndicates attempting to defend the Cup for the San  Diego Yacht Club.  </P> <P> "My No. 1 priority is a successful defense of the Cup," Burnham said.  </P> <P> Burnham said the America's Cup will be of paramount value to San Diego in  making the city known to the rest of the world. He compared its impact to that  of two other international sporting spectacles, the World Cup soccer  competition and the Olympics.  </P> <P> He said the America's Cup would have "no less an impact on San Diego" than the  1984 Olympics did on Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Commissioner Portwood seemed to agree, saying, "This is the kind of publicity  this community just can't buy. The benefit will be great and far-reaching, so  much so it's difficult to quantify.  </P> <P> "If we tried to match this event by promoting the port on our own, I don't  think we could do it for $100 million, let alone $10 million."  </P> <P> Port District Director Don Nay said recently that, although port revenues now  exceed expenditures by more than $40 million a year, making the port a target  for groups needy of public money, the port faces litigation from several groups  that may end up in losses of several million dollars.  </P> <P> Nay alluded to a $200-million complaint by homeowners in Point Loma upset over  airport noise and to ridding San Diego Bay of toxic pollution, which may cost  $100 million.  </P> <P> "I'm sure people will turn to us," Nay said in a recent interview, "but we have  many more demands than resources."  </P> <P> But Burnham, who Tuesday enlisted the president of City College and an outgoing  Australian to extol the benefits of regattas, said cleaning up the bay could be  just "one of the many benefits" the race brings to San Diego.  </P> <P> "We can also spotlight the 500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America  (in 1992) and San Diego's significance to the Pacific Rim," he said. "But time  is precious, and whatever time we lose today can't be made up in the future."  </P></p>

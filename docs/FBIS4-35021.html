			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "What Do the Tapes Contain?"] </F>   [Text] The cassette that has been circulating clandestinely  among various institutions and personalities contains three  [number as published] intercepted telephone conversations.    The main protagonist in the three calls seems to be Alberto  Giraldo, a journalist who has worked for EL SIGLO, LA REPUBLICA,  and Radio Super and who gained some notoriety when he was  described as the spokesman of Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez  Orejuela in 1987, a few months after the Cali trial, which ended  with Gilberto Rodriguez' acquittal in the first public legal  proceeding against him for drug trafficking.    In the three conversations, the man, who is apparently  Giraldo, phones individuals who are apparently the Rodriguez  Orejuela brothers to let them know of the efforts he has made  with persons close to the Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana  campaigns to negotiate a solution to the Rodriguez' case.    On each occasion, the person, who has been identified as  journalist Alberto Giraldo in different circles, refers to names  and to efforts to demand, in each case, a remuneration for  serving as a middleman.  <H5>  Conversation One </H5>   In the first conversation, Giraldo phones someone who seems  to be Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela. He asks him about the plane  that should pick him up and then explains he has great news.  Giraldo tells him he has spoken with Beltz and Maza Marquez  [former presidential candidate].    The person speaking with Giraldo, presumably Gilberto  Rodriguez, anxiously asks Giraldo about the security of the line  they are using and then asks Giraldo why he has not gotten in  touch with "Gordo Garcia."    Later in the conversation, Rodriguez instructs Giraldo to  get  in touch with Alvaro Pava, the Conservative senator who owns  Radio Super, so he can be brought up to date on the efforts he  has made within Andres Pastrana's campaign.    At the end of conversation number one, Giraldo explains to  Gilberto Rodriguez that he has spoken with Maza Marquez, that  things have improved a "heck of a lot" and that the important  thing is that they deliver the cash so that, according to what  he implies, it can be given to Maza Marquez.  <H5>  Conversation Two </H5>   In the second conversation, Giraldo does not seem to be  talking with Gilberto but with Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela.  Giraldo begins by complaining to Miguel about several articles  that have appeared in the newspaper LA PRENSA, whose director is  Juan Carlos Pastrana.    According to the complaints, the Pastranas, through LA  PRENSA, have accused Giraldo of being the reason why Maza  Marquez joined Samper's campaign.    Immediately thereafter Giraldo explains to Rodriguez that  "Eduardo," who from the context of the conversation would appear  to be Eduardo Mestre, urgently needs money and Rodriguez  explains that in fact "Eduardo" already sent an envoy to them.    The revelation worries Giraldo, who finally asked Rodriguez  who the envoy was, to which Rodriguez responded that it was  Villegas (during the same conversation he was identified as  Cesar Villegas).    Both [Giraldo and Villegas] are named in the conversation as  alleged intermediaries between the Samper campaign and the  Rodriguez Orejuela's. Moreover, the person who is seemingly  Miguel Rodriguez reveals that he had also received telephone  calls from "Medina" and he asks Giraldo to be calm and discreet  and to not discuss this matter with "Eduardo."    "Medina," who elsewhere in the conversation is referred to  as  Santi," seems in reality to be Santiago Medina, Samper's  campaign treasurer.    Due to the tone of the conversation, the person believed to  be Miguel Rodriguez questions his caller regarding the safety of  the telephone line and later explains that efforts must be  conducted on various fronts.    Giraldo insists on the importance of five points, among them  several important appointments which, he said, must be  guaranteed.    Later in the conversation Giraldo asks what he must tell  "Medina," and Rodriguez instructs him to explain that the money  will be sent in two payments as they had agreed.    Further on, Giraldo confirms to Miguel Rodriguez that  Samper's victory is in his hands and he denies what appears to  be an assertion by "Medina" to the effect that the Santo Domingo  Group was prepared to contribute to Samper's campaign all the  money it needed. According to Giraldo, the campaign needed 5  billion and has only received 2 billion, apparently from the  Santo Domingo Group. Rodriguez explains to Giraldo that the  remaining 3 billion are ready and the cartel can deliver them  without any difficulties.    In response to this assertion, Giraldo complains there was  nothing in it for him, to which Rodriguez responds that he is  not the candidate nor does he have 47 percent of the vote.  Giraldo later insists on receiving a bonus for the efforts he  presumably made and Rodriguez tells him that if Samper wins the  cartel will give him a bonus. However, he prohibited Giraldo  from making separate requests to the two alleged Rodriguez' and  two other powerful drug traffickers in Valle.    Later, reference is made to Maza's campaign concerning the  fact that it was a good thing he only garnered 60,000 of an  expected 100,000 votes, adding that therein lies the importance  of the [Rodriguez'] efforts. He was apparently referring to  40,000 votes that might go to Samper.    To conclude, they discussed "Eduardo," apparently Eduardo  Mestre Sarmiento, and Villegas; Rodriguez complained of the  meager results that usually characterize efforts with "Eduardo"  and Giraldo tells him that "Eduardo" had already met with the  two top men of the campaign and that what matters is the  existence of an agreement that will be fulfilled.</p>

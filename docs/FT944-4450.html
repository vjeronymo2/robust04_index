			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Exercised over cuts in Customs and Excise Sir, Your article, 'Reforms of Customs work announced' (December 1), reports Mrs Valerie Strachan, chairman of Customs and Excise, as promising that 'there are not going to be any customs-free ports or airports'. If she means what she says, it will be a welcome development. Only recently (November 25), in a written answer to a parliamentary question, Mr David Heathcoat Amory, the paymaster-general, listed six airports which receive scheduled flights from abroad and currently do not have full-time customs staff. The cuts of 550 anti-smuggling staff announced this week will add to this list. At these airports, instead of being met by customs officers, incoming passengers simply find a notice next to a telephone which they are asked to use if they have anything to declare. I suspect that smugglers of drugs, firearms or pornography are unlikely to use this 'more efficient' service. Mike King, assistant secretary, NUCPS national officer for Customs and Excise, 124-130 Southwark Street, London, SE1 0TU</p>

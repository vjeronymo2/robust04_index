			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Daimler approves micro car production Daimler-Benz, the German engineering group, has given formal approval for the production of the pioneering micro city car that is being developed through a joint venture between Mercedes-Benz, its automotive subsidiary, and SMH, the Swiss watch maker. The company will decide this month on the site for a new assembly plant for the project, but is expected to choose a site in France, the first time Mercedes-Benz will have chosen to assemble vehicles in the country. Mercedes-Benz is planning a radical approach to car assembly, with a modular assembly system relying heavily on outside suppliers. The company said yesterday that the level of vertical integration - the share of in-house production versus bought-in components - would be cut to 20 per cent from 45 per cent of existing Mercedes-Benz car operations. More than half the components and systems for the micro car will be supplied from existing Mercedes-Benz plants or other suppliers in Germany, with the remainder from components producers in west Europe. The 'unusually low' level of vertical integration was a precondition for producing the car at a very low cost and 'highly competitive prices', the company said. Mercedes-Benz, which holds a 51 per cent stake in the Micro-Compact-Car joint venture, and SMH, the maker of Swatch watches, which holds 49 per cent, aim to launch the 'micro compact car' in Europe by 1997/98, with an initial production capacity of 100,000 to 150,000 cars a year. They aim to open up a new segment at the bottom of the European car market for a two-seater urban micro car that would be only 2.5m long - significantly shorter than the Mini - allowing it to be parked in congested cities head-on to the pavement.</p>

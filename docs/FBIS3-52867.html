			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A U.S. Congress delegation entrusted to determine  the fate of six Israeli soldiers missing in Lebanon will arrive  in Beirut today.    According to Hizballah sources, a Hizballah delegation in  Damascus for the past two days has met Syrian officials but no  member of the U.S. delegation.    The U.S. delegation was expected to arrive in Lebanon  yesterday afternoon but the visit was postponed until today  following contacts between the Lebanese Government and the U.S.  Embassy in Beirut.    The delegation is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Rafiq  al-Hariri and Lebanese areas and villages. It is unlikely that  Speaker Nabih Birri will receive the U.S. delegation.    Sources close to 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah say  Fadlallah is not interested in the delegation or its mission.  According to diplomatic sources, Israel has conveyed an offer  to the delegation saying it is ready to release all the Lebanese  and Palestinian detainees once Israeli pilot Ron Arad is  released.    Hizballah leaders have said they refuse to meet the U.S.  delegation face to face but noted that this [communication] may  take place through friendly powers.    Hizballah Political Bureau Chairman Husayn al-Khalil said  there is no connection between Hizballah Secretary General Hasan  Nasrallah's current visit to Damascus and the visit conducted by  the U.S. Congressional delegation. He added that Nasrallah's  visit was scheduled a week ago for talks with Syrian Vice  President 'Abd-al- Halim Khaddam. Al-Khalil said: Khaddam did  not discuss this issue with us and no efforts are being exerted  in this regard.    Al-Khalil said Hizballah officials refuse to meet face to  face with any U.S. official but he expressed willingness to look  into the issue through an honest mediator who is not biased  toward Israel. Al-Khalil said: We cannot give the Americans the  honor of negotiating with us in this regard.    Al-Khalil said any party wishing to play this [mediation]  role should guarantee the release of all the Lebanese and  Palestinian detainees captured in Lebanese territory, including  Shaykh 'Abd-al- Karim 'Ubayd.</p>

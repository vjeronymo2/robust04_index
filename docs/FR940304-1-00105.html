			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association recommended that pulse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion and condensation be simplified to condensation of flue gases. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential efficiency improvement is to extract enough heat out of the flue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gases, such that condensation occurs. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association, No 40. at 5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department notes that manufacturing costs and actual efficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for design options that condense flue gases depend on the method of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condensation. Therefore, pulse combustion was retained as a separate design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Northern Indiana Public Service recommended that pulse combustion and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condensation of flue gases be eliminated as design options. While these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designs are clearly feasible from a technical standpoint, cost considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have proven to be insurmountable thus far. (Northern Indiana Public Service,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 48 at 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since pulse combustion and condensation of flue gas technologies are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasible, the Department cannot eliminate these design options, but has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered their cost impacts using the best available estimates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy proposed that flue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dampers and intermittent ignition devices be treated as separate designs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of concerns about contaminating indoor air with combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products from the pilot light, the Department did not consider flue dampers as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a separate design option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Natural Resources Defense Council proposed that DOE evaluate power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion with intermittent ignition devices. (Natural Resources Defense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council, No. 13 at 27).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From the limited description of this design option, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed that the Natural Resources Defense Council was referring to a fan-assisted combustion system using electronic ignition with the fan before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion chamber. Part of the increase in efficiency from this design is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused by the fan restricting off-cycle air flow through the flue. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduces off-cycle flue losses. The Department analyzed power vent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermittent ignition devices, which is a fan-assisted combustion system with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fan after the combustion chamber. The reduction of flue losses would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to the reduction for the design option recommended by the Natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resources Defense Council.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Northern Indiana Public Service also stated that for vent fans, the main  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy-conserving value is the reduction of flue losses, and a thermal vent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damper could be used to accomplish that reduction more simply. (Northern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indiana Public Service, No. 48 at 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department did not analyze vent dampers, which are above the draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hood, but did analyze flue dampers, which are below the draft hood, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conjunction with intermittent ignition devices as discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oklahoma Natural Gas proposed that DOE analyze improved burner design,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modulating controls, improved flue baffling and improved fill tube designs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce sediment buildup and temperature stacking of heated water. (Oklahoma  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Natural Gas, No. 57 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department was not able to obtain cost and efficiency data for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improved burner design or fill tube designs. No analysis was done for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modulating controls, because the Department is not aware of how this design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would improve efficiency. Improved flue baffling was included as a design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Rajendra Narang provided patented items for improving the efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of gas and oil water heaters. These included preheat of combustion air, self- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulating fuel flow to the burner, lower heat input, combustion dampers, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better heat exchangers. (Narang, No. 82).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No data on potential energy efficiency improvements or incremental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing costs were available for these design options. In addition, DOE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not able to develop any estimates on the cost or efficiency of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designs. Therefore, they were not included in today's proposed rule. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department requests cost and efficiency data on these designs in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate them for inclusion in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Observer: Sizing up What's so special about the Halifax Building Society? It hasn't had an exciting public flotation like the Abbey National or been as profitable as the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester. Hence, there will be some pained expressions at Halifax HQ at the sight of a 25 per cent jump in Abbey National's assets to Pounds 71.8bn. True, the Abbey is no longer a building society and its balance sheet has been inflated by money market activities. But unless there has been some nifty end-year window-dressing, it would be surprising if the Halifax balance sheet is bigger than the Abbey's when it reports in a fortnight's time. Take no notice of Halifax if it says that size doesn't matter any more. Being the biggest was one of its few claims to fame.</p>

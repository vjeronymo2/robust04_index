			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COX CABLE FIGHTING MAD AT CHANNEL 8;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: LEGAL ACTION CONSIDERED BECAUSE OF UNAUTHORIZED USAGE OF  COONEY-FOREMAN TAPE.  </P> <P> Cox Cable is considering legal action against KFMB-TV (Channel 8) for using  unauthorized videotape of the George Foreman-Gerry Cooney fight during its 11  p.m. newscast Monday, according to Marty Youngman, Cox pay-per-view manager.  </P> <P> Youngman said this was the first case he could recall of a San Diego network  affiliate using videotape of a pay-per-view event without permission.  </P> <P> Neither Jim Holtzman, Channel 8 news director, nor sports director Ted Leitner  returned phone calls Tuesday afternoon. Mike Reinberger, Channel 8's interim  sports producer, declined comment.  </P> <P> KGTV (Channel 10), KNSD-TV (Channel 39) and ESPN, the national sports network,  used still photographs from the fight, won by Foreman with a second-round  knockout. Channel 8 showed video of the fight highlights, including the final  knockdown.  </P> <P> In most events of this kind, cable systems throughout the country pay the fight  promoter for the exclusive rights. Cox, acting as the San Diego Cable Sports  Network, bought the rights for San Diego County from Top Rank Inc. and licensed  other cable systems throughout the county to air it. Cox customers paid $20 per  household to see the fight.  </P> <P> "Channel 8 is specifically prohibited by my contract" from using footage,  according to Youngman. "It's something neither we nor Top Rank will put up  with."  </P> <P> When a bar or restaurant screens a fight without permission, it's not unusual  for the cable system to seek monetary damages. Youngman said that is one option  in what he said is a unique case. He wouldn't say what other options might be.  </P> <P> "We want people to know that if it is an exclusive program they can't turn to  the 11 p.m. news for highlights," he said. "I'm more concerned with stopping it  and making sure it doesn't happen again."  </P> <P> Youngman said someone from Channel 8 had called him on Monday to ask if fight  footage could be used, but Wednesday he couldn't identify the caller.  </P> <P> Youngman said Cox will investigate further before deciding on a course of  action.  </P></p>

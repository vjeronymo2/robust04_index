			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Shares in JR East soar 57.8% on debut SHARES in East Japan Railway (JR East) soared 57.8 per cent above their initial offer price when half the company's shares were floated on the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday. The stock was finally traded at Y600,000 (Dollars 5,535) a share, after remaining bid-only all day. The listing of JR East is the biggest offering of a semi-privatised company since the Dollars 160bn flotation of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in 1986. It is a crucial test of the market's strength ahead of flotations for other government-held companies, including Japan Tobacco and the remaining six regional railways. Brokers hope that the success of JR East will help restore confidence among retail investors, who have been discouraged by last year's sharp drop in the price of NTT shares. Traders said that the rush of buy orders clogged the Tokyo stock exchange's computers, disrupting the processing of orders. Two million of the 4m JR East shares held by state-owned Japan National Railway Settlement were listed yesterday. TSE officials said that JNR Settlement had to inject more than 500,000 of its remaining shares into the market to deal with the lack of sellers amid a torrent of buyers. Mr Masatake Matsuda, president of JR East, rejected suggestions that the initial traded price was too high. He said that he believed the market price had been formed in a fair manner, based on proper information. Mr Matsuda said that JR East would maintain an annual dividend of Y5,000. However, he raised the possibility of a dividend increase, adding that he would need to compare the company's payout ratio and dividend rate with those of other listed companies.</p>

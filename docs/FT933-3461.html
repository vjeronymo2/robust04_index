			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): In the super league Britain has a 'super league' of middle-sized companies capable of making a considerable contribution to employment and economic growth but which have been overlooked in the enthusiasm for small businesses. This is the conclusion of a survey* of 3,500 fast-growing middle-sized companies - dubbed the 'super league' - by 3i, the development capital group, and Cranfield School of Management. The typical managing director of these companies is aged between 45 and 50 years and has worked for 10 years in the same industry. 'Whizz kids are rare,' the report's authors comment. The researchers sought out from records at Companies House profitable, privately owned businesses which had achieved sales growth of at least 25 per cent a year over a two-year period - 1989 and 1990. They selected companies with turnover of between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 100m at the beginning of the period. Nearly 3,500 companies or 11 per cent of the total met these criteria. Their aggregate turnover doubled to Pounds 18.4bn over the two years. The super-league companies provide employment for 244,000 people, a 30 per cent increase over the two years. Twenty six per cent were in manufacturing compared with 10 per cent for the UK as a whole. Twenty nine per cent of the companies were engaged in distribution, 18 per cent in construction and 16 per cent in transport and other services. The average gearing of these companies was 1.08 compared with 0.5 per cent for all companies. As a whole the middle-sized sector is numerically weak in the UK and suffers from a lack of public attention and encouragement, 3i said. 'If the UK authorities are seriously interested in promoting growth and creating jobs then this neglect must be abandoned,' it added. *Super League Companies. 3i Cranfield European Enterprise Centre, Cranfield, Bedford, MK43 0AL.

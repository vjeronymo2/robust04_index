			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Snisarenko: "Potential of the Duma Is </F> High; The Paramount Question: `How To Realize It?'"]    [Text] As we have already reported, the first plenary  meeting of the representative body of state power in Tyumen  Oblast was held, and the deputies chose to call themselves the  "oblast duma" (only 5 of the 17 deputies voted for the name  "legislative assembly").    I believe that the motivation of Deputy V. Yudin regarding  unity of the Russian land was well argumented: There is a state  duma in the capital of the Russian Federation, so then why  should every oblast or kray think up its own specific name?!    I also believe that Tyumen residents who are southerners  should not react painfully to the election of northerners as the  duma chairman and his deputy--N. Baryshnikov and V. Tretyakov.  They are not northerners above all, but rather they are Tyumen  residents first and foremost. In their very first brief  speeches, both spoke primarily about unity of the oblast and  about those pressing problems which the oblast duma is capable  of solving only by being united.    The speech "on results of work," presented by the head of  administration of Tyumen Oblast was also in the same vein.  Specifically, L. Roketskiy synonymously emphasized that he sees  the new duma as the main body of state power in the oblast, and  that it is necessary to speak not so much about the natural and  necessary separation of powers as about the parity of  responsibility for the fate of the oblast's present and future.    "You have been elected from the entire territory, and this  in  itself is a guarantee of its unity. Let us serve Tyumen Oblast  together!", said the governor.    We should mention also the farewell speech of the ex-speaker  of our former soviet, V. Ulyanov, in which he noted most  correctly that Tyumen Oblast was that region of Russia where,  fortunately, the transfer of power from the "old" soviets to the  new duma took place painlessly and in a civilized manner.    And now allow me to express certain strictly matter-of-fact  and specific notions about what I expect from our duma and...  what can be expected of it. At the same time, returning to the  headline of the present material, I will emphasize once again  that I believe the domestic potential of our oblast parliament  to be really high. And it is not at all frightening that we see  there a rather multi-layered "administrative stratification."  Just as strong is another stratification--"first hand" economic  managers, and next to them are teachers and doctors (I only  regret once again that no representatives of higher education  were elected to the duma).    Yes! One could sense that at its first session, some of the  regional heads in the duma "looked askance" in the direction of  their chief to whom they were directly subordinate. But I will  also say that L. Roketskiy himself immediately and in rather  strict form put a stop to their efforts at "consulting" and  "sharing opinions."    Yes! One could sense that the economic managers who had won  their relative independence tried already at the first meeting  to stage a cavalry charge against the executive power. That  happened too...    But I believe--and hope!--that this is merely the price of  development and growth. Our duma members must realize the main  thing: They must not follow the lead of the executive power in  trying to patch up the holes in our badly torn coat. Rather,  they must think about how to sew a new strong one which will  last a long time--that is their task!    And this task is not an easy one. It is tremendously  difficult. Especially since very little time has been left for  it--some year-and-a-half or two. And if the "first convocation"  of the duma proves unable to cope with the main task of waging a  mental attack on the slogan, "For our bright future!", then it  will not be able to break the ground for those who come to  replace it in 1996, when we--well, we simply must!--will have to  not simply follow the path of reform, but will finally have to  see its positive results.    A colossal weight of responsibility is being placed today on  the "full-time" leaders of the duma, N. Baryshnikov and V.  Tretyakov. We do not envy them. God forbid that they become  regular stately bureaucrats of a new model! It is they who will  determine today how strongly and effectively the work regimen of  duma activity will be organized, and I stress this last word. It  is they who must reorganize the technical apparatus which we  have inherited from yesterday's soviet into a highly productive  instrument for the realization of the thoughts and ideas of the  deputies, or more precisely, the members of the new duma.    I am not speaking now of trifles, such as when at the first  meeting "every and all" were crowded, perspiring, into a little  hall, where it was difficult to hear some of the speeches  because there were not enough microphones.    We are speaking of something else. What we need are not  blind  executors, but a system of analysts which most fruitfully  organizes and realizes the ideas and thoughts of the duma  members. I may even be so bold as to equate these two  forces--the duma itself and its new apparatus. If this does not  happen, then the duma will spin its wheels in place...    It is enough to give at least a cursory review of the plan  for the duma's standard-setting activity: Here we have that very  same draft of the Tyumen Oblast Charter and its Administrative  Code, other codes--land and water and statutes on the national  settlement and local self-government. We cannot list them all,  but these questions may be resolved only in a creative manner,  and with a scrupulously pragmatic and rational approach.    After all, that same "administrator" V. Bugayev was correct  in his "farewell" criticism of V. Ulyanov, when he cited the  latter's lack of preparation in regard to the totally unclear  mechanism for realization of the last message of the Minor  Soviet addressed to the RF Federal Assembly. Let us consider  this criticism as the first sign of efficiency in the work of  our Tyumen Oblast Duma which has just begun.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Commentary" column] </F>   [Text] From President Ezer Weizman and Rabbi Harris to  Yasir 'Arafat and Benazir Bhutto; from Fidel Castro to Prince  Philip and Madame Mitterand; the countries they represent are  all competing to gain favor with the new regime in South Africa.    However, it is not the rubbery smile of Nelson Mandela that  they are after, but rather control over the minerals on South  Africa's territory, and the strategic power that goes with it.    The race, however, has already been won by Western  countries,  and to be more precise, by Britain and America, who have been  the real bosses of Mandela and the ANC for the last 10 years.  So much so that it would have been more fitting if their flags  alone were fluttering over the Union Buildings -- if there had  been any honesty in diplomatic protocol.    Just as British and American financiers had helped the  Bolsheviks of Lenin and Trotsky to come to power in 1917 in  Russia, so too have Britain and America over the last 10 years  under Thatcher and Major, as well as under Carter, Bush, and  Clinton, helped the communist regime of Mandela and Slovo into  the saddle.    South African communists who fled before the security police  did not go to Moscow, but to London where the South African  Communist Party has its headquarters.    The American State Department financed the ANC for a quarter  of a century and had given guidance in its specialized  activities. At the same time the big brains of Harvard, who do  the thinking on behalf of American foreign policy such as the  controversial Samuel Huntington, had been doing their best to  undermine the will of the incompetent South African Government,  well supported by "diplomats" of the caliber of Chester Crocker.    The real victory smiles on Tuesday's photos [Mandela's  inauguration day] were those of Douglas Hurd, Hillary Clinton,  and Al Gore. However, he who laughs last laughs best. The  Afrikaner leaders, who are still going to capsize the whole  situation in our country, are going to laugh the best. It will  be their smiles that will be remembered the longest...</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAKESPEARE, MOZART, PUCCINI;  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'MIDSUMMER' AND 'LEAR' PRESENTED BY BRANAGH'S RENAISSANCE THEATRE CO.  </P> <P> The banner outside the Mark Taper Forum proclaims "King Lear A Midsummer  Night's Dream," minus a connecting/separating preposition. "King Lear" is in  block letters; "Midsummer" is in a more delicate cursive. Only the most  uninitiated theatergoer could mistake this proclamation of the twin bill  playing inside for the title of a single play. But the similarity of the  sensibilities that have gone into shaping the much-awaited Renaissance Theatre  Company's "King Lear" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream" might give one momentary  pause.  </P> <P> There are ideas here: clear, direct, youthful, vigorous and unshaded. In both  productions. Probably because both were staged by the same Wunderkind director,  Kenneth Branagh (whose recent film redux of Shakespeare's "Henry V" captured so  many imaginations). The acting company reflects this brash young leader. It too  is mostly young, inventive, talented and energetic. These qualities imbue the  whole enterprise with an exuberance that best serves the farcical elements of  "Midsummer" -- those bumbling "rude mechanicals" rehearsing their silly  play-within-the-play, the knock-down-drag-outs in the forest among the tortured  young lovers, Bottom's asinine dream, and a "bergomask" at the end that would  make the most resistent among us crack a smile through the sheer power of  send-up.  </P> <P> But where does all this buoyancy leave "King Lear"? Out on a limb. This is a  forceful "Lear," full of sound and fury, but with the heart carved out of it.  The vision is brash, dark, sexually tainted and not terribly interesting. We  get the trappings of drama here -- reddish ground, clanging portals, shafts of  unilateral light slicing the darkness -- but not the tragedy.  </P> <P> The King, as played by Richard Briers (the Bottom of "Midsummer"), gives us an  arrogant tyrant whose descent into insanity seems remarkably sane. Not even  when Gloucester's eyes are put out do we feel pained and revulsed -- partly  because Edward Jewesbury as Gloucester doesn't feel it enough. But only partly.  The scene itself is tamely done. There's a neatness to the whole undertaking  that lacks real blood and real sweat. The production comes in at a taut three  hours, but cutting the Fool (played by Emma Thompson, Branagh's wife) out of  the Dover scenes is the wrong kind of streamlining.  </P> <P> A play is not a race to be won. And this is not to imply that "Lear" is being  played that way. Or "Midsummer." Both have a good idea of what they want to be  and both offer some, if not enough, rewards. Branagh places both shows on the  same set designed by Jenny Tiramani -- a kind of astral nowhere, with stars and  a moon cut out of the backdrop and a circular stage in front. The stage is  covered in red pebbles, surrounded by an empty moat and ringed with an  additional playing strip.  </P> <P> The set remains bare, which is at once challenging for the actors and practical  for a touring production. There is one intrusive effect -- "real" rain during  one of the storm sequences in "Lear" -- that smacks of unnecessary bravura. If  you're going to indulge in this sort of thing, you'd better be prepared to  carry it through and for more than one scene. No one gets wet in this "rain."  It is the most overt example of the emphasis on externals that plagues both  productions. Otherwise, the effects gap is largely filled by the skill of the  actors, by Jon Linstrum's lighting and Patrick Doyle's original music (more  sound than music and often, particularly when it comes to the fairy songs in  "Midsummer," jarringly dissonant).  </P> <P> On the tally sheet, "Midsummer" fares best, of course, by dint of its monkey  business and fantastical lunacies, and because the play submits more easily to  the superimposition of a contemporary vision. The vision won't please everyone.  Titania (Siobhan Redmond) and Oberon (Simon Roberts) are charmless, noxious  spirits here, speaking in tortuous dialect-flavored English and done up in  fairly lurid punk rockish costumes. (All costumes are designed by Tiramani in  Early Nothing -- a hodgepodge of different periods, "The Rocky Horror Show" and  the far reaches of her singular imagination.)  </P> <P> Puck, played by Ethna Roddy (who delivers a tender and articulate Cordelia in  the other play) is more Caliban than Puck and almost completely  incomprehensible in what sounds like a thick Scottish brogue. This is not  practical with American audiences who have trouble enough with the Queen's  English. "Midsummer's" epilogue which follows an almost Noel Cowardish climax,  becomes a curiously anticlimactic pagan rite. It is hard to escape the feeling  of a playful, upbeat, enjoyable college production.  </P> <P> Branagh, it becomes abundantly clear, is an actor first, a good one, and an  actor's director. He loves their tricks and their imagination. His own Quince  is seething understatement broadly stated. Briers' Bottom is casual  unrestraint. The lovers (Thompson, Max Gold, James Larkin and Francine Morgan)  are bursting with peevishness and passion. They're absurdly, comically intense.  </P> <P> What's lacking all around is substance. Penetration. Subtlety. Branagh's world  is a place without nuance, a long drink of cold water: limpid, refreshing,  healthy but without aftertaste. The productions are cool geysers. They explode,  they don't dig deep and don't touch us deeply. For "Lear," which is a muscular,  clear reading of the play and fiercely acted on the surface, it means the  absence of subtext or of the possibility of tragic dimension. It is a  workmanlike, respectable, unboring, capable presentation, that never moves us.  It cannot make up in energy what it lacks in maturity. It runs but it does not  fly.  </P> <P>  At the Music Center, 135 N.

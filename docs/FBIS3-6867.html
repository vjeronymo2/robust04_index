The prime minister, who skipped the first meeting in Seattle  last year and caused dissatisfaction among some APEC members,  said he would be attending the summit since it was decided by  APEC. The inaugural summmit held in Seattle was initiated by  United States President Bill Clinton.    Speaking at the press conference after delivering a keynote  address at the 10th International General Meeting of the Pacific  Economic Cooperation Council in Kuala Lumpur, Datuk Sri Dr.  Mahathir reiterated that APEC should conduct informal meetings.  The prime minister said APEC should continue to exist as an  informal meeting and should not institutionalized its meetings  and have regular programs for a smooth [word indistinct]. But  the forum should not bind its members and that these objectives  should seek for members to know each other and understand their  constructive point of views.    To a question, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said the  Malaysian-initiated East Asia Economic Caucus, EAEC, is not  institutionalized and that it is a forum to discuss common  problems among countries in the region.</p>

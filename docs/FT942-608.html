			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Amoco receives tax settlement Amoco, the US oil group, has received about Dollars 440m, including interest, from a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, Reuter reports from Chicago. The settlement will result in a second-quarter after-tax gain of about Dollars 270m. The company said the payment was the final settlement of a dispute involving 'windfall profit taxes' in the 1980s. The settlement stems from seven cases filed by Amoco Production and its subsidiaries that contested notices of deficiency issued by the IRS, which alleged Amoco had underpaid its windfall profit tax liability from 1980 to 1986.</p>

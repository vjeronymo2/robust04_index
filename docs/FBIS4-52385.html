			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam had  a telephone conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata Tuesday afternoon to exchange opinions mostly on the recent  controversial remarks by former Japanese Justice Minister  Shigeto Nagano.    In the telephone talks initiated by Premier Hata, President  Kim said that Nagano's remarks on Japan's role during World War  II have shocked and hurt the Korean people.    "There should be no recurrence of a similar incident. The  Japanese cabinet member distorted the history of the past to  inflict an injury on the Korean people," the president said.    The telephone conversation lasted about 20 minutes beginning  5:15 PM.    Prime Minister Hata offered a regret over Nagano's remarks.  "It is highly regrettable that former Justice Minister Nagano's  remarks hurt the peoples of Korea and other Asian countries,"  Hata was quoted as saying.    Hata especially noted that at a Diet session earlier in the  day, he regretted Nagano's remarks by saying that his statement  had brought both sorrows and anger to many people in other Asian  countries, Chongwadae spokesman Chu Ton-sik said.    According to Chu, President Kim stressed that what is  important in the contemporary age is for South Korea and Japan  to cooperate with each other closely toward a new history and  march jointly onward toward common interests and peace in Asia.    The Japanese premier said Japan will continue to strive to  build constructive relations between Japan and other Asian  countries including South Korea based on a correct insight into  the past.</p>

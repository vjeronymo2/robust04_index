			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Capitol confusion The markets' initial reaction to the Republicans' mid-term triumph was euphoria. In many cases, the rationale was little more than the mantra that Republicans are good for business. In a few sectors, the increases were more justifiable. Defence stocks soared on hopes that traditionally hawkish Republicans could halt the decline in military spending. The effective death of the Clintons' healthcare package pushed up drugs stocks on both sides of the Atlantic, even though its demise will do nothing to ease margin pressures caused by the consolidation of the industry's customer base. Then reality set in. The risk that Republican isolationists could block ratification of the recent world trade agreement - with all the consequent dangers for the world economy - has increased. Most worrying is that prudent fiscal policy could be sacrificed on the altar of political expediency. With only two years to go before the presidential elections, Mr Clinton and the Republicans could start competing over who can deliver the largest tax cuts. Given that taxes are easier to cut than spending, the budget deficit could once again start expanding. The markets fear that could boost inflation, unsettle bonds and equities and require even larger increases in interest rates. Any hopes that the elections would reduce uncertainty have been unfulfilled. Indeed, yesterday's erratic movements probably represent a harbinger of greater market volatility brought by the Republicans' victory.</p>

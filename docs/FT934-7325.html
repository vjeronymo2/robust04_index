			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Timesharers get time for thought EUROPEAN Union ministers yesterday agreed new measures to protect potential buyers of timeshare properties from unscrupulous sellers. Since timeshare ownership became popular, buyers have often complained about high-pressure selling techniques and their inability to bring sales people based in other countries to justice. The directive approved yesterday provides for a minimum 10-day 'cooling-off' period to allow timeshare purchasers to change their minds. Britain, which had pushed hard for European-wide legislation, welcomed agreement on the directive. Many British people have bought a share in holiday homes, particularly in Spain. Existing UK legislation includes a 14-day cooling-off period, but applies only to contracts signed in Britain or under UK law. The new EU legislation also calls for contracts to be written in two languages to avoid confusion, and prevents sellers asking for deposits during the cooling-off period. The directive did not meet with the approval of all consumer affairs ministers. Italy and Portugal voted against it on the grounds that there should be a deposit and the Dutch abstained after calling for a longer cooling-off period. However, Lord Strathclyde, UK consumer affairs minister, who was not present for the agreement, said it was 'an effective package of consumer protection law' which would avoid 'unnecessary and bureaucratic burdens on the industry'. The measures were attacked, however, by the Timeshare Council, which represents legitimate timeshare companies in the UK. Mr Norman Burden, the council's chairman, said that the prohibition on deposits was unacceptable to the industry. He said: 'It goes against centuries of good commercial practice and undermines the mutual commitment which is the basis of every satisfactory contract. We shall continue to fight hard for the right to reasonable deposits.' He added: 'This new move brings a lot of uncertainty to an industry that sustains around 20,000 full-time jobs in Europe.'</p>

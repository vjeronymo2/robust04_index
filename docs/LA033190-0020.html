			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACK MEN AND JUSTICE SYSTEM  </P> <P> The Times is to be commended for printing the articles by Brown, Legrand Clegg  and Jewell Taylor Gibbs (March 17).  </P> <P> I am one of the "white masses" but I am deeply distressed at the killings in  the black inner-city neighborhoods and at society's abandonment of the children  from the moment of birth. They are programmed to poor education, to drugs, jail  and/or early death.  </P> <P> So long as these deplorable conditions exist for blacks in the inner cities, no  one can live in peace or tranquility.  </P> <P> DOLLY ADAMS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / New tax to fund NHS proposed Financing the National Health Service through an earmarked tax rather than general taxation could prove popular and clarify the debate on NHS expenditure, the British Medical Association says in a discussion document published yesterday. The BMA paper argues that a 'hypothecated', or dedicated, tax would encourage public discussion about investment in the NHS, and could under some circumstances lead to greater funding. It recognises, however, that the Treasury would probably oppose a specific health tax, although 'its objections are likely to be based more on political than economic judgments'. Yesterday's paper is the first in a series of research and discussion documents that the BMA plans to publish to encourage debate on health policy issues. Other subjects will include the democratic accountability of NHS purchasing authorities, equality of access to health services and community care. The BMA has consistently argued that the NHS is underfunded and one of the potential attractions of financing the service through a dedicated tax is health's relative popularity with the public as a spending priority. But the document acknowledges the difficulties that would be involved in introducing such a system. An independent body would, it says, be needed to oversee funds raised by the health tax and determine the expenditure and tax rates required. There would be likely to be political opposition to setting up a body with power to recommend changes in taxation that could have a considerable impact on the management of the economy. A specific health tax could, suggests the BMA document, take one of several forms. The widest coverage of potential taxpayers would be achieved by a flat rate or graduated health tax. But, by representing proportionately more of the income of lower earners, it could run into the same problems as the community charge. The Labour party is to publish a consultative document on its future health policy shortly. This may allow scope for debate on the possibility of a hypothecated health tax.

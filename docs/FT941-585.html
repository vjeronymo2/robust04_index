			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (5): Poor relation of the region - Saint Etienne To most French cities the economic recession that has hit France over the past few years came as a nasty shock after years of prosperity, but for Saint-Etienne it has simply marked yet another milestone in its long term decline. 'Most people talk about the economic crisis as though it has only lasted for the past year or two,' says Bruno Roux, head of economic development. 'For us it has gone on for much longer. Saint-Etienne has gone through every imaginable crisis over the past 30 years.' The litany of closures and cutbacks that has hit Saint-Etienne in the post-war period is undeniably brutal. It is a relatively young city by French standards: tracing its roots to the 19th century when coal mines and textile mills sprang up in the area. These mines and mills were later joined by steel plants engineering factories and by the 1930s Saint-Etienne was a thriving manufacturing centre. But the city has since declined dramatically as its traditional industries have disappeared. Saint-Etienne lost almost 30,000 jobs with the closure of the coal mines, 10,000 with the demise of its textile mills and 25,000 through the demise of the steel plants. It has also lost a string of smaller sectors, including its bicycle factories and gun makers. 'The only consolation is that our traditional industries died at different times,' says Mr Roux. 'This did at least give us the chance to try to heal the wounds left by one set of closures before the next catastrophe.' Saint-Etienne probably reached its nadir in the early 1980s when the local level of unemployment was roughly double the national average at 12 per cent. The local authorities redoubled their efforts to attract new investment to the area and to try to strengthen and restructure the surviving companies. This initiative was undoubtedly made more difficult by Saint-Etienne's image problem. The city, with its nouveau riche 19th century roots and traditional dependence on 'dirty' industries such as coal mining, had long been regarded as a poor relation of prosperous Lyon less than 60km away, not least by the Lyonnais themselves. Its post-war troubles undoubtedly reinforced this problem. 'One of our main difficulties is that Saint-Etienne is seen as an old mining town,' says Coralie Grimand, deputy director of the Loire Industrial Development Agency. 'It isn't true. The mines closed down years ago. But images stick and are difficult to erase.' The Stephanois, as the citizens of Saint-Etienne are called, have attempted to build on their traditional skills to create new industries. They have tred to build on the links between the old textile and steel mills with the medical products industry by targeting bio-medical companies. Similarly they have identified meat as a local speciality in the food sector on the back of Saint-Etienne's modern abattoir and its cattle market. One of the city's chief tactics for attracting new investment has been to offer incentives in the form of property. Saint-Etienne has been active in redeveloping old properties for industrial use and selling or letting them at low rates. It has thus had some success at attracting new investment. The best period was between 1986 and 1987, which meant that the new arrivals and start-ups had the benefit of the buoyant years of the late 1980s. There has also been a concerted effort to try to strengthen the existing industrial base. 'Saint-Etienne is dominated by small companies, many of which are used to operating as sub-contractors,' says Ms Grimand. Saint-Etienne has also attempted to address its image problem by raising its profile in the arts. A Museum of Modern Art opened in 1987 with a collection that ranges from Monet and Rodin, to contemporary figures such as the German artists, Georg Baselitz and Gerhard Richter. Saint-Etienne has also developed its theatrical tradition by inviting European drama groups to the city. The 1980s initiatives have helped to broaden the local economy. The mix of businesses is now more varied. The biggest local employer is not a manufacturer but Casino, the supermarket group which was founded in Saint-Etienne and is still headquartered there employing more than 3,500 people in the area. Coralie Grimand says there are signs of a modest pick-up in new investment. But the toll of job losses and business failures is still continuing and, according to Bruno Roux, there is no sign of the Stephanois sharing the increase in business confidence that is evident elsewhere in the Rhone-Alpes.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Observer: Bottoms up We falsely imagine German politicians rather dour dogs, particularly about their own profession. How pleasant therefore to see the main opposition leaders now betting each other over how long Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition, with a 10-seat majority, will survive. Joshka Fischer, leader of the Greens has bet Rudolf Scharping, head of the Social Democrats, that there will be a grand coalition - an alliance between Kohl's Christian Democrats and Scharping's lot - before next summer. No way, said Scharping, accepting Fischer's wager for an unspecified number of bottles of red wine. Sounds like Scharping wins either way.</p>

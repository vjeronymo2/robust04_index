			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Rights activist to lead Guatemala GUATEMALANS woke up yesterday to their third president in less than a week after the unanimous election by Congress of Mr Ramiro de Leon Carpio, the human rights ombudsman, ended a constitutional crisis that had thrown the country into political chaos. Mr De Leon, 51, won an uncontested second-round of voting after the withdrawal of Mr Arturo Herbruger, the 81-year-old president of the supreme electoral tribunal, who trailed by 64 to 51 votes in the first round. He will serve until January 1996 to finish the term of former president Jorge Serrano, who fled the country after failing to hold on to the authoritarian powers he had assumed on May 25. The election of Mr De Leon is being seen as a bold step by Congress, who chose the more controversial of the three candidates put forward by a broad coalition of business leaders, political parties, unions and popular organisations. 'Ramiro was not the candidate of the large party, the business sector, or the military,' said Mr Gabriel Aguilera, a political analyst. 'This is Congress responding to the street.' Mr De Leon has been a sharp critic of the powerful Guatemalan security forces for their widespread abuse of human rights. But on Saturday he praised the army for its role during the last few days in returning Guatemala to constitutional government, despite the military's initial backing for Mr Serrano's so-called self coup, and its later support for the illegal presidential bid of Mr Gustavo Espina, the former vice-president. Mr De Leon will be taking power at a difficult time. The credibility of state institutions is low and business confidence has been undermined by months of instability. It remains unclear how a much called-for purge of Congress will be effected.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 Apr (MENA)--Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq  al-Shar' has stated that his country's position on peace is  clear: implementation of the Security Council resolutions, full  Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, and a just and comprehensive  peace in the region.    Al-Shar' told AL-'ALAM AL-YAWM that Syria will not concede  one inch of Golan territory and will accept no security  arrangements at the expense of Syria's national security or  pan-Arab security.    He said Syria will determine its position on resuming the  peace negotiations in Washington in light of the results of U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher's upcoming tour of the  region.    The Syrian foreign minister called on the United States to  shoulder its responsibility as a sponsor of the peace process.  He urged the United States to make the right decision to  safeguard the peace process and preserve U.S. credibility in the  region.    Al-Shar' warned that if Israel fails to reconsider its  position toward the peace process as a whole and to make the  right decision to put this process back on track in accordance  with the Madrid formula, then things will keep getting worse.</p>

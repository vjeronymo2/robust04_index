			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> M MAIL: Supporters of Measure M, the half-cent tax for transportation on the  November ballot, are finally getting ready for their first mass mailing --  450,000 pieces due out in the next few days. . . . "We got a bit of a late  start," acknowledges Reed Royalty of the campaign, "but we're catching up." . .  . Late won't mean unsophisticated, though. There will be 30 different versions  of the mailer, informing voters in different areas of the county what streets  and intersections will be improved if the measure passes. Dennis McLellan and  Danny Sullivan  </P></p>

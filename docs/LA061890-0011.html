			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAMIR AND HIS NEW CREW: HARDLY LOOSE CANNONS;  </P> <P> FEARS OF EXTREMISM ARE EXAGGERATED. THIS ECLECTIC MIX HONORS WESTERN VALUES AND  IS STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE PEACE.  </P> <P> When the Israeli government led by the Likud Party's Yitzhak Shamir fell in  March after a parliamentary vote of noconfidence, the Bush Administration could  barely suppress its glee, anticipating that opposition leader Shimon Peres  would convert his majority in the Knesset into a pliable government led by the  Labor Party. Early reports predicted the end of Shamir's career and Peres'  comeback.  </P> <P> Americans unfortunately do not understand Israeli politics. If they did,  President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III would have been far  more circumspect in their earlier criticisms of Shamir. Small blocs are always  trying to bring down Israeli governments in the hope that they will be able to  leverage greater power in the new constellation that emerges from the ashes.  The religious parties, in fact, are now in just such a position.  </P> <P> It hasn't always been so. In November, 1988, the religious parties overplayed  their hands when, perceiving their capacity to hand Shamir a parliamentary  majority without the participation of the Labor Party, they demanded new  religious legislation that exceeded the secular majority's tolerance level.  Shamir then had to ally with Peres.  </P> <P> But when Bush and Baker drove the Israeli government into chaos three months  ago with their terms for promoting Israeli-Palestinian talks, the religious  groups saw a new opportunity: They could join Peres in bringing down the  "unity" governent and then negotiate with Shamir, knowing his bottom line from  the outset.  </P> <P> The government that has emerged will not be marked by the religious extremism  feared by its critics. The religious parties, now cognizant of Shamir's limits,  withdrew a number of the demands they had put forth 20 months ago. They will  get five ministries, three of which (Religious Affairs, Interior, and  Education) they have held before. A fourth, Absorption, will simply work to  integrate new Soviet immigrants into Israeli society.  </P> <P> Shamir's government, contrary to his opponents' worst fears, actually offers  the best possible opportunity to move forward on the panoply of major issues  that link the United States and Israel.  </P> <P> Just as the religious dimension of Israel's new government has been exaggerated  by its critics, so has the "right-wing" factor. Yuval Neeman, the new minister  of Science and Energy, is universally recognized as the nation's leader in the  field. While his Tehiya party does advocate annexing Judea and Samaria, more  commonly known as the West Bank and Gaza, it has been flexible enough to sit in  coalitions with Labor. And Ariel Sharon, who lobbied aggressively for the  defense portfolio, was forced to settle for the housing ministry; defense will  be in the hands of Moshe Arens, the outgoing foreign minister and former  ambassador to the United States. Arens is known as both a pragmatist and a  technocrat with American-bred values.  </P> <P> Surprisingly little attention has been paid to Shamir's naming of David Levy as  foreign minister. Levy is a charismatic figure in Israel's majority Sephardic  community, which is rooted in North Africa.  </P> <P> He is Israel's first foreign minister to speak little English and Americans  know little about him. He is fluent in Arabic and French; both languages are  likely to prove important in relations with the Arabs surrounding Israel. Those  who have followed his career recognize that Levy is the Likud's least  ideological leader.  </P> <P> In all, it is an eclectic mix -- balancing ideologues with pragmatists and  religionists with secularists. Americans will be pleased that Israel, which has  become the last Western outpost of economic socialism, will be committed to  implementing productivity-based capitalist principles. At the same time, the  new government will be strong enough to make peace. Observers sometimes forget  that Labor never signed a peace accord with any Arab government; only Menachem  Begin's Likud did that.  </P> <P> Yes, this new government can offer major breakthroughs. But the Arab world will  have to present its own peacemakers so that Shamir can talk with someone  serious about living in harmony with a Jewish state.  </P></p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: MAM rises 26% to more than Pounds 65m MERCURY Asset Management, Britain's largest institutional fund management company, yesterday reported a 26 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 65.1m for the year ended March 31 1993. The company, which is 75 per cent owned by investment bank SG Warburg, has proposed a final dividend of 12p (8.9p) making a total of 15p against 11.5p. The results include a Pounds 2.9m gain on the sale of Mercury's sale of its stake in fund manager Jupiter Tyndall which had been written down the year before. Mr Hugh Stevenson, chairman, said the improved results reflected a net increase in funds under management of Pounds 1.9bn. Gross funds under management rose to Pounds 49.7bn compared with Pounds 40bn, with a significant portion of the rise reflecting the dramatic improvement in asset values following Britain's withdrawal from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism last year. While the bulk of the net inflow consist of the institutional UK pension fund assets which have been the mainstay of Mercury's business, a significant portion are accounts from private clients, overseas accounts and charities. Funds managed for international clients have risen by about 30 per cent during 1992-93 to Pounds 9.4bn. Mr Stevenson explained that Mercury had spent about Pounds 25m in upgrading its systems over the past five years which has allowed it to expand funds under management dramatically without significant expansion in staff.

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / ANC gains parliamentary voice as MPs switch party THE African National Congress yesterday gained a voice in South Africa's segregated parliament for the first time, as five white MPs joined the organisation. The five, who had been elected as members of the liberal opposition Democratic party, said they would stay in parliament as independents representing the ANC. The Democratic party, which suspended four of the five men last week, yesterday said it would expel them. The move illustrates the realignment in white politics taking place since last month's white referendum, in which the ruling National party gained an overwhelming mandate to abolish apartheid. With the first multi-racial elections expected to take place by early next year, white politicians are beginning to woo non-white voters. The National party is seeking a coalition of whites, mixed-race 'coloureds', Indians and moderate blacks while the ANC wants to extend its support beyond blacks. Yesterday the ANC, which for decades has condemned the whites-only House of Assembly as racist, said it was delighted at the move. The five men - Mr Pierre Cronje, Mr Dave Dalling, Mr Jan van Eck, Mr Jannie Momberg and Mr Rob Haswell - cannot officially sit as ANC MPs because the ANC is not registered as a political party, but they will represent its interests in the legislature. They said they would try to improve the image of the organisation in the white community, where it has very few supporters. The five were obviously emotionally moved by their decision to become members of the multi-racial ANC, after years of informal contacts with the organisation inside and outside the country. Mr Momberg, who previously spent 30 years within the ruling National party, spoke of a desire to right the wrongs of apartheid for which he accepted partial blame. The five said in a statement: 'We join the ANC to work towards the full liberation of all South Africans. . . to work for democracy in practice.' They ended their address with the words of the ANC national anthem, 'Nkosi sikele i'Afrika' (God bless Africa). Sitting at a table flanked by senior ANC leaders, they quickly adopted the rhetoric of liberation, referring to their new colleagues as 'comrade'. The five men are likely to have little influence in parliament, where the National party has an overwhelming majority. But their defection will damage the Democratic party, which now has 28 seats.</p>

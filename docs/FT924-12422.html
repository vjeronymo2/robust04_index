			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Costain strikes Pounds 123m deal with Peabody COSTAIN, the UK construction group, has agreed to sell for Dollars 200m cash (Pounds 123m) its profitable Australian coal mining business to Peabody Coal, a subsidiary of Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate. Peabody operates open cast and deep coal mines in the US, and is the second largest private coal producer in the world. It has been identified by Hanson as one of the core businesses it wishes to expand. Peabody will also assume responsibility for borrowings, including capitalised lease obligations of ADollars 120m (Pounds 53m). The sale price gives Costain a book profit of Pounds 92m. The deal will lead to a substantial reduction in Costain's borrowings which, after the recent slump in the value of sterling, had risen to Pounds 344m. That included Pounds 52m of off-balance sheet loans due on the Spitalfields commercial property joint venture in London. The debt was equivalent to gearing of more than 100 per cent based on shareholders' funds of Pounds 276m at the end of last year. Gearing would then fall to about 50 per cent but, after substantial property write downs in the UK and Australia, it was expected to be about 70 per cent. Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, said: 'The deal will improve our financial position. A book profit of Pounds 92m is very good in the current market.' He said the Australian subsidiary made pre-tax profits of ADollars 46m the 12 months to the end of June. The purchase is the first large acquisition outside the US by Peabody, which last year made operating profits of Dollars 296m. Mr David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson Industries, the conglomerate's North American arm, said: 'This is part of a continuing programme of expanding our core businesses. 'We will wait and see what happens with British Coal. We will certainly look at it although privatisation is still a long way down the road.' There was 'nothing incompatible' in expanding a core business, particularly in the US, while making opportunistic bids such as its Pounds 780m offer for Ranks Hovis McDougall.</p>

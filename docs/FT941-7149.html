			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (6): Goodbye to narrow nationalism - Robert Corzine on how the state oil company is striving for efficiency and cooperation Kuwait was at the forefront of the drive in the 1970s by oil producers to wrest control of their industries from foreign concession holders. In the 1990s Kuwait may prove to be a pioneer in the process of reshaping often bloated state oil companies along the leaner lines of their private sector counterparts. And it may do so in partnership with foreign companies. The beginnings of what could evolve into a radical departure in oil policy come after two decades in which Kuwait built up a fully integrated, state-owned industry. Subsidiaries of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, the holding company at the centre of the sector, are involved at all stages of the industry's 'value chain', from crude oil production to refining, petrochemicals, retail marketing and shipping, both in Kuwait and abroad. The structure, modelled on that of the big integrated oil majors, has helped to even out revenue flows. Refining and marketing, for example, are traditionally able to achieve higher margins during periods of low oil prices. Kuwait's low cost of production, estimated by Western experts to be as little as 70-80 US cents a barrel, is an added advantage. In the past it has offset to some extent the inefficiency associated with chronic over-manning of the sector. But just as the Kuwait government is having to think about ways to reduce the welfare state, the highly cosseted oil industry is having to think about how it will adjust to growing world competition in an era of relatively low prices. Low production costs cannot be the only measure of the industry's efficiency, according to Mr Nader Sultan, the new deputy chairman of KPC and until last November the former head of its international operations in London. He believes the main challenge facing the sector is the need to adopt the best practices of international oil companies, but to do so within the restrictions imposed by the company's social obligations as the country's single-largest employer and most politically-sensitive industry. Mr Sultan acknowledges that 'sometimes it feels as though I am being pulled apart' by conflicting forces, although he is optimistic that a politically-acceptable way forward can be found. The privatisation of some KPC assets is central to the drive for efficiency, he says. The first step is still being debated, but it is likely to be the sale of domestic service stations. Other activities such as the domestic distribution of LPG cylinders and shore-based support services for visiting tankers could follow. Outside investors might also find an early role in Kuwait's fleet of oil and refined product tankers. The sale of refining operations is less likely. 'We would have a problem if a potential partner said let's have a joint venture at an existing refinery, he says. 'What real advantage could they bring? But starting with a clean slate is different.' Likewise, he sees no prospect of selling off well-developed production assets such as part of the giant Burgan oil field. But future foreign involvement in the exploration and production of undeveloped reserves is one of the main issues in a wide-ranging internal debate over Kuwait's future oil policy. At present foreign involvement is confined to technical assistance contracts such as the one held by British Petroleum. Amoco and Chevron are discussing similar arrangements, which some Kuwaitis believe could evolve into broader cooperation, including joint ventures. Mr Sultan, however, believes much can be done to improve efficiency in the industry before 'we bring in foreign partners'. But partnerships may be essential to maintaining the momentum of an efficiency drive, he adds. There would also be substantial technical and administrative advantages to partnerships, according to western industry executives. Foreign involvement would also lessen the costs of raising sustainable capacity to 3m barrels a day, 1m b/d more than Kuwait's present quota from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Mr Sultan says the higher figure is equivalent to the long-term market demand for Kuwaiti oil. Industry observers say it would also boost Kuwait's bargaining power in Opec, as well as allow it to respond to any sudden shortfalls in world markets. Specific areas which might be opened to exploration include potential offshore fields as well as parts of western Kuwait, near the Iraqi border. The presence of western oil companies in such militarily sensitive areas is seen by many Kuwaitis as a way to enhance their long-term security. It might also counteract nationalist arguments against foreign participation in oil production. In addition any agreements with foreign companies are likely to be production sharing deals rather than the concessions which Kuwaitis associate with the colonial era.</p>

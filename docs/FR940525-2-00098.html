Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Public Law 97&hyph;415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing this regular biweekly notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Law 97&hyph;415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended (the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed to be issued from May 2, 1994, through May 13, 1994. The last  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biweekly notice was published on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24745).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination for each amendment request is shown below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication of this notice will be considered in making any final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination will consider all public and State comments received before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action is taken. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this action will occur very infrequently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. Written comments may also be delivered to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By June 24, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be permitted to participate as a party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

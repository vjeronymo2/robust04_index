NEC Corp. will build a new line at its plant in Roseville,  California, that could produce 64-megabit dynamic random-access  memory (DRAM) chips, an NEC spokesman said.    NEC also plans to build a manufacturing plant in Kyushu for  64- megabit chips for production starting in August.    Hitachi Ltd. is building a plant in Ibaraki Prefecture that  will contain facilities for production of 64-megabit chips, a  Hitachi spokesman said.    Fujitsu Ltd. also has a plan to build a similar-level of  facilities for logic chips, a Fujitsu spokesman said.    The moves are viewed by analysts as efforts by Japanese chip  makers to gain a step on their U.S. and South Korean rivals in  the market share contest for 64-megabit chips.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH JANICE;  </P> <P> THE REMATCH  </P> <P> I turned a profit for the third consecutive day as Cove Dancer came through on  part of my $50-to-win-and-place bet in the first race by finishing second. I  will try to keep my streak going today by betting $50 to win on Moscow Moment  in the third race and a $50 place parlay from Moscow Moment to Rules All in the  ninth race.  </P> <P> SURELOCK lost on his $20 exacta box in the eighth race when Horsche won, but  Via May finished fifth. SURELOCK's bet today will be $40 to win and place on  Fille L' Argent in the eighth race.  </P> <P> Janice Goldinger's Thur. bankroll: $2,317.50  </P> <P> Thur.

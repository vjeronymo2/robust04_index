			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> ONE SCIENTIST UNDER THE MICROSCOPE;  </P> <P> THE THREAT AND THE GLORY REFLECTIONS ON SCIENCE AND SCIENTISTS BY P.D. MEDAWAR  HARPER &amp; ROW $22.50, 277 PAGES  </P> <P> I wish I had known Peter Medawar, the British Nobelist who received the prize  for physiology or medicine in 1960. Those who did, speak of him with awe.  </P> <P> By all accounts he was brilliant and gracious, a humanist with a gift for  explaining his passion in graceful prose.  </P> <P> As a scientist he expanded the curative power of medicine when he successfully  grafted "foreign" cells onto an animal still in utero, overcoming the problem  of tissue rejection and opening up the field of immunology, including the  ability to transplant organs from one individual to another.  </P> <P> He was a towering figure literally (he stood more than 6 feet tall) and  figuratively, with students and friends around the world. Medawar wrote for the  general public and was frequently invited to lecture and review.  </P> <P> "The Threat and the Glory: Reflections on Science and Scientists" is a  posthumous collection of these articles and talks, some published before,  others in print for the first time, all reflecting Medawar's thoughts about  science from the late 1950s until his death in 1987.  </P> <P> The 23 chapters range from fascinating "bench" stories of life in the lab, such  as "The Strange Case of the Spotted Mice," to a defense of the use of animals  in research, six talks about "The Future of Man" delivered in 1959, and  thoughts on dying, written between the strokes that incapacitated him but never  completely prevented him from working.  </P> <P> As director of Britain's National Institute for Medical Research, Medawar was  often attacked by antivivisectionists. In the Paget Lecture in 1966, sponsored  by the Research Defense Society, he addressed the use of experimental animals  to enlarge medical knowledge.  </P> <P> Trained initially as a zoologist, Medawar was interested in evolutionary  theory, especially the question of "fitness" in humans as well as animals. He  thought of the animal rights sentiment in Britain as a recent trend -- going  back only 170 years -- and faulted rights advocates for their sentimentality.  </P> <P> Then turning to the National Institute for Medical Research, where animals were  bred and cared for by professionals familiar with their genetic composition and  history, he supported what he referred to as "the 3 R's of humane laboratory  practice: Reduction, Refinement and Replacement": reduction in numbers of  animals used, refinement of experimental techniques, and their eventual  replacement by tissue culture and computer simulation.  </P> <P> What is interesting for an American reader is the directive that in Britain  animals can be used only when an immediate medical application is foreseen.  Medawar found this restriction cramping. He emphasized the need for pure  research, which would necessitate the use of more animals in the laboratory. He  acknowledged the right of the general public to know about all animal research  but wanted this research expanded to include any that would advance human  welfare. And Medawar defined human welfare as more than physical health, but as  the satisfaction of what he saw as a species-specific compulsion to explore the  world.  </P> <P> Critics today, including scientists like Jane Goodall, suggest that the  satisfaction of human curiosity is not the unmitigated good that has been  preached since the Enlightenment, and that science can overstep its role.  Medawar would adamantly disagree.  </P> <P> "It is too late now to adopt an intellectually pastoral existence . . . too  late to cease to be ambitious." And for this ambition to be satisfied, he  maintained, living animals will be needed for research, albeit in declining  numbers, for some time to come.  </P> <P> Medawar was an unabashed "speciesist" who made no apologies for his  championship of Homo sapiens. In "The Future of Man," six talks for the Reith  lectures of 1959 that compose a third of this volume, Medawar pondered our  evolutionary future, including the possibility that advances in medicine may be  regressive, enabling the supposedly "unfit" to reproduce "and the dangers, real  or imagined, of the genetic deterioration brought about by the propagation of  the genetically unfit."  </P> <P> These fears are part of an English scientific preoccupation with degeneration,  articulated earlier in the century by the eugenicist Karl Pearson and much  disputed by later scientists.  </P> <P> This chapter is filled with interesting facts about population changes -- that  older mothers tend to have daughters rather than sons -- and that populations  that consciously limit family size tend to complete their families while young,  and thus reduce the average gap between generations. What would he have made of  the tendency today for late marriages and delayed births, which also result in  small families but with increased gaps between generations?  </P> <P> Medawar was apparently a charismatic figure, as witnessed in the foreword by  Lewis Thomas. His inspirational thoughts in "The Life Instinct and Dignity in  Dying" suggest why he elicited such broad affection. The volume is, inevitably,  a mixed bag, rich in good scientific storytelling, but also already a  period-piece, reflecting biases of place and class.  </P> <P> Next: Jonathan Kirsch reviews "The Legacy: The Vietnam War in the American  Imagination," edited by D. Michael Shafer (Beacon Press).  </P> <P> </P></p>

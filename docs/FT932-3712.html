			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Stronger yen casts its shadow over equities - Market activity in Tokyo The summer months, historically, have been unkind to the Tokyo stock market. After the jump in activity during recent months, shares are currently facing a lull, on uncertainty over a higher yen and on caution regarding the course of the economy. The Nikkei index rose 24 per cent during the first four months of this year, but it has remained almost flat around 20,500 during the past month. The 21,000 line has proven to be a tough one to crack, as investors who bought around that level in 1991 wait to unload their holdings. There are now signs that US hedge funds, looking for quick profits, are anticipating a chance to sell into weakness, creating short positions in the near term. Last month's corporate results season held few surprises, with pre-tax profits for leading companies down by some 30 per cent. Estimates for pre-tax profits for the current year to March 1994 are mixed, ranging from a rise of 14 per cent to a fall of 10 per cent. The rise in the equity market over the past few months, seems to indicate that investors have discounted corporate profits for the fiscal year to March 1995. Mr Patrick Thompson, at Fleming Investment Management, believes that corporate profits could rise by 70 to 100 per cent for that year. With the market on a prospective p/e of 78 times, however, many investors have started to feel uncomfortable over current valuations. They are not willing to increase holdings further until there is a fall in share prices or firm evidence of an improvement in the economy. Japanese institutional investors, who have been inactive during the recent rally, may not come in until they confirm the market's uptrend. The sudden rise in the yen against the dollar threatens companies' projections of flat profits for the current year to March 1994. The rise also comes at a time when a spate of statistics is casting doubts on previous optimism over an imminent bottoming out of the economy. Bank lending for April rose by 1.1 per cent from the previous year, its smallest rise ever, while industrial output for April fell 2.2 per cent from the month before after two consecutive months of strong gains. Mr Geoffrey Barker, an economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, points out that the stronger yen could depress the Nikkei below the 20,000 level. 'The contradiction of the yen gaining as a result of the stable stock market, and in turn threatening economic recovery, will be tested,' he says. While denied by the US, the yen's rise reflects the perception among investors that currency market movements will be used to pressure Japan. Analysts point out that a strong yen will not achieve a fall in Japan's trade surplus. Some believe that unless a policy to solve bilateral trade issues is formulated between the US and Japan, the dollar could fall to as low as Y100. A higher yen is good news for inflation. It also means lower import prices. However, benefits for the consumer are expected to be offset by corporate rationalisation. Leading companies have announced an average decline of 1.86 per cent for this year's summer bonuses, the first fall since 1987. In short, rather than enriching the ordinary Japanese, and triggering a return in consumer confidence through lower imports, a higher yen will hurt consumption as companies will feel squeeze on income. Meanwhile, the recent stability of prices has given authorities room to address the market's structural problems. A recent report commissioned by the finance ministry identifies cross shareholdings between companies as a barrier to an efficient market. On the over-the-counter market, disclosure problems of small companies have once again made investors nervous. At the beginning of this month, Hanix Industry, a construction machinery manufacturer, announced that it had filed for court protection, with liabilities totalling Y170bn. The company blamed 'malicious credit reports' and allegations of tax evasion for itsfunding problems. While the incident reflected the vulnerability of small companies to rumours, it also cast doubts on the lack of disclosure by OTC corporations. Earlier this week rumours that THK, a leading bearings company, was facing financial problems once again rocked the OTC market. The Japan Securities Dealers Association is now to study disclosure measures for OTC companies. In the near term, the 21,000 level continues to be a barrier for the Nikkei. Japanese investors expect resistance at that level to persist, and remain conservative in their forecasts. Mr Mr Kazuo Tamayama, fund manager at Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment Management, expects the index to fluctuate between 18,000 and 22,000 until the autumn. Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson is more optimistic. He sees the Nikkei falling to 18,500 in the worst case scenario, but thinks that the next few months will be a trough before a 'powerful drive upwards", predicting that it will reach 24,000 by the end of the year.</p>

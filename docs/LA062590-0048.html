			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE LAUDED FOR POLICY OF LETTING INS SCREEN COURT;  </P> <P> IMMIGRATION: HE ASSISTS IN EVENTUAL DEPORTATION OF DEFENDANTS WHO ARE ILLEGAL  ALIENS. A BILL IN SACRAMENTO WOULD ENCOURAGE OTHER JURISTS TO DO THE SAME.  </P> <P> Eighteen months after Judge David O. Carter invited federal immigration agents  into his Orange County courtroom to identify illegal aliens convicted of  serious crimes, the experiment is being eyed as a model for California and  other border states.  </P> <P> A proposed law that would encourage all Superior Court judges in California to  follow Carter's lead easily cleared the state Assembly recently. And in  Washington, the leader of a U.S. Justice Department-backed study said he, too,  is optimistic about duplicating the Orange County project in other courts.  </P> <P> "We're very impressed with the program in Orange County," said Joseph A.  Trotter Jr., a lawyer at American University who is conducting the study with a  Justice Department grant. "It has a lot of potential benefit for alleviating  caseload pressures."  </P> <P> Carter is believed to be the only county or state judge in the country who has  invited INS agents to screen people coming through his court -- and his  approach is criticized by some who see it as abusive of detainees or a misuse  of time.  </P> <P> "He's the only judge who feels it's necessary to use state resources for a  federal agency," said Ramon Ortiz, the assistant public defender in charge of  Orange County Superior Court cases. "I find it wrong."  </P> <P> Most of those coming to Carter's court and screened by the INS are felons who  have violated the terms of their probation. A smaller percentage have pleaded  guilty to a new felony offense and are awaiting sentencing before Carter,  although he said he does not know in advance what any offender's residency  status is.  </P> <P> In addition to allowing access to the offenders, Carter's court staff also  promptly provides the INS agents with certified criminal-conviction documents  that are crucial to the deportation process, according to immigration  officials.  </P> <P> Carter's statistics show that illegal aliens make up more than one-third of the  criminal offenders appearing in his court. According to the records, 35% -- 834  of the 2,366 offenders screened in 1989 -- were identified as illegal aliens.  If those violators are not deported upon completing their sentences, local  probation officers already working at full capacity must supervise them.  </P> <P> For Carter, a remedy is at hand: Those illegal-alien offenders -- many of whom  have committed drug offenses, burglary or violent crimes -- should not continue  to burden the probation system.  </P> <P> "I'll be damned if I'm not going to have the resources to turn around a  16-year-old, or an 18-year-old kid" who otherwise might lose the chance to be  rehabilitated while on probation, Carter, 46, said in an interview.  </P> <P> Because of legal restraints and limited federal funds, Carter conceded that it  may be impossible to quickly clear caseloads by deporting criminal aliens  before they are sentenced to already-clogged jails and prisons.  </P> <P> But Carter and INS officials said they are hopeful that, after the illegal  aliens have served their sentences and are formally deported as felons, they  will be less eager to re-enter the United States and risk prosecution that  could result in maximum terms of two to 15 years in federal prison.  </P> <P> John Brechtel, INS assistant district director for investigations, did not have  statistics to document his view, but he said he is convinced "the rate of  recidivism is less" among those deported with a formal, criminal-alien status.  </P> <P> An observation by The Times of Carter's court last week found that INS agents  questioned female and male offenders who would appear later in the morning  before the judge. The questioning occurred through the metal bars of a holding  cell two floors beneath the courtroom in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Once the agents located an offender they believed was an illegal alien, they  asked questions aimed at providing the best long-term identification aids. One  man, for instance, displayed a hand with a severed middle finger. Another  showed a huge tattoo on his shoulder.  </P> <P> The aliens set to appear before Carter, said one of the INS agents, "are very  cooperative. It's very rare that someone will claim that he's an American  citizen when he's an undocumented alien."  </P> <P> The agents said that the most basic tip-off of whether an individual is in the  United States illegally is whether that person can speak English. After the  questioning is completed and those interviewed appear before Carter, the  judge's staff provides the necessary paper work, usually within 24 hours.  </P> <P> A bill inspired by Carter's project cleared the state Assembly on June 15 by a  61-4 vote. It would specify that judges could, under state law, similarly  cooperate with the INS.  </P> <P> "A lot of (judges) are hesitant to implement it because it is not specifically  allowed for in law," said Lynn Montgomery, a spokeswoman for the bill's author,  Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> The measure, AB 3819, is awaiting a hearing in the state Senate and Roos said  he expects it to pass.  </P> <P> The Orange County project also is getting national scrutiny. Trotter, the  lawyer at American University, has enlisted court officials from Texas and Cook  County, Ill., to help examine the project. He said the group will report its  findings to the Justice Department later this summer.  </P> <P> Still, some look skeptically at the project.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Horowitz, supervisor of the court's  criminal division, said he thinks it is better for INS agents to confine their  screening to jail facilities. The INS has been granted access to Los Angeles  County jails for about a year, Horowitz said, but not to courtroom holding  cells, as allowed by Carter.  </P> <P> Horowitz said that granting INS agents access to the holding cells "really  interferes" with the confidentiality of conversations between defense lawyers  and detainees in what are already cramped quarters.  </P> <P> Nativo Lopez, spokesman for Hermandad Mexicana Nacional of Santa Ana, an  advocacy group for undocumented workers, said he is "concerned from the  standpoint that individuals are not informed that they have a right to counsel  before they're interrogated by these people."  </P> <P> "It's a specious argument," Carter countered, noting that INS agents routinely  question suspected illegal aliens on the street and elsewhere without attorneys  present. Carter said his project requires the questioning of detainees of all  racial backgrounds and is fair because those being targeted have committed  "aggravated" felonies and may be dangerous.  </P></p>

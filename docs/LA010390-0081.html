			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST BLOC IN TRANSITION;  </P> <P> AGING WARRIORS SAVORING VICTORY;  </P> <P> ROMANIA: LONGTIME FOES OF COMMUNISM GET TOGETHER TO PUSH FOR NATIONAL UNITY.  ALL HAD BEEN IMPRISONED.  </P> <P> The old men had been waiting 40 years for vindication, and they met Tuesday for  the first time with an excitement that seemed to wipe away all the ills of old  age, all the rheumatism and high blood pressure and heart problems, in a moment  of triumph they could barely contain.  </P> <P> The Communists had been routed from Romania. Or at least the Communist, Nicolae  Ceausescu, had been routed, along with his top henchmen.  </P> <P> "We fought them from the first," said schoolteacher Ion Radu, who at 59 was  among the youngest of the 60 men who gathered in a cold and empty house in the  center of Bucharest.  </P> <P> Officially, they met as a section of the soon-to-be registered National  Peasants Party. But their real purpose was to establish themselves as an  organization of former political prisoners -- the first avowed enemies of  communism in Romania, and the first to suffer because of it.  </P> <P> Most of the men were in their 60s and 70s and had fought with Romanian  anti-Communist resistance and Partisan movements at the end of World War II.  They have vivid memories of encampments in the Carpathian Mountains, of  guerrilla warfare with the Communists who took over at that time.  </P> <P> Others were rounded up in the Stalinist terror that swept the newly Communist  nations of Eastern Europe after the war. Their prison terms ranged from five to  15 years, in the period of about 1946 to 1964, when most were released.  </P> <P> They returned to a Romania where communism was deeply entrenched, and they went  on with their lives, in bitter silence. But they did not forget their fight as  Romanian society, under the Ceausescu regime, grew steadily more oppressed.  </P> <P> And the mood Tuesday, as the old fighters met, bordered on euphoria, as they  quarreled energetically over such things as how best to proceed with the  election of officers, to press their case and, once again, to simply announce  their existence.  </P> <P> "We suffer from two diseases right now," Radu said. "First, we haven't talked  in so long that we cannot stop. And second, the longer a man talks, the more  convinced he is that he is right. You must have patience with us."  </P> <P> Strikingly, these old opponents of communism have found allies in the youngest  opponents of communism, the youth who probably paid most dearly in the  revolution that toppled the Ceausescu regime. Both sides see in the other a  similar combative dedication to the anti-Communist cause.  </P> <P> "At the end of the war, the Peasants Party won 80% of the vote," said Ion  Radoi, a 25-year-old youth leader. "But the Communists falsified the election  results, and many people were imprisoned after this. The common point is that  they suffered -- and so did we."  </P> <P> The links between the old and the young have parallels in Poland and Hungary,  where the youth find a closer kinship in political thinking with their  grandfathers than with their parents.  </P> <P> In Poland, the cult surrounding the memory of Gen. Jozef Pilsudski, who led an  independent Poland during the years between the world wars -- and was the only  Polish general to defeat the Soviets in battle -- has equal adherents among the  young and the elderly.  </P> <P> In Romania, anti-Communists were sent to work in labor camps on the Danube  River-Black Sea canal project; thousands of them are believed to have died. The  heads of both the Liberal and Peasants parties were convicted in show trials in  1947 and died in prison.  </P> <P> Among the most venerable members of the gathering in Bucharest on Tuesday was  Gregore Brancusi, 79, who said he is a nephew of the Romanian sculptor,  Constantin Brancusi, and who is famous as the leader of a resistance brigade  that fought the Communists until 1951. He spent 13 years in prison.  </P> <P> "We are not interested in revenge," Brancusi said. "We are interested in  national unity."  </P> <P> In careful handwriting in a small notebook, Brancusi has catalogued the  veterans' demands, which are to be presented to the new government. They go  back to the beginning:  </P> <P>  -- The 1946 elections should be declared illegal.  </P> <P>  -- A list of political prisoners who died in prison and labor camps should be  published.  </P> <P>  -- Proper military decorations should be issued to army members who refused to  join Communist forces.  </P> <P>  -- The names of political, scientific and cultural figures who died in prison  should be made public.  </P> <P>  -- Statistics on the number of people passing through prisons and labor camps  should be published.  </P> <P>  -- Heads of prisons and work colonies should be brought to justice.  </P> <P>  -- Personnel from prisons and work camps who tortured prisoners should be  named.  </P> <P>  -- Lawyers who were appointed to defend political prisoners and who failed to  present an adequate defense should be identified.  </P> <P>  -- Priests who informed on opposition activists should be expelled from the  Orthodox Church and their names should be published.  </P> <P>  -- Property taken from political prisoners and their families should be  restored.  </P> <P>  -- Pensions for secret police officers and top police officials should be  reviewed and possibly revoked.  </P> <P>  -- Romanians in exile should be invited back to contribute to the "moral  purification" of the country.  </P> <P> It is not likely, given the pressing demands of making a new government work  and, eventually, of administering elections and reordering a Communist economy,  that these demands will be a matter of high priority for the new government.  </P> <P> But for most of those gathered Tuesday, this program does not matter. It is  enough, as one of them said, to say that "we are still here."  </P> <P> "In 1948, they pulled out my fingernails," Alexandru Stoicescu said. "I was a  lawyer, and when I came out of prison, I made paper bags to sell on the street.  I lost my wife. I lost my child. But I am here. Today, I am here."  </P></p>

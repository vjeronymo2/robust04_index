			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / The Markets: Desperately seeking surprises - Global Investor Towards the world-weary resolution of The Age of Innocence, Edith Wharton's classic novel now playing as an award-winning film, the hero and his new bride set off to tour Europe. She buys a wardrobe of gowns in Paris, he picks up a set of suits in London, and they settle onto the boat heading back to the New World, content that they have picked the best - meaning the most predictable - of each country's wares. Any investors - American or otherwise - who follow that approach to the European equity markets at the moment will find value eluding them. The only survival game at present - and it is hardly an enjoyable one - is to dig hard for the few surprises in future earnings growth that remain. It is a peculiarly awkward point at which to try to squeeze money into the equity markets. Coming out of recession, companies should have several years of strong growth before threats of inflationary pressures and rising interest rates re-emerge. But investors have had months - about 18 months in the UK's case - to scour the markets for stocks which should perform well in those conditions. The main question now is whether all of that potential is already captured by share prices. Of all the European equity markets, Germany looks the most attractive by some way. Recent company announcements have delivered a handful of surprises already - shares have risen sharply as the figures emerge. The market's capacity for delivering unexpectedly good results should continue, at least for this year. Surveys show business confidence improving rapidly as exports pick up on the back of American and Asian demand. Last week five of the country's independent economic research institutes threw their considerable weight behind politicians' optimism about the economy, with a forecast that gross domestic product would grow by 1 per cent in western Germany in 1994 and by 7.5 per cent in the east. Broking houses, which had typically been sketching in no growth for this year, are upgrading earnings estimates. The threats to that picture are that the present weakness of the dollar against the deutschemark restricts exports, and that inflationary pressures could revive. Given the dependence of German companies on bank finance, the equity market has historically been even more sensitive to a rise in interest rates than other European markets. However, the recent low wage settlements have gone some way to addressing inflationary fears. They have also, as Mr Michael Hughes, currency analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd has been arguing, taken some of the strain off the currency. Exchange rates of DM1.85 to DM1.90 to the dollar by the autumn, which was widely predicted several months ago, now look unlikely. But a weakening towards DM1.75 in the next few months, compared with DM1.65 at the end of last week, still looks on the cards and should ease some of the market's remaining fears. After Germany, Sweden deserves to be the next stop. With more adventurous financial structures than their German rivals, and with profits more sensitive to export volumes, Swedish companies have tended to offer the attractions - and risks - of Germany, multiplied several times. The paper and pulp sector may have shown all the performance of which it is capable for some time, but industrial stocks should have further to rise. Beyond that, the pickings become much thinner. To rely on the constants that underpin the Italian market, such as a fair proportion of savings continuing to make their way into the market (at 18 per cent, the savings ratio is Europe's highest), is to allow nothing for disillusionment with the new government. In the UK's case, the rewards of chasing after growth stocks may now be so elusive that the opposite principles should apply. Investors may well find it worthwhile picking up countercyclical, high-yielding shares such as the financial sector instead. It is hard, with yields on long bonds still drifting up, to see the UK market doing more than tracking sideways, or perhaps edging forwards as dividend growth comes through. According to Mr Edmond Warner, head of strategy at Kleinwort Benson Securities, 'the UK market is condemned to a lengthy period of consolidation while returns to shareholders build'. The markets are now also settling firmly into a view of rising interest rates: three-month sterling contracts are now discounting 8 per cent interest rates in December 1995. It is becoming increasingly hard to believe that all the earnings growth which is assumed in current valuations will in fact appear. General manufacturing stocks, for example, are on a multiple of some 16 times estimates of 1995 earnings, compared with the All Share Index's rating of less than 13 times earnings. That is a large premium for a group of companies which trade at a discount to the market at the peak of the economic cycle. Against that background, the virtues of dividend growth offer considerable appeal. The financial sector, which has that attraction, offers no hiding place from the gloom of the bond markets, it must be said. The yield on the sector and on bonds have tracked each other closely (see chart). But the past few years suggest that the sector demands only stability in the bond markets, not recovery, to perform better. While it offers few surprises, it at least does not ask that investors pay top prices for earnings. BOILED IN OIL Enterprise Oil's bid for Lasmo apart, oil shares have seen aggressive buying in the past few weeks, driven by the strength of underlying oil prices. There is a case, though, that both shares and futures have gone far enough in the short run. After the Opec meeting at the end of March, which agreed to maintain output levels, Brent crude touched Dollars 12.70 but has now revived to Dollars 15.30. But views in the market on the direction from here are sharply divided. Those - like Mr Simon Flowers at Natwest Securities - who think oil could reach Dollars 18 to Dollars 19 a barrel within a year and rise further beyond then, are taking a bet that growth in demand will be enough to soak up the impact of future Iraqi supplies, for example. At current prices, British Petroleum and Shell Transport are valued on between 17 and 19 times 1994 earnings. Even looking several years out, prices seem to have caught up with events. THE SUPERHIGHWAY It does not take much exposure to the current cable enthusiasm to question the valuations being put on the 'superhighway', which will pipe every kind of communication service to our doors. Last week Telewest, the largest cable operator in Britain, confirmed plans for a global share offering this summer which could value the company at Pounds 1.7bn. That is based on the reckoning that cable's revenues from delivering telephony will outstrip revenues from television by the end of the decade. But investors might well ask whether cable is underplaying the risk that British Telecom will eventually be allowed to provide entertainment over its telephone lines, such as 'video-on-demand' - programmes dialled up from a video library. BT is barred from doing that until at least 2001 by the 1991 Duopoly Review, but that ban will be reviewed in 1998. If allowed to go ahead, BT would have little of cable's expense of digging up streets - its trunk lines are now fibre optic cable, capable of carrying television programmes. True, most BT connections to houses are still through copper wires, which deliver less good pictures, but recent trials have had some success. The outcome of the 1998 review is unpredictable: it will depend on the nature of the government in power and on any obligation it feels to protect the cable industry. But cable's vulnerability on this point emphasises that British media is hardly the brave new deregulated world that media barons sometimes portray. On the contrary: investment success in British media has always depended on getting judgments about future regulatory changes right. If the rules do change, the cable valuations now mooted will look unforgivingly high.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 28/4/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 % change over period                      US    Japan    Germany    France    Italy    UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Week               0.07    0.04      0.11      0.12      0.15    0.09 Month              0.31    0.21      0.48      0.53      0.70    0.44 Year               3.44    3.25      6.69      7.31     10.63    6.19  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Week              -0.36    0.21     -0.03      0.67      0.27    0.04 Month             -1.01    0.15     -0.14     0.031      0.94   -0.01 Year               0.42    6.74      6.86      8.17     19.46    5.94  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Week              -0.56    0.58      0.10      1.06      0.66   -0.39 Month             -1.26    1.02     -1.10     -0.73      1.45    0.10 Year              -0.16    9.30      6.10      8.67     26.77    7.11  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                0.0    -0.3       2.4       2.8       5.9     0.9 Month              -2.2    -0.7       4.1       0.5      15.2     0.4 Year                5.2     1.5      36.0      18.6      51.5    17.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              BEST PERFORMING STOCKS FROM FT-A WORLD INDICES                       IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO  28/4/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                % change                                      Close   Week   Month    Year  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Banesto (Spa)                        1,050   34.4    43.3   -53.2 Golden Plus (Mal)                    12.50   28.2    77.3     na Commerce Clearing                    19.00   20.6     7.0    12.6 Clorox (USA)                         50.13   20.0    11.4   167.2 Teledyne (USA)                       17.00   18.2    -2.2   -13.9 Plate Glass (RSA)                    135.0   17.4    22.7   223.4 Novell (USA)                         18.63   17.3    -4.5   -36.0 Lotus Dev.

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Advertising dregs One of the advertising industry's more boring buzzwords is 'globalisation', the notion that a product-promoting campaign can be extended across different cultures and countries. But like so much else in advertising it is a pretty absurd idea. Take the Nestle Gold Blend ads. For some four-and-a-half years, commercial television viewers in the UK have witnessed the development of a 'romantic' saga between a yuppie couple, whose lives appear full of angst and anomie except for the brief moments when they share a cup of Nestle Gold Blend instant coffee. Now the joyless duo have been transferred to the US, where they are continuing their assignation; but this time over a cup of Nestles Taster's Choice. Funny that they prefer a different coffee when in Britain, but never mind. Nobody is taking much notice, least of all McCann-Erickson, the ad agency behind the campaign. It is standing behind its own corporate advertisements which stress 'the branding on the ads is so strong, no-one ever mistakes them' for other brands of coffee.</p>

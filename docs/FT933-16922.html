			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Observer: Quick and the dead Slow-moving corteges could soon be a thing of the past if we're to put a literal interpretation on the words of one Alan Edwards, president-elect of the Funeral Standards Council. 'Some funeral directors are failing to keep pace with consumer expectations . . .,' he says. As part of its 'quest for excellence', the newly-formed undertaking is to appoint a funeral ombudsman. Since there hasn't been one to deal with matters of death before, the first incumbent will be advised by the body concerned with perhaps the nearest equivalent: the Insurance Ombudsman Bureau. Given the nature of the job, however, the council might do well to arrange for additional advice from the Society for Psychical Research. After all, to keep proper watch over the quality of services, the funeral ombudsman will need ways of hearing complaints from the principal consumers who, given modern methods of disposal, will in most cases have themselves been consumed.</p>

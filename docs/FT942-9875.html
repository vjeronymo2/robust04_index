			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Arts: Elgar's Rondo - Theatre Writing plays on the lives of great composers is a tempting but tricky business. David Pownall makes a habit of it. He has put the predicaments of Shostakovich, Prokofiev and Gesualdo on the boards, and devised both a stage and a radio play on the later life of Elgar. Both of these focus on why such a masterly and otherwise prolific composer should have completed only two symphonies. Haydn managed 104. It is a question genuinely worth pondering; but having seen Elgar's Rondo - an RSC transfer from the Stratford Swan to the Barbican Pit - I am not sure that Pownall is quite the man to ponder it. The very fact of Elgar's existence, his arising out of the musical nothingness that was 19th century England, is still startling. There is rich dramatic material in his social and artistic discomfiture as a lower-class Catholic who lost both faith and class, enduring the vapidities of the Philistines only to find himself reduced to frozen melancholy by the atrocities of world war; while the struggle with the symphonic ideal is a great emblematic 19th century theme. To have failed with his third attempt must have seemed failure indeed to Elgar: this is the subject of Pownall's radio play, Elgar's Third. Elgar's Rondo probes the period in his life between what he perceived as the public failure of his Symphony No 2 in 1911 and the beginnings of the Cello Concerto in 1918. The title refers to the second symphony's scherzo, whose pounding, dissonant climaxes apparently struck first audiences as bafflingly avant-garde. Elgar's friend and publisher AJ Jaeger ('Nimrod') returns from beyond the grave to urge him forwards in the stylistic direction of the Rondo, and to write another symphony; but Elgar wants to throw in the towel. The play depicts a battle for Elgar's soul between the depressed composer on the one hand, and Jaeger and a young Jesuit priest on the other. Meantime, his wife Alice is fading through terminal illness. There are theatrical surprises verging on the surreal - the characters first stream on in lurid fancy dress; a military band marches in and out; and a casual King George V with a couple of dead fish calls on the Elgars - but they are not perhaps surreal enough, just as the writing never sinks deeply enough into Elgar's mind to convince one that the character really is a great composer, not just Alec McCowen doing his fastidious pronunciation act. Though furnished by Pownall with an authentic stock of Elgarian puns and nursery talk, McCowen's Elgar is confusingly close to his impersonation of Elgar's contemporary, Kipling. Sheila Ballantine's Alice - giddy, snobbish, disaffected, weary and drawn - is a rather striking portrayal. John Carlisle's Jaeger, Ian Hughes's Father John and James Hayes's Bernard Shaw are sharply taken. But the only really moving moment in this production (by Di Trevis) was when a fragment of the gentle opening of Sospiri was allowed to play on the gramophone. At the Pit Theatre, Barbican</p>

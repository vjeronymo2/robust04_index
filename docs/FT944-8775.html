			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Sports Council forced to change managers One of the principal organisations set to receive funds from the National Lottery has been forced to carry out extensive management changes following a damning report into its operations by Whitehall's accountancy watchdog. The Sports Council, which is responsible for promoting sporting activity in the UK, has made the changes after a claim by the National Audit Office that senior executives were involved in business relationships that were incompatible with their official duties. The audit office said in a confidential memorandum last month that 'real conflicts of interest' had arisen in the Sports Council's relations with a company called Sportspartner, which acted as its trading arm and ran managerial contracts for national sports centres. The memorandum, sent to members of the Commons public accounts committee, reinforced a report earlier this year in which the organisation was criticised for poor administration of public funds. The Sports Council, whose parent body is the Department of National Heritage, said yesterday that urgent action had been taken to meet the NAO's criticisms following the appointment of a new chairman and vice-chairman. In particular, the conflicts of interest relating to Sportspartner were resolved last week, when it was decided that the company would be wound up by March next year. The council said that Mr Ian Johnson, the former director of finance, had stood down as director of the company in the meantime. The council said: 'We are confident that there are now no transactions occuring that the NAO could take exception to. All the people who were referred to in the initial NAO report have retired or resigned.' It is understood that the Sports Council has received a copy of the NAO's latest memorandum, but officials refused to discuss it yesterday. The organisation will be sending a memorandum to the public accounts committee detailing efforts to achieve transparency of financial flows and avoidance of conflicts of interest. A number of MPs said yesterday that the organisation, which expects to receive about Pounds 1.6bn from the National Lottery in the next five years, could be censured by the committee, which is due to publish its report early next year.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Waiting for the volume to increase: Shifts in technology in the consumer electronics industry could see European manufacturers gain advantage over their Japanese rivals Mr Jacques D'Elfant, senior managing director of Philips consumer electronics, last month gathered the staff of his newly estab-lished European marketing, sales and service organisation in a sprawling warehouse in Acht, Holland. Surrounded by stacks of audio equipment Mr D'Elfant delivered a stark message to his team on how the Dutch electronics group planned to regain the initiative in the European market from its Japanese competitors. 'We are not fighting against the Japanese but against Frenchmen, Germans and others who sell Japanese products,' he said. 'We know where we want to go so we can start on this right away.' A similar rallying call is being heard at other European consumer electronics manufacturers as they brace themselves for another joyless year in 1992. Manufacturers expect the European consumer electronics market to be flat in 1992, following a meagre 1 per cent growth in sales last year from Ecu25.2bn (Pounds 17.7bn) to Ecu25.4bn in 15 western European countries, according to BIS Strategic Decisions, the high-technology consult-ancy. Hopes that a recovery in leading European markets would lift demand for colour TVs and hi-fi sets, after a virtual standstill in 1991, have been replaced by a recognition that any pick-up in consumer activity this year will, at best, be slow. In the past few years, Europe's indigenous manufacturers have been battered in their own markets by the onslaught of Far Eastern competitors. Japanese manufacturers, in particular, have dominated important markets such as for VCRs, CD players and camcorders and have eaten into the European groups' market share of products, such as TVs, where the Europeans have traditionally dominated. Yet in spite of the gloomy near-term outlook, the European consumer electronics industry is optimistic. The growing feeling is that the industry is at a turning point which could work to the advantage of European manufacturers. While Japanese manufacturers are also suffering from the downturn in their own market, shifts in technology, such as from analogue to digital and the move to high-definition TV, could give European manufacturers a chance to regain the initiative over Japanese competitors, at least in their own markets. 'This kind of technology shift is always a major opportunity,' says Mr Jorma Ollila, president of Nokia, the Finnish electronics group. Wide-screen TV, and eventually high-definition TV, are seen to provide such an opportunity. By the year 2000, one market study suggests that half the retail value of colour TVs will be made up of wide-screen TVs. The attraction of wide-screen TV to European manufacturers is that it is a value-added product at the higher end of the market, offering larger profit margins. Europe's top three manufacturers have launched wide-screen TV sets, while Japanese manufacturers have yet to do so in Europe. Meanwhile, with digital music cassettes, Philips has stolen a lead over Sony (which has a competing format, MiniDisc) in its pre-launch publicity and in signing up record companies to produce music on its own format. In spite of recent setbacks, Europe's consumer electronics manufacturers have been sustained by a pride in their ability to maintain a leading role at least in the European market. 'Unlike the United States, Europe has never thrown in the towel in this segment,' Thomson Consumer Electronics, the French state-owned company, says in a report. Philips and Thomson are still first and second in Europe in revenue terms and the third and fourth largest consumer electronics groups in the world. Nokia is the second-largest manufacturer of mobile phones after Motorola of the US. In colour television sales, Philips and Thomson still top the European rankings followed by Grundig, the German group in which Philips has a large stake, and Nokia. Sony, the Japanese group, is fourth, according to BIS. European manufacturers also show greater confidence that they have identified their weaknesses and introduced changes to strengthen their position. As profits have suffered recently, European manufacturers have been putting their houses in order. Philips launched Project Centurion, its wide-ranging internal restructuring programme. Thomson took a restructuring provision of FFr1.5bn (Pounds 148.3m) last year. Nokia, which depends on consumer electronics for 33 per cent of sales, took a FM391m (Pounds 9.2m) provision largely to cover the costs of an efficiency boosting programme in its consumer electronics business this year. 'We are now in good shape, we have a very good product range, and are well placed to compete with other manufacturers,' says Philips. Although the industry practice of blaming difficulties on the Japanese has not entirely died out, there is a greater willingness to address its own weaknesses. For example, European manufacturers have been strengthening their distribution, marketing, sales and services in recognition that technology alone will not bring profits. In the short-term, the benefits of the manufacturers' restructuring will be substantial, particularly for Philips, says Mr Andrew Haskins, industry analyst at James Capel. Nokia, meanwhile, has forged ahead with its mobile phone activities and recently won large contracts to supply the US and Japanese markets. But in the long-term, a question mark remains over whether the Europeans will be able to sustain any improvements in profitability that may come from restructuring and a pick-up in demand. They have ploughed vast sums into new products and into shaping up for the recovery, which should bring at least short-term benefits, but the test for European manufacturers may merely have been postponed.</p>

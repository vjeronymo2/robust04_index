			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Italians ignore Andreotti's warning: The prime minister's party has experienced a serious setback DURING the election campaign, Mr Giulio Andreotti, Italy's outgoing Christian Democrat prime minister, was wont to caution the electorate against a protest vote with the advice: 'Too many doctors risk killing the patient.' Yesterday's early returns suggested the electorate had ignored his caution. The Christian Democrats have received their first serious electoral reverse since 1948 as voters switched allegiance to a wide arc of parties. Italy's 11th legislature thus looked certain to contain a greater fragmentation of political parties, all with differing prescriptions on how to cure the country's ills. Although the Christian Democrats will remain the largest party in parliament, their vote appeared to have fallen below the psychological barrier of 30 per cent. Prior to the elections, party officials said that any vote below 30 per cent would be an upset, aware that this would undermine the party's credibility and post-war political dominance. The vote is almost certain to reduce the influence of the party to orchestrate the formation of the next coalition and destroy hopes of retaining the outgoing four-party alliance with the Socialists, the Liberals (PLI) and the Social Democrats (PSDI) as a majority. In the outgoing parliament the latter alliance accounted for 53 per cent of the national vote and 49 per cent was considered the minimum necessary to form a government. The Christian Democrats lost ground to a protest vote, given heavily in the North to the populist Lombard League. But the vote also reinforced the standing of the small Republican Party, the Greens, the Radicals and the Sicily-based reform group, The Network (La Rete). The Christian Democrats failed to capitalise on the fall of communism. Indeed, the party seemed at a loss how to adapt its long-standing anti-communist stance. In contrast, the former communist vote held up well, split between the bulk who adhered to the new Party of the Democratic Left and the Reconstructed Communism hardliners. The party had relied upon its well-oiled party machine to drum up votes; only in the south was it effective. But even here the Republicans and more particularly La Rete made inroads, largely because of the Christian Democrats' links with organised crime. The party is now expected to be under strong pressure to forego some of its quota of power. Over the years the party has amassed a formidable netowrk of influence and patronage, well beyond its share of the vote. Rather than diminish as its vote slipped in general elections from the 1948 high of 48 per cent to a low of 32 per cent in 1983, this power tended to be consolidated. In the outgoing administration the Christian Democrats held 17 of the 32 ministerial portfolios and 38 of the 69 under-secretaryships. They held every key ministry save foreign affairs (in the hands of the Socialists) and kept a tight control over the security services. Their hold is even greater in provincial administration, with 17 of the 20 presidents of the regions being Christian Democrats. Outside pure politics, the Christian Democrats control their own trade union federation, the Usl, and their appointees dominate the state corporations including the state holding company, IRI, which accounts for 5 per cent of GDP. A weakening of the Christian Democrat vote implies not just a significant lessening of their ability to carve up the country distributing favours to the party faithful. It also raises questions about the leadership of the party which has failed to detect the changing mood of the nation. In particular it calls in question the future of Mr Andreotti, 73, who had hoped to move from the premiership to the presidency.</p>

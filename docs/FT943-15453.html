			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Peruvian growth rate of 11.8% beats predictions Peru has retained its position as Latin America's most dynamic economy in the first five months of this year, with growth rates that have outstripped expectations, including those of the government. The government said the economy grew by an annual rate of 11.8 per cent in the first five months of the year, compared with growth forecasts of 4 to 5 per cent for 1994 as a whole. The expansion is in most sectors, but has been marked in fishing, with catches a third higher than last year - when they were also good following a downturn in 1991 and 1992. Peru is the world's third largest fishing nation and the leader in fishmeal exports. This year, the industry expects to exceed 1993's 1.13m tonnes of fishmeal exports by some 20 per cent. Agricultural output also rose 16 per cent in the first five months of 1994, compared with a year earlier. There has also been a sharp recovery in Peru's construction sector. The government, with help from the Inter-American Development Bank and World Bank, is pouring money into long-neglected infrastructure, with road repairs and resurfacing boosting sales of cement and iron and giving jobs to thousands of unskilled workers. Peru's mining sector, meanwhile, responsible for almost half of all export earnings, has benefited from the recent rises in international minerals prices, especially copper. New gold deposits, now coming on stream, are also rapidly pushing up the overall value of minerals exports. The upturn is from a low base, however, following a 25 per cent fall in Peruvian GDP between 1988 and 1992. Even if this year's growth exceeds last year's 7 per cent rise, Peruvian per capita output will still barely match 1960 levels. However, for a government facing general elections in just 10 months, the strength of the recovery is a welcome bonus. President Alberto Fujimori said on Wednedsay growth for 1994 would 'exceed by far' the 4.5 per cent previously agreed with the IMF and would probably top 7 per cent.</p>

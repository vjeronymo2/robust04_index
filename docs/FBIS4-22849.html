E. Ankudinov, P. N. Fedorov; UDC </F> 621.396.67.01]    [Abstract]Ratios are examined between the power that is  dissipated and the power that is absorbed when a random  conducting antenna loaded with a matched load is irradiated from  opposite directions. It was shown that with a random aspect to  the radiation and polarization of the falling wave, the total  dissipated power is always more or equal to that absorbed when  the antenna is radiated from the opposite direction by a planar  electromagnetic wave with coinciding polarization and amplitude.  Moreover, depending on the nature of the load which ensures a  minimum effective scattering cross-section, antennas can be  classified into three categories. In addition, an example of an  antenna which provides identical reception from any two  directions is a thin rectilinear dipole antenna. Unlike a  rectilinear dipole, the majority of antennas have unsymmetrical  directivity patterns. 2 figures and 8 references.</p>

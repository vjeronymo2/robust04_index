			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Banks cover redemption of Ascii Swiss bonds ASCII, Japan's biggest independent software company, is being bailed out by a group of banks after diversification into films and other media left it struggling to repay borrowings. Six institutions led by the Industrial Bank of Japan are providing some Y12bn (Dollars 96.1m) to cover the redemption of Swiss franc convertible bonds due next March. Some funds have already been advanced, and the company said yesterday that the loan package should be tied up by the end of the week. It would not confirm reports that the deal provided an additional Y3bn in immediate operating funds. Ascii had Y1.23bn pre-tax profits in the year to March on sales of Y34.5bn. It has been hit by the Japanese economic slowdown this year, soon after expanding from its computer publishing and software base into film production and multi-media. IBJ is said to be considering a management presence at Ascii to help put the company back on course.</p>

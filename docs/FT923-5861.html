			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber production lower MALAYSIA'S RUBBER production in the first six months of this year fell to 568,803 tonnes from 569,495 tonnes in the same period last year, according to figures released by the Government. While smallholder production rose by 12,652 tonnes, or 3 per cent, over the six month period, production in the estate sector fell by 8 per cent, with many plantations choosing to move out of rubber cultivation into the more profitable palm oil. During the first half Malaysia exported 513,267 tonnes of rubber, a fall of 8 per cent from last year's figure. Total natural rubber stocks at the end of June were 162,996 tonnes, a 5 per cent rise on the May figure.</p>

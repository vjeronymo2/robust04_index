			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALZER ON WINE: TIME FOR WINE  </P> <P> WINE HAS ALWAYS BEEN a hard sell in the United States because it has not been  understood as a natural companion for food -- part of a healthful regimen. The  autumn harvest of 1990 arrived under threatening clouds of "sin tax" ballot  measures and federal legislation threatening the very existence of grape  growing and winemaking in the state. Yet, it is always time for wine.  </P> <P> "We've got to put the glass or bottle of wine on the table, right there with  the hamburgers, pizzas and tacos," says Sheldon (Hack) Wilson, owner /vintner  of Chimney Rock in the Napa Valley. "What we need," he says, "is a definition  that comes as easy as Coke's 'Pause that refreshes,' which tells the story  without any insinuating stuffy rigmarole."  </P> <P> There was a challenge. We left it with his suggestion: "It's always time for  wine . . . the civilized refreshment."  </P> <P> While I was in the Napa Valley, I also stopped at Monticello Cellars, where the  Napa Valley Vintners Assn. was having its annual Crush Celebration. Guest  harvesters from all over came to pick grapes and assist in the crush and  fermentation (while wearing rubber boots), alongside all the regulars. There  were tales to tell and good laughs.  </P> <P> One week later, I flew to Switzerland to observe the harvest in the Canton of  Vaud, which fronts Lac Leman of Geneva, home of the vine since Roman times. The  harvest was in full swing. As in the Napa Valley, laughter, songs and shouts of  merriment were everywhere.  </P> <P> Swiss wine growers promote the ubiquitous golden Chasselas grape as having a  very subtle flavor . . . and taking character from the different soils in which  it is grown. True. I tasted dozens of wines of Chasselas origins from the  separate appellations. None were the same. Some were earth-earthy, some had  subtle aromas, and others defied description. But all were delicate, with an  appetizing dryness.  </P> <P> In Switzerland, as in other parts of Europe, wine is part of the food regimen  and is consumed regularly.  </P> <P> Back in America, with Thanksgiving days away, it's almost redundant to say,  "It's time for wine!" But it is time, now, at Thanksgiving and whenever. "It's  always time for wine . . . the civilized refreshment." Robert Lawrence Balzer  </P></p>

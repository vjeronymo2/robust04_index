			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Transitional Executive Council's [TEC] decision  to retain detention without trial has been condemned by the  General Council of the Bar, which described it as wholly  unacceptable in a free society. Council Chairman (Vin  Trengrove) said in Johannesburg that any decision to retain  detention without trial would also fly in the face of the  constitutional principles recently endorsed by the multiparty  negotiating process and by the TEC itself. Mr. (Trengrove)  called on the TEC to reaffirm its commitment to the repeal of  Section 29 of the Internal Security Act, which provides for  detention without trial.</p>

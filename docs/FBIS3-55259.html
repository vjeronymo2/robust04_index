In his words, the experts found that numerous provisions of  the recently adopted constitutions of Tatarstan, Bashkortostan  and Tuva were inconsistent with Russia's Constitution. Twelve  other republics, he said, still have old constitutions which are  also inconsistent with the new Constitution of the Russian  Federation. In particular, by its constitution Mordovia is a  Soviet Socialist Republic.    Medvedev placed special emphasis on the fact that five newly  established republics, Adygey, Altai, Ingushetia,  Karachayevo-Cherkessia and Khakasia, do not have their own  constitutions. The presidential chief of staff emphasized that,  according to Article 72 of the Russian Constitution, the Russian  Federation and its constituent parts would establish general  principles of organizing systems of state authority and local  government bodies. In numerous republics elections to the  republican and local legislatures will be held shortly. In this  light, the constitutions of the republics must as soon as  possible be brought in line with the Fundamental Law of the  Russian Federation.</p>

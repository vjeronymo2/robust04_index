			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Arts: Salerooms pick up the pieces - Off the wall THE ROLL call of major contemporary art dealers shutting up shop in the face of the recession is assuming apocalyptic proportions. This week Nigel Greenwood, who championed artists as diverse as Glenn Baxter and Jeffrey Camp, joined Odette Gilbert, Kasmin, Fischer Fine Art, Nicola Jacobs and Anne Berthoud among the notable names who have abandoned their West End galleries. Apart from Gilbert, where the banks pulled the plug, the others were unprepared to struggle on with ever increasing rents and property charges and ever falling sales. Most have decided to deal privately from home. Even so, the contemporary art market in London faces the biggest crisis in its history. It was bound to happen. For a start there are very few collectors of contemporary art priced at over Pounds 50,000 and, apart from Charles Saatchi, they are virtually all foreign businessmen whose buying depends upon the profitability of their companies. At the moment they are just not interested. By the very nature of the art there can be no copper bottom reputations and taste changes rapidly. Then the success of dealers in forcing up prices in the 1980s, and their self deception that the spiral would continue, made re-stocking suddenly expensive; dealers are now stuck with pictures whose market value has almost halved. In contrast dealers in Old Masters and decorative art, with connoisseur clients and stock that has not risen so rapidly in price, are holding on. Their most splashy event, the Grosvenor House Fair, which ends today, has hardly set the bells ringing. On the other hand most dealers have sold something and turnover generally is on the level of a year ago. With many dealers reducing their prices daily, the old fashioned gentleman collector is realising he can afford to buy again and is re-appearing from out of the wood work. The top dealers desperately need a good Grosvenor House because it is the only time during the year that they can mount a collective challenge to the salerooms - and judging by the lacklustre auctions planned by Sotheby's and Christie's this June the dealers can reckon to have won the contest. It is ironic then that the adversity of the dealers is proving much needed relief for the auction houses, who often get the task of cashing in the assets when a dealer packs up shop. Sotheby's has disposed of unsold paintings for the Heim Gallery and this week offered silver and jewels, the old stock of Tessiers of Bond Street. On July 1 Sotheby's is selling over 70 Hockney prints once dealt in by Kasmin at prices up to 40 per cent lower than two years ago. Christie's has acted as undertaker for Sparks, the Chinese dealer, and for Odette Gilbert. With the market in such depression this is a strange time for Hugues Joffre to quit as expert in charge of contemporary art at Sotheby's. The most logical explanation is that he will join arch rivals Christie's. Such a move across Piccaddilly is almost unprecedented: neither firm wants to get dragged into the poaching game: it would enable top specialists to play one off against the other. But Joffre, whose knowledge of buyers and sellers has enabled Sotheby's to capture over 70 per cent of the contemporary business, may be just too tempting for Christie's. Keith Cooper is moving from director of PR at English National Opera to director of PR and marketing, at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. He replaces, after a gap of over a year, Ewan Balfour. With such mixed loyalties Cooper put on both his hats to dismiss the flier in The Times that David Mellor's Department of National Heritage was planning a brand new opera house on the South Bank to be ready by 2000 for the millennium celebrations and as a new home for a merged Covent Garden and ENO. With both houses about to launch multi-million pound rebuilding appeals such a rumour could devastate their fund raising campaigns. Hence a quick move to scotch such fanciful kite flying. The chairmen of the ROH and the ENO are considering a joint denial, and Mellor has let it be known that he has not yet given the matter a second's thought - although some major arts building to mark the next thousand years is a Government ambition. Merging the ENO and Covent Garden is, however, a favoured scheme of The Times editor, Simon Jenkins. Opera 80 was unhappy with its name. In the nineties it seems to be the last vestige of Thatcherite Britain. So it has changed it - to English Touring Opera, the kind of name that could have been around for years. As indeed it was - it was the original name for the company now known as City of Birmingham Touring Opera. English Touring Opera was the best that six months, and Pounds 10,000 of research, could come up with, winning out over more creative options like (hard to believe) Moving Opera and Aria. The feeling was that the potential customers of Opera 80 might not be able to pronounce Aria. At least English Touring Opera exactly describes the work of the company, which is subsidised by the Arts Council with Pounds 620,000, plus more from sponsors, on its visits to medium sized venues. English National Opera was not best pleased with the change: but it survived London Festival Ballet transforming into English National Ballet and it accepts that few of its customers will mistake small scale ETO for Coliseum based ENO. The Arts Council is doing its bit for the disabled, raising its budget for handicapped performers from Pounds 91,000 to Pounds 150,000 in a year and persuading a Duke (Westminster) and two Lords (Palumbo and Rix) to attend a Theatre and Disability Conference in Manchester next Friday. But it seemed to be carrying its commitment beyond the pale with a special grant of Pounds 25,000 to enable Bolton Octagon to put on Titus Andronicus employing disabled actors. The prospect of the armless or the tongueless coping with Shakespeare's most bloody play, packed with such amputations, was surely too much. It turns out that the play will use deaf actors.</p>

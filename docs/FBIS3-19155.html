			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis described the  latest UN Security Council resolution on the Cyprus issue--both  regarding the confidence-building measures [CBM's] and the more  general factors of the issue--as very satisfactory and  substantive.    In a statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation,  Mikhailidhis said the new resolution clearly says that an  agreement must be reached on the CBM's with no delay and that  the measures do not constitute either a substitute or an overall  Cyprus solution. They are measures that will open the way for a  substantive dialogue on a solution.    Mikhailidhis also noted that the resolution clearly mentions  that the current situation in Cyprus is unacceptable and that if  current efforts fail, the Security Council should study other  ways for implementing the several UN resolutions.    Referring to the draft document on UN ideas that was  submitted to the two sides in the form of informal documents,  Mikhailidhis said the Greek Cypriot side has asked for  clarifications and has taken neither a positive nor a negative  stance on the draft document. He added that from the meetings  held so far between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Gustave  Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special  representative in Cyprus, it seems it will not be possible to  hold meetings in New York at the end of March. The foreign  minister noted that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' recent  statements do not give positive messages.    The foreign minister announced that Hans van den Broek, the  European Union [EU] commissioner in charge of foreign political  affairs, will visit Cyprus on 24 March for talks on the Cyprus  issue and the Cyprus-EU relations.</p>

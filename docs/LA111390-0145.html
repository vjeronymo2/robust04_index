			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> 'VOICE OF GLASNOST' TO BE ENVOY  </P> <P> Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, the witty "voice of glasnost"  who gave the Soviet government a human face, has been rewarded with an  ambassadorship in a European country, Tass said today.  </P> <P> The Soviet news agency, citing "reliable Foreign Ministry sources," said Vitaly  Churkin, a close aide to Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, will replace  Gerasimov as the chief official contact for several hundred foreign reporters  based in Moscow.  </P> <P> Gerasimov was not immediately available for comment. An aide confirmed that he  will go to a European capital as a Soviet ambassador but said his exact  assignment was not known.  </P> <P> Gerasimov's droll sense of humor, sometimes acerbic tongue and stylish clothes  gave his briefings an air of entertainment as he and correspondents from around  the world matched wits in a give-and-take previously unknown in Moscow.  </P></p>

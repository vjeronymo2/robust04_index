			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Building society in property deal talks NATIONWIDE BUILDING Soc-iety is negotiating to take a controlling stake in Quality Street, the Glasgow-based company which develops and manages private rented housing, James Buxton writes. The transaction involves restructuring Nationwide's Pounds 160m lending to Quality Street, which showed a loss last year and whose balance sheet is in deficit, partly because of the fall in property values. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, said yesterday that the building society had decided to make Quality Street its vehicle for involvement in the private rented sector, ahead of expected government measures to encourage private renting. It would also put about 1,500 of its repossessed properties under Quality Street's management to be rented out. Quality Street was formed in 1988 by Mr Paul Mugnaioni, formerly Glasgow's director of housing. It now manages about 3,000 properties of which it owns about 2,000. Nationwide took 25 per cent of Quality Street's equity when it was formed and earmarked funds to finance its properties. In 1991 it sold its stake to Mr Mugnaioni and another director but continued to lend to it.</p>

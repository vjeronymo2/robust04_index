			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Crime beat is played softly-softly - The Issues, Law And Order THE PICTURE of policing Oxford painted by television's Inspector Morse is not one that acting chief superintendent Ralph Perry, the Oxford area commander, recognises. 'There are more murders in the average episode of Morse, than Oxford has in two years,' he says. If Morse existed, Mr Perry could find more than enough to keep him busy. Last year recorded crime in the city increased by 34 per cent compared with 16 per cent nationally. In three years crime in Oxford has doubled. Beyond the dreaming spires the city has very real problems of vagrancy, homelessness, drink and drugs. It also has a disproportionately high level of auto crime, connected partly with the theft and racing of cars on the city's outlying estates of Barton, Rose Hill and Blackbird Leys. With Mr John Patten, the home office minister, defending Oxford West and the continued media attention on the problems at Blackbird Leys, law and order ought to be a main talking point in Oxford during the campaign. Yet, as appears to be the case nationally, in spite of record levels of crime everywhere, the law and order debate has been little more than a sideshow. Mr Patten says that not one person has raised the issue with him on the doorstep in this campaign. Crime was only an issue recently at the height of the 'joyriding' at Blackbird Leys last summer. Sir William Goodhart QC, the Liberal Democrat challenger in Oxford West, says it is clear why the Tories have not raised the issue: 'It no longer works to their advantage.' The rise in recorded crime shows the Tories' claim to be the natural party of law and order is 'wearing a little thin', he adds. If that explains the Tories' desire to keep what little debate there is firmly focused on its plans rather than its record, it does not account for Labour's apparent reluctance to raise the subject. However Mr Andrew Smith, who is defending Oxford East for Labour and lives on Blackbird Leys, says law and order has been specifically raised with him by a significant number of people. Residents on Oxford's estates are fed up with the continuing nuisance of 'theft and racing of cars' - he refuses to call it joyriding. There seems very little to choose between the main parties' policies. All three give a commitment to reform of the criminal justice system after recent miscarriages of justice - an issue nobody has raised with any of the candidates. All three parties also talk about the need to focus on crime prevention rather than cure and the need to concentrate efforts on the young in particular. Mr Patten says: 'Crime prevention starts with the young. This is the message for the nineties.' The Tories are planning a national task force 'to co-ordinate action against criminal behaviour among children in the family and at school'. The Liberal Democrats talk about the need to keep young people aged 16 to 18 active by building up local youth facilities. Sir William says stealing and racing cars is 'a symptom of young people with too much time on their hands'. Mr Smith says: 'There is a real problem in Britain today with rootless people who feel they have little to lose by breaking the law.' All three parties also speak of the need for more community-based policing, and give a manifesto commitment to increase police numbers. All of which is good news for Mr Perry. The Thames Valley force has one of the lowest police-to-people ratios in the country. Mr Perry is expected to deal with the huge increase in crime with 250 officers - roughly the same as Oxford had in 1968. He says: 'With an extra 30 or 40 officers we could do an awful lot to meet the public's expectations.' He would love to work towards some concept of regular policing of the community, but a recent increase in the number of beat officers by 12 is as far as he can go with present resources. He is particularly concerned about the socio-economic aspects of crime. Youths hanging around with nothing better to do contributed to the problems on the city's estates last summer, but he is aware that that is not the complete explanation. Many of those involved, particularly on Blackbird Leys, were not economically deprived. Mr Perry says: 'There is no way you can compare an estate such as Meadow Well (the Newcastle estate where trouble also flared last summer) with conditions on Blackbird Leys. Facilities on Blackbird Leys are second to none - swimming pool, sports centre, BMX track, nice schools, speedway stadium, Greyhound racing stadium, youth clubs - you name it, it's there.'</p>

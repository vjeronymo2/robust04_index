The tax rate for gasoline, diesel oil and kerosene will rise  to 190 percent, 25 percent and 13 percent, respectively, from  the current 150 percent, 20 percent and 10 percent, the Ministry  of Finance announced following a meeting of economic vice  ministers yesterday.    The tax rate hike will offset a reduction in oil prices  which  was announced by the government, which will link domestic oil  prices to international prices.    The Trade-Industry-Energy Ministry said last week that  consumers can enjoy a reduction in oil prices by 4-5 percent  from February 15.    International oil prices fell to 12.85 dollars per barrel in  January this year from 15.81 dollars per barrel last year.    As international oil prices fall, the government estimates  that its "transportation tax," which was introduced this year to  finance the modernization and expansion of social overhead  capital (SOC) projects, will be down by more than 600 billion  won this year from the original target.    The government set the tax base at 15.81 dollars per barrel  for a collection of 3.2 trillion won in transportation tax this  year, out of which 2.6 trillion won will come from the tax on  gasoline.    But as international oil prices fell, the tax base also  fell.  Thus, the MOF said the government decided to raise the tax rate  on the three key oil prices. The end result is that drivers  must buy gasoline at the current price of around 610 won per  litter even after the government links the domestic oil retail  price to international fluctuations from the middle of this  month.    The government has been under fire for "arbitrarily" raising  tax rates or implementing a new tax without full debate at the  National Assembly or through public hearings.    Last month, it announced plans to collect 1.5 trillion won  each year for the next 10 years to finance the rural sector, at  the instruction of President Kim Yong-sam.    The government also suddenly announced yesterday that it  will  raise the special excise tax rates on major oil products.</p>

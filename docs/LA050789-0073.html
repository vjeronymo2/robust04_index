He died of his injuries.  </P> <P> While his mother was holding him, a thief crept into her home and took her  purse, which held $33, Garrod said.  </P> <P> "Whoever did this must be evil," she said. "They knew the child was badly  injured, and Teresa was so distressed. It's enough to turn anybody's guts."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Marketa Fialkova, Czech ambassador to </F> Poland, by Barbara Sulek; date and place not given: "We Do Not  Insist on Being First in NATO"]    [Excerpts] [Sulek] You must be giving a lot of interviews  in connection with the new situation that has arisen following  the adoption of the Partnership for Peace [PFP] initiative.    [Fialkova] Not at all. This is the first.    [Sulek] Everyone wants to know if the Czech Republic really  wants to join Europe, NATO, and the EU alone.    [Fialkova] It lies in our interests that the Czech Republic,  Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary belong to the same security group.    [Sulek] But as far as PFP and NATO are concerned, the Czechs  have definitely gone further than the others.    [Fialkova] The PFP declaration clearly states that all the  countries will be assessed individually. It calls for the  admission to NATO of each country individually, not as a group.    [Sulek] Prime Minister Klaus has himself said that he would  like the Czech Republic to join Europe without Visegrad.    [Fialkova] I do not think Prime Minister Klaus has firmly  rejected Visegrad cooperation, but what he wants is genuine  cooperation, not just gestures and meetings. He is in favor of  cooperation, but at an appropriate level. He does not insist on  a total coordination of Visegrad activity.    [Sulek] But without this coordination, the Visegrad  countries  appear at odds with each other and incapable of joint, steady  action. Perhaps a strong and cohesive Visegrad group does not  lie in the interests of the United States and Russia?    [Fialkova] President Clinton made it clear that everyone is  concerned about good practical regional cooperation, and that is  what we want as well. A major feature of this cooperation is  CEFTA [Central European Free Trade Agreement]. The Czech  Parliament has already ratified this agreement, but the Polish  Parliament was prevented from doing so by the parliamentary  elections. CEFTA offers a very good scope of cooperation.  Prime Minister Klaus wants this cooperation to start as soon as  possible, so that a complete liberalization of trade may occur.  Our trade with Poland has slumped in recent years, which is a  great pity.    [Sulek] How do you explain that?    [Fialkova] It is largely due to Poland's protectionist  policy  and an absence of credit mechanisms to encourage trade. A major  obstacle is the high Polish customs tariffs on our products,  including cars. It lies in our interests that these tariffs  disappear in regional cooperation. A prosperous Poland lies in  our interests for it is good to have a rich neighbor with whom  one can conduct trade at a profit. It also lies in our  interests for the entire Visegrad group to belong to one single  security system. We do not insist that we join NATO first. If  Poland joins NATO first, we will be very happy about it. Our  vice minister for national defense said at the defense  ministers' summit that in such a case, we will be second, and we  will use Poland's experience.    [Sulek] Do you not consider it possible that the Visegrad  group might split up and some countries might join NATO and  others not?    [Fialkova] We Czechs really do not want to split up the  Visegrad group.    [Sulek] I am not saying the Czechs would do it.    [Fialkova] Well, anything is possible in politics. However  such an eventuality is unlikely, because it takes two sides to  do that. Even if someone on the outside wanted to stop our  trade, he would not be able to do so because we are neighbors,  and between neighbors there are natural economic, cultural, and  political relations. And how can one stop trade? One cannot,  if we ourselves do not want to stop it.    [Sulek] The Czech Republic is the only former communist  country (not counting the GDR) to have clearly dissociated  itself from its former structures, hierarchy, and influence. Do  you think this had a bearing on your NATO talks and on the  different treatment accorded to your country?    [Fialkova] There is no indication that NATO has treated us  differently, and no one has said anything to this effect.  [passage omitted]    [Sulek] You have been ambassador in Poland since April 1990.  Has the Polish-Czech friendship established during the  Solidarity era survived, and do you still have your old  acquaintances?    [Fialkova] Yes. I have not quarreled with any of my old  friends, and I am pleased to say that Polish-Czech relations  have never been better. The Poles are liked by the Czechs and  by the Slovaks, which is fantastic. I would be very happy if I  could contribute something to that friendship.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Chrysler results help sustain Dow at record Wall Street US stocks were little changed in largely featureless trading yesterday, but with the market gaining support from stable bond prices and some better than expected fourth-quarter results, writes Martin Dickson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended unchanged at 3,870.29, although maintaining Monday's record close. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged up 0.95 to 474.25 and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.84 at 793.02. NYSE volume was fairly heavy at 309.7m shares and advances outscored falls by 1,198 to 892. Apart from a dip at the opening, the Dow spent the day in positive territory, at one time gaining nearly 10 points, but gave up the advance towards the close. Sentiment was helped in the morning by stronger than expected results from Chrysler, the car manufacturer, which reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of Dollars 2.11, compared to forecasts of around Dollars 1.60. Chrysler closed Dollars  3/4 higher at Dollars 62 1/2 and the figures buoyed the rest of the automobile sector, General Motors adding Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 62 1/8 and Ford Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 68 5/8 . A large number of money centre and super-regional banks also reported yesterday, and their figures were generally ahead of expectation and showed a strong improvement in asset quality. However, share prices mostly dipped on profit-taking. Wells Fargo lost Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 133 3/4 , Nationsbank Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 49 1/4 , Chemical Banking Dollars 1 at Dollars 40 1/2 and Citicorp Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 40 7/8 , but Chase Manhattan firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 35 3/4 . Trading was also enlivened by a revised takeover bid for Paramount Communications from Viacom, which slightly raised the cash it is offering for 50.1 per cent of the company and also improved features of the securities it is offering for the remaining 49.9 per cent. Analysts said the new terms appeared to make its bid competitive with the higher offer on the table from QVC Network and was likely to keep the takeover battle alive until the February 1 date set by Paramount for final offers. Viacom's non-voting 'B' shares, which form the major part of its package of securities, fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 37 3/4 , while QVC dipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 43. Paramount rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 80. Blockbuster Entertainment, which has agreed to be acquired by Viacom as part of the Paramount bid, held at Dollars 28. Drugs group Eli Lilly advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 61 5/8 after announcing plans to divest its medical device and diagnostics businesses and take Dollars 1.2bn of restructuring and other charges in the fourth quarter. Controls group Honeywell shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings of 85 cents a share, up from 79 cents, while Grumman, the defence group, rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 42 5/8 on announcing plans to cut operating costs by nearly Dollars 600m over the next three years. Canada Toronto rose afresh to set another record high. The TSE 300 index ended 17.7 up at 4,561.9 as rises led declines by 444 to 369 after volume of 73.5m shares. Financial services remained strong, adding 1.14 per cent at 3,553.1.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / BMA votes out moderate leader DR JEREMY Lee-Potter, the moderate leader of the British Medical Association who re-established relationships with the government after confrontation over the National Health Service reforms, yesterday lost his post as chairman of the BMA council. He fell to a challenge to his leadership by 36 votes to 17 at a council meeting at the end of the BMA conference in Torquay. His successor is Dr Alexander Macara, 61, a Bristol University consultant lecturer in public health medicine and former chairman of the BMA medical ethics committee. Dr Lee-Potter became chairman three years ago at a time of open hostility between the BMA and government. He accepted the reality of health reforms and returned the association to dialogue with the government. His conciliatory stance never found favour with sections of the BMA. As the conference made clear, many doctors continue to believe that government reforms are undermining the principles of the NHS and aggravating funding problems. Dr Macara, who wants an early meeting with health secretary Mrs Virginia Bottomley, denied he would be more confrontational but added there would be a change of style. He said: 'I fear that the secretary of state gets false reassurances from her courtiers who tell her what she wants to hear. We have to have consistent and vigorous proposals to persuade her to re-examine the evidence for change.'</p>

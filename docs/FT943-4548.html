			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / New Sharp microwave smells success in the kitchen Sharp, the Japanese electronics group, is to install an electronic nose into microwave ovens manufactured at its plant in Wrexham in north Wales. Smell sensors in the oven will feed information into a neural network programmed to recognise the characteristics of different foods when they are cooked. Neural networks are computers, inspired by models of the brain, that can be built to recognise complex patterns. Sharp is refusing to discuss its new product before its official announcement on Monday, but journalists who have a smell of the story expect to be told that it will mean the end of the over-cooked and dried up food that inexperienced cooks find all too easy to produce with current microwaves. The advantage of using a neural network is that cooking is a complex process and it is difficult to decide when it is complete. Even the same kind of food needs different amounts of cooking depending on its size and shape. For example thick steaks need to be cooked for longer than thin steaks. Several different types of information - on temperature, colour and smell - are needed to know that cooking is done, and of course different cooks have different views on what constitutes rare, medium or well-done. The neural network will be programmed in the factory, so the microwave will arrive in the home already knowing how Sharp thinks food should be cooked. It is not known whether it will be adjustable for vegetables al dente. Sharp's plant in Wrexham, which opened in 1975, manufactures microwaves, VCRs, typewriters, and word processors. It employs 1,300 people, and production in the last financial period was valued at Pounds 120m according to Mr Mike Williams, director of personnel and general affairs. Sharp had been planning a press conference in Wrexham on Monday to announce the new microwave, with the company's president, Mr Haruo Tsuji, flying in from Japan to make the announcement. A government minister was also thought to be scheduled to attend. But information about the new product leaked out at the British Association festival of science in Loughborough yesterday, at a meeting to discuss applications of neural networks. Asked about the announcement, Ms Caroline Barratt, head of public relations for Sharp UK said: 'As far as Sharp is concerned we have a press conference on Monday.'

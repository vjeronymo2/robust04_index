Negotiators for the three parties emerged after little more than  an hour of talks, saying there had been no movement on key  constitutional and electoral issues.    The breakdown could mean a boycott of the April poll by the  Freedom Alliance's major component, the Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP], as well as the Afrikaner rightwing.    Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said the  election would in all likelihood be promulgated on Wednesday,  allowing two days for the resolution of differences.  Negotiators, however, felt this was unlikely and a general mood  of despondency characterised the talks breakdown.    Monday night's meeting came up against two issues which the  ANC said were non-negotiable. These were the single ballot  system for the April election and complete autonomy for regional  constitutions. The ANC's National Executive Committee is due to  meet on Tuesday to discuss a package put to the meeting by the  alliance.    IFP Central Committee member Walter Felgate said there was  little chance of a breakthrough. He said ANC Secretary General  Cyril Ramaphosa had said during the meeting that he thought  there was a slim chance of changes leading to a multi-party  settlement.    Mr Felgate said the FA would await the ANC's response to its  package.    Mr Meyer said the election would go ahead without those  parties who wanted to boycott it. He said government was  satisfied it had moved sufficiently over the last 10 days. "The  ANC and the Freedom Alliance can't find each other. Unless they  change their positions in the next 48 hours, there's not going  to be much progress on the way forward."    He said government believed the issues could still be  resolved. Mr Meyer added government was satisfied with the  constitution and satisfied it had met the demands of the  alliance. For this reason, the election could go ahead, he said.    Mr Meyer noted it was important all parties participate in  the election with a view to gaining support for their ideas.  "There is no way they can play a role if they do not take part  in the election."    Monday night's talks took place after a weekend in which  both  the IFP and the Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National  Front] militantly rejected participation in elections. The  Monday night meeting was considered a final attempt to reach  agreement after three previous meetings the week before had  failed to bring the parties closer.</p>

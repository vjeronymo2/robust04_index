			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 15 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces  have withdrawn from all weapons collection points which they had  surrounded in the heavy arms exclusion zone around Sarajevo, a  UN Protection Force spokesman said Friday [15 April].    But UN troops had still not been allowed to go free,  UNPROFOR's Captain Eric Chaperon said, adding that there was  still no news of Canadian and French UN troops still being held.    Chaperon said tension had lowered in the area, where Bosnian  Serb forces have harassed UN forces in recent days since NATO  air strikes against the Moslem enclave of Gorazde.    On Thursday the Serb forces tried to seize heavy weapons  grouped under UNPROFOR control following a February 9 ultimatum  for them to withdraw from the exclusion zone around Sarajevo.    Chaperon said Friday that reports indicated there was a  "relaxed atmosphere" at weapons collection sites after the  Bosnian Serb withdrawal. He said UN forces were no longer on  full alert.    The Bosnian Serbs, angry at the NATO strikes on Gorazde, had  been threatening a French battalion at Krivoglavci, to the  northwest of the Bosnian capital, with a tank.    The report came as UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi and  mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg held face-to-face talks with  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at his Pale headquarters.    The talks, the first since the crisis sparked by the Gorazde  strikes, were reportedly aimed at discussing a cease-fire.</p>

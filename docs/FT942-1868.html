			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Britain's labour laws Labour law could be on the point of re-emerging as a central issue in British political debate. The immediate images of a rail strike, flickers of militancy in pay bargaining, and the sight of Labour leadership candidates jousting over how much of Conservative trade union legislation to abolish, suggest that such a re-emergence may not be on terms that British business would welcome. Most business leaders, after all, like most Conservative politicians, are happy enough with the current regulatory mix. Strikes remain rare, unemployment is falling, why tamper with the system? This is unlikely to be a sustainable approach. A Labour party led by Tony Blair is almost certainly electable, and if elected it will owe a big debt to the trade unions. In any case, labour market changes have raised new questions about the appropriate balance between employee rights and employer flexibility. Moreover, Britain's system of labour law is becoming over-complex. It combines traditional contract law, in which collective trade union rights are expressed as immunities, with both domestic and European positive rights legislation. Rationalisation of this hybrid is required. The subject is best sub-divided into the issue of individual employment rights and the overlapping issue of the framework within which unions should operate. Contrary to much rhetoric, union decline has not left employees unprotected before the whims of bad employers. The last two decades have seen a mushrooming of workplace rights, from protection against unfair dismissal to all the fields now covered by Brussels directives. It is true, however, that thanks to the complexity of the law and the slow operation of the industrial tribunal system, many employees feel less protected than they should, while many businesses complain of an excessive regulatory burden. Employee rights One answer, which could appeal to either a Conservative or Labour administration, is to make greater use of the formal contract of employment. Written into that contract could be a Citizen's Charter for the workplace, outlining employee rights. Such a clarification of rights (and obligations) could reduce uncertainty for both employers and employees, especially in smaller companies. It might be supplemented by a code of practice, drawn up the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress, on those matters not covered by the law. Union role Where do unions fit into this? Many union officials say, with justice, that individual rights are most meaningful when unions enforce them. That might make a case for a right to union representation. But a full-blooded right to bargain collectively is more problematic. A law to this effect did not work effectively in the late 1970's - remember Grunwick? - and many companies which have effective communication and participation without unions might find themselves hussled into unsuitable arrangements. Similarly, although contract law means that the right to strike has to be expressed, anachronistically, in terms of immunity from damages, a positive right to strike might - in a British context - shift the balance too far in favour of strikers. Most continental European countries do have a positive right to strike, or not to be dismissed while on strike, but these derive from far more legalistic systems where unions often have to jump through many more legal hoops than in Britain. A Blair-led government would probably only tinker with Conservative union legislation. It might also steal a march on the Conservatives by making available to all employees the rights to consultation, in fields such as health and safety, which still remain linked to union recognition. But Labour is currently also commited to a right to bargain collectively and a right to strike. Even more worrying from the point of view of job creation and effective management is the party's pledge to abolish the probationary employment period by insisting on full protection from unfair dismissal from the first day of employment. Mr Blair himself is no doubt aware of the dangers of hefty re-regulation of the labour market for a party committed to rapid job creation. But whatever the colour of the government, there will be a need for continued modernisation of Britain's labour laws.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian government will make a list of  potentially bankrupt factories, Russian President Boris Yeltsin  said Monday when he met with the managers of the Kama automobile  factory KamAZ in Naberezhnye Chelny during his tour of  Tatarstan. Yeltsin explained that the list would include  factories which could not be run profitably on their own and  that it would be updated monthly.    He said that the decrees on tighter finances and production  that he had signed earlier would be supplemented with four new  decrees of the same kind.    He emphasized that the Russian economy, notably its  manufacturing industries, needed faster restructuring. Because  this was proceeding slowly, the payment crisis was getting  worse, he said.    He promised that the state would help KamAz which was  recovering from a fire. Foreign investments would be attracted  to it and credits would be made available. Yeltsin said that  KamAz was exempt from profit and value-added taxes until the end  of the year.</p>

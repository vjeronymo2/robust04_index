			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Vans take shine off motor figures MOTOR INDUSTRY euphoria over last month's unexpectedly strong 17.76 per cent rise in new car registrations is about to be partly damped by statistics showing that key sectors of the commercial vehicles market remain unable to shrug off recession. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders will this week publish figures showing that total commercial vehicle registrations in August were 2 per cent down on even the very depressed levels of the same month last year. August, as with the car market, is by far the largest sales month for commercial vehicles. The problem is concentrated in the light and medium van market. Industry analysts believe it indicates that the small companies and tradesmen who are their main buyers want evidence that economic recovery can be sustained before they are prepared to commit themselves to purchases. August's sales of small vans, mainly based on cars such as the Vauxhall Astra, were 6.66 per cent lower than the same month last year, and those of panel vans, typified by Ford's Transit, were 5 per cent lower. For the first eight months of the year the light van market was down 8.18 per cent at 41,000 and the panel van sector down just over 5 per cent at about 60,700. The heavy truck market has started to match the recovery trend in the cars sector, as long-distance hauliers and other operators continue the overdue replacement of fleets. The 4,950 trucks over 3.5 tonnes sold in August represented a 20 per cent rise from last year, slightly outperforming August's new car market. Carmakers continued to express delight at the weekend over August's strong sales performance. However, Mr Geoffrey Whalen, president of the SMMT and chief executive of Peugeot Talbot, said that this year's forecast total of 1.75m, although well up on 1992's 1.6m, was still far below the 2.3m of 1989. By far the biggest winners in the August car figures were the Japanese and French industries. Japanese cars took more than 13 per cent of the market for the first time, although the figures include production from UK car plants. Citroen and Renault each saw sales increases of about a third.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          UK CAR REGISTRATIONS

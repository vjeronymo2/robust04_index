			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / International Company News: Endesa book-building begins Book-building for the global share offer in Endesa, the big Spanish electrical utility, has officially begun and subscriptions for the domestic retail tranche of the shares open on Wednesday. The offer is being made by Endesa's chief shareholder Grupo Teneo, which is part of INI, the public-sector corporation. It will reduce its holding from 75 per cent to 65 per cent. When Teneo announced the issue in February, it confidently expected it to bring in around Pta200bn (Dollars 1.45bn). At current prices the offering, which will be managed by Goldman Sachs and by Argentaria, the state-controlled domestic bank, is unlikely to raise more than Pta170bn. In February, Endesa shares were trading on the Madrid stock market at Pta7,350. On Friday they closed at Pta6,500: their January high was Pta7,900. The expected reduction in sale proceeds will deal a severe blow to Spain's cash-strapped public sector. Endesa is by far the most important profit earner among state-controlled companies. The proceeds shortfall of some Pta30bn at current prices is equivalent to around half the losses posted last year by Iberia, the state airline and the biggest loss-maker in the Teneo group. Mr Luis Saenz, Teneo's financial director, said funds raised from the Endesa offering would go towards consolidating the rest of the industrial group. Losses at Iberia were chiefly responsible for dragging down Teneo's profits from Pta21bn to Pta3bn last year. Losses at INI, Teneo's parent, totalled Pta125bn last year.</p>

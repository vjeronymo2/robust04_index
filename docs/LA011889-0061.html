			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> At least 51 people, including 35 schoolgirls, were killed when a train slammed  into a crowded bus in southern Sri Lanka. About 72 bus passengers were injured  in the accident at an unprotected level crossing at Ahungalle, 60 miles south  of Colombo, the capital. No one on the train was hurt. The state-owned bus was  carrying students from four local schools who were returning home from a visit  to a clinic. The train, traveling about 50 m.p.h., crushed the bus and broke it  in two, dragging part of it 250 yards.  </P></p>

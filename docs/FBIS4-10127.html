			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva -- Everything is ready for a big party. But  now, after six years of negotiations, a black cloud is hanging  over the closure ceremony that will be held in Marrakech on 12  April for the most ambitious round of negotiations for the  deregulation of world trade: the Uruguay Round of GATT talks.  The United States does not want countries where workers are  exploited to obtain easy access and trade advantages for their  products in international trade. The United States demands that  the World Trade Organization that will be officially created  during the Marrakech meeting study the subject.    But Brazil and all the poor countries that already are  feeling like possible victims of trade retaliations refuse to  discuss the problem. Brazilian Ambassador to GATT Felipe  Lampreia protested the idea at the Uruguay Round Negotiating  Committee.    "Labor issues must not be discussed by a trade organization  but by the International Labor Organization," said Graca Lima,  one of the Brazilian negotiators.    According to Lima, the U.S. proposal is premature and may  open the door to a new form of trade barrier against products  from developing countries.</p>

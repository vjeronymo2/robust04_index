On the contrary, he said Tuesday [22 March] in an  interview with foreign journalists in Simferopol, this will help  transfer relations into a definite channel.    Meshkov said that due to irrational economic policies of  Kiev's leadership our Crimean home is razed to the ground. Our  task is to build it up and we ask Ukraine not to interfere, he  said. Meshkov intends to build the Crimean "home" by restoring  normal economic relations with Russia and establishing mutually  advantageous relations with Ukraine and other CIS and foreign  countries.    Dual citizenship, said Meshkov, is the bleeding wound that  causes most people in the Crimea to suffer. He believes the  problem is caused by the abnormal conditions of the Soviet  Union's disintegration, the disruption of traditional ties and  largely bears a moral-political rather than legal character.    The Crimean Republic having its own citizenship, with people  also being allowed to hold a second Ukraine or Russian  citizenship will lessen the suffering of Crimeans, believes  Meshkov. The problem of citizenship, he said, is also the  problem of statehood. That is why it should be solved  immediately.    I do not have negative feelings for the President of Ukraine  (Leonid Kravchuk--"IF"), said Meshkov. I believe he does not  feel negatively about me. It is a matter of the incompatibility  of nationalist sentiments within the Ukrainian leadership and  the Crimean's aspirations as a consequence of the collapse of  the economy, said Meshkov.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin report: "Is June </F> the `Key' Month?"]    [Text] Zagreb, 1 Jun -- Moscow believes that June should  be a "key" month in the attainment of a Bosnian peace settlement  and possibly in resolving the whole set of problems in the  Yugoslav crisis, Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's  special representative, said Tuesday [31 May] in Zagreb during  an exclusive interview with your ITAR-TASS correspondent.    Speaking about holding a special summit meeting on the  Bosnian settlement, V. Churkin noted that "if this summit has  not been held by mid-June, say, more attention will probably be  paid to Yugoslav affairs during the G-7 meeting in Naples, which  will a G-8 meeting for the first time, with Russia's full  participation in the discussion of political problems."    Commenting on the content of today's talks in Belgrade with  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and also with Serbian  leaders from Bosnia and Krajina, the Russian deputy foreign  minister noted that priority during these talks was given to two  issues -- the situation in Bosnia, with the emphasis on  attaining an agreement on the cessation of hostilities; and the  preparations for the next Geneva meeting, as well as for the  resumption of talks between Zagreb and Knin.    The Russian president's special representative plans to meet  with Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidium, and Bosnian Premier Haris Silajdzic in Sarajevo.    Tuesday evening V. Churkin was received in Zagreb by  Croatian  President Franjo Tudjman. "We had a very good discussion during  which Franjo Tudjman once again reaffirmed his high opinion of  Russia's role in the Yugoslav settlement and Croatia's interest  in continuing dialogue not only with Knin but also with Belgrade  and in the overall normalization of bilateral relations, which  play a key role in the complex of problems involved in the  Yugoslav crisis," the Russian diplomat said.</p>

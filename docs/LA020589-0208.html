			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NO. 1 RIVERSIDE SAVES FACE IN FINAL MINUTES TO DENY CSUN  </P> <P> It's an old adage, but, in this case, particularly appropriate.  </P> <P> The bigger they are the harder they fall.  </P> <P> And UC Riverside, ranked No. 1 in Division II basketball, would have made quite  a divot on the floor of the Cal State Northridge gym.  </P> <P> But it didn't.  </P> <P> Instead, it was the expectations of Northridge players and fans that went splat  in the final minutes of an 86-79 loss to Riverside in a California Collegiate  Athletic Assn. game Saturday night.  </P> <P> Northridge (12-8, 3-4 in conference play) can take some solace in that it  certainly didn't give the game away. It was taken from the Matadors.  </P> <P> Riverside, which has won 14 in a row, shot 55.4%, including 63% (17 of 27) in  the second half.  </P> <P> Maurice Pullum led the way for the Highlanders, connecting on 5 of 11 3-point  shots and finishing with 28 points.  </P> <P> Chris Ceballos had 16 points and 9 rebounds for Riverside and Jimmy Shorters  added 15 points in 17 minutes off the bench.  </P> <P> Darren Matsubara scored a team-high 24 points for CSUN.  </P> <P> Riverside, which has a win over Iowa to its credit, finished the first half of  its CCAA schedule 7-0. The Highlanders are 18-2 overall, but only 1 of their  losses came on the court. The other was a forfeit caused by the use of an  ineligible player.  </P> <P> Northridge is 3-4, but still in the hunt for a berth in the 4-team CCAA  postseason tournament. The Matadors are tied for fifth with Cal State  Bakersfield -- their opponent at home on Thursday.  </P> <P> But nobody was thinking about such things after letting a big fish off the  hook.  </P> <P> "When you're playing with such a slight margin of error you have to always be  attentive," CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy said. "You need 40 minutes -- not 35."  </P> <P> Actually, the Matadors put in 32 Saturday.  </P> <P> Northridge, which led by as many as 7 in the second half, led for the last  time, 58-57, after a Jemarl Baker jumper with 8:09 left.  </P> <P> The shot only temporarily slowed Riverside, however. The Highlanders, already  on a 12-6 run, took off on a real tear, scoring their next 8 times down the  floor to gradually pull away.  </P> <P> Included in the run were 4 3-point plays, 2 on 3-point shots by Pullum and  Shorters. The others came in a particularly frustrating fashion for the  Matadors.  </P> <P> Twice Riverside beat the Matadors' full-court press with a deep pass. And twice  Shorters made layups with CSUN's Todd Bowser fouling -- too late and too light  -- from behind.  </P> <P> The last of Shorters' 3-point plays came with 3:18 left and gave Riverside a  75-66 advantage.  </P> <P> Still, Cassidy couldn't fault his team's effort.  </P> <P> Down, 76-69, and fading with 1:55 left, Northridge gave it a last-ditch try.  </P> <P> A 3-point play by Bowser pulled the Matadors within 4. Then Baker stuck a  3-point shot and Riverside's lead was 77-75 with 1:33 left.  </P> <P> In the next minute, Riverside pulled away for good, making 7 free throws,  including the front ends of 4 1-and-1 opportunities.  </P> <P> Riverside, which had trailed at the half only twice this season, was even with  Northridge at the break Saturday. A 3-point shot by Chris Jackson at the buzzer  from beyond the top of the key enabled the Highlanders to tie, 36-36.  </P> <P> Northridge trailed Riverside for most of the half before going on a 12-4 run to  take a 31-29 lead on a 3-point shot by Derrick Gathers.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FAA Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The FAA agrees with the manufacturer's comment about two causes of failure-to-activate and notes that the FAA/NASA report addresses these two situations. The FAA/NASA report documents well the failures of ELT's approved under TSO&hyph;C91. As discussed previously, the most significant conclusions from the report are that: (1) 23 to 58 lives are lost each year due to ELT failures; (2) many of these failures are caused by poor ELT maintenance; and (3) a 64 percent failure rate reduction can be expected with a complete transition to TSO&hyph;C91a ELT's. Attachment 1 of the FAA/NASA report entitled, ``Validation of NASA ELT Reasons for Failure Analysis Report,'' verifies the NTSB data that provides the cornerstone of the FAA/NASA report. In addition, the new ELT TSO&hyph;C91a contains revised G-switch specifications designed to provide proper activation limits and to minimize mechanical defects. This new design is expected to reduce the number of false alarms and improve the failure-to-activate rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> False Alarms_Automatic ELT's <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Twenty commenters identified ELT false alarms as contributing to poor performance. Several commenters cite the FAA/NASA report, which documents the following causes of false alarms: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _G-switch (crash sensor); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Corrosion; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Incorrect installation of the ELT; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Human failures or mishandling; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Heat, water, or radiated interference; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Accidental operation of the controls; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Internal failure. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to identifying the causes of false alarms, members of the Search and Rescue community (SAR) note the significant, additional cost of responding to false alarms, the ability to respond to real emergencies, the cost to taxpayers, and the additional, unnecessary, physical risk to SAR personnel caused by responding to false alarms. In its comments, the NTSB stated that ``in a recent SAR mission the cost incurred, excluding a significant contribution by volunteers, was $13 million.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FAA Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The FAA agrees with the comments regarding false alarms. The primary beneficiary of reducing the number of false alarms would be the SAR community. A reduction in false alarms would make more SAR resources available to aid aircraft in distress. The resources expended by SAR on false alarms would be significantly reduced. The FAA expects that the current number of false alarms will be reduced by 75 percent with implementation of TSO&hyph;91a and a mandatory inspection and maintenance program. However, as stated in the FAA/NASA report, the FAA cannot quantify the benefits in lives to be saved. A reduction in the number of false alarms would result in the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) spending less time analyzing the validity of thousands of signals that occur annually on the 121.5 Mhz frequency. Thus, it is reasonable to presume that if the pre-rescue preparation time were reduced, additional lives could be saved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Replacement Time and Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the FAA did not propose the replacement of existing ELT's with models of newer design, in Notice No. 90&hyph;11, the agency solicited opinion from affected users regarding a proposed time frame for a near-term retrofit program. Twenty-one commenters address the time that should be permitted for mandatory replacement of existing ELT's with those approved under TSO&hyph;C91a. Seven commenters call for a ``voluntary'' replacement. In general, the SAR community proposes four years. Most commenters acknowledge that a manatory timetable for replacement is necessary to realize the benefits of this second-generation ELT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Twenty-six commenters express concern over the direct replacement cost of existing TSO&hyph;C91 ELT's with TSO&hyph;C91a ELT's. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FAA Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The FAA does not agree with the recommendations concerning voluntary replacement. The FAA evisions this final rule addressing new installations to be the first step in the much-needed transition to the improved ELT's. Even though the FAA conducted an extensive education program in the 1980's through the FAA Back-to-Basics Program, seminars, advisory material, and pamphlets, the FAA estimates that fewer than five percent of potential users voluntarily installed the improved ELT's. Although a voluntary replacement program may be less costly, resolution of the failure to activate and false alarm problems would not be timely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) has been tasked to make recommendations concerning the retrofit of ELT's in the entire fleet. For a detailed description of this task, see the ARAC notice published at 58 FR 16574, March 29, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Automatic ELT Replacement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Burford may acquire Trocadero centre - Price thought to be slightly less than Pounds 100m sought Burford Holdings, the property company which purchased the Ladbroke property portfolio for Pounds 103m earlier this year, is understood to have signed an exclusivity agreement for the potential purchase of the Trocadero, off London's Piccadilly Circus. Mr Nick Leslau, Burford's chief executive, said he was unable to confirm the agreement. He added, however: 'For some time, we've been interested in the Trocadero at the right price and under the right conditions.' Mr Philip Wallace, the receiver at KPMG Peat Marwick, said an exclusivity contract had been signed with an unnamed party at a value which was slightly less than the initial Pounds 100m asking price. The Trocadero, which at the peak of the market was valued at more than Pounds 200m, helped drag former owners Brent Walker and Power Corporation towards the brink of collapse. The holding company for the property went into receivership in January 1993, and was put up for sale last October. At a price of Pounds 100m, the 350,000 sq ft entertainment and retail centre would offer a current yield of close to 9 per cent. The building has considerable potential, having 100,000 sq ft of empty office space, and bringing in almost 14m shoppers per year. However, it has been affected by the tawdry image of its neighbouring streets. Burford has a reputation for buying lower grade properties where the management can add significant value. Mr Leslau said one option would be to switch the office property back into retail or entertainment. Burford paid for the Ladbroke portfolio through a share issue, which brought its gearing back down to about 35 per cent, compared with its self-imposed ceiling of 100 per cent. It would therefore be comfortable funding up to Pounds 150m in property purchases through debt. Mr Wallace claimed there had been considerable interest in the Trocadero from prospective buyers in the US, east Asia and UK although Pounds 100m appeared unachievable. 'We have spoken to 30 or 40 different interested parties', he said. It appears that Burford has several weeks in which to tie up the deal.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ho Li (0149 4539): "Democrats Scrambling To Get </F> on `Last Train'"]    [Text] The big boss in the north has said time and again  that Hong Kong's three-tier legislature will be reelected. There  will be no "direct" transition, and no legislative member should  expect to ride the "through train" [meaning that members of Hong  Kong's last Legislative Council may become, upon confirmation by  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Preparatory  Committee, members of the first Legislative Council of the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region]. This is because the British  Hong Kong authorities have submitted the so-called "three  violations" political reform package [Chris Patten's plan in  violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Hong Kong  Basic Law, and the understandings reached between China and  Britain] to the Legislative Council, and the Sino-British talks  have broken down. Now, whatever political reform plan is adopted  by the Legislative Council, a new kitchen will have to be set up  in 1997, says the big boss.    The 1994/95 elections for the three-tier legislature are  drawing near. Though this "last train," with a life of only two  or three years, cannot carry the passengers to their  destination, all political parties and organizations and all  politicians, big and small, are scrambling to get on board. They  include not only democrats and conservatives but also pro-China  political organizations. This is not because they turn a deaf  ear to the northern big boss' "stern" statement. Rather, the  reason is that if you do not get on the train, the arena will be  occupied by others in the next two to three years.    With the curtain to be raised soon for the election war, a  must now in political circles is to deal with friends and foes  with diplomacy. If some results can be produced eventually  through negotiations, the outcome would be the confrontation of  two big forces. The democrats would team up to encounter the  "Unsacred Alliance" formed by the conservative and pro-China  forces.    The hardliners among the democrats are most likely to be  pushed down from the train in 1997. Their participation in  political affairs is more or less out of a  going-without-retreating mentality. This is especially true for  their attitude toward the "last train" before 1997. You must  first get on the train before you are pushed down from the train.    In the 1994/95 three-tier legislature election, all are  ready  to do their utmost no matter what plan the Legislative Council  will adopt. Election of the local legislature--district  boards--will be held in this September. Next year the Hong  Kong-Kowloon and New Territories urban councils will be elected.  This will be followed by the most influential event--the  election of the Legislative Council. Election of the district  boards and urban councils are skirmishes for the Legislative  Council election. In this year's district board election, there  will be 360 seats to be filled. The "Democratic Alliance for the  Betterment of Hong Kong," a pro-China political organization,  has revealed that it will support 80 candidates to run for these  seats. The "Liberal Party," which is regarded as a conservative  party, has announced that it will have some 100 members to join  the election war. As to the three democratic political  organizations, it is estimated that the "United Democrats of  Hong Kong" will have 100 candidates, the "Meeting Point" some 30  candidates, and the "Association for Democracy and People's  Livelihood" about 40 to 50 candidates.    Whether the democrats can team up in the election depends on  whether agreement can be reached through negotiations among the  United Democrats of Hong Kong, the Meeting Point, and the  Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood. In principle,  the agreement will be that, in the same election district, the  three organizations will make all-out efforts to support only  one democratic candidate who is most likely to win the election.  This will avert their contention in the same election district.  Even if contention occurs in the same district, they hope to  minimize it and behave as true gentlemen, if at all possible, so  as to avoid hurting their amity.    As a matter of fact, the district boards have 360 seats,  while the three democratic organizations have less than 200  candidates in total. Perhaps the democrats should pay more  attention to studying the cause that has limited their  development and resulted in their insufficient manpower.  Meanwhile, because of the three organizations' overlapping areas  of development, their candidates may conflict with one another  in the same election district. In the past, these three  organizations have all along tried to negotiate with one  another. In the 1991 district board election, however, they did  have some conflicts despite their negotiation efforts. In 1991,  the United Democrats of Hong Kong supported 71 candidates to run  for the district board seats, the Association of Democracy and  People's Livelihood had 17 candidates, and the Meeting Point had  13. In that election, conflicts did occur between the  Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood and the Meeting  Point.    Nonetheless, whether the three democratic organizations can  reach some agreement through negotiations cannot be judged  merely by the existence or nonexistence of conflicts among them  in the district board election. We must look into other factors.    A flagship among the democrats, the United Democrats of Hong  Kong is the largest of the three democratic political  organizations, presently taking up 13 seats in the Legislative  Council (including as many as 11 of the 18 directly elected  seats). It, therefore, has the posture of a "big party." In the  eyes of the northern big boss, however, the United Democrats of  Hong Kong is a thorn in his side and must be taken out. The  United Democrats of Hong Kong has expressed willingness to hold  dialogues with the Chinese side, but the latter has viewed it as  a "group not to maintain contacts with" and has consistently  hurled accusations against it.    As for the Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood  and the Meeting Point, the former was previously more  enthusiastic about participation in political affairs than the  latter. This is because at the inception the Meeting Point was  mainly a political-critic group. Now, however, in the  Legislative Council the Meeting Point holds four seats, while  the Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood is merely a  "one-person party." Toward these two political organizations,  the Chinese side's attitude is different from that toward the  United Democrats of Hong Kong. The Chinese side has said that  dialogues can be held with them and, what is more, it will  appoint their members as Hong Kong affairs advisors and district  affairs advisors. Toward the Chinese side's gesture, the Meeting  Point takes a relatively clear attitude. It agrees to have  dialogues with the Chinese side, but upholds its own stand. With  regard to the issue of Hong Kong's political reform, it supports  democracy and takes Governor Chris Patten's package as the  bottom line. On the other hand, the political stand of the  Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood is  comparatively "ambiguous."    The United Democrats of Hong Kong and the Meeting Point have  shown a stronger desire to seek coordination among the  democrats. The Meeting Point has said openly that it is willing  to consult with the United Democrats of Hong Kong and the  Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood so that they  can coordinate with and support one another in this year's  district board election. In contrast, as people within the  political circles may recall, in the 1991 election, when the  Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood and the Meeting  Point both planned to nominate their candidates for the same  election district, the former proposed two solutions: One, the  opponent should make way. Two, the two organizations should  merge into one.    In fact, teaming up among democrats should not be limited to  coordination in the district board election. A higher goal  should be the development of a broader united front consisting  of the three organizations plus other democratic personages.  This is particularly necessary in view of the Legislative  Council election to be held next year. The Legislative Council  has 60 seats, of which 20 will be directly elected (of the other  seats, 30 will be elected by functional constituencies, and 10  by the Election Committee). This makes it all the more necessary  for the democrats to coordinate their actions with respect to  candidates for the various election districts. They should pool  their efforts and support one another. However, teaming up may  be just wishful thinking. Turning it into a reality will  probably involve grave difficulties. One of the difficulties  is the hard-to-resolve conflicts of interests among the  democratic political organizations. Every political organization  wants to expand their strength and influence. The most effective  way to do this is to gain more seats in the legislature,  especially the Legislative Council. Since this concerns their  interests, it would be hard to be "modest." In the past  elections, though the three democratic organizations sought to  coordinate their actions, none would make way for the others.  Election is a seat-seizing game. As there are only a limited  number of seats on the "last train," a scramble for seats will  easily occur.    Further, attention should be paid to the splittism caused by  the "China factor." The northern big boss has always wanted to  suppress the United Democrats of Hong Kong by smearing that  organization so hard as if it had contracted "political AIDS"  and everyone should keep apart from it. Long ago Beijing began  to behave as the ruler of Hong Kong. It seems that the United  Democrats of Hong Kong can only have a gloomy political future.  Under China's big-stick policy, the United Democrats of Hong  Kong, though it may become a passenger on the "last train," is  most likely to be pushed down. And, in all probability, other  political organizations and politicians, big and small, will  keep a "safe distance" from it and will have reservations about  coordinating with it or allying with it to form a democratic  united front, if they think of their "own prosperous future" or  if they are frightened by the stick of the northern big boss.  Now, the northern big boss is keeping a fierce watch on the  democrats' efforts toward coordination. China's mouthpiece has  already launched an offensive, asserting that the United  Democrats of Hong Kong is "overbearing" and cannot coordinate  with the other democrats. At the same time, the Chinese side has  spread words to the effect that the newly appointed Hong Kong  affairs advisors and district affairs advisors will include  members of the Meeting Point and the Association of Democracy  and People's Livelihood, but no consideration will be given to  members of the United Democrats of Hong Kong. This is to display  its traditional talisman--the carrot in addition to the stick.</p>

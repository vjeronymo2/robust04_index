			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: EC declaration has no impact STERLING closed  1/2 pfennig down against the D-Mark in London yesterday as traders became increasingly concerned about the weakness of the US dollar and its impact on the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. Trading was thin because the US was off for the Labor Day holiday. But an atmosphere of uncertainty pervaded the market after last Friday's extremely poor figure for the August US non-farm payroll. The drop in US employment, and the  1/4 percentage point reduction in the Federal Funds rate that followed, have had two consequences. First, they have raised renewed fears of a drop in the dollar, which is certain to test DM1.40 on the downside today. Analysts said the producer price index, due out this Friday, could contain low inflation data and give the Federal Reserve a good excuse to push the discount rate below 3 per cent. Secondly, there are fears that this drop will cause new tensions in the European Monetary System, because of renewed buying of D-Marks. Dealers appeared to be unimpressed by a declaration from European Community finance ministers at the weekend that an EMS realignment is out of the question. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, still appeared uncertain on this point in a radio interview on Sunday. The commitment from the Bundesbank not to raise interest rates 'in present circumstances' was also disregarded. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, said the markets had already assumed that this was the case. 'There is nothing new there at all,' he added. 'What the market wants to know is when the cut will come.' Mr O'Neill believes pressure on the pound could be intense in the next few days. In his view, the US payroll figure on Friday undid 75 per cent of the UK government's efforts in securing an Ecu10bn loan with which to buy sterling on the foreign exchanges. 'The Bank will certainly have to spend that money this week, but the possibility that they will have to raise rates still exists,' he said. The pound ended in London yesterday at DM2.7950, off  1/2 pfennig on the day. The dollar closed unchanged at DM1.4030. The Italian lira improved against the D-Mark as investors unwound short lira positions, knowing that the currency was unlikely to come under strong speculative attack while the US is on holiday. The heavy selling of the Italian currency on Friday may have been overdone, considering the 1 3/4 percentage points rise in interest rates that day. But a fall in the dollar to new lows would put the lira under pressure again. It closed at L763.5 to the D-Mark against a previous L765.0.</p>

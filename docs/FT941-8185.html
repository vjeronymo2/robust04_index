			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Hungary defence chief heads party Defence Minister Lajos Fuer will lead Hungary's main governing party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, into elections in May, AP reports from Budapest. Mr Fuer was elected the new president of the forum in a vote late on Saturday at the party's congress. The forum is the leading party in the conservative coalition government, whose popularity is slipping because of economic troubles. Mr Fuer, 55, a historian, was the sole candidate. He won 685 of 729 ballots cast. He was arrested by Russian troops after the suppression of the 1956 revolt and briefly interned. He was a founding member of the forum and has been a member of its national presidium since 1988. 'I will continue the policies of the late prime minister Jozsef Antall,' he told the delegates. Antall, who died in December of cancer, held both the party chairmanship and premiership. His successor as premier, Mr Peter Boross, said he did not want both posts. Mr Fuer told the three-day congress that his party has a chance of 20 to 30 per cent of the votes in the parliamentary elections. Recent opinion polls have indicated that the forum would gain only 8 per cent of the vote. The Socialist party is leading the polls, with 18 per cent.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India offers oil and gas fields for development THE INDIAN government yesterday announced its decision to offer 43 oil and gas fields to private companies for development as part of its privatisation programme. The offer to privatise 12 medium-sized and 31 small oilfields is part of the government's policy to involve private investment, particularly direct foreign investment, in the hydrocarbon sector, to supplement the inadequate resources of the government-owned Oil and Natural Gas Commission and Oil India. Foreign oil exploration companies would get income tax relief and would be levied 50 per cent income tax without surcharge, as opposed to 65 per cent in other lines of business. The package offers discovered oil and gas fields for development and areas for exploration on a continuous basis, as well as incentives to private companies to participate in joint ventures for the setting up of new refineries.</p>

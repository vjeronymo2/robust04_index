			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Mr Lamont's wedge and gap I do not want to spoil the party; but it is time someone pointed out that the UK chancellor has announced what is to all intents and purposes a one percentage point increase in the rate of income tax to come into effect in a year. He was able to escape the uproar that a straightforward announcement would have caused by taking advantage of the strange convention under which one part of income tax is given the strange name 'employee National Insurance contribution'. On the main Budget strategy other commentators have followed my lead in calling it Augustinian, after the saint who prayed to be made virtuous, but not yet. The official Treasury more prosaically describes the Budget, which imposes little extra taxation in the coming year, but which builds up to a Pounds 10.3bn revenue increase by 1995-96, as wedge-shaped. I want, however, to concentrate not on the wedge but on the gap that emerges starkly from the Treasury's Budget Red Book. The projected growth of total spending measured by nominal gross domestic product is reasonably consistent with normal growth and declining inflation. The path is distorted downwards in 1993-94 and upwards in 1994-95 'because of timing effects associated with the fall in the exchange rate'. But the underlying movement is in the right direction. What has, however, changed for the worse compared with last year's Red Book is the division of the projected nominal growth between real output and inflation. The projected increase in real output is now about one percentage point a year less for the next three years than the equivalent path projected in the 1992 pre-election Red Book. On the other hand, inflation - despite being at historically low levels - is now projected on a higher path; and a decline is not expected until 1995-96. The exit from the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) has not been the costless joyride that the Europhobes have prematurely celebrated. The output shortfall is the more worrying of the two. The chancellor seemed to assume in his Budget speech that any resumption of growth would make inroads on unemployment and that it was all a question of delays and lagging indicators. Not so. There are two key concepts. The first is the output gap. This is an estimate of the degree to which increases in demand can readily be absorbed by producers without increasing inflation. (In its modern form it is not a pure physical measure. There could still be millions unemployed after the gap has been reduced to zero.) The size of the output gap has been estimated by the Bank of England to be in a very wide range between 2 1/2 per cent and 7 per cent of GDP. The second important concept is the growth of productive potential. If actual output is growing faster than this, the output gap narrows and unemployment eventually drops. If output is growing more slowly, unemployment will increase. This will be so even if the chancellor is proclaiming 'recovery'. The process will then only be alleviated by wasteful methods such as premature scrapping of equipment, or forced or voluntary retirement of workers from the labour force. The growth of productive potential is estimated by the Treasury at 2 1/4 per cent a year; but it could well be higher owing to the resilience of productivity increases. If unemployment is to be reduced output will have to grow at least as fast as this. Otherwise we remain in a growth depression. Yet according to the Treasury's projections it is not until 1994-95 that non-North Sea output even starts to grow fast enough to make inroads into the output gap. Moreover, even if we take the lowest end of the Bank of England range for that output gap, it is not quite filled even by 1997-98, at least one year after the next election. Some will say that I am taking too seriously estimates, which are only projections by medium-ranking Treasury officials and are neither targets nor even forecasts. In the early 1980s, at the end of the last recession, the Treasury was just as helplessly pessimistic about growth in the late 1980s, which in the end turned out too fast for comfort. In fact, the Treasury does have alternative projections, which assume that non-oil GDP will grow in the medium-term by  1/2 per cent faster and  1/2 per cent slower than its central projection. The only implications it shows in detail are those for the Budget deficit, which are startling enough. On the central projection, the public sector borrowing requirement only drops to Pounds 30bn or 3 3/4 per cent of GDP by 1997-98, early in the next parliament. This is above the Maastricht limit of 3 per cent, but I suspect it would be sustainable - a matter on which the promised separation of the government's capital and current accounts might shed light. The higher growth projection, on the other hand, leaves the PSBR at 2 1/4 per cent of GDP, well within Maastricht guidelines. The policy problems are brought out most startlingly by the low-growth projection. Here the PSBR falls only slightly, despite the projected tax increases and remains in 1997-98 at 5 1/4 per cent of GDP. This is about the same as in the last year of the Callaghan government. What are the policy implications? Would we need ferocious cuts in spending and tax increases to reduce the Budget deficit to a sustainable rate? Or, on the contrary, would the deficit have to be allowed to run or even increase to stimulate spending in a slack economy? I would be interested in the views of informed readers, so long as they are typed, and they do not expect an individual reply. It is symptomatic of the lack of progress of macroeconomics that a response anywhere between these opposites can be justified by qualified practitioners. Simply doing horrifying algebra on the explosion of debt interest is inadequate. For such sums normally assume that output is unaffected by the deficit or measures taken to curb or increase it. In fact, the Budget is not just a replica of that of households and companies. On the contrary, it is reasonable for the public sector to spend more at a time when the private sector is hesitant to spend. Of course, it would not make sense to pay out larger and larger sums of debt-servicing at high interest rates to the people whose money the government has borrowed. If the long-term climate turns out to be deflationary rather than inflationary, it would be best to use fiscal policy as a shock absorber, and then concentrate on reducing interest rates. Such a course would be difficult for Britain alone because of exchange rate implications. Some have said that the UK is in no position to take a lead in international economic policy, after the humiliation of its departure from the ERM. The present state of world economic leaders is such that anyone with ideas could take a lead. It would however help if the British government did more to dispel the widespread Continental view that its main recovery strategy is competitive devaluation - a view I spend so much time trying to dispel on Continental visits. But to do so would involve saying more about sterling than the purely historical frightened sentences which appear in the Red Book. Nor is British influence helped by Norman Lamont's seizure of every opportunity to beat the patriotic tin drum for his backbenchers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TREASURY PROJECTIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- annual % increase                        1992-93   93-94   94-95   95-96   96-97   97-98  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nominal GDP growth       3 1/4   4 3/4   7       6 1/2   5 1/2   4 3/4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Real GDP growth   Non-North Sea           -1/4   1 1/2   2 1/4   2 3/4   3       3   Total                    -     2       2 1/2   2 3/4   2 3/4   2 3/4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Inflation   RPI excluding MPs      3 1/4   3 3/4   3 3/4   3 1/4   2 1/2   2   GDP deflator           3 1/2   2 3/4   4 1/4   3 3/4   2 1/2   2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Red Book  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

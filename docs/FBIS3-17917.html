Yevgeniy Saburov told INTERFAX-Ukraine that the meeting,  held  on Tuesday, focused on "general aspects of the relations between  Ukraine and Crimea." At the same time, "a fairly concrete  matter was (also) given consideration, the beginning of economic  reform in Crimea." "Since that matter doesn't contradict the  law on the sharing of powers between Ukraine and Crimea, there  couldn't have been much friction," Saburov said.    Asked whether the relationship between Ukraine and its  autonomous republic could be based on a treaty, he said, "this  would eliminate the problem of (Crimea's) secession (from  Ukraine)."    As for the possibility of using the Russian ruble in Crimea,  Saburov said, "cash rubles are in circulation in Crimea anyway,  as they are in Kiev, for that matter." He said the Crimean  government planned to shortly open ruble bank accounts for the  autonomous republic's enterprises. "As for the idea that  Russian Central Bank rubles could be poured into the economy of  Crimea, who will give them to us?" Saburov said.    He said granting him Ukrainian citizenship was "under  consideration." Saburov, who is a Russian citizen but needs  Ukrainian citizenship to carry out his duties as deputy premier,  said he favored dual citizenship for Crimea's population.</p>

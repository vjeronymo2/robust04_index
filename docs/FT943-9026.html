			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Summer storms The theory that the worst of the jitters about rising interest rates could be over suddenly looks less plausible. Bond markets across Europe took a tumble on Thursday, dragging equities in their wake, following rises in Italian and Swedish rates. Wall Street is still restive at the thought that US rates may soon go up again. The FT-SE 100 index lost only 25 points on the week after staging a strong come-back yesterday afternoon. With both the Bundesbank council and US Federal Reserve open market committee meeting next week, though, the outlook remains unsettled. The relatively modest decline in London equities is some comfort. Every day brings brighter news on corporate earnings. This week centre stage belonged to the banks and insurance companies, which took it in turns to shatter brokers' profits forecasts. Industrial companies such as GKN  - and yesterday the consumer giant Unilever - are also starting to enjoy the upturn. The prospects for utilities are equally good following painless price reviews by the water and electricity industry regulators. Dividend growth forecasts of around 8 per cent for the market as a whole this year are a powerful support. Yet it is difficult to believe that equities will thrive while bonds remain on edge. The weakness of the pound against the D-Mark - down to DM2.40 yesterday - reflects the strength of the German currency rather than any loss of confidence in sterling. But while the market is transfixed by the next move in rates, such weakness is not soothing.</p>

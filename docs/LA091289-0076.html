			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAI-ICHI KANGYO BANK IS PROSPECTIVE BUYER;  </P> <P> MANNY HANNY EXPECTED TO SELL ITS CIT GROUP  </P> <P> Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said Monday that it is in "serious discussions"  with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. of Japan regarding joint ownership of its wholly  owned CIT Group, a commercial finance company.  </P> <P> But industry analysts said Manufacturers Hanover will likely sell the unit and  that it could bring up to $1.5 billion.  </P> <P> A Manufacturers Hanover spokesman wouldn't comment beyond a brief statement  issued by the New York-based banking company.  </P> <P> Analysts said Manufacturers Hanover will likely sell all of the commercial  finance company to Dai-Ichi Kangyo as part of an effort to shore up its  capital. The bank is among the most heavily exposed of major U.S. financial  companies to Third World debt.  </P> <P> A Japanese news report said the deal was worth $1.5 billion.  </P> <P> "My sense is that they will go all the way," said Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods  analyst James McDermott. "Manufacturers Hanover is under pressure to build its  capital base."  </P> <P> Manufacturers Hanover's stock rose $2.875 a share to $42.50 on the New York  Stock Exchange on Monday on the news of a potential sale of the unit, analysts  said.  </P> <P> Analysts estimate that Manufacturers Hanover, the nation's seventh-largest  banking company, would gain $400 million from the sale of the unit.  </P> <P> Manufacturers Hanover acquired CIT Group from RCA Corp. in 1984 for $1.5  billion. RCA has since been taken over by General Electric.  </P> <P> CIT, a nationwide business financing company used mainly by mid-sized  companies, had assets of $9.3 billion at the end of 1988. Last year, CIT's  profit was $120 million and it employed about 2,500 people.  </P> <P> "CIT is not a crown jewel. It is starting to make money, but after finance  costs and amortization it does not add anything to Manufacturers Hanover's  bottom line," said Bear Stearns analyst Mark Alpert.  </P> <P> Alpert said the sale of CIT for $1.5 billion would be "very positive," reducing  Manufacturers' need for new capital, removing 13% of its assets off its books  and eliminating $450 million of goodwill.  </P> <P> Analyst Lawrence Cohn of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said the bank could use  profits from the sale to build its Third World loan reserves, making it less  exposed to Third World debt.  </P> <P> Another analyst said Manufacturers Hanover was doing everything it could in the  next couple of weeks to raise its stock price so that it could sell common  stock soon.  </P> <P> "It's too bad they have to sell it (CIT) rather than making it work for them,"  an analyst said. "Going forward, a money center bank has to have a unique  business to survive. Commercial finance is such a lucrative business."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'GLORY' AN EPIC OF WANTING PROPORTIONS  </P> <P> "Glory" (at the Cineplex Odeon Century City) is an eloquent, heart-tugging  Civil War epic about the first black infantry regiment to march off to battle  for the Union. And epic is the word. Not since John Ford has a film maker  created such dramatic large-scale Civil War battle scenes in a major theatrical  film.  </P> <P> However, without its fresh focus on the role of the black soldiers in the Civil  War, "Glory" would seem old-fashioned in its unabashedly sentimental conflict  between good and evil. What makes it as rousing as it is is our awareness that  the Civil War was far from a decisive victory for blacks; it was more like the  first round in a struggle for freedom and equality that continues more than a  century later.  </P> <P> "Glory," which is a touch self-congratulatory, eschews the ironic for the  heroic, even though much of what it depicts is inherently, even cruelly ironic,  especially in the spectacle of men who, among their first acts as free men,  volunteered to pay for their freedom with their lives.  </P> <P> Written with fervor by Kevin Jarre from various sources and directed  passionately by "thirtysomething" co-creator Edward Zwick, "Glory" proceeds  confidently in straight-ahead fashion with some astute observations along the  way.  </P> <P> Matthew Broderick stars as an actual Boston Brahmin abolitionist, Col. Robert  Gould Shaw who, though wet behind the ears, doesn't flinch when he is asked to  lead the 600-man 54th Massachusetts Voluntary Infantry, the first black Civil  War unit. Broderick gives a flawless performance as this quintessential  Victorian idealist, a prim, diminutive man with a Van Dyke beard, who has to  dig into himself to find the reserves of courage and leadership.  </P> <P> Broderick shows us Shaw's growth, his learning how to temper his reflexive  severity as he gains self-confidence. Keeping him in perspective is his less  serious, less focused -- but no less decent -- friend, Maj. Cabot Forbes,  played by a very likable Cary Elwes.  </P> <P> The film makers wisely devote the first of the film's two hours to the  regiment's training in a camp in Massachusetts. As the irate Shaw finds he must  combat racism that delays uniforms, rifles and even shoes for his black  soldiers, we learn to know a group of them. They are: Trip (Denzel Washington),  a bitter, cynical young field hand from Tennessee; Rawlins (Morgan Freeman), a  quiet, older man, a natural leader and peace-keeper; Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy), a  sweet-natured, sharp-shooting innocent from South Carolina; and Thomas Searles  (Andre Braugher), a Boston intellectual and freed man who is best friends with  Shaw and Forbes.  </P> <P> Shaping the men up is their Irish sergeant-major (John Flinn) who insists, not  quite convincingly, that he is tough on blacks not because he is a racist but  because he wants them to have a chance at surviving. There are unbilled  appearances by Jane Alexander as Shaw's mother, the recipient of many of his  letters, and Raymond St. Jacques, a dignified Frederick Douglass.  </P> <P> These actors, starting with Washington and Freeman, are distinctive and  involving. Braugher's Searles, however, is one of the film's primary strengths,  as he tries desperately to meet the psychological as well as physical rigors of  his predicament. Braugher's Searles is nicely balanced by Cliff DeYoung's  nasty, corrupt Union colonel, a racist who exploits the war for profit.  </P> <P> As it proceeds to its magnificent climactic battle sequence in Charleston  harbor, "Glory" reminds us that the Civil War was fought for many reasons. At  the same time the film, like "Cry Freedom" and "A Dry, White Season," feels it  must tell of a black struggle from the perspective of a sympathetic and noble  white. For all that is commendable about "Glory," you nevertheless wish you  were experiencing it from the perspective of Trip, a man who gets put down  constantly for telling the truth, but who is obliged by the script to shape up  and get swept up in the film's selfless heroism, just like everyone else.  </P> <P> Denzel Washington, a born star still waiting for that breakthrough part, brings  an anguish to Trip that seems to go beyond the role itself. At times Trip seems  a bit too contemporary in his militance, but then he is not as focal, not as  developed as he might be.  </P> <P> Remarkable as a period piece and for Freddie Francis's vivid cinematography,  "Glory" (rated R for battlefield violence) is an impressive accomplishment for  a director whose only previous theatrical film was the yuppie comedy "About  Last Night . . ." Although "Glory" is splendid for what it is, it does leave us  wanting more.  </P> <P> 'GLORY'  </P> <P> A Tri-Star presentation. Producer Freddie Fields. Director Edward Zwick.

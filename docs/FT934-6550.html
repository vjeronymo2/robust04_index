The buyer is Corporate Express, a private contract stationer, backed by four investors, K-Mart, JP Morgan Investment, Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, and InterWest Partners.

Hanson Office Products made an operating profit in the year to end-September of Pounds 9.3m on sales of Pounds 253.7m. Net book value is Pounds 33m, and with Pounds 66m of goodwill written off on acquisition, Hanson will show an exceptional gain of about Pounds 10m on the sale.</p>

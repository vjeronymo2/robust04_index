			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tanja Staric: "Charges Raised Against Gaspari </F> and Puhar"]    [Text] Ljubljana -- The SLS [Slovene People's Party] and  SDSS [Social Democratic Party of Slovenia] have rejected the  SKD's [Slovene Christian Democrats] initiative to unite.  Instead, they offer to form a new coalition based on the  "positive legacy of the Demos [Democratic Opposition of  Slovenia]." The Presidency of the Social Democrats states in its  message that the coalition should fight against "corruption,  legal anarchy, political repression, and restoration of  neocommunism." The People's Party says in its statement that  Slovenia has arrived at a "decisive crossroads" at a time when  it is still able to resist a "pernicious economic policy." The  SLS will file criminal charges against Finance Minister M.  Gaspari, Labor Minister Jozica Puhar, and Director of the  Development Fund U. Korze. A real political scandal was caused  yesterday by Janez Jansa's offer to all dissatisfied members of  the Democratic Party, Eco-Greens, and Socialists who do not want  to merge with the Liberal Democrats, to join his party.  Presidents I. Bavcar, P. Tancig, and V. Zakelj denounced this  sort of "recruitment" as an "intolerable attempt to interfere  directly in the relations among the merging parties on the one  hand and the internal relations of the parties on the other  hand."</p>

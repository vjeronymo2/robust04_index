			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Marcano from "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Chamber of Deputies approved in its first  debate an emergency bill to solve the Banco Latino crisis, and  the Executive Branch will possibly promulgate that legal  instrument next week. The debate began at the lower chamber at  1630. The legal instrument establishes the necessary norms so  people who deposited their money in the bank may recover their  money.    [Begin Walter Marquez, Banco Latino Commission chairman,  recording] The deputies agreed to approve the bill in the first  debate. The proposed changes in style and content will be  reviewed during the second debate. The president has announced  that an urgent meeting will be held on Monday to complete the  process for the bill's approval. Congress will be in permanent  session until the bill is fully approved on Monday afternoon or  evening. The Senate should review it on Tuesday, and the  documents will be sent to the president on Tuesday or Wednesday  for promulgation. [end recording]    The Chamber of Deputies' Finance Commission has been in  permanent session since Thursday in order to prepare the  respective report.    [Begin unidentified deputy recording] The bill seeks to  achieve two goals: first, to regulate this specific emergency at  Banco Latino and guarantee account holders will be able to  recover the largest amount of money possible; second, to prevent  similar situations from occurring in the future. Do you see the  importance of this text? [end recording]    The Chamber of Deputies debates will possibly continue  during  the weekend because the Finance Commission, which is in  permanent session, is expected to present a report on Friday for  the second debate on Saturday. Hence, the deputies will approve  the bill, thus allowing the Senate to begin its first discussion  on Tuesday. The special bill for Banco Latino will probably be  sanctioned by Wednesday.</p>

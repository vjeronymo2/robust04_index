			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: CRH down 8% to IPounds 57.6m CRH, the Irish construction and building materials group, which spent IPounds 101m on acquisitions and capital expenditure in 1992, suffered an 8 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to IPounds 57.6m (Pounds 58.8m) on turnover down 3 per cent to IPounds 1.11bn for 1992. Mr Tony Barry, chief executive said: 'While we do look forward to improvements in some of our operations, particularly in the US, the current year seems certain to witness difficult conditions in a number of our markets. Although 1993 will be another tough year, severe pruning of our costs has our companies in good shape'. He said the labour force in the group's UK division had been cut by 700 to 3,000, and 19 mixed concrete and pre-cast concrete installations had been mothballed in Spain to weather out the recession in its European operations. Nonetheless, operating costs rose 2 per cent to IPounds 263m, which Mr Barry put down to rationalisation costs and the incorporation of acquisitions in the Netherlands in 1992. He said that 'a further serious decline' in the UK construction industry during 1992, together with severe price competition, was responsible for the low margin of IPounds 4m profits on a IPounds 303m turnover in the UK market. Earnings per share declined by 8 per cent to 16.05p (17p). A proposed final dividend of 4.5p for a total of 6.75 (6.45p) is recommended. COMMENT CRH's earnings performance in 1993 will be particularly sensitive to construction activity in the Irish market, which in 1992 contributed 45 per cent of profits but only 19 per cent of turnover. Despite a 22 per cent promised increase in government construction spending this year, construction activity is broadly forecast to decline overall by some 4 per cent. The European outlook is equally bleak. An anticipated upturn in US activity will partially offset this, which will give volume growth, but little scope for profit margin increases. The group's strong cash position might offer scope for some bargain-hunting acquisitions, adding to profitability when the outlook improves. Earnings forecasts range from 13.5p to 16p for 1993, depending on one's outlook for the Irish market, but which suggests there may be further discounting in the price ahead. This might explain the sweetener to shareholders of further growth in dividend.</p>

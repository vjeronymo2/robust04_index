			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Political commentary: "Clinton's Words--Bigger Than His </F> Mouth"]    [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton alleged very clearly  that "Jerusalem is an integral and permanent capital of Israel  and cannot be divided."    These remarks have caused manifestations of hatred and  abhorrence on the part of the Palestinian political groups that  have broken away from the PLO. These allegations are the  political stance of a government that is seeking to project  itself as a "neutral mediator" to create conditions for what it  terms "Arab-Israeli peace." These remarks were made when  Israel's domination of Jerusalem and, in fact, the usurpation of  Jordan's West Bank have not been officially recognized by the  United Nations. Thus, the city of Jerusalem-- which is revered  by followers of all divine religions and has a special sanctity  and importance--has been described as the indivisible capital of  the despotic Zionist tyrants.    This opinion clearly indicates the dimensions of U.S.  support  for the occupationist regime of Palestine and depicts the  position of Israel as the progeny of the United States. It is  certain that the Zionists have laid great premium on U.S.  support for the attainment of their objectives and the  materialization of their expansionist policies,    Therefore, if the Zionists covet the territory of their  neighboring countries; ensure their existence by the policy of  terrorism, intimidation, and repression; perpetrate atrocities  such as the massacre of fasting worshipers in al-Khalil [Hebron]  without any pretext; and constantly speak from a position of  superiority and strength in the rounds of talks with the  spineless Arab regimes, it is because their actions are based on  the overt support of the Americans.    Since the dawn of history, holy Jerusalem has suffered  numerous incidents of tyranny and suppression by Europeans,  Americans, and then the Israelis. Today at the height of the  treasonous indifference of the regional Arab rulers, it is on  its way to becoming the main power base of the murderers of the  Palestinian nation.    The fact is that Arab governments have played a considerable  role in paving the way for the current situation. The crisis of  the oil war and the synchronized stances of the Arabs and  Zionists during that crisis created the psychological  circumstances for subsequent sessions aimed at a compromise  between the Arabs and the Israeli despots. This provided a  conducive background for the overt and covert closeness between  the Zionists and Arab echelons and proved to be an important  weapon for neutralizing the struggles of the Muslim Palestinian  nation for the liberation of their country from the clutches of  the despots.    Unfortunately, the Islamic world today is riddled by  dissent,  discord, and disharmony more than it ever has been. The  governments ruling over the Islamic countries have been  alienated from Islam and Islamic values on the one hand, and  from their own people on the other.    This alienation--coupled with the phenomena of an  inferiority  complex, underestimating themselves, and bartering themselves  away-- on the part of the Islamic countries before the Zionists  has constantly been one of the basic factors for the gradual  growth of Zionism and the expansion of its political influence  and domain in the heartland of Islamic territories.    The consolidation of the Zionist strategy in occupied  Palestine and their gradual infiltration into the neighboring  countries, which was a culmination of the traitorous conferences  of compromise between Arabs and Israel in the region in the past  one or two years, is to a large extent the result of this very  defensiveness, laxity, self-bartering, and erroneous perceptions  on the part of the rulers and shaykhs of the region.    It is certain that for every step the Arab governments take  backward in the face of the extortionist demands of the United  States and the government it has spawned in occupied Palestine,  the Americans and Zionists rush two steps forward in a more  exacting and audacious manner for greater privileges, and  describe this policy as "peace."    The events of the past two decades in occupied Palestine and  its borders with all the Islamic countries, which were marked by  numerous fluctuations, should drive home to the Arab governments  that the Zionist regime is not to be satisfied with what it can  grab with its talons. Naturally, dealing with such a wanton  government can never be a source of peace and stability for the  zealous Middle East region.    The best and most logical stance has been adopted today by  those inside occupied Palestine and in south Lebanon who--in  parallel with the proliferation of their Islamic and cultural  activities--have pitched themselves against the criminal Israeli  regime. They are the ones who have kept the flame of the  intifadah alight for so many years under the worst possible  conditions.</p>

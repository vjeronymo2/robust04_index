			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Einar Koch report: "Mafia: Confidential Report Shocks </F> Bonn; BKA: In One in Three Cases of Organized Crime a Civil  Servant Is Involved"]    [Text] We were afraid of that....    Organized crime is irresistibly infiltrating our  authorities.    In construction offices, foreigners' offices, offices  responsible for imposing fines -- everywhere there are bribes  and cover-ups.    In a confidential report the Federal Office of Criminal  Investigations [BKA] warns: One in three investigations into  "organized crime" is aimed against corrupt officials.    BKA President Hans-Ludwig Zachert says in this confidential  analysis: "For a long time we used to look down arrogantly on  the bakshish mentality in other countries. Corruption was a  phenomenon that was primarily associated with other cultures.  There is no longer any reason for this smug indifference."    The worst cases came from the reports of the land offices  for  criminal investigations:     -  At the Russian military airport of  Sperenberg in Brandenburg police seized 10,000 smuggled guns  ("Makarovs"). Thirty of the guns seized were stolen -- by a  young criminal police officer with connections with the  mafia.    -  In Munich a five-man special commission is investigating  employees of construction and planning offices, who reportedly  received several 100,000 German marks [DM] in bribes for orders  involving purification plants; 66 of the accused have been  sentenced to prison terms totalling 94 years and fined DM1.5  million.    -  The Bavarian Land Office for Criminal Investigations is  currently investigating another 49 officials; 53 investigations  have already been concluded.    -  In Hesse, 1,400 employees of  authorities have been investigated for corruption over the past  five years.    -  In Frankfurt an employee of the Social Welfare  Office granted a total of DM3 million of unwarranted social  welfare to 80 Czechs.    -  In Hamburg 18 employees of the foreigners'  office are being investigated for allegedly issuing almost any  stamp or any permit in return for cash.    BKA Chief Zachert warns of a "morass": "We must dry it up  before it is too late."</p>

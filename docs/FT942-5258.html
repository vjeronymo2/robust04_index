			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (1): A weary wait for Quebec's verdict - The economy is on the mend, but the political scene is becoming more stormy Most nations only dream of emulating Canada's recent achievements. How many, after all, can boast that they have signed free trade agreements with their biggest trading partner and with one of the world's most vibrant emerging economies; that they have pushed inflation down virtually to zero; changed governments after a free and peaceful election; and, to cap it all, produced North America's champion baseball team two years in a row? Canada has done all these things, and is starting to reap the rewards. Before the US Federal Reserve began tightening monetary policy in February, Canadian interest rates had slid to their lowest level in 30 years. Equally significant, the gap between Canadian and US interest rates was at its narrowest in decades. With exports leading the way, the economy is on track, at least for the time being, for a steady, non-inflationary recovery. At the same time, Canadian workers' productivity has improved dramatically. Companies have sharpened their competitive edge, broadening their horizons in the US, Mexico, Latin America and south-east Asia. Canada also deserves credit for at last starting to tackle some of the structural handicaps which for years have kept the economy from reaching its full potential. One is the generous unemployment insurance and welfare system which has kept Canadian cities remarkably free of beggars and slums, but has raised public sector deficits and trapped thousands of able-bodied people at the bottom of the social ladder. The new Liberal government, which came to office in last October's general election, has launched a vigorous overhaul of the once-sacred social security programmes. The government plans to unveil reforms within a year which are likely to link benefits more closely to training and work. In a remark which would have been unthinkable even as recently as last year's election campaign, Mr Jean Chretien, the prime minister, observed in mid-April that 'it's better to have (people) at 50 per cent productivity than to be sitting at home drinking beer'. Meanwhile, the 10 provinces are inching towards an agreement to dismantle the pervasive non-tariff barriers which have kept British Columbia wine out of Ontario liquor stores, and New Brunswick workers from Quebec construction sites. A growing number of influential Canadians realise that their education system is badly in need of repair - though progress so far in fixing it has been slow. Regrettably, these signs of renewal do not tell the full story of Canada in spring 1994. A gloomier dimension is evident in the stunning results of last October's general election. The Liberals won a comfortable majority, returning to office for the first time since 1984. But Canada's two other national parties, the Progressive Conservatives (which had won the two previous elections) and the left-of-centre New Democrats, were virtually annihilated. Despite gaining 16 per cent of the popular vote, the Tories won just two seats. The opposition benches are now filled by two regional parties which did not exist seven years ago, and whose policies are the antithesis of the qualities of compromise and tolerance for which Canadians are justly famous. The Bloc Quebecois, whose avowed priority is to turn Quebec from a province of Canada into an independent country, holds the incongruous title of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. The Reform party, all but one of whose MPs come from the four provinces west of Ontario, wants to scrap national bilingualism and opposes any special deal with Quebec which might prevent the francophone province from breaking away. Reform's economic policies are well to the right even of the defeated Conservatives. The two new opposition par- ties have undeniably brought some fresh air to Canadian politics. The BQ has so far been the more effective of the two. Although its MPs spend most of their time as Quebec's cheerleaders in Ottawa, some have also been thoughtful critics of national policies, especially of the proposed cuts in social programmes. Reform's penny-pinching MPs seldom allow a Question Period to pass without politely reminding the Liberals of the long shadow cast across Canada's economic prospects by the towering budget deficit. The federal deficit reached a record CDollars 45.7bn, or 5.4 per cent of gross domestic product, in the year to March 31 1994. Aside from the occasional skirmish, the governing Liberals and the two opposition parties have yet to lock horns on their profoundly different visions of Canada. Mr Chretien, for his part, has so far sought to avoid confrontation on the Quebec issue, in favour of setting the new government's economic, social and foreign affairs agenda. The political scene is becoming more stormy, however, as a provincial election draws nearer in Quebec. The vote, which will most likely be held in September, will determine whether Canada must endure yet another period of hand-wringing and navel-gazing over the future of Quebec. A victory by the separatist Parti Quebecois, the BQ's provincial cousins, would pave the way for an unsettling period lasting at least a year, and probably much longer. The PQ, which currently leads in opinion polls in Quebec, plans to start the breakaway process immediately after the election. It has promised to hold an independence referendum within 12 months. The separatists have spread a soothing message, reassuring Quebeckers that independence would eliminate the inefficiencies of a 10-province federal system while maintaining the benefits of the North American free trade agreement and close economic ties with Canada. Proponents of national unity, led by Mr Daniel Johnson, Quebec's new Liberal premier (with the federal Liberals in the wings), are using a differ- ent tactic from earlier constit- utional wrangles. During the 1980s, federal Tories and Quebec Liberals pandered to Quebec nationalism by promising greater autonomy for the province within the Canadian federation. But Mr Johnson has taken a more aggressively federalist approach. He has told Quebeckers that the best way to create jobs and to safeguard their future is through a strong, united Canada. Business leaders generally endorse that view, but are nervous about speaking out. Those that have raised their voices in recent years - including Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, and most recently, Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare products group - have found themselves accused of blackmail. The conventional wisdom in Montreal is that, while many Quebeckers are keen for a change of government after nine years of Liberal rule, they will not be willing to take the much bigger gamble of breaking away from Canada. But the longer the squabble over Quebec's future continues, the greater the chances that the separatists will eventually prevail. With defenders of a strong, central government thin on the ground in recent years, the transfer of one power after another from Ottawa has seemed almost inevitable. Outside Quebec, the willingness of Canadians to keep fighting for a united country cannot be taken for granted. Many English-speaking Canadians have become weary with the bickering, now spanning almost two decades, over Quebec's place in Canada. The view is now widespread, especially in the Reform party's western stronghold, that while Quebec is welcome to stay, it should be wished good riddance if it decides to go its own way. Mr Mike Harcourt, British Columbia's premier, told the Globe and Mail newspaper in mid-May that 'Quebec and BC are natural allies in a renewed Canada and would be the best of friends. But if they decided to separate, we wouldn't be the best of friends, we'd be the worst of enemies.' A victory by Mr Johnson's Liberals in the forthcoming election would seriously weaken the PQ, and probably cripple the Bloc Quebecois. If the PQ wins, however, the 1994 poll may mark the ironic point in history where, just as Canada was starting to revitalise itself, it also started to fall apart.</p>

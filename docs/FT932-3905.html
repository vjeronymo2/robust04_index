			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: James Cropper rises 18% JAMES CROPPER, the Cumbria-based paper and board manufacturer,lifted annual profits by 18 per cent as a strong performance from its converting division offset a poor year in papermaking in the UK. On turnover little changed at Pounds 40.3m, pre-tax profits for the 12 months to March 27, struck after an exceptional reorganisation charge of Pounds 174,000, amounted to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 1.06m). The technical fibre products side experienced a turn-round into the black and the weak domestic papermaking operation was mitigated by growth in export sales and profits. A recommended final of 2.125p brings the total for the year to 3.1p (3p), covered three times by earnings of 9.4p (8.6p) per share.</p>

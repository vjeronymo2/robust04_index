			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Ultramar directors to share Pounds 6.7m LASMO, the independent oil exploration company, announced it had paid Pounds 6.7m to seven Ultramar directors, in one of the biggest post-takeover payments in British corporate history. The payment was made to terminate the contracts of the directors after Lasmo took over the diversified oil and gas group in December. Lasmo will also pay Pounds 1.4m to top up the directors' pension funds. Lasmo has already paid Pounds 886,000 in compensation to former chairman, Mr John Darby, and Lord Remnant who resigned from the board at the end of October amid controversy over directors' remunerations. Most of the compensation is understood to have gone to Mr David Elton, Mr Peter Raven, former finance director, and Mr Eugene O'Shea who all resigned from the Ultramar board at the end of January. Mr Jean Gaulin, Ultramar chief executive, and Mr Nick Di Tomaso, senior vice-president in charge of refining and marketing, received a payment for terminating their Ultramar contracts, but have agreed to remain with the company on new contracts with a month's notice. Two non-executive directors share in the pay-out: Mr Ronald Utiger and Mr Bernard Ness. The payments include Pounds 4.8m for terminating contracts, Pounds 1.9m for pension contributions, Pounds 35,000 for loss of office and Pounds 67,000 for other benefits. Lasmo said the settlement was not as large as it could have been because directors were accepting two and a half years' salary rather than three to which they were entitled. The company still has to agree a deal with Mr Lloyd Bensen, former chairman who had remained on the board and resigned in October. His pay-out could be as much as Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.6m). Mr Robert Bland could qualify for a payment of more than Dollars 1m, but agreed to remain with Lasmo to work on the Indonesian operations. Mr William Sheptycki will work on Lasmo's North Sea operations until he retires in April. The company has added the directors' payments to the cost of its Pounds 1.1bn takeover of Ultramar together with provisions for severance and redundancy payments to other employees as a result of the restructuring of Ultramar's operations. The company said it had made progress in integrating Ultramar. Lex, Page 20</p>

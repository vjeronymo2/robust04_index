			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> RECREATION ZONE RULES DEBATED  </P> <P> As part of a long-term plan to renovate Anaheim's prosperous tourist area, the  City Council council Tuesday night debated new design guidelines for the  commercial recreation zone around Disneyland and the Convention Center.  </P> <P> Some business people -- especially owners of small businesses -- expressed  reservations that the improvement plans were being made at their expense.  </P> <P> "The program the city has I think really inhibits the small landowner," said  Mike Capelouto, whose family owns a small business in the zone.  </P> <P> In past public hearings, business owners and developers have been concerned  that the new plans were too restrictive. Developers had asked the city for  development incentives, such as density bonuses, and business people asked for  more leniency on the uses of signs for their shops.  </P> <P> Some landowners also were concerned that businesses such as fast-food  restaurants, convenience stores and self-service laundries, which would be  prohibited under the changes, could in fact be helpful to tourists, especially  families on a travel budget.  </P> <P> The council will vote on the ordinance covering the zone changes in three  weeks.LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUSH, PULL AND THE BODY POLITIC;  </P> <P> HISTORY: SINCE THE GREEKS, HUMANS HAVE SOUGHT THE 'LAWS' OF HISTORY. BUT THERE  IS ONLY ONE LAW, AND IT EXPLAINS THE DOWNFALL OF COMMUNISM.  </P> <P> A historian cannot observe the momentous events of the last few months in  Eastern Europe or, indeed, perestroika and glasnost, which opened the way for  them, without being greatly instructed as to the nature of history herself --  of Clio, Queen of the Muses.  </P> <P> First, it must be said that the distinguishing feature of history is that it is  full of surprises. The most renowned expert, the most farsighted prognosticator  cannot anticipate the future. We have no idea what the future holds in store  for us. The future, Robert Frost wrote, is given form by our faith. We believe  the future into existence. Why then can we not predict it? Well, for one thing,  our moods are too transitory and unpredictable. We are too fickle and faithless  to be relied upon.  </P> <P> Since the time of the ancient Greeks, human beings, especially male human  beings, have found the obscurity of the future maddening. They have shown  remarkable ingenuity in trying to discover the "laws" of history. The Greeks  (and to a degree, the Romans) believed that time was cyclical, that nations  were compelled to go through preordained cycles -- from democracy (which  invariably degenerated into anarchy), to dictatorship (which was legitimated  into monarchy), to oligarchy (the rule of a rich and powerful class made  restive by the arbitrary dictates of the king). And so on, forever.  </P> <P> Christianity, by anticipating an end to time, the Day of Judgment, attacked the  pagan notion of endlessly recurring cycles and "straightened history out," so  to speak. Humanity was not condemned to endless repetition; there could be  change and progress toward a clearer idea of God's intentions for man.  </P> <P> In the 19th Century, the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel  propounded his "dialectical" view of history. The dialectic consisted of a  thesis (the dominant consciousness of the age) and an antithesis (a set of  opposing propositions). Out of the struggle between the established thesis and  its challenger, the antithesis, would come a new synthesis that combined the  most enduring values of the rival creeds. Hegel's theory of the dialectic was  one of the great creative notions in all of history -- in part at least because  it involved the principle of incorporation. The synthesis was larger, more  comprehensive, more generous, if you will, than the rival systems. The  synthesis, in turn, became a thesis and was once again challenged by a new  antithesis.  </P> <P> I have always found Hegel's system a most fruitful one. Unfortunately, Karl  Marx did too. He adapted Hegel's dialectic, with bourgeoise capitalism as the  thesis. The antithesis was communism, which must utilize the technological  skills of capitalism and place them in the service of the classless society,  run by and for the benefit of all, but especially for the benefit of the  workers. Millions of men and women were enthralled by the prospect of a society  without class strife, with jobs for all and communist equality.  </P> <P> Marxian communism, moreover, came forward under the banner of the new religion  of science. No wonder it had an enormous attraction. It must be kept in mind  that the economist system (thesis) it opposed (capitalism) was the most brutal  and exploitative system yet invented by the race. It condemned millions to  lives of desperate poverty and crushing toil so that a relative few might live  in the luxury of Oriental potentates.  </P> <P> Of course it did more than that. It developed a remarkable technology,  theoretically at least capable of supplying the needs of all the inhabitants of  the globe, and a large and productive (and prosperous) middle class, a  substantial number of whom, appalled at its excesses and inequities, became  socialists of one kind or another and some of whom became communists (in the  U.S. very few workers did). In any event, all the true believers in Marxism  were assured that communism was the scientifically inevitable wave of the  future. It might be resisted or abetted but it could not be deflected.  </P> <P> I mention all this because the Marxian dialectic is only the most recent of the  "laws of history" and, one might add, one of the shortest-lived.  </P> <P> There is, in fact, as far as I can discern, only one law of history. It was  simply stated by the English historian-philosopher Lord Acton more than 100  years ago: "Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely."  Although Acton put the idea in its most familiar form, it is an idea at least  as old as classical times. The Greeks expressed it in the idea of hubris, or  pride. Success, wealth, power brought in their train hubris. The human who  sought and achieved power and wealth challenged the gods and they, angry at  such human presumption, brought the pretender down in ignominy.  </P> <P> Christians called it "original sin," the disposition of the individual to  prefer his will to the will of God. Every individual was born with this taint  of sin, deriving from Adam's original disobedience. The most common political  manifestation was the proclivity of humans to abuse power and indulge selfish  desires rather than seeking the common good.  </P> <P> If the law that "power corrupts" is the only irrefutably established law of  history, it has a number of corollaries. In the words of the British historian  E.L. Woodward, "Everything good has to be done over again, forever." Daunting,  in one way, encouraging in another, Woodward's axiom follows naturally from our  disposition to abuse power.  </P> <P> It was the Founding Fathers' acute awareness of this law that prompted them to  try to devise a constitution that would prevent any class or interest from  exploiting any other. Gouverneur Morris reminded the delegates that the rich  had always exploited the poor -- no reason to think that they would be any less  inclined to do so in a republic than in a monarchy. The only remedy was to  hedge the rich with constitutional constraints. There was, of course, no  guarantee that human ingenuity could devise effective limitations, but it was  worth trying.  </P> <P> So what do we have? No laws of history but a single law and a number of  corollaries, among them the assumption that democracy is the best system for  calling the powerful to account. There is also the related idea of rotation in  office to prevent officeholders from acquiring excessive power and being  corrupted by it.  </P> <P> It is not only individuals who aggregate power and almost inevitably abuse it;  collections of individuals called bureaucrats also amass power and abuse it,  albeit usually in more modest ways. However, it may well be that, in the last  analysis, the bureaucrats are more dangerous to the general welfare than single  abusers of power if only because they are so much harder to root out.  </P> <P> Which brings us back to Marxian communism. There is, obviously, no such thing  as "historical inevitability," either communist or capitalist; there are only  the touching, sometimes illusory dreams and ambitions of human beings who at  their best yearn for peace and order and justice and at their worst make an  inordinate amount of mischief (often in the process of trying to bring about  peace, order and justice in the world).  </P> <P> There are, of course, many reasons why Marxian communism has failed so  dismally, but perhaps the most basic reason is that in their pursuit of a  utopian social order, the Marxists ignored the only historical law that cannot  be ignored: "Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely." By  establishing a one-party system, the Bolsheviks ensured that communism would,  in time, be corrupted by its unchallengeable monopoly of power.  </P></p>

			<p>Marijuana   Smuggling Case   <F P=102> 94WD0375B Kingston THE DAILY GLEANER in English 8 Apr 94 p 1 </F> <F P=103> 94WD0375B </F> <F P=104>  Kingston THE DAILY GLEANER </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO     [Text] A Corporate Area businessman, who allegedly gave two  prominent young men a quantity of ganja to take to the United  States, was arrested yesterday and charged with breaches of the  Dangerous Drugs Act.    A police source said Christopher Moore, 23, accompanied by  his attorney, turned himself in to the police and was arrested  and charged with possession of ganja, dealing in and taking  steps to export the drug.    Moore, son of Charles Moore who owns Moore's Transport Ltd.,  on Hagley Park Road, St. Andrew, is booked to appear in the  Kingston Criminal Court at Sutton Street this morning.   <H5>    A Link </H5>   Moore's arrest is linked to the arrest Wednesday of Bryan  Bernal, the 20-year-old son of Jamaica's Ambassador to the  United States, Dr. Richard Bernal, and a juvenile relative, for  breaches of the Dangerous Drugs Act.    The young men were held with 45.45 kilograms of ganja  disguised as pineapple juice as they were being processed to  leave the Norman Manley International Airport for Washington D.C.    However, they contend that they were given the tins, packed  into two cartons, to deliver to the relative of an acquaintance  in Washington D.C. The police had been trying to find the person  who allegedly gave the young men the contraband.    In the meantime, the after-dark bail Wednesday of Bryan  Bernal and a juvenile relative has raised many eyebrows in legal  circles.   <H5>    Unprecedented </H5>   Lawyers say it is unprecedented that persons charged in  connection with the trafficking of significant amounts of drugs  be offered "station" bail.    Although the police have the power to grant bail, they  invariably remand persons caught attempting to smuggle drugs and  allow the court to decide if bail should be granted and in what  amount.    Alleged traffickers, mostly foreigners have consistently  been  denied bail in the past, but some Jamaicans whose attorneys have  been able to convince the court that they will turn up for their  trial have been offered bail, usually with conditions attached,  such as surrendering travel documents and reporting to the  police each week.    At Hunt's Bay Police Station Bryan Bernal and the other  accused were each offered $500,000 bail Wednesday night.    They were freed on bail, about 10 hours after they were held  with the drug packed into 96 tins, labelled pineapple juice,  among their luggage.    When they appeared in the Kingston Criminal Court at Sutton  Street yesterday, Resident Magistrate Norma Von Cork extended  their bail until next Thursday, April 14.    Their Jamaican passports were seized as a condition of bail.    An application by defence counsel Richard Small for the two  to be given permission to return to the United States to  continue their studies was turned down by the magistrate. Mr.  Small submitted that Bryan, an architectural student, was due to  sit examinations this month.    Mr. Small and attorney-in-law Stephen Shelton are appearing  for the accused. Clerk of the Courts Linda Wright is  representing the Crown.</p>

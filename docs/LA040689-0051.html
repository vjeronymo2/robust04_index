			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> One of the highest ranking and most decorated black officers in the California  National Guard has been cleared of allegations of sexual and financial  improprieties. Lt. Col Ezell Ware Jr., 48, succeeded in retaining his  commission and is working full time as a staff assistant in the California  Guard headquarters. A panel of four officers recommended last year that he be  stripped of his reserve commission. But the California National Guard  commander, Maj. Gen. Robert Thrasher, overturned the panel's decision.  Top-level officials at 6th Army headquarters and at the Pentagon have endorsed  Thrasher's action, said Ware's lawyer, Robert Bernstein. As a helicopter pilot  in Vietnam, Ware was shot down five times. He received an Air Medal with 21 oak  leaf clusters, three Meritorious Service Medals and two Army Commendation  Medals.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER CHUNK OF BLUFF SLIPS, ILLUSTRATING A FACT OF LIFE  </P> <P> Dale Dillon had just announced that a 1 1/2-mile stretch of Coast Highway north  of San Clemente would reopen within the hour when a new chunk of the bluff gave  way, depositing more rock and dirt on the roadway Wednesday afternoon.  </P> <P> Dust from the latest slide hadn't even settled, when Dillon, a county official,  turned to a group of nearby workers. "All bets are off," he said. "Mother  Nature isn't cooperating."  </P> <P> It's a fact of life that motorists and homeowners in north San Clemente and  Capistrano Beach have known for years.  </P> <P> The sandstone and clay bluffs, rising sharply about 100 feet above the two-lane  highway, are prone to give way at a moment's notice. Wind, rain and time have  weakened the bluffs, which tower over the roadway and a narrow band of homes on  the beach below.  </P> <P> Shortly after 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, nearly 2,000 cubic yards of dirt broke loose  and spilled across Coast Highway just north of Camino Capistrano. No one was  hurt, but five homes on the bluff top lost portions of their back yards. The  highway was closed for more than 35 hours, forcing traffic to be rerouted  around the area. It was finally reopened to through traffic Wednesday night,  but Dillon said there are no guarantees that the bluffs won't slip again.  </P> <P> "This is the fourth slide of this magnitude in the last 15 years and there's  really no way of telling what caused it," said Dillon, chief of public  facilities operations for the county's Environmental Management Agency. "More  than likely, it's probably nature running its course."  </P> <P> That was little comfort Wednesday to the five homeowners who lost 10 to 20 feet  of their yards and in two cases, lost portions of concrete patios.  </P> <P> "It was just a shock. It was like someone took a big bite out of my patio,"  said Edward Makasjian after inspecting the damage to his home in the 2800 block  of La Ventana for the first time on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The semi-retired real estate agent, who lives in Downey and plans to move full  time into the San Clemente home with his wife this summer, said he plans to  rebuild the patio, and will be "content with what is left of his yard." But he  believes the city should erect some type of retaining wall along the edge of  the bluff to prevent another slide.  </P> <P> San Clemente officials, however,  </P> <P> mailed letters to the five residents on Wednesday, advising them to hire  private geologists to evaluate the damage to their yards and make  recommendations on appropriate measures to stabilize the slope below their  homes. Huynh Trang, a city building inspector, said the homeowners actually own  the slope and therefore are responsible for taking corrective action, if  necessary, to stabilize it.  </P> <P> "It's up to the homeowners," Trang said. "Obviously, once they settle on a plan  they must get city approval to make those improvements."  </P> <P> The cause of the slide may be impossible to determine but moisture is often a  factor, Dillon said. Residents living on top of the bluff often over-water  their yards, and the excess moisture easily makes its way through the porous  sandstone below. But when the water hits a layer of impervious clay, it begins  to move laterally, causing the sandstone to slip with it.  </P> <P> In the area around the slide, portions of the bluff at varying heights appeared  wet Wednesday.  </P> <P> "That clay gets as slick as wet concrete," he said. "And the slope just gives."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zheng Yan (6774 6056): "Where Is the British </F> Side's sincerity in Holding the Talks?--Commenting on the White  Paper 'Representative Government in Hong Kong'"]    [Text] After the British side published its white paper  "Representative Government in Hong Kong" (hereinafter "White  Paper"), the Chinese Foreign Ministry made public the truth of  several major issues discussed by the two sides in the  Sino-British talks on the 1994-95 election arrangements in Hong  Kong (hereinafter the "truth"). The "truth" hit home by  pointing out that the British side had no sincerity for the  talks and deliberately sabotaged them. Then, the British side  could do nought but defend itself once again, saying that "the  Chinese side often blamed the British for having no sincerity  for reaching agreement on the political structure but that this  was absolutely not true in reality."    What, then, are the real facts?  <H5>  The British Side Damaged the Foundation for the Sino-British </H5> Talks    On 13 April last year, China and Britain eventually decided  to hold the talks for which the Hong Kong people had ardently  hoped. That day, the Chinese and British Governments jointly  announced their decision as follows: "According to a decision  made by the Chinese and British sides after discussion, the  representatives of the two governments will begin talks on 22  April 1993 in Beijing on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in  Hong Kong according to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the  principle of converging with the Basic Law, and the relevant  agreements and understandings already reached by the two sides."  In short, the foundation for the Sino- British talks was the  abovementioned three principles. However, the 17th paragraph of  the "White Paper" flatly denied that agreements and  understandings had been directly reached by the Chinese and  British foreign ministers in early 1990 on the 1995 electoral  arrangements in Hong Kong, saying that "there was no agreement  on electoral arrangements for 1995 and the issue has been left  open for future discussion." This was a brazen negation of  historical facts.    As a matter of fact, in early 1990, the work of drafting the  Basic Law entered its final stage and the Drafting Committee  would soon make its final decision on the political structure of  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]. Although the  drafting of the Basic Law was China's internal affair, so that  things would be more favorable to Hong Kong's smooth transition  and to the smooth transfer of government, and also because  British Foreign Secretary Hurd had expressed his hope that "an  understanding can be reached on the development of the political  structure before and after 1997," the Chinese side still  discussed with the British side by exchanging correspondence  (written messages) between the foreign ministers of the two  countries. The subjects under discussion included the number of  seats in the council, the composition of the Election Committee,  the voting procedures in the legislature, and the nationality  requirements for members of the Legislative Council [Legco].  The seven diplomatic documents which have been made public  clearly show the discussion process between the two sides and  the agreements and understandings which were reached.    For example, regarding the number of directly-elected seats,  the British held that the number of directly-elected seats in  the 1991 Legco should be not less than 18, requiring that there  should be 24 directly-elected seats in the first SAR Legco in  1997. According to the consensus reached by the Basic Law  Drafting Committee, the Chinese side held that there should be  20 directly-elected seats in the 1997 Legco; 24 in 1999; and 30  in 2003. At the same time, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said in  his letter to Foreign Secretary Hurd: "In order to realize the  convergence of the political structure before and after 1997 and  ensure the smooth transfer of government, the Chinese side is  willing to consider the British side's idea of increasing the  number of directly-elected seats from 15 to 18 in 1991." On 12  February, Foreign Secretary Hurd sent a letter to Foreign  Minister Qian, the third paragraph of which reads: "I am now  ready to confirm an understanding with the Chinese Government as  follows. If the final version of the Basic Law specifies 20  directly-elected seats in the SAR legislature in 1997, 24 in  1999, and 30 in 2003, then the British Government is ready to  limit the number of directly-elected seats in the 1991 direct  elections to 18." The final version of the Basic Law specifies  the numbers of directly-elected seats of the Legco from 1997 to  2003 according to the consensus of the Basic Law Drafting  Committee and the abovementioned understanding between the  Chinese and British sides.    The "White Paper" admitted only that the 18 directly-elected  seats in 1991 were arranged according to the "common view" of  the Chinese and British sides. We must then ask the British  side: Did the number of 18 directly-elected seats just drop  from the sky? Mr Hurd, Britain's foreign and commonwealth  secretary, used explicit words in expressing the understanding.  The British side agreed to set 18 directly-elected seats in  1991 precisely under the precondition that there would be 20  such seats in 1997, 24 in 1999, and 30 in 2003. The four  figures in the agreement reached by the Chinese and British  sides were inseparably linked together with the concrete process  of democracy in Hong Kong. Otherwise, the "18 seats" would  become a mysterious number that could not be understood.    Why did the British side only acknowledge that the 18  directly elected seats in 1991 represented the "common view" of  the Chinese and British sides? People should not think that the  British side still had a fragmentary memory of the agreements  and understandings reached between China and Britain. No, that  is not true. For the British side, it would be the best thing  if this was also negated. However, if they really did this, it  would be hard for them to explain the introduction of 18  directly-elected seats to the 1991 Legco election. This was the  painful and embarrassing reason why the British side had to  admit that the 18 seats represented a "common view" of the  Chinese and British sides.    In the talks, the British side was also faced with a  question  it had to answer. How many direstly-elected seats should there  be in the 1995 Legco? According to the agreement reached by the  foreign ministers of the two countries in early 1990, there will  be 20 seats in 1997; so it is logical that there should also be  20 seats in 1995. The British side refused to admit this simple  fact until the third round of the talks and only then very  reluctantly.    As another example, the issue regarding the composition of  the Election Committee was discussed repeatedly. The letter of  reply sent by the Chinese side on 8 February 1990 explicitly  said: "The components and proportions must be arranged  according to the second point of the Basic Law's Annex I because  Annex I was passed by the Drafting Committee Eighth Plenary  Session by a two-thirds majority." On 12 February, the written  message from Foreign Secretary Hurd to Foreign Minister Qian  affirmed: "I agree in principle with the arrangements for  setting up the Election Committee as you propose. The Election  Committee may be set up in 1995 and the details of such  arrangements can be discussed by both sides in due course." In  the covering letter accompanying the abovementioned message, the  British side explicitly indicated that no obstacles existed to  both sides' cooperation on the issue of the Election Committee  and also expressed gratitude for the Chinese side's efforts in  this regard.    Things were written clearly in black and white and were  absolutely not so vague as the "White Paper" said in that "the  electoral arrangements were left open for future discussion."    In the talks, the British side continually insisted that the  Chinese and British sides had not reached any agreement on the  composition of the Election Committee; it also indicated that  the British side was willing to consider the concrete  arrangements proposed by the Chinese side according to the terms  specified by the Basic Law Annex I. That is to say, in the 1993  talks, the British side refused to implement the agreement and  understanding reached by the two sides in early 1990 on the  composition of the Election Committee and would only give  consideration to the package as a concrete program proposed  unilaterally by the Chinese side. Such tricks by the British  side have rarely been seen in the history of world diplomacy.    The British side's denial of the fact that the Chinese and  British sides had reached agreements and understandings on the  arrangements for the 1995 Legco elections directly shook the  foundation for the talks, making it impossible for them to move  along a correct course. This also fully showed that the British  side was hyprocritical when agreeing to the "common foundation"  for the talks. If they refused to even acknowledge the existing  agreements and understandings on the concrete arrangements for  the 1995 elections, how could they have any sincerity? Here, we  must ask the British side: As you agreed that the talks be held  on the basis of the three principles, to what specific things do  the "relevant agreements and understandings reached by China and  Britain" refer?  <H5>  Deliberately Complicating Things Shortly After the Beginning </H5> of the Talks    As their name indicated, the "Sino-British Talks on the 1994  and 1995 Electoral Arrangements in Hong Kong" were aimed at  ensuring the convergence of the electoral arrangements for the  last Legco, the two municipal councils, and the district boards  under the British Hong Kong authorities with the Basic Law and  the relevant stipulations made by the National People's Congress  [NPC] so that members of the three-tiered councils could remain  there after 30 June 1997, thus making things more favorable to  Hong Kong's smooth transition and the smooth transfer of  government. Therefore, the subject of the talks was clear and  definite.    However, the British side deliberately complicated things in  the first round by raising three subjects beyond the scope of  the talks for discussion with the Chinese side. They demanded  that consultation be held on the Hong Kong members of the Hong  Kong SAR Preparatory Committee; that the Chines Government  guarantee its support for the election of all members of the  Legco by universal suffrage in 2007; and that the Chinese side  be ready to use the same model of the 1995 Election Committee to  form the selection committee for the first SAR chief executive  in 1997 and the election committees for other chief executives  after 1997.    The issue of Sino-British consultation about the Hong Kong  members of the SAR Preparatory Committee. The decision made by  the Seventh NPC at its third session in April 1990 already  specified the composition of the preparatory committee and that  all its members will be appointed by the NPC Standing Committee.  This is a matter within China's sovereign power and is not open  to Sino-British consultation.    The issue of electing all Legco members by universal  suffrage  in 2007. This matter will arise 10 years after the  establishment of the SAR and will be decided by the SAR on its  own. This point has also been explicitly specified by Annex II  of the Basic Law. The Basic Law is the fundamental law of the  Hong Kong SAR and Hong Kong affairs after 1997 will also be  handled on the basis of, and in accordance with, the Basic Law.  The issue of whether or not there should be Chinese Government  support does not exist.    The issue of taking the 1995 Election Committee as the  model.  The form of composition and the method of forming the selection  committee for the first SAR chief executive and the election  committees for later chief executives have all been specified by  the NPC decision and the Basic Law annexes. The British side  have no right to propose any unified model.    The British side's intention in raising such questions was  obvious. In the tactical aspect, the British tried to set  artificial obstacles to the talks, stalling for time so that the  talks would not be able to achieve any result before the  deadline set by the British side beforehand. Thus, it would be  able to find a pretext for terminating the talks. With regard  to the aim of the talks, the British side not only tried to seek  an electoral arrangement favorable to itself but also tried to  gain more by interfering in affairs within the autonomous  jurisdiction of the future SAR. Does this show any sincerity  from the British side?  <H5>  How Did the Sino-British Talks Break Down? </H5>   Here, I would like to outline the rough course of the  breakdown of the Sino-British talks according to what I know.    In order to break the deadlocked situation in the talks and  to achieve positive results as soon as possible, the Chinese  side proposed that the talks on the 1994 1995 electoral  arrangements in Hong Kong be carried out in two phases. The  electoral arrangements for the district boards and the two  municipal councils, which should be easier to handle and were  also more pressing, were to be discussed first and settled. The  talks could then concentrate on the more complicated  arrangements for the Legco elections. The Chinese side then  took the initiative and proposed a five-point verbal  understanding during the 15th round on 28 October 1993. This  proposal was as follows:    1. The British side promises to keep their nature as organs  without political power and functions of the district boards and  the two municipal councils unchanged so that they will converge  with the relevant provisions of the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law.    2. The British side agrees to abolish the relevant  provisions of the regulations on the elections for the district  boards, the two municipal councils, and the Legco which prevent  deputies to the people's congresses at various levels in the PRC  from being elected. While revising the relevant electoral  regulations, the British side will continue to maintain the  provision prohibiting members of the national assemblies or  councils in other countries and regions, and salary-earning  officials from other countries and regions, from entering Hong  Kong's Legco, district boards, and the two municipal councils.    3. Both sides agree to lower the voting age from 21 to 18.    4. The Chinese side has no objection to the British side's  adoption of a "single-seat, single-vote system" for the district  board and municipal council elections.    5. The British side believes that appointed seats in the  district boards and in the two municipal councils should be  removed from the 1994 and 1995 elections. The Chinese side  holds that an appropriate percentage of appointed seats be  maintained in the 1994 and 1995 district board and municipal  council elections; the number of appointed seats in the district  boards and the two municipal councils will be decided by the  Hong Kong SAR Government on its own according to Article 98 of  the Basic Law, after 30 June 1997.    On 3 November, through diplomatic channels, the British side  handed over its draft of the Memorandum of Understanding  according to the abovementioned five-point verbal proposal with  an explanation which stated: The copy drafted by the British  side only made an essential change to one point in the  five-point proposal put forward by the Chinese side. That is,  the "single-seat, single-vote" system will be applicable to the  elections of the district board, the municipal councils, and  also the Legco. Apart from that, the British side accepted the  entire contents of the Chinese side's proposal.    As for the fifth point, the formula drafted by the British  side was worded as follows:    5. The British side propose that the system of appointed  membership of district boards and municipal councils should be  abolished with effect from September 1994 and March 1995  respectively. The Chinese side have proposed that a certain  proportion of the membership of these bodies should remain  appointed, pointing out that on or after 1 July 1997 the Hong  Kong SAR authorities, in accordance with Article 98 of the Basic  Law, will determine on their own what the number of appointed  members of district boards and municipal councils should be.    The above quotation showed that the British side had  already accepted the solution proposed by the Chinese sideand  this is evidenced by both the British side's expression and the  specific wording of the copy it delivered to the Chinese side.  Thus, it is expected that results might be achieved in the  "separate" settlement of the electoral arrangements after the  Chinese side's tremendous efforts for the proper settlement of  the difficult issue concerning the appointment system. At this  moment, however, the British side once again created new trouble  by demanding that the voting method for the 1995 Legco elections  also be written into the fourth point of the understanding.  This abruptly sharpened and complicated the matter at issue.    On 5 November, through diplomatic channels, the Chinese side  made its initial response to the copy delivered by the British  side on 3 November and indicated that an official reply would be  made some time later. The Chinese side indicated: It is  "improper" to extend the "single-seat, single-vote" electoral  method to the geographical direct elections for Legco as the  British draft suggested. The voting pattern for the Legco  direct elections should be further discussed and separately  arranged when the two sides concentrate the talks on the Legco  electoral arrangements.    The British side expressed disagreement, and stressed that  the first-stage agreement must include the voting method of  "single- seat, single vote" for the geographical direct  elections for Legco. It indicated that this was a point of  "substance" for the British side. Otherwise, it would not be a  "balanced" agreement for the British side and would not be  "attractive."    In order to strive for an agreement and to solve the  so-called "balance" issue about which the British side was  concerned, the Chinese side made renewed efforts on the second  day of the 17th round, proposing that the five-point  understanding between the two sides might exclude the Legco  electoral arrangements. The Chinese side then handed over two  versions of the draft understanding for the British side to  select from. After considering them, the British side said  privately that it could not accept any understanding excluding  the voting method for the Legco elections. Then, it flatly  rejected the drafts handed over by the Chinese side. In the  following plenary meeting, the negotiating representative of the  British Government read a prepared statement, saying that: "From  the instructions I have received, I am not authorized to  continue the discussion on the first-stage understanding."  Thus, the British side first departed from the negotiating  table; at the same time, they continued to hypocritically  express their willingness to hold the 18th round of the talks on  more extensive and more complicated arrangements for the Legco  elections. After that, the British side took a series of  unilateral actions to finally and tightly close the door on the  talks.    In order to shirk responsibility for damaging the talks, the  British side later even talked a lot about the omission of the  words "on its own" by the Chinese side from its draft in the  17th round of the talks. Paragraph 42 of the "White Paper"  says: The omission of the words "on its own" after the  reference to the Hong Kong SAR Government "did not mean that the  SAR Government would in future determine on its own whether or  not to retain or abolish appointed seats; that decision would be  for 'the Chinese side.'" This was an out-and-out distortion!  The Chinese side omitted the words "on its own" in order to  make the version more concise. Despite the omission, the action  will still be made by the SAR Government, and the meaning of the  sentence has not changed at all. As a matter of fact, when the  Chinese side handed over the draft with the omission of the  words "on its own," the British side did not discuss anything  with the Chinese side. If in the course of discussion, the  British side had demanded that the words "on its own" be written  back into the text, it is believed that it would not have been  hard for the Chinese side to accept this. However, as the  British side had made up its mind to terminate the talks, it had  no interest in further discussing anything with the Chinese  side. The misleading interpretation of the omission of the  words "on its own" by the Chinese side in the "White Paper" was  merely a pretext that the British side later found for shirking  its responsibility for undermining the talks.    "Whether going up to the heavens or going down to the  netherworld, nothing can be seen at all." [ancient Chinese  verse quoted from unknown source] Where was the sincerity the  British side advocated repeatedly?    All the facts are plain: The British side stubbornly stuck  to the package dished out by Chris Patten and had no sincerity  at all from beginning to end; still less did it want to reach  any agreement. In the talks, the British side employed the  following tactics: Damaging the foundation for the talks by  means of generally affirming and concretely negating the  principles; trying to rediscuss agreements and understandings  which the two sides had already reached; imposing subjects  irrelevant to the theme of the talks, thus causing trouble for  the Chinese side and stalling for time. At the same time, the  British Hong Kong authorities put into practice a number of  electoral affairs which should be discussed by the two sides,  thus disrupting the talks. When the talks were delayed to the  deadline set by the British side, it continued to find new  pretexts to terminate the talks. They then proposed talks on  more complicated issues in order to shirk responsibility for  damaging the talks. It then brought the Patten package to the  Legco "piece by piece" according to its established plan. This  was the course traversed by the British side in the 17 rounds of  the talks over seven months.</p>

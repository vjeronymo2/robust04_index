			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> OLDEST LIGHTHOUSE TO BE MOVED  </P> <P> The National Parks Service plans to relocate the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, the  nation's oldest and tallest brick lighthouse, once it can be strengthened for  the move.  </P> <P> The lighthouse is threatened by wave action now that sand dunes have eroded and  can no longer protect it. When the black-and-white-striped lighthouse was built  in 1870, it was 1,500 feet from the Atlantic Ocean. It currently is 160 feet  from the ocean.  </P> <P> Workers will renovate and strengthen the 208-foot-tall lighthouse to reduce the  risk of damage when it is moved, said Robert Baker, the park service's  Southeastern director.  </P> <P> The service has dropped plans by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build a  $5.6-million barrier around three sides of the lighthouse to keep waves from  bashing it, Baker said.  </P> <P> "Attempting to protect the lighthouse from its present location is ultimately  futile," Baker said.  </P></p>

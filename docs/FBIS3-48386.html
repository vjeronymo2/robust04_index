Officials said Kim's application was taken to mean that he  is  giving up his Korean citizenship and seeking political asylum.    It is not immediately known how the Seoul government will  respond.    Kim, who was a trusted aide to President No Tae-u, left the  country when authorities started investigating him on suspicion  of receiving bribes while he was in Chongwadae.</p>

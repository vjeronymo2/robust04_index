			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar pointed  out yesterday in the capital of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay  that Bolivia is willing to gradually -- and with increased  strength -- approach the member countries of the Common Market  of the South, Mercosur, made up of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay,  and Uruguay.    Aranibar is in Montevideo, the capital of the Oriental  Republic of Uruguay, where he is participating in a Latin  American Integration Association, Aladi, meeting. There are  problems regarding the participation of Mexico -- which has  already signed an agreement with Canada and the United States --  as far as the free trade agreement is concerned.</p>

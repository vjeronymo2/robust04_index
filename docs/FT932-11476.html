			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Observer: On a whim So why is Wim Duisenberg playing hard to get? The affable and capable head of the Dutch central bank, who also chairs the European Community's committee of central bank governors, has to be the leading candidate for the presidency of the European Monetary Institute. Favoured by both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand, Duisenberg would be charged with trying to steer EMI, which under the Maastricht treaty is due to spring to life at the beginning of next year, towards - maybe - a fully-fledged European Central Bank. Word is that Duisenberg, 57, is not interested - not because he dreads a political minefield, but because he apparently believes that running the Dutch bank presents a greater challenge. He may not escape that easily. Another candidate, Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France and former managing director of the IMF, turns 64 later this year, and so is a less likely choice on grounds of age alone. Meanwhile, Horst Schulmann, a free-thinking German who is a mere 60, is also mentioned but is reckoned to be quite content in his newish job as head of the Hesse branch of the Bundesbank. Could it be that the wily Dutchman might just change his mind if a deal were reached to site EMI, not in Bonn or Frankfurt, but in Amsterdam?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cordoba, 17 May (NA) -- Engineer Luis Murgio, one  of the scientists from Cordoba Province who has developed a  satellite that will be launched at the end of 1995, has  travelled to Moscow to coordinate the launch with Russian  authorities.    The first satellite from Cordoba was developed within the  sphere of the province's Science and Technology Secretariat with  the participation of a group of researchers that had worked on  the now-deactivated Condor-II project.    The research activities were supported by the National  Atomic  Energy Commission in the province through the state enterprise  CORATEC [expansion not given], which was created in 1992.    The project will have a final cost of some $1.2 billion, and  it is thought that most of it has been built in Cordoba,  although it does have some imported parts.    The satellite, which is the size of a shoe box, will be used  for agricultural, geological, and environmental purposes.</p>

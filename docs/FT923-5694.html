			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Jobless rate 'has doubled' for young AN ESTIMATED one in six people aged between 16 and 24 are out of work, and the age group's rate of unemployment has nearly doubled in the past two years, according to research published yesterday. The analysis by the Unemployment Unit, an independent research organisation for the unemployed, and the charity Youthaid showed that 888,700 people aged under 25 are looking for jobs or waiting for a place on a Youth Training (YT) scheme. This represents 16.5 per cent of the workforce of that age, the highest proportion since January 1987. Two years ago the rate was 8.8 per cent. The Unemployment Unit said that although this represented 511,400 people the rate had almost doubled because now there were just over 500,000 fewer people aged under 25 in the workforce. The figures include what the organisations call the 'invisible unemployed', an estimated 97,000 people aged 16 and 17 who are not on YT and do not have jobs. Many do not receive benefits because these are dependent on them being on training schemes. A Labour party survey earlier this year suggested that up to 60,000 people aged 16 and 17 were waiting for a YT place. The Department of Employment disputed this although it provided no precise figures of its own. Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, said the latest figures showed that the government's guarantee of a training or education place for young people was a sham. He called on ministers to reverse the withdrawal of income support for this age group. 'It cannot be right to deprive a section of the community of all income when the government's own 'guarantee' of a training place has simply not been delivered,' he said. Ministers have privately expressed embarrassment at the way in which the training pledge for 16 and 17-year-olds has not worked as planned. The Department of Employment is trying to spread best practice among Training and Enterprise Councils, which deliver YT. The Department of Social Security is looking at how information about the severe hardship allowance can be made more readily understandable and available to those who might qualify.</p>

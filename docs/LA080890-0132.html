			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> SAVE OUR PARKS MAY FACE RIVAL INITIATIVE  </P> <P> The City Council, in a move denounced by some local environmentalists, is  considering a rival ballot measure to thwart an initiative sponsored by Save  Our Parks.  </P> <P> The Save Our Parks initiative, which has already qualified for the Nov. 6  ballot, would forbid the sale or lease of park or beach land unless approved by  a vote of the people.  </P> <P> The City Council on Friday will consider a rival measure that would allow the  lease of parks and beaches without a citywide vote.  </P> <P> The rival measure surfaced at the City Council's regular Monday night meeting.  Tom Duchene, a leader of a coalition of parents seeking a "youth sports  complex" at Central Park, told the council that the Save Our Parks initiative  would be harmful to the sports effort.  </P> <P> Duchene said the Save Our Parks initiative would prevent parks from  accommodating any structure more than 3,000 square feet in floor area or  costing more than $100,000, unless approved by voters. Duchene said that  restriction would mean that the proposed youth sports complex would have to be  put to a citywide vote if the Save Our Parks measure passes on Nov. 6.  </P> <P> "We should not force our kids and their parents to wage expensive political  campaigns just to have a place to play in our community," Duchene said. He then  urged the City Council to adopt another, less-restrictive ballot measure.  </P> <P> Save Our Parks officials and some other environmentalists at the City Council  meeting spoke against Duchene's proposal. But a majority of the council favored  the idea. By a 4-1 vote, the council called for a meeting at 9 a.m. Friday to  consider Duchene's proposed ballot measure. If it is approved, the Duchene  ballot measure would then go on the Nov. 6 ballot as a competitor to Save Our  Parks. BILL BILLITER  </P></p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Broker gets a lifeline from Daiwa - Emiko Terazono examines the Japanese bank's purchase of Cosmo the schedule for which is due to be announced today - as a wholly natural move. The two institutions are former operations of Nomura Shoten, a money exchanger set up by Tokushichi Nomura in the late 19th century. 'They are like brother companies,' says an official at Japan's ministry of finance. Mr Hiroshi Nakano, president of Cosmo, said the company had posted extraordinary losses of Y69.8bn (Dollars 682m) due to its tobashi deals, or shuffling of one client's account to another to avoid realisation of investment losses. 'The only way for Cosmo to survive is to become a subsidiary of Daiwa.' Cosmo has a negative net worth of Y7.1bn, and its capital adequacy ratio had plunged to a negative 280 per cent. Daiwa will inject Y70bn to Y80bn through share purchases. The situation is a clear embarrassment to the ministry of finance and the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, Japan's securities watchdog set up last year. Cosmo said it had found out about the tobashi deals early last year, but had not informed the authorities. The ministry took action against Cosmo over a number of separate tobashi cases late last year. The SESC, which had investigated the broker, had failed to uncover the crippling losses. Although Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, last week claimed Cosmo's operations were unrepresentative of other small brokerages, many analysts suggest that Cosmo could be the tip of the iceberg. The ministry has started an investigation of 48 brokerages to look for irregular sheet trading. The rescue will leave Daiwa with more than 50 per cent of Cosmo, making it the first bank to own a stock brokerage affiliate. The anti-monopoly law prohibits banks from holding more than 5 per cent of a company, but in Cosmo's case this ruling has been waived. From April, Japanese banks have been allowed partial entrance into the securities industry. Ministry of finance officials say that the exception was made because the stock market is still fragile and the economy has yet to recover. 'This does not mean we will not let a single broker fail,' said Mr Sohei Hidaka, director-general of the ministry of finance. But some analysts assess that Daiwa's acquisition of Cosmos may accelerate the pace of deregulation of the barrier between the country's banking and securities industries. The government drew up plans in the late 1980s to allow banks into the securities industry. The move met with fierce opposition from Japan's stockbrokers: and the recent weakness of the stock market has tended to slow the banks' entrance into the business. However, the government's decision to allow Daiwa to rescue Cosmo through acquisition comes as brokerages, especially the smaller houses which depend on commissions from retail operations for revenue, are in dire need of financial help as trading volume on the stock market has plunged. Cosmo itself posted a pre-tax loss of Y150m for the first four months to July. In the near-term, the Cosmo bail-out is likely to place a heavy financial burden on Daiwa, which will need to pump in additional funds for the broker's restructuring. Moody's Investors Service, the US credit ratings agency, yesterday said it was placing Daiwa Bank under review for a possible downgrade. Longer term, however, all that could change. According to Mr David Marsh, analyst at IBCA, the banking credit agency, Daiwa is in an exciting position with trust banking, commercial banking and broking as its three main operations. Investors on the Tokyo stock market remained calm, with the leading Nikkei average moving ahead yesterday. A Cosmo spokesman said while some individual investors had cancelled their accounts, most corporate investors remained undeterred.</p>

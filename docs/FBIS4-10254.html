			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibeth Vega G.] </F>   [Text] President Guillermo Endara said yesterday that under  no circumstance will he consider renegotiating the  Torrijos-Carter Treaties to prolong the existence of U.S.  military bases in Panama beyond the year 2000.    Endara's statements followed the arrival of a U.S. mission  headed by Republican Phil Crane. The U.S. delegation is in  Panama to collect information from different economic and  political sectors on the possibility of renegotiating the  presence of U.S. military bases in Panama. According to the  Panama Canal treaties, the last U.S. soldier has to leave  national territory before midnight on 31 December 1999.    The U.S. delegation of about 25 people met with President  Endara yesterday. The delegation also plans to meet with  different business groups, as well as with the presidential  candidates for the 8 May elections (Ernesto Perez Balladares,  Ruben Blades, Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, and Ruben Blades [as  published]).    "They visited me, and I told them I had a promise to fulfill  for the people--a promise I made in the 1989 campaign, when I  vowed that during my administration the renegotiation of the  treaties will not be considered under any circumstance," the  Panamanian president said.    According to Crane, prolonging the presence of U.S. military  bases along the Panama Canal and in national territory will  guarantee the security of both countries, as well as the  security of the entire world. Crane also said Panama would  benefit economically "because it will simply be a business deal  between two countries."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Party [NP] has questioned the need for  a political party to have a cell in its offices following last  night's police swoop in which four injured men were found at the  ANC's PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] headquarters in  Johannesburg. The four, some of whom claimed to be IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party] members, were found in a barred cell after a  fifth man summoned the police to the ANC offices at Lancet  House. The fifth man also showed signs of serious assault and  said he had escaped from the ANC headquarters.    ANC officials told the police last night that they had  detained the men because they were suspected of breaking into  cars. The NP said this incident confirmed many people's  suspicions about what went on in ANC offices, and raised new  questions about the reasons why ANC President Nelson Mandela had  stopped the police from searching ANC headquarters after  shooting in the city three weeks ago.</p>

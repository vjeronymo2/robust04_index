This amendment is prompted by reports that certain PSU printed circuit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boards and power supply connectors have overheated in service. The actions specified by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this AD are intended to prevent overheating of the PSU printed circuit board and power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supply connectors, which could lead to a fire in the PSU. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective January 26, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of January 26, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from de  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Havilland, Inc., Garratt Boulevard, Downsview, Ontario M3K 1Y5, Canada.

That action proposed to require repetitive inspections of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the passenger service unit (PSU) printed circuit boards and power supply connectors to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detect corrosion and evidence of overheating; repair or replacement of the circuit boards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or replacement of connectors, if necessary; and eventual installation of a modification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would terminate the required inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter requests that the proposed requirement to submit inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results to de Havilland be deleted. The commenter states that, since the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require that a terminating action be accomplished, and since de Havilland has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aware of the addressed problem for several years, any data supplied to de Havilland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through inspection reports would not shed any new light on the problem. The FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concurs. Upon reconsideration of this proposed requirement, the FAA considers the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submission of reports to be unnecessary. Additionally, de Havilland has advised the FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it foresees no future need to receive such reports. Accordingly, the FAA has revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final rule by deleting the reporting requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This same commenter requests that the compliance time for the proposed initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection be revised to account for new airplanes. The commenter suggests that new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes should not be required to be inspected for at least 12 months since new. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering this comment, the FAA has determined that the applicability of the final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be revised to limit it only to airplanes having serial numbers 3 through 369,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inclusive. Airplanes having serial numbers higher that 369 were delivered with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent of Modification 8/1950 (the terminating modification required by this AD)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installed. In light of this, a revision to the final rule to address ``new'' airplanes, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested by the commenter, is unnecessary since all of the affected airplanes have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accumulated more than 12 months since new.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has revised the applicability of the final rule to clarify the specific part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers of the subject PSU's installed on the affected airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule to clarify this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in calculating the economic impact of AD activity. In order to account for various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hour. The economic impact information, below, has been revised to reflect this increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the specified hourly labor rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 133 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The required inspections will take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total cost impact of the proposed inspections on U.S. operators is estimated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $15,960, or $120 per airplane, per inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The required terminating modification will require approximately 3 work hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per PSU to accomplish, at an average labor cost of $60 per work hour. Required parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would cost approximately $62 per PSU. Each airplane is equipped with between 18 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26 PSU's. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed modification on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. operators is estimated to be $242 per PSU, or between $4,356 and $6,292 per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted. However, the FAA has been advised that the initial inspection has already been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished on approximately 22 airplanes; therefore the future economic impact of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule is reduced by at least $2,640. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

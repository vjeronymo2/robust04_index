			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: FHOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> MATERIALS AVAILABLE FOR AIRTIGHT SLIDING DOORS  </P> <P> QUESTION: It gets chilly and drafty near our aluminum sliding glass patio door  and I feel a warm air leak in the summer. What type of replacement doors are  best to block both the cold and heat and lower our heating bills?  </P> <P> ANSWER: A typical metal sliding-glass patio door is one of the most  energy-wasting items in a house. To exacerbate the problem in the winter, you  feel chilly from the drafts, so you set the room temperature higher to  compensate.  </P> <P> The three most important factors to consider are the basic design (sliding or  swinging), the frame material and the type of glass. The basic design and frame  material have the greatest impact on the airtightness of the door. The type of  glass impacts the conductive heat loss the most.  </P> <P> Double swinging (French) doors can be designed to seal very well. With swinging  doors, much of the weatherstripping can be the compression type. If you chose  insulated metal doors, super-airtight magnetic seals, like on your refrigerator  door, are used. Compare the air leakage (infiltration) specifications for each  door you consider.  </P> <P> However, before you consider swinging doors, make sure you have adequate open  area in your room for the doors to open. Sliding doors are real floor space  savers because you can place furniture near them.  </P> <P> With any type of sliding-glass door, a very strong frame material and good  design are important. These doors take a lot of impact abuse. They must remain  true, otherwise even the best weatherstripping won't be effective.  </P> <P> There is a new type of sliding-glass door with a unique track design. The door  closes in a similar fashion to an airplane door. They are flush when closed.  This provides one of the most airtight seals. It is also very secure against  break-ins.  </P> <P> The frame is made of special fiberglass. Fiberglass is very strong and it  expands or contracts very little with temperature and humidity changes  throughout the year. Unlike vinyl and aluminum, you can easily paint the  fiberglass frame to change colors if you desire.  </P> <P> The glass options for patio doors are the same as for windows. The two most  energy-efficient glass systems are Heat Mirror and low-emissivity (Low-E)  filled with argon gas. Both have an insulating R-value more than three times  greater than single-pane glass and they block outdoor noise.  </P> <P> You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 370, showing a list of patio  door manufacturers (sliding and swinging), frame materials and types of glass  they offer, and information on the new fiberglass airplane-type door.

What could cause this and what can I do to fix it?  </P> <P> A: The most probable cause is that your furnace is cycling on the fan/limit  switch. It shuts off the burners when the temperature inside the furnace gets  too high. This is often the result of inadequate air flow through your heating  system.  </P> <P> Check to make sure the furnace filter is clean and not blocking the air flow.  Check the tension adjustment on the blower belt so it isn't slipping. Make sure  the duct dampers are in the open position and that the return registers aren't  blocked by carpets. If everything checks out properly, you should contact your  service technician.  </P> <P> Letters and questions to Dulley, a Cincinnati-based engineering consultant, may  be sent to James Dulley, Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati,  Ohio 45244.  </P> <P> </P></p>

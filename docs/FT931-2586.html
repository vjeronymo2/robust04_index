			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kalgoorlie Super Pit's future hangs on pipeline plan THE FUTURE of Australia's biggest gold mine, the Super Pit at Kalgoorlie, depends heavily on a proposed 2,000-km gas pipeline to bring cheap energy from the north of Western Australia. Mr Ian Burston, chief executive of Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines, which operates Super Pit, says that his company (which comprises a 50:50 joint venture between Homestake Australia and Poseidon Gold) would consider becoming part of a consortium to build and to operate the pipeline in order to gain the advantages of cheaper electricity. The pipeline scheme is being heavily promoted by the recently-elected Western Australian government, which wants it operating in about two years. The government has made it clear that it will put no money into the scheme but it will hasten the necessary permitting procedures. At present the Super Pit is supplied with electricity from Perth, 600 km to the west, and about half the power drains away because of the distance. Mr Burston says the present cost of power prohibits the use of conveyors and other equipment that would enable a substantial increase in Super Pit production. 'If we could buy electricity from the gas pipeline we could consider other methods of moving ore out of the pit.' Last year Super Pit produced 640,000 troy ounces of gold and this year output is forecast to rise to 660,000 ounces. This will involve moving 56m tonnes of material. Mr Burston suggests that the present mining methods - using huge mechanical shovels capable of scooping up 20 cubic metres at a time and trucks that can carry 200 tonnes in one load  - allow a maximum of about 60m tonnes a year to be moved. To boost production beyond that level, in-pit crushers and conveyor systems would be needed. Mr Burston says conveyor systems capable of carrying huge loads up very steep angles - necessary because the Super Pit walls slope at 45 degrees - are already available. Super Pit was the brainchild of Mr Alan Bond, the now-tarnished Perth entrepreneur who had the idea of amalgamating the small open-pit mines developed in the area by many different owners. The area also is riddled with 3,000 metres of underground workings and the Super Pit operators have to take great care, detecting the voids with radar equipment. Super Pit already produces more gold and processes more ore than any other mine in Australia. It will ultimately absorb all of the previous open pits and many of the shallow underground workings on the Eastern Lode System of Kalgoorlie's Golden Mile. When fully developed, the pit is expected to be as much as 4.2 km long, 1.5 km wide and about 500 metres deep, a man-made hole that will be clearly visible on the moon - but only if KCGM can find a way to open up the present mining bottleneck.</p>

This deadline was subsequently put back to 10  October that same year. The plant continues to operate and to  add to the gigantic mounds of radioactive waste....    Since after the collapse of the USSR the plant was left as  the only one of its kind in Russia, they are thinking about  expanding production.    Three years ago, having learned of the situation at the  plant, specialists from Gossanepidnadzor and environmental  protection departments were dispatched there. They were  horrified by the picture that emerged -- with natural background  radiation of 15-18 microroentgen per hour, in some parts  workplaces were "polluted" to the level of up to 500-700  microroentgen per hour, and radiation from the thousands of  tonnes of actual waste reached 1500 microroentgen per hour --  and the defenders of people's health and the environment sounded  the alarm.    Certain measures were taken immediately. Decontamination  procedures were carried out at workplaces and on parts of the  plant territory, showers were installed, and constant  radiological monitoring was set up. But all this failed to  attack the root problems. So in the end the chief medic at the  Kray Gossanepidnadzor Center submitted a decree on closing the  plant down....    We stood with Vitaliy Tereshchenko, the enterprise's chief  engineer and expert physicist from the Kray Gossanepidnadzor  Center Department of Radiological Hygiene, at the edge of the  compound where the plant has started to store sacks full of  waste -- for dispatch to Rostov-Na-Donu, to "Radon," the nearest  specialist combine. Some 4,000 sacks have already been filled  here, but the work has been "in vain" -- "Radon" has refused to  accept even a portion of the waste.    Further into the compound the waste has been neatly placed  in  sacks, while nearer to us it has just been dumped willy-nilly.  Screw nozzles, on which a white salt containing radioactive  substances is visible, are like snakes "guarding" the  approaches. V. Tereshchenko moves an instrument toward the  "snakes." It's really bad -- over 800 microroentgen per hour.  The sand a couple of meters from the compound is also very  "dirty" -- 575 microroentgen per hour.    Nearby there is a kind of lake into which water is dumped  after the production cycle. At the bottom are thousands of  tonnes of radioactive sediment.    Some of the water leaks onto the flats. The radiometric  device indicates that the water packs a "punch" of 70  microroentgen per hour.    "We have already drawn up several options for setting up  controlled waste burial sites on the territory of the plant  itself," Oleg Anisimov, deputy chief project engineer of the  Russian Federation Atomic Energy Ministry All-Russia Planning  and Design Research and Technological Association, says.    As it turns out, setting up a burial site on the plant's  territory would take around two years and cost roughly 1 billion  rubles. The buried waste will remain radioactive for  approximately 1.5 million years. So would we not thereby be  planting a kind of "ecological time bomb"?    Plant Director Valeriy Kaygorodov claims that workers at the  enterprise have not suffered any particular illness in all these  years. However, when the conversation turn to the fact that  even world science has made little study of the effects on the  human body not of huge but of low doses of radiation, they fall  silent and appeal to other experts, saying: We are merely  technicians.</p>

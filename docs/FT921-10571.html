			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Approval granted for Pounds 450m payment - European Community Budget THE GOVERNMENT last night made heavy weather of obtaining approval for Pounds 450m of provisional payments to the European Community budget, as it said the UK's net budget contribution was now likely to be 'in the region of Pounds 2.5bn.' Mr Francis Maude, the financial secretary to the Treasury, was besieged by puzzled backbenchers from both sides of the Commons inquiring why the payment was necessary. Opposition to the measure was spearheaded by Sir Teddy Taylor (C Southend East) who suggested that all MPs who supported it should be surcharged. The issue was whether parliament should pay for what was unlawful, he said. The special estimate debated yesterday is required because the budget adopted by the European parliament may be illegal. Under these circumstances, Britain can limit payments to the contribution due had a budget for 1992 not been adopted, with the balance - of some Pounds 150m a month or Pounds 450m over the first quarter - to be approved by parliament. The large size of the discrepancy arises because last year's Pounds 1.2bn UK contribution to the EC budget was abnormally low. Only Pounds 12m of the overall payment relates to the portion of the budget which is in dispute. An amendment advocating that the provisional payment be reduced by Pounds 100,000 was defeated by 220 votes to 27. The government motion was approved with a majority of 207 (223-16).</p>

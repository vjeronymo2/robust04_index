			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restucturing of Eastern Germany (3): Service with a smile - David Waller reports on the banking revolution The transition from command economy to market economy in the east of Germany has been especially pronounced in the banking sector. Before unification there was no private sector banking industry at all - now the sector employs tens of thousands of people and provides a level of service to the customer which is more advanced than in the west. 'Before the wall came down customers came into their bank and got shouted at by the employees,' recalls Mr Peter Krakow, chairman of the Leipzig Sparkasse, the biggest savings bank in the new federal states. 'There was no discretion whatsoever - and everybody else in the queue could listen in. People were profoundly suspicious of their banks, seeing them quite rightly as agents of the state. All this has changed.' As the bustling banking hall of the Leipzig Sparkasse shows, well turned-out employees now speak in respectful tones rather than barking out orders to terrified customers as if they were underlings. Those who do not want to stand in the queue can make use of an array of self-service machines in a separate room. Here, as elsewhere in the new federal states, the level of technology on offer is more sophisticated than at bank branches in the banking metropolis of Frankfurt. According to the Bonn-based Federation of German Banks, there are now just under 100 private sector banks in the eastern states, with nearly 1,300 branches as at the end of last year employing 21,000 people. On top of that there are around 160 Sparkassen which employ 42,000 - twice as many people as before the wall came down. Then there are the Landesbanken - public sector commercial banks  - which serve the new states in a series of complicated cross-shareholding and cooperation agreements with their western counterparts. This is a dramatic change from communist days when the banking sector was divided between the Staatsbank - the state-owned bank which was part of the machinery of the command economy - and the Sparkassen. While Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, the two biggest banks in the west, bought the old Staatsbank network, all other credit institutes have had to build up their branch networks from scratch. By the end of 1993, private sector banks had invested DM4.5bn in buildings and fixed assets alone, excluding further hundreds of millions spent on intangibles such as training. The Federation of German Banks says that banks plan to spend a further DM1.5-2bn expanding their branch networks over the course of this year and next. The commitment of the private sector banks to the east has not been without problems. Unpopular in the west of Germany at the best of times, banks are especially unpopular in the east where economic recovery is taking far longer than politicians promised at the time of reunification. The resentment is that much greater as a result of the banking sector's record profitability last year and, more recently, the failure of big banks to foresee the collapse of the Jurgen Schneider property empire which has put several thousand jobs in Leipzig at risk. Mr Eberhard Martini, chief executive of the Bavaria-based Hypo-Bank and outgoing chairman of the Federation of German Banks, complained in March that banks were portrayed as 'crisis-profiteers'. He denied that the banks charged excessive fees in the east and, in an outspoken speech, he criticised Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mrs Birgit Breuel - chairman of the Treuhand privatisation agency - as well as the press for the banks' poor image in the east. His outburst follows the long-running dispute over the scale and the form of banks' commitment to the so-called Solidarity Pact. While banks have agreed to commit hundreds of milliona to east German industry by means of direct participation in German industry, Chancellor Kohl has complained that the 'bank billions' have not yet been forthcoming. As Martini said, the banks will only invest on normal commercial criteria and in the east these criteria are difficult to fulfil. Therein lies the nub of banks' problems in the east: they are expected to fulfil a social role in the rebuilding of the new federal states while being obliged to shareholders to undertake only profitable business. Conditions in both commercial and retail banking are difficult. As Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chief executive of Commerzbank, explained recently, 'the risk for commercial customers is higher in the east . . . we simply don't have the credit information and the company history which normally form the basis of a lending decision.' Not surprisingly, corporate customers complain about their treatment at the hands of the arrogant 'wessis' or western Germans who still dominate the top management positions in the east-based banks. A poll conducted recently by the BDI Federal German industry association of 1,000 east German businesses yielded a multitude of complaints about the banks, who were accused of being too conservative. On the retail side, banks complain that they must pay higher deposit rates than in the west and invest more time and effort in providing advice to customers. Part of this is due to the Sparkassen, which have adapted rapidly and vigorously to capitalism with the help of partnership agreements with institutions in the west, with the result that they have managed to keep a market share of retail business higher than in the old federal states. 'The big western banks thought that they'd have it easy when they came here,' chuckles Krakow at the Leipzig Sparkasse. 'Of course we have lost customers and market share - but not on the scale that other banks were expecting.' The net result is that for many big commercial banks, the investment in the east has been substantial but as yet unprofitable. Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of the Deutsche Bank, said as the bank announced record 1993 profits, the bank has invested DM4bn to date in the east and has yet to make a pfennig of profit. Mindful of the long-term opportunities, Mr Kopper said he was not complaining about this. Difficulties aside, institutions are using the east as a testing ground for new products and services. The best example of this is the Hypo Service-Bank, a subsidiary of the Hypo-Bank which offers just nine basic retail banking products compared with the 60 products on offer at a normal bank branch. As yet, this highly automised concept - designed to cut down on the costs of basic banking services at the same time as increasing the speed and efficiency of customer service - is only on offer in the east. It may be that this model will be copied throughout the western federal states.</p>

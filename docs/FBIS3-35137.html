The sources said that this request came in a message which  an  Algerian envoy, namely presidential court director Mohamed  Sa'idi, delivered to President al-Asad from President Zeroual  last week.    The Syrian sources said that the message dealt with  conditions in Algeria and bilateral relations, and offered  condolences to President al-Asad on the loss of his son, Basil  al-Asad.    The sources expects a summit to be held between President  al-Asad and Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to discuss  regional issues, relations between Iran and some Arab states,  the peace process, and issues of common concern.    However, the sources did not say whether the meeting will be  held in Damascus or Tehran.</p>

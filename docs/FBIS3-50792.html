"It is necessary to  increase the number of security corps and to supply them with  resources that this critical situation demands. I am talking  about transportation units and all other requirements of the  service."    He explained that measures are being taken to control the  possession of weapons. He noted that both legal and illegal  weapons sales have increased at an alarming rate recently and  said that the weapons go to the most densely populated, poorest  areas; that is, to the neighborhoods.    He described weapon control measures and noted that they  must  be part of an ongoing program, just like everything else  involved in security.    The president reported that the National Security and  Defense  Council will be installed this afternoon and that the Rural  Security Council will meet tomorrow to discuss the border  security problem.    Velasquez said the meetings will be attended by governors  from the border states, livestock owners associations, and  officials from the various ministries and offices related to the  livestock sector.    The president stated: "Efforts to make life and work in that  large area more secure are important and cannot be delayed."    Velasquez said Colombia takes very much the same view, and  that is why the Colombian Government has expressed through its  highest authorities its interest in reaching an agreement on the  matter.    Velasquez appeared optimistic. He said that in the next few  weeks Colombian authorities will make reinforcements on their  side of the border a fact.    Regarding life in the poor sectors, the president said he  will hold talks this week to establish the nature of the social  problem, which he is sure the next government will inherit.    He noted: "When one sees a bus loaded with 80 young people  arriving at a court so they can stand trial, one must realize  that the state did not do a thing to help them when they were  children."    The president believes that the situation of poor children  who live in heavily populated areas must be improved.    He added: A program in this regard must be initiated because  repression is useless. He added: The social sector of my  government wants to set the basis for actions to modify public  education.    As an example the president mentioned private organizations,  including religious ones, that do educational work in these  zones and achieve very positive results. Their work is somewhat  different from that of public education.    The president said he wants to propose this reform. He noted  that in Merida State an extraordinary project called integral  education has been implemented. The project was set in motion  by Antonio Luis Cardenas, former rector of the Libertador  Pedagogic School.    He said that this program takes into consideration economic  limitations and the need to guide the young toward learning some  trade capable of furnishing them with a practical tool with  which to face life.    According to the president, the fundamental idea is to start  this program with children and to have morning and afternoon  classes so they have food assistance throughout the day.    Regarding pardons, President Velasquez said he is studying  a new list and will release the names this week. He again asked  those who are still outside the law to return to justice.    In addition, Velasquez said he is working on Colonel Iginio  Castro's return from Quito. Castro is seriously ill. The  defense minister wants to transfer Castro to the Caracas  Military Hospital and take other steps later.    The president recalled that in his salute to the Armed  Forces  and in several statements, he has always asked the leaders and  other persons involved in the coup attempts to legalize their  status.    Velasquez said: I did so in Los Proceres Avenue during the  ceremony to salute the National Armed Forces. I asked the  officers who are in Lima to return and to do so with the  assurance that there is a complete legal state.    Velasquez believes that the time is right because the  grounds  for an agreement have been set with the elected government.    He said: Of course it is the right time, under the country's  current state of law and with the guarantees granted by the  Constitution.    Regarding the situation of some officials under arrest due  to  the notorious El Amparo case [border massacre], he admitted that  pardons are being reviewed and that 12 persons are involved.    In his statements, Ramon J. Velasquez referred to relations  between his government and President-elect Caldera, describing  them as cordial as there has been a flow of information on all  public administration aspects through Julio Sosa Rodriguez, the  liaison.    "He, in turn, has a group of individuals who help coordinate  the transfer of power. For example, there is Nepomuceno Garrido  in the Labor Ministry, Maria de Guzmas in Family, Elba Ruiz in  Education, Jose Ignacio Moreno Leon in Privatization, Roberto  Centeno in Transportation, and Gustavo Rodriguez Amengual in  Environment, to name a few. In the office of the Secretariat of  the Presidency Ministry, we have Andres Caldera, Fernando Egana,  and Fernando Febres Cordero," Velasquez said.    Asked about his meeting with President Caldera, Velasquez  replied that he went to speak about the IVA [value-added tax]  and that the situation has been clarified.    Velasquez stressed that Sosa Rodriguez is satisfied because  modifications made to the first report by Caldera's economic  team were taken into account.    "Thus, as Sosa Rodriguez says, the text that was published  fulfills the suggestions made. There is a 15-percent increase  for luxury items and greater exemptions for basic food basket  items, medical products -- pacemakers, prosthesis and other  items, plus land, maritime, and air transportation," said  Velasquez.    In his first meeting of 1994 with media representatives,  Velasquez sent Venezuelans and all others living in the country  his cordial greetings for the New Year, his good wishes, and his  wish that the country consolidate its march, mainly for social  and political peace, for economic development, for cultural and  scientific advancement, and for the affirmation of traditional  positive Venezuelan values.</p>

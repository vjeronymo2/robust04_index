			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Lloyd's may allow Names to trade syndicate shares Lloyd's of London is considering a radical extension of its reform programme by giving its members the right to trade their shares in syndicates at the insurance market. The initiative, being studied by a team of market professionals and advisers, may also make it easier for Names - the individuals whose assets back the market - to operate with limited liability. A 10-person team, headed by Mr Robert Hiscox, Lloyd's deputy chairman, will examine the scope for introducing a market in syndicate 'participations'. If introduced, Names would have the right to buy, sell or transfer their shares in syndicates which underwrite insurance business. An outline of the team's brief was contained in a letter this week from Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, to colleagues. He said the market might allow existing Names 'to realise value from their current participations'. He added: 'Any market mechanism should provide for complete transparency and also provide some benefit to the society (of Lloyd's) as a whole.' The news signals that Lloyd's is pressing ahead with far-reaching reforms, despite the failure on Monday of its efforts to settle litigation with a Pounds 900m out-of-court offer to more than 20,000 loss-making Names. The fresh push for reform follows the successful launch last year of 12 investment trusts, which own 'corporate Name' subsidiaries. The trusts are trading at the market with limited liability for their losses. The trusts, along with a number of smaller corporate Names, have committed Pounds 800m to the market and account for about a sixth of its Pounds 10.9bn capacity - its ability to accept premium income - for 1994. Mr Rowland said the team, known as the Value Group, would also look at ways of attracting fresh capital and fulfilling commitments made last year to members about 'pre-emption' rights. These would give Names the right to increase their shares of syndicates when managers decide to increase capacity. Funds released through the sale of 'participations' could be used by some Names to help meet their liabilities on syndicates which have years of account left open because of uncertainty over future claims. Lloyd's is hoping to close most of these so-called 'open years' by creating a new reinsurance company, NewCo, into which assets and liabilities relating to all business underwritten before 1986 would be transferred. It is expected that NewCo will be operational by 1996. Other members of the Value Group are Sir Laurie Magnus, a director of corporate finance at Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank which sponsored Lloyd's biggest investment trust, London Insurance Market Investment Trust and Mr Mark Brockbank, a leading underwriter.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=3 --> IV. Annual Audits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> A. The Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional and third-party servicer audits. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 487(c)(1)(A)(i) requires an annual audit of the financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition of the institution in its entirety and an annual audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the institution's compliance with the requirements governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Title IV programs. The institution must make these audits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to cognizant guaranty agencies, eligible lenders, State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, and the State review entities designated under subpart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1 of part H of Title IV of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issues that the community was asked to address and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community's views:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. To what extent, if any, should the annual audit requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be waived or limited? Should this requirement for annual audits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be waived for institutions participating in the Quality Assurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Annual financial audit should be waived in all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances except in the case of new institutions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions undergoing a change in ownership,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions with a cohort default rate in excess of 25  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent for one year, and institutions that did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy all factors of financial responsibility in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their most recent financial statement issued to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department. Furthermore, institutions would be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to submit no more than two consecutive annual audits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before being considered released from the annual audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Annual compliance audit should be waived for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions except in the case of new institutions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions undergoing a change of ownership, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions which have undergone a compliance audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the past three years which resulted in Title IV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities in excess of one percent of Title IV funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disbursed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A further suggestion was made to truncate the audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements if the Secretary continues to require an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual audit. A minority of the group felt that annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audits, both financial and compliance, should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required and not waived. Those institutions that meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality assurance criteria would be required to submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a short form audit on a biannual basis. [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;No further burden should be placed on institutions than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their State already requires or than the IRS requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of them. If someone else wants the audit, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department should be responsible for distributing them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There should be diminishing filing requirements based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon performance evaluation factors and general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longevity of institutions to exempt an institution from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an annual audit. A minority suggested that pledged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets be accepted at some level in lieu of a certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual audit. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The annual audit requirement could be waived in certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas, e.g., the institution could be exempt from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student compliance components but not from a financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit if the institution is in the quality assurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Department should develop a set of guidelines that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would permit exemptions. [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. How should guaranty agencies, lenders, and other parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request audit information from institutions?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An audit correction action plan should be sent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranty agencies and lenders. Requests should be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> writing with explanations of why the request is made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Freedom of Information Act procedures could be used. Requests should be made to the appropriate official on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> campus. Information may not be given to any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party without the approval of the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Requests should be in writing to the Chief Executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. A minority of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the group believed that all requests should be made in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> writing to the Chief Financial Officer only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Institutions should be notified of any requests for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information and when information is released to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate agencies. The information should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> released only to the parties already listed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Information should be provided to guaranty agencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lenders, and other parties upon request. [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. In matters not governed by specific provisions, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 487(c)(1)(B) provides for the establishment of standards of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility and administrative capability that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include any matter the Secretary deems necessary for the sound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of the financial aid programs (such as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertinent actions of any owner, shareholder, or person exercising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control over an eligible institution.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

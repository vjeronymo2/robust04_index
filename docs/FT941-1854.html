			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Worldwide accounting standard moves closer International accounting standards-setters are to work with their US counterparts to develop the reporting of earnings per share. The US plans to move away from its current disclosure of primary earnings per share towards the international emphasis on the disclosure of basic earnings. The International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) said it expected to issue an exposure draft standard later this year, which would lead to a final standard in 1995. The US Financial Accounting Standards Board plans a similar timetable. The move represents a shift towards greater co-operation as standards-setters attempt to harmonise financial reporting around the world. It comes as the IASC is pressing for wholescale ratification of its standards by Iosco, the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, which could lead to companies using IASC standards gaining quotations in stock exchanges. A number of the national accounting standards-setting bodies, including those in the UK, Canada, US and Australia, are beginning to develop projects jointly.</p>

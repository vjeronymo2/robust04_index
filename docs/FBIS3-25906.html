			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Zhang Chaojin (1728 6389 6855) and </F> reporter Jia Yong (6328 3057)]    [Text] Beijing, 18 Jan (XINHUA) -- Structural changes have  taken place among cadres of the People's Liberation Army [PLA].  Professional technical cadres composed mainly of scientific and  technological personnel account for more than half of the total  cadres, thus becoming an important force in the Army's  modernization.    To educate and cultivate a large number of both  socialist-minded and professionally proficient  scientific-technical cadres is a strategic decision made by the  Central Military Commission [CMC] under the new period of reform  and opening up. The whole Army conscientiously carries out  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's belief -- that "science and technology  are the primary productive forces" -- and makes great efforts to  build a well-coordinated and rationally structured contingent of  scientific-technical cadres who have high political awareness,  are professionally competent, and possess a good work style. At  present, tens of thousands of scientific-technical cadres hold  high-level posts in charge of specialized technologies across  the whole Army. A dozen of them have been elected academicians  of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and more than 5,000 cadres  enjoy special allowances from the government. The entire Army  attaches importance to cultivating middle-aged and young  scientific-technical cadres. Thus far, more than 200  middle-aged and young experts have made outstanding state-level  contributions. Of them, the youngest professor is only 28 years  old. In our Army, senior experts with outstanding achievements  and middle-aged and young experts with marked contributions  represent separately the highest or first-class level that our  country has reached in certain scientific areas. We have taken  the lead in the world in scoring some research results in weapon  tests, satellite launching, engineering technology, basic  medical science, and superlarge computer development. Hundreds  of scientific-technical personnel in our Army have been elected  members, directors, or executive chairmen of authoritative  academic organizations at home and abroad.    Following the development of the contingent of scientists  and  technicians, our Army established and perfected policies and  regulations on managing professional technical cadres to  gradually institutionalize and regularize this contingent. The  CMC and the PLA headquarters successively promulgated seven sets  of regulations for managing professional cadres -- regulations  concerning the examination and appointment of professional  technical cadres, grade adjustments, grades for civilian  employees, and promotions and awards for cadres who have made  remarkable contributions. They also made stipulations  concerning the political treatment and pay for professional  technical cadres. All major units have also taken new measures  to encourage scientific-technical personnel. These effective  regulations and measures have aroused the enthusiasm of the  broad masses of scientific-technical cadres to contribute their  wisdom and talents to the modernization of national defense. In  recent years, the entire Army has won nearly 10,000 state and  military science and technology achievements awards. Many of  these achievements have reached advanced international levels or  have filled the gap in the fields of science and technology at  home.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Wet weather helps Ransomes return to the black with Pounds 2m RANSOMES, the mowing machinery manufacturer, returned to the black in the six months to June 30 but again passed its interim dividend. The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.01m, compared with losses of Pounds 767,000. Sales rose to Pounds 79.8m (Pounds 76.8m) and operating profit increased by 42 per cent to Pounds 6.41m (Pounds 4.53m). Mr Bob Dodsworth, chief executive, said the Pounds 2.3m cost of the preference dividend and the continuing worldwide recession meant that the group still could not afford to pay an ordinary dividend. 'We have turned the corner on the first half and July and August were better than last year. But we still have a long way to go.' Wetter weather in Europe helped consumer grass machinery to increase operating profits to Pounds 2.01m (Pounds 614,000). 'The last three years were very dry' said Mr Dodsworth. 'This year people have had to cut their grass.' Commercial grass machinery and industrial vehicles lifted operating profits from Pounds 3.52m to Pounds 3.98m reflecting a reduction in the workforce and tighter cost controls. Another 80 jobs were shed across the group bringing the total below 2,000. Small property disposals enabled the property division to increase operating profits from Pounds 397,000 to Pounds 423,000. Cost cutting and currency exchange movements helped reduce borrowings by Pounds 16m to Pounds 73m, representing gearing of 190 per cent. Mr Dodsworth said difficulties in exporting to the US and stiff US competition arising from the weak dollar more than offset advantages of exporting from US businesses. Fully diluted earnings per share of 1.4p compared with losses of 1.6p.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Scottish airline to shed 250 jobs Loganair, the airline, is shedding 250 jobs in a shake-up of services. It is to concentrate on 'lifeline' services to the Scottish Highlands and Islands, handing over other services from Glasgow, Edinburgh and Manchester to its sister company, Manx Airlines. The two companies form part of Airlines of Britain Holdings. Loganair, which employs 560 people, said about 80 of the affected employees would be transferred to Manx, resulting in a net cut of about 170 jobs. All services operated by the two airlines would be retained.</p>

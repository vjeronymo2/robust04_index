			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S SPEECH ON U.S. GOALS IN MIDDLE EAST  </P> <P> Listening to the addresses of President Bush and of the Democratic Party right  after, I was angered by the similarity and at the lack of alternative thinking  that the major political parties engage in. I believe the world situation is  not being presented with any clarity.  </P> <P> For instance, our moral position in the Persian Gulf is a joke. In recent  memory, we have invaded small nations in our own hemisphere in violation of  international law. The U.S. faces up to aggression only when it is in the  economic interests of our capital-gains-taking ruling class.  </P> <P> Why did neither political party make any mention of solar energy as a viable  alternative? Some say it is not economically feasible. But is our massive troop  deployment economically feasible? Is the savings and loan bailout sound  economic policy? Is subsidizing the nuclear power industry, which has proved  unprofitable, cost effective? When will we realize that capital gains tax  breaks and subsidies to big companies amount to the public giving the wealthy  more wealth -- a welfare check to industry.  </P> <P> KESHAV KAMATH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Heritage taxed to extinction Sir, Antony Thorncroft's article, 'Houghton Hall plans winter sale', (September 10/11) underscores the mutually exclusive ends of the Treasury and the Department of National Heritage: taxing the aristocratic domains to near extinction while seeking to preserve the heritage of the nation. With little revenue and contents sold, maintenance costs coupled with unbridled taxation should surely end the greatness of any country house.

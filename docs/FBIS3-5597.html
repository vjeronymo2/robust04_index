The United States has reintroduced  its so-called Super 301 policy where it can double tariffs on  some commodities in a bid to get Japan to open its markets.  Speaking in Perth, Mr. Keating urged the two parties to allow  the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, APEC, to resolve  the dispute. The prime minister says Canberra is concerned that  America's action will harm Australia's relationship with Japan.    [Begin Keating recording] It is the heavy-handed  sledgehammer  number to crack the nut. Now, we think that is going to lead to  a lot of bilateral trade tensions and that is why, I think, that  we see the body which I was involved in last year in  establishing at the head of government level -- this is the  APEC, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation -- this trade argument  between the United States and Japan is a sitter for resolution  within the APEC framework.

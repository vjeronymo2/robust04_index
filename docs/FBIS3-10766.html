In an interview with the Radio Caracol  network, due to the insistence of the EL TIEMPO newspaper that  such a meeting took place, the Cuban diplomat stated that they  are being fooled by someone interested in destroying the  excellent relations between the two countries. Those accusations  were also denied by the Colombian Government and the minister of  defense, as well as by several of the participants in a  solidarity meeting held in Havana in January.    The Communist Party of Colombia, as an organization that  participated in the forum that was held in Havana, issued a  statement saying that any attempt to distort the nature of the  Latin American meeting was an effort to reaffirm the infamous  U.S. blockade against Cuba. The note also stated that efforts  are being made to block the sale of oil to Cuba, a transaction  that was recently approved by the Colombian Government and  condemned by recalcitrant minority groups of Cuban emigres in  Miami.</p>

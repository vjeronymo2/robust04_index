			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Sport: Sampras replaces Courier as king of the courts - Tennis YOU MAY not even have noticed, but last Sunday in Hong Kong, Pete Sampras beat Jim Courier 6-3 6-7 7-6 in the final of the Salem Open. Nothing special about that, you might think. But it was a poignant moment in the careers of both young Americans. Nine days earlier, in Tokyo, 21-year-old Sampras had won his quarter-final against another American, David Wheaton, to displace Courier as the No. 1 ranked player in the world. He is the 11th man to reach that pinnacle since the computer rankings were introduced in 1973. The Hong Kong victory therefore clearly stated: 'The king is dead; long live the king.' Ironically, it was Courier's accession to the throne in February 1992 that sparked the ambition in Sampras to emulate him. 'Seeing Jim at No. 1 sets a goal for me,' he said at the time. 'I believe it's something I can do, too. It's a matter of staying healthy and playing consistently.' Yet, even with the help of his new coach Tim Gullickson, Sampras could not find that elusive consistency last year, especially in the Grand Slam Championships. Although he won five tournaments he ended 1992 ranked third after losing in the final of the US Open to Stefan Edberg, the semi-finals at Wimbledon and the quarter-finals in Paris. This year Sampras could hardly have been more consistent. He has already captured four titles, starting with the outdoor event in Sydney last January. That was a prelude to his semi-final finish at the Australian Open. Even his physical frailties seem to be under control. During his winning run in Key Biscayne last month he told me that he was taking pain killers for the shin splints that have troubled him since 1990 when, at 19 years and 28 days, he became the youngest ever winner of the US Open. 'I don't like it but at least it means I can compete. Anyway I shall have two weeks off to rest them before I have to play in Tokyo, it should be enough.' As the world now knows, it was indeed enough. Too much for Courier. These two have been friends and rivals since their junior days. As young professionals they were room-mates at the Nick Bollettieri Academy in Florida where Agassi was also in residence. They won their first important title together - the 1989 Italian Open doubles in Rome. When I first saw him, Pete had just embarked upon his professional career. It was at Palm Springs in 1988. In those days he was a shy, gangling 16-year-old, all arms and legs, with smooth, effortless strokes but not much idea how to use them. To all of us it was apparent that here was a player with limitless potential. He beat the graceful Indian Ramesh Krishnan in the first round, saving three match points in the process. That was a good sign. Then he upset a man who had taught him much about match play at the Rancho Palos Verdes Club outside Los Angeles where they were both members. Eliot Teltscher was less than pleased at being beaten in straight sets. 'I always knew the kid was going to be good,' he said. 'But I didn't think it was going to happen so soon.' Nor did anyone else. Sampras did not have a spectacular junior career. Although he could always beat the local opposition he could not make an impact nationally. Courier, Agassi or Michael Chang always seemed to be in the way. 'I couldn't serve and I had no real idea of how to volley,' he recalls. 'I was just trying to play the way all the kids played - counter-punching from the baseline. I realised I would have to do something about my game.' unofficial (and unpaid) coach for some years. Together they decided that if he was to make progress and become a volleyer, Pete would have to forsake his double-handed backhand. Stefan Edberg had made a similar change at the suggestion of Percy Rosberg, who had been Bjorn Borg's first coach. Wisely Rosberg had left Borg with his effective two-hander but had changed Edberg because he had recognised Stefan's ability as a volleyer. It was the same with Sampras. But the change was painful. 'After six months of hitting the fence and losing my temper a few started to go in. It was a great relief]' he says. Ever since, more and more have been going in. Nowadays Sampras has the most complete game of all the leading men. His serve, fired at around 130 mph, has become Lethal Weapon 4, his groundstrokes, taken on the rise and hit flat and fast are as penetrating as any, and his volleys are punched firmly or caressed with sweet touch, according to the situation. So what sort of man is the new world No. 1? In a word: confident. That had always been the missing ingredient. Following his unexpected success at the 1990 US Open there followed two years of growing into the position. Pete's girlfriend De-Laina Mulcahy, a law graduate, has had a positive influence on the process. The benefit was clear in Key Biscayne. The mature way Sampras dealt with some of the most testing playing conditions I have seen was a revelation. A year ago he would not have coped. So far this year Sampras has served 366 aces, over 100 more than his nearest challenger Michael Stich, even though he has got in less than 64 per cent of his first serves in. As Ivan Lendl used to say, it is not the percentage that matters but the moment. Sampras also leads the field on first serve points won (81 per cent), service games won (91 per cent) and break points saved (72 per cent). This superiority on serve gives him the freedom to go for his returns and gain enough breaks to win his matches. The killer streak, essential to success, has become more obvious as Pete has added confidence to his greater physical strength. He is now the perfectly proportioned athlete, strong, fit and fast. Yet, beneath the hard exterior is the same gentle individual. When he won Dollars 2m at the Compaq Grand Slam Cup in 1990 he gave Dollars 50,000 towards research into cerebral palsy which had claimed an uncle. Hardly surprising, this, from a man whose hero as a youth was the greatest of them all, Australia's double Grand Slam winner, Rod Laver who was the epitome of sportsmanship and athletic chivalry. Watching tapes of the great man's matches was part of Pete's training routine. If he goes on developing (and, as he readily admits, there is room for improvement), tapes of Pete Sampras's matches will become required study for today's embryonic champions.</p>

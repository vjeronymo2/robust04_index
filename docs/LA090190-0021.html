			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DUFFY HALTS SHERIFF CANDIDATES' VISITS  </P> <P> San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy, responding to what he says are  "appearances of political pressure or solicitation" by sheriff's candidates  Jack Drown and Jim Roache, has banned both men from "pop-in" visits to areas of  the department in which they don't normally work.  </P> <P> Although he sent a warning letter to both men, Duffy said in an interview  Friday that he had received complaints only about Roache. About half a dozen  people complained to him directly, Duffy said, and several other protests came  through the Deputy Sheriff's Assn., the organized law enforcement group to  which most deputies and officers belong.  </P> <P> "I could have directed my letter just to Roache," Duffy said. "He was bothering  deputies on duty on his day off. He had no reason to be where he was. That's  against county regulations. There's no reason for those men on duty to know Jim  Roache."  </P> <P> Drown, an assistant sheriff, has been on leave since late July and Roache, a  sheriff's captain, goes on leave next week. Both won't return before November's  election. Therefore, Duffy said, neither man should have any reason to show up  to any jail, department or substation unless it's where they work.  </P> <P> Duffy has vocally supported Drown in the race. During the June primary,  however, Roache gathered 32% of the vote and Drown 28%.  </P> <P> In his letter, Duffy said he objects to any surprise visits that don't have to  do with a candidate's job duties.  </P> <P> "What I am prohibiting is on-duty or off-duty 'pop-in' visits at sheriff's  facilities where employees can even perceive that the purpose of such a visit  is in connection with your political campaign," the Aug. 28 letter says. "Your  campaigns should be no more of a daily distraction to our employees than is  already necessary."  </P> <P> Roache said Friday he has appeared at three jail locations in the past two  months, including a visit to the County Jail downtown three Saturdays ago.  </P> <P> "I was downtown anyway and had an hour to kill, so I went in and said hello,"  he said. "I was not campaigning. I have to be conversant on the jail situation  during the campaign, so that's why I'm making visits. It's not to get votes."  </P> <P> Roache said he does not object to Duffy's letter, which has been posted in many  department locations, but had hoped to visit a new jail location in Otay Mesa.  He said he probably would ask for a tour.  </P> <P> Since he announced himself a candidate, Roache said he has been "cut out of the  official loop" of correspondence that others see on the jail situation. "I'm a  member of this department, and the jails are a crucial issue," he said. "How am  I supposed to know what's going on?"  </P> <P> But Duffy said he will see to it that Roache and Drown are cut off from outside  visits.  </P> <P> "They're both on leave," he said. "Neither has business in any facility."  </P> <P> Drown agrees. He said he has not visited any area of the department except his  office three or four times.  </P> <P> Besides, Drown said, he already has nearly everyone's support in the Sheriff's  Department and does not need to campaign there.  </P> <P> "I don't have to go out there and shake hands," he said. "But Jim's been  showing up at places where he hasn't been seen in years."  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Drown released a survey of 474 members of the Deputy  Sheriff's Assn. that showed 414 votes for Drown and 11 for Roache. The  remaining votes were split among other candidates at the time or had no  endorsement.  </P> <P> Duffy said in the letter that he is distributing copies of the letter to a  number of Sheriff's Department locations.  </P> <P> The department has not had to grapple with the issue of two department  employees running against each other since 1970, when Duffy, then the captain  of the County Jail downtown, defeated Chief Deputy Sheriff Warren Kanagy to  replace a retiring sheriff.  </P> <P> Duffy has retained his office for 20 years, a period in which it was illegal  for any staff members to run against an incumbent sheriff. Roache won a court  battle earlier this year that overturned that policy.  </P></p>

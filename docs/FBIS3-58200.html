			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Gerd Brueggemann: "Search for Orientation"] </F>   [Text] When U.S. President Bill Clinton begins his first  foreign policy trip to Europe -- almost one year after he came  to office -- the course of his stopovers is clear: the NATO  summit in Brussels, Boris Yeltsin in Moscow, and Prague, where  he is scheduled to meet the heads of state and government of  Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. Unfortunately, the  political course that the President intends to pursue is not as  obvious.    A few days before Air Force One starts the flight across the  Atlantic, hectic activities can be observed in Washington,  which, in numerous background talks, is trying to give the  impression that the various and often disparate elements of U.S.  European policy all serve one purpose -- to imbue new contents  to the alliance after the end of the Cold War, encourage the  reform policy in the countries of the former East Bloc, and open  to them the paths to the community of Western states. For this  purpose, the White House devised a plan intended to concentrate  the conflicting interests in Europe under the name of  "Partnership for Peace."    The "partnership" is intended to facilitate cooperation  between the former Warsaw Pact members and NATO without  extending to them the alliance's security guarantee. In Warsaw,  Budapest, and Prague, it was, thus, described as a plan whose  most important task is to deny them speedy membership, not least  to enable Clinton to assure the Russian president that NATO was  not intending to isolate Russia. Clinton said that "we want to  avoid the impression that we are creating a new dividing line in  Europe after having worked for decades to eliminate the old one."    Such arguments can also be heard in a similar form from  Moscow. It is no coincidence. The congruence makes it clear  that the Clinton administration is obviously determined to  concede the highest priority to promoting the democratic  developments in Russia in its European policy -- also out of  security considerations. The Americans believe that accepting  the three former communist countries into NATO would threaten  the Russian reform process. It was particularly Polish  President Lech Walesa who strongly warned against such a view.  It might rather contribute to destabilize the situation in his  country and in the other young democracies and to expose them to  Russian pressure for hegemony. Yet, Clinton obviously thinks  that this risk is acceptable and intends to elaborate on his  position during his meeting with the politicians of these  countries in Prague, a position which, he said, was  "misunderstood" in East Europe.    The American position is biased in favor of Russia without  an  appropriate counterweight. Many of its critics at home,  including, among others, Robert Zoellick, who served as  undersecretary in the State Department in the Bush  administration, are convinced that the persuasiveness and the  credibility of this policy would be greater even vis-a-vis  Moscow if the "Partnership for Peace" plan were to contain a set  of firm criteria and a schedule for accepting new members to  NATO instead of a rather vague offer for cooperation.    At the moment, America's economic policy toward the former  Soviet empire appears similarly unbalanced and leaning toward  Russia. While, after the collapse of the communist-controlled  economies, there was wide agreement among Western governments  that only a resolute implementation of reforms based on the  market economy could create the basis for economic recovery,  Washington recently expressed its doubts about whether such a  policy is correct. Under the impact of the result of the  Russian election of December, which brought considerable gains  to antireform forces, Clinton's leading Russia strategist,  Strobe Talbott, announced the necessity of a slower reform pace  to undermine the basis for the demagogic arguments of the  reactionary forces.    Talbott, who has since been nominated by Clinton as deputy  secretary of state, said that the "shock therapy," which has so  far been pursued, has proved a failure; more therapy and less  shock will be necessary in the future. One may now well discuss  whether the policy that has so far been applied was applied in  the right doses, but the assumption that the pace of reform was  too high puts the actual facts upside down. The White House has  obviously also realized that and initiated attempts for a  retreat. One spokesman said that Talbott was misinterpreted,  but he failed to deliver the appropriate interpretation.    What remains is the impression of a certain confusion in  America's East European policy. Out of fear of a setback for  the democratic development in Russia, it evades to orient itself  by clear principles and, instead, is guided by the short-term  aspects of day-to-day politics.</p>

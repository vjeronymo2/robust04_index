			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Union sells Sabre for Pounds 8.4m Union, the discount house, is selling Sabre, its sales aid leasing division to GE Capital, the financial services side of General Electric of the US, for Pounds 8.4m cash. The move marks the conclusion of Union's withdrawal from sales aid leasing. Payment of Pounds 2.7m is deferred for three years. The sale will release Pounds 30m of inter-company funding used to finance Sabre and generate profits of about Pounds 1.5m. Sabre was acquired in 1988 and provides sales aid finance on small ticket items such as office equipment. For the 1993 year it achieved profits before tax - and Pounds 1.1m of group management costs - of Pounds 3.68m, against losses of Pounds 3.26m, on turnover of Pounds 14m (Pounds 19.6m). The results were helped by lower debt provisions of Pounds 1.37m, compared with Pounds 5.73m. Net asset value at completion is expected to be about Pounds 3.6m. Union said that Sabre had been restrained from writing as much new business as it would have liked by the fall in the group's capital base in 1991-92. That had resulted in an ageing portfolio. If it had remained in the group, Sabre's growth and profitability would have been constrained for the foreseeable future.</p>

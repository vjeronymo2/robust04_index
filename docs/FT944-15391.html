			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: Italian industrial output surges Italian industrial production surged during the normally static month of August, rising 16 per cent on the same period in 1993. However, the August figures are not considered truly comparative because of the adoption of more staggered holiday closures by factories during the summer holidays this year. The rise in industrial production lifted the increase in the first eight months to 3.7 per cent over the same period last year, according to Istat, the national statistics institute. The most spectacular increase has been the 145 per cent jump in car production over 1993, reversing the decline that set in three years ago. Other sectors growing fast are electrical goods (up 41 per cent), shoe manufacture (up 36 per cent) and plastics (up 34 per cent). Poland's industrial output (unadjusted) rose 3.5 per cent in September and was 16.7 per cent higher than in September 1993, the central statistical office said. Switzerland recorded a trade surplus of SFr169.1m (Pounds 84.5m) in September after a revised deficit of SFr288.7m in August, the federal customs office said. Finnish industry's producer price index rose 0.2 per cent month-on-month in September and the year-on-year rise was 2.1 per cent, Statistics Finland said.</p>

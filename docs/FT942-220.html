			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Senate vote blocks move to streamline product liability Sweeping changes in US product liability law, which would have curbed consumers' rights, foundered in the Senate yesterday when the bill's supporters failed to break a filibuster. The Product Liability Act was meant to set a national standard for the treatment of lawsuits against manufacturers of products that have injured or killed consumers, in place of the existing patchwork of state laws. Its backers, led by Democratic Senator John D. Rockefeller, argued that changes were vital to streamline the system, and prevent some of the arbitrary or excessive awards against companies which, they claim, are made under state law. Fear of liability lawsuits was also damaging US competitiveness by inhibiting product innovation, they argued. Opponents included a wide range of consumer, women's and union groups, which fought a tough campaign against the bill. Its supporters yesterday fell three short of the 60 Senate votes needed to halt debate on the issue, effectively killing the bill for this year. The bill sought to: promote non-trial alternatives to resolve liability disputes, such as non-binding arbitration; eliminate company liability for injuries caused by defective workplace equipment more than 25 years old; end the rule of joint and several responsibility whereby a victim of a dangerous product may be able at present to seek full redress against, for example, a manufacturer and its parts supplier; provide an absolute protection against punitive damages for manufacturers of government-approved drugs and medical devices.</p>

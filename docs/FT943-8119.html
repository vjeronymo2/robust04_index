			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Kok completes Dutch cabinet The Dutch Labour party leader, Mr Wim Kok, yesterday finished choosing his cabinet, clearing the way for Queen Beatrix to swear in the new government on Monday. The new foreign minister will be Mr Hans van Mierlo, leader of the left-leaning D66 party, one of three parties in the new coalition. Mr van Mierlo, who helped found the reformist D66 in 1966, served briefly as defence minister in a short-lived coalition with the Labour party and the Christian Democrats in 1981. Mr Gerrit Zalm, the prospective finance minister, is a member of the right-wing Liberals, the third party in the coalition, and is the head of the semi-autonomous Central Planning Office. He has also been a senior civil servant at the finance and economic affairs ministries. Mr Kok's new government, which is committed to increasing employment and changing elements of the country's generous welfare system, ends more than three months of political uncertainty since May's inconclusive general election. The cabinet is unusual because it brings together three parties that have never governed in the same coalition before and because its two main components, Labour and the Liberals, have traditionally clashed on incomes policy. This difference of opinion could cause tension in future. However, the coalition has already cleared one hurdle by agreeing on the broad outlines of the 1995 budget, due to be presented to parliament on September 20. The budget talks were part of the long and detailed coalition negotiations conducted over recent weeks by Mr Kok, who was finance minister in the outgoing cabinet. His government programme is a careful compromise between the wishes of the Labour and Liberal parties. He has managed to avoid cutting the level of unemployment and disability benefits, yet he has also committed himself to making spending cuts of Fl 18bn (Pounds 6.67bn) over the next four years in such controversial areas as health and education. Labour, which had been the junior partner to the Christian Democrats in the outgoing centre-left government, saw a sharp drop in support in the May poll, partly because of its agreement to previous welfare changes, but it narrowly emerged as the biggest party overall. The Christian Democrats suffered a historic defeat and now face being relegated to the opposition for the first time since universal suffrage began in the Netherlands in 1917. It is still trying to find a replacement for Mr Elco Brinkman, who resigned on Tuesday as leader of the party in parliament. Mr Brinkman is held responsible for the party's electoral defeat, which was also caused partly by the decision of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the veteran prime minister and Christian Democrat politician, to retire from national politics.</p>

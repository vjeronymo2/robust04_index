			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Perot adviser resigns from campaign A SENIOR campaign adviser to Mr Ross Perot abruptly resigned last night, dealing an apparently severe blow to the Texas billionaire's plans to put himself forward as an independent US presidential candidate. Mr Ed Rollins, who guided the victorious Republican campaign of Mr Ronald Reagan in 1984, said there were 'differences over the future conduct of the campaign'. He said his departure was 'a mutual decision' and that 'the kind of campaign I wanted to run and Mr Perot wanted to run were not really compatible'. He added that if he had continued, 'the anger and frustration would only have gotten worse'. Day-to-day operations of the Perot camp will be left in the hands of Mr Tom Luce, a long-time associate, and Mr Hamilton Jordan, who only 24 hours ago denied that he, too, was on the verge of resignation because Mr Perot was ignoring his advice. The next two weeks are expected to be critical for Mr Perot. If he is unable to reverse his slide in the polls or dispel the growing perception that his autocratic tendencies are not compatible with politics, his populist bid for the White House may soon be over. He has always said he would only run if his name was registered on the ballot in all 50 states, a process at present barely half complete. If this faltered, he would be provided with a ready-made excuse for withdrawal. Mr Perot's recruitment on June 4 of Mr Rollins and Mr Jordan, the Democratic campaign manager for Mr Jimmy Carter in 1976 and 1980, was considered a coup, providing a degree of political sophistication previously lacking. But Mr Perot's popularity has started dropping. Two weeks ago, he led both President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate, in the polls. Last night, though, a poll from ABC News and the Washington Post showed Mr Clinton in a 17-point lead over Mr Bush, transformed from a five-point deficit only a week ago. The governor's support was 45 points among 'likely voters' in the survey, completed on Tuesday. Mr Bush was on 28 per cent, Mr Perot down to 20 per cent. The Texan independent has been beset by controversy over some of his public statements and criticism for the lack of specifity behind his ideas. Both Mr Rollins and Mr Jordan were known to be upset when Mr Perot decided not to use the services of Mr Hal Riney, an experienced advertising consultant. As Mr Rollins conceded last night, this was a symbol for a deeper strategic unease with Mr Perot seemingly unwilling or unable to move into a different gear. Many leading Democrats do not want Mr Perot to withdraw at this stage, as Mr Clinton has benefited politically from the animosity between Mr Perot and President Bush. Taking centre stage, Page 6</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada eases barley controls THE ACCELERATING liberalisation of the North American grains trade has been underlined by a Canadian Wheat Board decision to loosen its hold on domestic barley sales and exports to the US. The move reinforces other measures over the past four years that have eased trade controls and contributed to a big rise in grain trade between the US, Canada and Mexico. The barriers will come down further under the North American trade agreement, which is due to be take effect next January. Under Nafta, Mexico has agreed to replace import permits on wheat with moderate tariffs. The Mexican wheat market has been opened significantly to US and Canadian exporters over the past year by channelling imports through the private sector rather than the now-disbanded government procurement agency. Canadian farmers can in future choose between selling barley through the Wheat Board or through private traders. In addition, curbs on imports of US barley and barley products will be lifted on Aug 1. Mr Michael Wilson, Canada's trade minister, said the new rules would create 'a true continental market for feed and malting barley which will benefit farmers on both sides of the border'. According to a recent consultant's report, the changes will lift Canadian barley producers' revenue by about 17 per cent. Critics of the new policy are concerned, however, that it could further weaken the authority of the Wheat Board and increase pressure for the board to give up its monopoly on wheat sales. Thanks in part to the removal of import permits in 1991 under the US-Canada free trade agreement, the US has become Canada's second biggest market for durum wheat, used for pasta. Exports to the US soared to 276,000 tonnes, equal to about a quarter of the US durum market, from the start of the present season last August to mid-March, compared to 202,000 tonnes in the same period last year and virtually zero in 1990. Meanwhile, US shipments of pasta to Canada have jumped seven-fold. The Wheat Board relinquished control over oats exports in 1989 at virtually the same time as bilateral import curbs were dropped. In addition, almost all Canada's flour mills have either been bought by or folded into joint ventures with US companies. According to Agriculture Canada, flour exports to the US reached 51,000 tonnes in the first seven months of this season, more than double the average in the 1980s.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Gatt chief ready for caretaker WTO role With the contest for the top job at the future World Trade Organisation effectively deadlocked, Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is believed to be ready to stay on in a caretaker role until his term ends next July. Mr Sutherland announced last April he would not be a candidate for director-general of the WTO, which is supposed to begin work on January 1. But it now looks increasingly unlikely that a decision on his successor will be made by early December, when Gatt members are due to endorse the appointment, making it virtually impossible for the new director-general to take up the WTO reins in January. Though no formal proposal to stay on has yet been made to Mr Sutherland, it is under active discussion by trade diplomats anxious to assure a smooth transition from Gatt to the more powerful WTO. However, some officials are still hopeful that the decision on the choice of WTO chief can still be made by next month. A third round of consultations among Gatt members on the WTO appointment is taking place in Geneva this week. Trade officials said yesterday they expected the outcome to be a continued three-way split on regional lines between Mr Renato Ruggiero, the EU candidate, Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the outgoing Mexican president who has US and Latin American backing, and Mr Kim Chul-su of South Korea who has Asian support. Though Mr Ruggiero is ahead numerically, the eventual decision must be made by consensus. Delays in ratifying the WTO and the associated Uruguay Round global trade accords, the continued stalemate over the next OECD secretary-general and the lack of engagement of the US in the WTO race are all seen as obstacles to consensus. To these must now be added the uncertainty over the outcome of the Uruguay Round vote by the US Congress in three weeks' time. A rejection by Congress would certainly kill the WTO which could not operate effectively without the participation of the world's biggest trader. Only 30-odd countries among Gatt's 124 members have so far ratified the world trade pact, and they do not include any of the Quad group of leading traders - the US, the EU, Japan and Canada. Most have been awaiting the US decision. The mid-term elections and the impending Uruguay Round vote have also kept the US out of the active big-power horsetrading that will be a necessary ingredient of an eventual deal. Though strongly denied by the US and EU, many trade diplomats believe there is also a trade-off between the WTO leadership and the long delayed decision on who should run the OECD in Paris. If, as the US and Canada are demanding, the OECD job goes to a non-European, this could boost Mr Ruggiero's WTO chances. Congress and Gatt, Page 6</p>

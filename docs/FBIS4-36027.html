			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Simultaneous with the fifth anniversary of the  demise of His Eminence Imam Khomeyni, may he be admitted to  God's paradise, the religious and political rites of the Friday  prayers were staged today in Tehran under the leadership of  Ayatollah Yazdi in the presence of the mourning masses.    Addressing the congregation, which embraced a large group of  mourners and pilgrims from various parts of the country and the  world to the blessed shrine of His Eminence Imam Khomeyni,  Ayatollah Yazdi said that taking part in ceremonies marking the  anniversary of the Imam's demise has become an Islamic ritual.  [passage omitted]    The acting Friday prayer leader of Tehran referred to the  recent guidelines of his eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the  leader of the Islamic revolution, which stated that the nation,  the government, and the country's officials should refrain from  doing things which could serve to inspire hope among the  enemies.    Ayatollah Yazdi urged the nation to pay careful attention to  these guidelines, and said: Those who speak in certain forums  and gatherings in a very unfair way and away from the norm of  constructive criticism, and tend to deny all the achievements of  the Islamic revolution and overlook all the great tasks which  have been accomplished since the victory of the Islamic  revolution -- in particular during the era of reconstruction --  are in fact creating a gap in the ranks of the nation, thereby  undermining the nation's unity and enabling the enemy to exert  its influence.    Ayatollah Yazdi then condemned the slogan of separation of  religion from politics and, calling on the clergy and all the  strata of the nation, said: We must move in such a way that our  policy remains identical to our religion.    Furthermore, he condemned the Zionist regime's kidnapping of  Mustafa al-Dirani, the head of the Believers' Resistance  Movement of Lebanon, as well as Israel's air attack on the  Ba'lbek area in southern Lebanon. He considered these acts to  be a blatant violation of international norms and conventions  concerning the territorial integrity and independence of a  country. He, moreover, condemned the silence of international  forums toward these crimes, and said: These acts of the Zionist  regime show that until the people of the occupied territories  return to their homeland, and until Israel is completely  destroyed, the Mideast region cannot hope to witness peace and  tranquillity.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has said that the sons of  Palestine would always remain in the heart and that they are  worthy of appreciation and respect, especially those who adhere  to their land and remain steadfast on it. We have no ambition,  aim, or purpose other than the return of right to its people and  owners on their national soil and the achievement of a  comprehensive and just peace, which future generations can  accept, safeguard, and defend in an honorable and secure life.    His majesty added: We in Jordan are one family of various  origins and are cohesive in the homeland of the free people.  Man is valued by the sacrifices he has offered and will offer  in the future by confronting the challenges and carrying out the  national duty.    His majesty also stressed that Jerusalem and the holy  shrines  would remain in our conscience and that we will continue to work  so that they will be for us all with God's sovereignty  prevailing and so that these holy lands become a source of  enlightenment, as they used to be in the past.    His majesty's statements came when he received at the Royal  Hashemite Court today a delegation from the Arabs of Nazareth,  Akko, Galilee, the Triangle, and the Negev, who came to Jordan  to extend condolences to his majesty and the honorable Hashemite  family on the death of Queen Mother Zayn al-Sharaf, beseeching  Almighty God to have mercy on her soul, grant her paradise, and  inspire patience to his majesty and the honorable Hashemite  family.</p>

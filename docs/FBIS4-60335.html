			<p>BFN     [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said that  during his stay in the United States he will hold talks at  various levels on political issues, foreign affairs, economic  matters and national security. Talking to APP in London prior  to his departure for the United States, he said that he will  also exchange views with IMF authorities and hold talks with  officials of Congress and Senate committees.    The president refuted the impression that Pakistan-U.S.  relations have suffered any jolt. He said that Pakistan's  relations with the United States are not limited to only one  dimension; rather, they are wide-ranging. The president said  that some people view these relations only in the context of  nuclear nonproliferation, which is not a correct approach.  Pakistan has categorically said in this regard that on  principle it favors restrictions on nuclear weapons, and to say  that Pakistan should do this and India should not do this is not  acceptable to Pakistan. The president was seen off at Heathrow  Airport by a representative of the Queen of England, acting  Pakistani High Commissioner (Naim Jan Naim), high commission  officials, and Pakistani residents. Later, the president  arrived in Rochester, beginning his private visit to the United  States. He was received at the airport by Pakistani Ambassador  Dr. Maliha Lodhi, senior officials of the Pakistani Embassy, and  Pakistanis residing in the city. During this stay, the  president will be given an honorary LLD degree by University of  Rochester. The president will leave for Washington on 23 May,  where he will have a very busy time and hold some important  meetings.</p>

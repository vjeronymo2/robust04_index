			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cuban Government has earmarked $13 million for  the purchase of components, spare parts, and other resources  abroad for the repair and maintenance of a number of  thermoelectric plants in the country.    The tremendous efforts being made by personnel of the  electricity sector and other areas, in addition to the resources  which are now beginning to flow, will facilitate the beggining  of the recovery of the power plants' traditional generation  levels.</p>

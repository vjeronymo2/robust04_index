			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Filatov, chief of the Russian </F> president's staff, by correspondent L. Ioffe; place and date not  given; from the "Vesti" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Ioffe] Sergey Filatov is far from being a noisy  sort of politician, he is very proper and even affable, and then  all of a sudden there is a huge fuss in the newspapers about his  resignation.    [Filatov] It was news to me just as to everyone else, all  the  more so in that there is nothing behind it all. That is the  most interesting bit. Two months ago there were attempts to  bring the president's first aide Viktor Vasilyevich Ilyushin and  myself into conflict...    [Ioffe] On what grounds, if I may ask?    [Filatov] Actually, it is hard to say, but I reckon that  there are nevertheless, a number of political forces that on the  one hand, want to put their own people in, of course.    [Ioffe] Sergey Aleksandrovich Filatov cited the words of  Gennadiy Zyuganov, to the effect that his party has its men at  all level.    [Filatov] There are lots of people who do not like accord.    [Ioffe] As for relations with Viktor Ilyushin, Filatov said  these have always been good, and will continue to be, for both  men are busy getting on with the job.    [Unidentified announcer] Sergey Filatov gave this interview  to our commentator after a conference to mark Academician  Sakharov's birthday.</p>

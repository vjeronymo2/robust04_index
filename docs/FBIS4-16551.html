			<p>BFN     [Text] Yasushi Akashi and Vitaliy Churkin, special envoys  of the UN secretary general and the Russian president, held  talks with the leader of the Bosnian Serbs Radovan Karadzic in  the Sarajevo suburb of Pale today. This was the first meeting  between Akashi and Karadzic since NATO planes bombed Serb  positions near Gorazde a week ago.    An ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned at the Zagreb  headquarters of peacekeeping forces that at the Pale meeting  they discussed conditions for a cease-fire under which Bosnian  Serbs could suspend their offensive on Gorazde.</p>

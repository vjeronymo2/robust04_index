			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Frigid temperatures have stopped people cold across Alaska, where a dozen towns  were locked up in the minus 50s and minus 60s, and the temperature hit 70 below  zero at a truck stop in Coldfoot, on the trans-Alaska oil pipeline supply road.  Even high temperatures were well below zero in most of Alaska, and temperatures  were so low that much of the state has gone into hibernation. Planes that carry  mail, groceries and people to numerous outlying villages have been grounded by  extreme cold and, in some places, by ice fog -- dense fog formed by ice  crystals.  </P></p>

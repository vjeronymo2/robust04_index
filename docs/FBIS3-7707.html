Foremost among the five priorities is the stability of free  industries and the protection of Filipino workers abroad. Also  included in the priorites is the implementation of strict  discipline in governmental financial management through  effective rules and regulations, and efficient coordination in  the execution of economic programs. Likewise, the government  must attend to the on-going peace talks with the rebels in order  to end the armed rebellion.    The President also promises to make alterations in programs  in order to administer justice, decrease criminality, and  increase trust in the government, programs targeted primarily at  the uniformed scalawags and anomalous government officials.    In this connection, the House of Representatives will extend  all the support needed by the Ramos administration in order for  it to be successful in 1994, and to proceed with national  improvement plans through the year 2000.    This was the statement made by Speaker Jose de Venecia, Jr.,  in response to the report to the nation presented by President  Ramos yesterday at Malacanang regarding the Ramos  Administration's accomplishments in 1993, and its plans for this  year and the years to come.    According to De Venecia, almost all of the legislative  proposals and the support asked for or set forth by President  Ramos have been approved by the House, such as the Foreign Bank  Liberalization Act, Build, Operate and Transfer Act, and other  bills relating to business progress, tax collection, and  attracting foreign investors.    De Venecia also stated that it is up to the Senate to act  now  because the bills approved by the lower House have been pending  in the upper House.</p>

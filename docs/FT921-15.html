			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Trading still quiet THE MARKET dozed yesterday after indecisive weekend opinion polls on the general election failed to excite traders. A mixed bag of polls, which showed the Labour party unable to extend its small lead over the Conservatives, pointed towards a hung parliament on April 9, or as some dealers put it yesterday, 'no parliament'. 'The market seems fairly sanguine about the election,' said one dealer. 'Perhaps they are just rather bored with it all. At the moment everybody seems inured to a hung parliament.' Rates remained soft throughout the day. The key three-month interbank rate eased slightly to 10 13/16 -10 3/4 per cent from 10 7/8 -10 3/4 per cent. At the longer end, however, the one year rate firmed from 11-10 7/8 to 11 1/8 -11 per cent. Generally the long dates were consolidating and threatening to mount a more decisive move beyond 11 per cent, suggesting that the markets are looking for a rise in base rates after the election. The June sterling contract opened down two basis points at 88.96, and after low volumes of trading climbed to 89.08. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.3bn but revised its forecast twice during the day, ending with a forecast liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.75bn. In the morning the Bank bought bills totalling Pounds 710m for resale to the market on April 13 at 10 7/16 per cent. It operated in the market again in the afternoon, purchasing Pounds 752m outright, including Pounds 652m of band one bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent and Pounds 100m band two bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, with a further Pounds 300m for resale on April 13. With bill operations finally amounting to Pounds 1.76bn, the shortage appeared to have been fully serviced. The expectation was that the authorities would pursue their course of fostering inexpensive funding with the objective of calming troubled waters. Money was generally cheap, with the overnight rate dipping to 9 per cent during the morning from an early 9 7/8 - 3/4 per cent. It finished around 10 per cent in thin trading. German call money rates edged higher yesterday to 9.60/70 per cent from Friday's 9.60/65 per cent as bank liquidity came under pressure from end-of-month pension payments. Dealers said the March reserve requirement was set by the Bundesbank at DM75.9bn.</p>

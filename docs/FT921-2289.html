			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: CBOT options on futures expand THE Chicago Board of Trade will begin trading options on its two-year Treasury note futures on April 24. Options trading on the CBOT's interest rate futures has mushroomed in recent months, making the likelihood of success for the new product considerably greater. While the CBOT, the world's largest futures market, is home to the 30-year Treasury bond contract, the most widely-traded in the world, investors are finding shorter-term futures and futures options increasingly attractive. Trading in options on the CBOT's five-year Treasury note futures, for example, nearly tripled for January to February 1992 compared with the same period last year.</p>

The GSDF's plan  is in line with an ongoing review by the Defense Agency of the  national defense program outline, which was drawn up in 1976  under the Cold War confrontation, according to the YOMIURI.    In the review of the outline defining the nation's basic  defense policies, the agency is considering slashing the GSDF's  personnel from the current number of 180,000 to less than  150,000.    Under the GSDF's plan, the bases in the Northern District  Army stationed in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island,  would be cut by 12 to 26, the daily said.    In accordance with reducing the number of the bases in  Hokkaido, the divisions under the command of the Northern  District Army would be also decreased to three from four.    The Northern District Army currently has the largest number  of divisions among the GSDF's five district armies to address  "the threat from the North," which implies a possible military  attack by the former Soviet Union.</p>

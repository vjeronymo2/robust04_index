			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The public transportation strike called to take  place on Monday was observed throughtout the entire Caracas  metropolitan area, even though the president of the Single Union  of Independent Vehicles, the labor organization that convened  the strike, reached an agreement at noon with the Transport and  Communications Ministry on the payment of student subsidies.    Simon Ladera, president of the Single Union of Independent  Vehicles, met with Transport Minister Cesar Quintini Rosales and  reached an agreement, supposedly to end the strike, but the  strike occurred anyway.    Ladera, after signing an agreement with the transport and  communications minister stating that the public transportation  sector would begin to charge the subsidized student bus fare  rate starting this week, called on all labor union affiliates to  return to work, but his request was not complied with.    Only buses operated on Monday afternoon. The subway operated  with extra units. There were many pirate taxi cabs operating as  well. The public transportation situation in Caracas and part  of the interior of the country is expected to return to normal  on Tuesday.</p>

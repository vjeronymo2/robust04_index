			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Warning on price of Scots separatism ECONOMISTS yesterday painted a much less attractive picture of the benefits to Scotland of a devolved parliament and of independence than those portrayed by the political parties arguing for them. A devolved Scottish parliament would be far more dependent on the UK Treasury for its revenue than supporters of devolution claim, according to Professor Donald MacKay and Mr Peter Wood of Pieda, the Edinburgh economic consultancy. They add that it would have little autonomy in economic and industrial affairs. They say in a report for Bell Lawrie, the Edinburgh stockbroking firm, that an independent Scotland would have a large structural budget deficit and probably a substantial balance of payments deficit. The report is a challenge to Labour and the Liberal Democrats, which support a Scottish parliament, and to the Scottish National party which wants independence in the European Community. The economists warn that there is a gulf between public expectations and reality over a Scottish parliament, and say that the resulting disillusionment could cause political instability leading to demands for full independence. The tax revenues that a Scottish parliament would have assigned to it under the proposals of the Scottish Constitutional Convention would fall far short of its public spending. It would therefore have to negotiate with the Treasury for the rest of its funding, the economists say. It is unlikely that the Treasury would agree to anything which gave a competitive advantage. The parliament's right to raise taxes by up to 3p in the pound would raise only 4 per cent of expenditure. The economic powers proposed for the parliament were 'vague, confused and unconvincing', Prof MacKay said. As for independence in the EC, Scotland would have a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 5.85bn in 1991-92, assuming unchanged tax and spending levels, and two thirds of UK oil revenues. This would amount to 14.4 per cent of Scotland's gross domestic product and would be difficult to fund without punitive interest rates. Higher taxes would appear inevitable to maintain spending.

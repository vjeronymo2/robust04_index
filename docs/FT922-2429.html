			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Framatome posts flat profits for year FRAMATOME, France's supplier of nuclear reactors, yesterday announced stable profits for 1991 and its first order for five years. The group reported a net profit of FFr986m (Dollars 182.25m) against FFr984m in 1990, on turnover up slightly to FFr14.2bn from FFr13.6bn over the same period. State-controlled Framatome, subject two years ago to a failed bid for control by Alcatel Alsthom, the private sector telecommunications and engineering group, has suffered from the international decline in demand for nuclear plant. It expects turnover to fall again this year to FFr13.1bn, on which it is forecast-ing a FFr900m net profit. Framatome's main nuclear customer, Electricite de France, has completed the expansion of its ambitious nuclear plant programme, but, as expected, did pass on an order for a 1,450 MW power station earlier this month. However, it lost a contract to build a steam generator in Belgium to Mitsubishi of Japan.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITIES BREAK RULES ON HOUSING FOR POOR RESIDENTS  </P> <P> Nearly one-fourth of all California communities are building no housing for the  poor, despite state-mandated plans that require each community to construct its  share of low-income housing, according to a survey by the California Coalition  for Rural Housing.  </P> <P> The study found that plenty of homes are being built for the wealthy, but only  16% of the housing needed for low-income people is being constructed.  </P> <P> The study found that only 97,424 low-income housing units were built statewide  through the end of 1989 -- at least 500,000 housing units less than required  under current plans. The survey alleges that 82 community redevelopment  agencies violated state law by failing to set aside money for low-income  housing in communities that have not met housing goals for the poor.  </P></p>

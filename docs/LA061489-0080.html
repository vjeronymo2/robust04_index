			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRAN ALLISON, STAR OF TV'S 'KUKLA, FRAN &amp; OLLIE,' DIES  </P> <P> Fran Allison, who as the winsome straight man for a bulb-nosed clown named  Kukla and a one-toothed dragon called Ollie made up one of the most popular and  beloved triumvirates in TV history, died Tuesday morning.  </P> <P> She was 81 and died at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital after a long struggle  with bone marrow failure, an inability to produce enough blood cells, said  Clark Dennis, her longtime friend.  </P> <P> She had been admitted to the hospital near her Van Nuys home on May 23.  </P> <P> Miss Allison was a veteran radio comedienne, hostess and singer when she became  the only visible human member of the late Burr Tillstrom's captivating  contingent of hand puppets.  </P> <P> Each evening about 7, she would sally forth to begin her always patient  dialogues with Kukla, the pragmatic imp with the oversized nose, and Oliver J.  Dragon, a talkative serpent from a long line of non-fire-breathing lizards.  </P> <P> Their fragmented discourses, always extemporaneous but centered on themes that  Tillstrom and Miss Allison had discussed before air time, were cheerful  homilies offering guidance for young minds.  </P> <P> From Nov. 29, 1948, when the show first went on national television -- after  being on the air for a year or two in Chicago -- until Aug. 31, 1957, when it  ended its national run to later move to public television, its cast of  characters provided parents with wholesome respite.  </P> <P> But the charming, soft-spoken island of sanity she became on "Kukla, Fran &amp;  Ollie, " (kukla means doll in Russian) was not the character that first brought  Frances Allison to prominence.  </P> <P> Born in La Porte, Iowa, she gained her early radio experience in that state  with a character she called "Aunt Fanny," a gossiping spinster who thrived on  publicizing the best-kept secrets of her neighbors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aunt Fanny  </P> <P> The manager of the station in Waterloo, Iowa, where she was showcasing Aunt  Fanny, sent a transcription to Don McNeill, host of radio's popular "The  Breakfast Club."  </P> <P> Aunt Fanny, who came to the microphone as "She's Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage"  played in the background, took her tattling to the huge national audience that  made McNeill's mixture of sentiment and comedy a staple of the Depression Era.  </P> <P> She also was heard as both comic and vocalist on such other variety radio shows  as "Smile Parade," "Uncle Ezra's Radio Station" and "Meet the Meeks."  </P> <P> When "The Breakfast Club" moved to television in 1950, Aunt Fanny went along.  But McNeill's TV effort was short-lived, and in 1954, Miss Allison, a jazz  aficionado with a wide range of interests, joined the highly respected panel of  "Down You Go," a word game.  </P> <P> She also was a part of "It's About Time," a historical TV quiz show of that  same year, and "Let's Dance," a big-band spectacular that featured orchestras  from both New York and Chicago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Enduring Legacy  </P> <P> But her enduring legacy will be as the voice of charm and reason for  Tillstrom's puppet entourage, which also included Fletcher Rabbit, the mailman  who had to starch his drooping ears for formal occasions; Beulah Witch and her  rocket-propelled broomstick; Col. Crackie, the long-winded Confederate, and  many more.  </P> <P> She first met Tillstrom, who died in 1985, at Chicago station WBKB where he was  developing a television format for the puppets he had exhibited at the 1940 New  York World's Fair.  </P> <P> The two of them mapped out 10 ideas that they believed would fill half an hour  of air time. Over the years, the show ran alternately in 30-minute, 15-minute  and 5-minute segments before moving to PBS from 1969 to 1971. It also ran in  syndicated form from 1975 to 1976. Tillstrom provided all the puppets' voices  but was never seen, while Miss Allison managed the running commentary.  </P> <P> Most recently she had been seen on a local senior citizens program called  "Prime Time," broadcast over KHJ-TV, Channel 9.  </P> <P> Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television, told the  Associated Press on Tuesday that she is beginning a seminar on children's  television next Tuesday at the Museum of Broadcasting in New York with clips  from "Kukla, Fran &amp; Ollie."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concern for Children  </P> <P> "I am using it as an example of the concern that the broadcast industry used to  have for children and their families," Charren said. "It was one of those  wonderful ideas that happens rarely, when something that appeals to children  also appeals to adults."  </P> <P> Miss Allison's marriage to music publisher Archie Levington ended with his  death in 1978. Survivors include her brother and two nieces.  </P> <P> She will be buried next to her mother in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said niece Nan  Calvin, who added that a local memorial service is pending.  </P></p>

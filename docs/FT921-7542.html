			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Scheme launched to boost private share ownership PROSHARE, an organisation committed to turning the UK into a 'nation of shareholders', was launched yesterday with financial backing from the Department of Trade and Industry, the Stock Exchange and 20 industrial and commercial companies. The new organisation will campaign for reforms such as fiscal incentives for private equity holdings, more education of schoolchildren in personal finance and for companies to use 'best practice' when establishing employee share-ownership schemes. ProShare has initial funding of Pounds 1m a year for three years. The organisation said that in spite of the privatisations of the 1980s, which increased the number of shareholders from 3m to 11m, the habit of shareholding was not deeply rooted. Three quarters of private investors own shares in no more than two companies and 54 per cent own shares in one. Only 3 per cent of private investors own shares in 11 or more companies, which is generally accepted to be necessary to build a diversified portfolio. The proportion of shares held by private individuals has fallen from 65.8 per cent to 21.3 per cent over the past 30 years. Sir Peter Thompson, the former chairman of transport company NFC, is ProShare's chairman. He said an increase in private share ownership would improve the liquidity of the stock market and would have beneficial effects on the economy by increasing the feeling of ownership among the workforce. ProShare would try to provide private investors with improved information and research and would encourage more user-friendly and lower-cost share distribution services. Sir Peter said there was a lack of knowledge of share ownership among the population and ProShare would aim to educate people in the risks and rewards. The organisation has letters of support from all three main political parties. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said in a letter to Sir John Harvey-Jones, ProShare's president: 'The aim of the new body, which we share, is for a society whereby the fortunes of shareholders, management and employees are successfully bound up together.' Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the chief regulator for the financial services industry, said: 'We welcome the formation of ProShare. There is a clear need for a responsible organisation to represent the interests of private investors.'</p>

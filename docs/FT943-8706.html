			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / People: Smith's Challenge in New Zealand Michael Smith, 43, one of the contenders to take over as the next chief executive of ScottishPower, is moving to the other side of the world to run a new utility business being set up by Fletcher Challenge, one of New Zealand's largest conglomerates. Smith, a former general manager of Thorn Lighting who joined ScottishPower in 1990, takes up his new post as chief executive of Fletcher Challenge's utility sector at the end of the month. New Zealand, like Britain, has been deregulating its energy industry and Smith has been given the job of developing Fletcher Challenge's utility operations in New Zealand and globally. Fletcher Challenge grew rapidly during the 1980s but its dependence on cyclical capital intensive industries, such as forest products and oil and gas, has caused problems and it has been selling off assets in order to reduce its gearing. It sold majority control of its New Zealand natural gas utility two years ago. However, the company's fortunes have been recovering and it is understood to be keen to take advantage of the opportunities thrown up by the privatisation of the local electricity business. Smith, who has a marketing background, has been responsible for developing ScottishPower's non-regulated businesses which include CaledonianGas, retail, and electrical contracting. ScottishPower's core business is looking after a large part of Scotland's electricity supply but it has more than doubled its retail outlets, to 155, since privatisation and expanded into supplying natural gas and is moving into telecommunications. Although Smith is said to have done a good job developing ScottishPower's non-core businesses, he was not thought to be the front-runner to take over from Ian Preston, who has headed ScottishPower since before privatisation and is expected to retire next year. Duncan Whyte, a 47-year-old Scot running the core electricity business, is thought to be the most likely internal candidate. Smith said yesterday that thoughts of succession at ScottishPower had not prompted his decision to move to Fletcher Challenge. It is understood that he was partly swayed by family reasons. He is married to an Indonesian and spent six years in that country in the 1970s with Voluntary Service Overseas, Mobil Oil, the Ford Foundation and the World Bank.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Japan's role in the world PARLIAMENTARY fisticuffs and filibusters notwithstanding, Japan has taken a timid but important step towards playing a political role in the world commensurate with its economic might. After a sitting that lasted four days and nearly four nights, parliament's upper house passed a bill authorising small numbers of Japanese troops to serve in United Nations peace-keeping operations overseas. Assuming the lower house, which agreed the bill some time ago, now passes the amended version, Japan will be able legitimately to deploy its modest but growing self-defence forces abroad for the first time since the second world war. The decision was the subject of more than 18 months of bitter parliamentary debate. During that time Japan - much to its government's embarrassment - was unable to play anything more than a financial part in the Gulf war. The fact that Japanese politicians have been stung into recognising the need for a physical as well as a financial contribution to international action is significant. It is only with this kind of experience, gathered cautiously over a substantial period of time, that Japan will broach a serious debate about how the country is to exercise its power in the world and its immediate region. Security needs These are deep and dangerous waters, and wading into them requires diffidence. Japan is not, for one thing, on the point of developing much of a foreign policy of its own. Any international deployment of its forces will be strictly wrapped in the UN flag and in all other respects Japan continues to depend overwhelmingly on the US for its security and other foreign policy needs. But that observation itself begs a question which may, in the next few years, become more insistent: how durable is the US-Japan relationship? Japanese officials are inclined to brush such doubts aside. Equally, no country in the region, including China, wants to see a re-emergence of Japan as a regional power. The argument runs: if everyone wants the US to stay then the US will stay. This line of reasoning may be plausible, but its converse is hardly unthinkable in a period which lacks the galvanising polarities of the Cold War and features an unremitting stream of economic tensions which has made Japan such a volatile factor in American politics. The US did not find it unthinkable to shut down its previously vital naval facilities at Subic Bay in the Philippines last year and it needs to be borne in mind that it is encouraged to keep troops in Japan by the substantial sums the Japanese government pays towards their upkeep. Unsettling events Moreover, even if the US relationship is as solid as Japanese officials claim, they are well aware that continuing stability in their immediate neighbourhood is scarcely guaranteed. It is not hard to think of events that might occur in north or east Asia before the century is out, that could seriously unsettle the entire region: from reunification of the Korean peninsula to a large-scale upheaval in the Chinese leadership. It would be remarkable if in all these possible crises, the US and Japan saw completely eye to eye. The possibility of Korean unification, for example, is already causing frissons of concern in Tokyo that seem to some observers to go beyond America's specific worries over North Korea's nuclear programme. Japan's substantial economic stake in the future of south-east Asia may also eventually translate into a political approach to the region which deviates from that of the US. Such considerations are a far cry from the modest step into the international arena Japan has just taken. But it is they, rather than hazy notions of international solidarity associated with the UN, that may be the real foreign policy preoccupations for Japan over the next few years. The wrangling over the peace-keeping bill is a small hint of the troubles the country has yet to face in coming to terms with its changing world role. It is in everyone's interest that Japan's emergence as a more vigorous world citizen is accomplished with appropriate tact.</p>

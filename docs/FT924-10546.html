			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Thrifty move clips Heron's wings - The background of the declining fortunes of Gerald Ronson AS the man once lionised as 'the finest businessman of his generation', Mr Gerald Ronson, must have yesterday been asking himself what had gone wrong. To avoid liquidation he is proposing to give up all but 5 per cent of Heron International, the private company he founded 27 years ago. In the year ending March 1990, Heron, the second-largest private company in the UK after Littlewoods, with 2,000 employees worldwide, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 65.3m. According to unaudited figures sent to bondholders, for March 1992 it made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 217m. This prompted it to enter into negotiations with its bondholders and bankers which resulted in yesterday's restructuring proposals. Heron includes Heron Homes, petrol stations, motor dealerships and the sole Suzuki distributorship in the UK. In America, Heron has extensive property interests and once owned the troubled Pima savings and loan institution in Arizona. There was no shortage of Heron bankers willing to give their views on the private company's fall from grace. 'In the go-go eighties Ronson was driven by a desire to do the next deal. Some of them were great deals. But, with hindsight, too many of them were in sectors which were to be hammered by the prolonged recession of the nineties.' Another banker opined: 'Three of Heron's main activities - property, housebuilding and luxury car sales - were pulverised by the recession.' It would be difficult to disagree with any of these explanations. However, according to one of Heron's financial advisers, the reason for Heron's downfall was more prosaic. Heron made its big mistake when it moved across the Atlantic into the booming American thrift business - the equivalent of British building societies - by buying Pima. By 1984 Pima was claimed to be the fastest-growing financial institution in its home state of Arizona. Pima looked at one time as if it would prove to be one of Mr Ronson's biggest successes. 'Unfortunately,' said the Heron adviser, 'it turned out to be one of its biggest failures and the engine of the group's downfall.' By 1989 the thrift industry had expanded into collapse as over-optimistic borrowers got into difficulties and Pima was costing Heron some Pounds 40m a year. It was also the business to which Guinness paid much of the Pounds 5.8m for Heron's support in the Distillers bid. Heron returned the money. If it had not been for Pima, Heron's financial advisers believe it would have probably ridden out the property slump and Mr Ronson would be able to keep 100 per cent control of Heron, in spite of its total debts of Pounds 1.4bn. Earlier in the year Mr Ronson was aware of the extensive restructuring needed to save his company. He suggested various options, including the splitting of bondholders' debt into interest-bearing and non-interest bearing portions, along with a maturity extension and the rescheduling of the bankers' debt. It was not until KPMG Peat Marwick's circular to Heron's 82 creditor banks in June, that Mr Ronson accepted the need for a debt-to-equity swap. The accountants said Heron was 'technically insolvent' last March on the basis of an asset review prepared by valuers Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks. The recent devaluation of sterling only underlined Heron's problems - most of its borrowings are in foreign-denominated currencies. Last month Mr Ronson finally agreed to dilute the 100 per cent stake (15 per cent he held personally, 40 per cent held by Ronson family trusts and 45 per cent held by three Ronson charitable foundations) to just 5 per cent. Friends say Mr Ronson's experience of Ford open prison, where he served six months for his part in the Guinness scandal, has left him more determined than ever to lead Heron out of its present crisis. Although his wife Gail plans to resign from Heron's board she is expected to continue to advise Mr Ronson over the restructuring of the company.</p>

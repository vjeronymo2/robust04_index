			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICERS' CONDUCT AFTER GIRL'S SHOOTING PROBED  </P> <P> Los Angeles police officials are looking into citizen complaints that officers  failed to promptly pursue the getaway vehicle in a drive-by shooting and  allowed a mortally wounded 7-year-old victim to go too long without medical  attention.  </P> <P> Witnesses to the Aug. 2 attack at the Imperial Courts housing project contend  that two officers who arrived within seconds of the shooting waited at least  five minutes before chasing the getaway vehicle. Residents of the Watts housing  project also said that when they complained about the delay, police attacked  them with batons, one man was arrested and another man's arm was broken.  </P> <P> Several tenants also alleged that the drive-by shooting victim, Kanita Haley,  who was wounded in the head during a hail of automatic gunfire, lay in a yard  for as long as 20 minutes before she was taken to a hospital. The Grape  Elementary School student died two days later.  </P> <P> Police said they are looking into the tenants' allegations, first made to  reporters last week.  </P> <P> Capt. M. M. Wasson, commander of the Southeast Division, said Thursday that a  preliminary inquiry has turned up no wrongdoing by the first two officers who  arrived at the shooting scene near 115th Street and Mona Boulevard. Other  officers took crowd-control actions, he said, only after someone in the crowd  threw a bottle at them.  </P> <P> Wasson said, however, that new information provided at a meeting of the tenants  Wednesday must be checked out before a final determination is made. "This may  end up as a personnel complaint and that would put it into a whole different  independent investigation," he said.  </P> <P> A Fire Department spokesman, Battalion Chief Ed Allen, said the ambulance crew  reported that they arrived at the scene nine minutes after a call from police  and took Kanita to the hospital six minutes later -- a total of 15 minutes  after the original call.  </P> <P> Allen said the department's response-time goal is five minutes, but he added,  "We delivered her to the hospital in a reasonable amount of time."  </P> <P> A computer record, which Allen disputes, indicated that the ambulance might  have stayed at the scene for as long as 43 minutes. He said he believes that  the ambulance crew neglected to sign off the computer after completing the run.  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who attended a meeting of the  Imperial Courts Residents Council on Wednesday, said she will help the man  whose arm was broken file a formal complaint with police.  </P> <P> Wasson said the meeting was the first time he had heard that someone may have  been injured by police after the child's shooting. The man with the broken arm,  who declined to give his name because he feared police retaliation, told Wasson  that he will cooperate with police in their inquiry. On Thursday, police said,  the man declined to be interviewed by investigators.  </P> <P> Wearing a cast on his left arm, he told his story to an audience of about 60  people at the tenants meeting on Wednesday.  </P> <P> On the night of the shooting, the man said, he was walking through a grassy  area near 115th Street and Mona Boulevard when he heard gunfire and people  shouting that a child had been shot. Almost simultaneously, he said, he saw a  police car pull into view just as the car carrying the gunman sped into an  alley.  </P> <P> The man said he ran to the police car and reported the shooting. Other tenants  also ran up to the police car, he said, and pointed in the direction of the  speeding getaway car.  </P> <P> Instead of pursuing the car, the man complained, the officer who was driving  pulled to the curb and parked. It was a full five minutes, he said, before  police drove away, apparently in pursuit of the getaway car.  </P> <P> By the time other officers arrived, the man said, an increasingly angry crowd  had gathered. When people in the crowd demanded to know why the first officers  had delayed, he said, police began pushing them back and hitting some people  with batons.  </P> <P> He could not get out of the way fast enough, he said, and was struck on both  arms and in the ribs by an officer. He and other tenants denied that anyone  threw a bottle at police.  </P> <P> Another man was arrested for inciting the crowd, according to a police  investigator.  </P> <P> Wasson said after the meeting Wednesday that the two officers arrived at the  scene between 10 seconds and 15 seconds after the shooting. He said they had  not immediately chased the suspected getaway car because they had not seen it  and had not determined the origin of the shooting.  </P> <P> The officers, according to Wasson, might have spent as long as two minutes  trying to summon emergency aid on their car radios. Another two to three  minutes, he said, were spent trying to figure out exactly what was happening.  </P></p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: RTZ RTZ was clearly anxious to get its hands on Nerco's attractive US coal reserves. The Dollars 1.2bn acquisition also includes a disparate package of oil, gas and precious metals assets for which a buyer will have to be found. That leaves a degree of risk. Gearing of around 60 per cent is not unreasonable at this stage of the cycle, but it would do to make some in-roads into debt through disposals before making another move. If that can be achieved, RTZ looks sensible to add coal to its portfolio of commodities. The low-cost and low-sulphur coal bought yesterday should be less vulnerable to environmental legislation. With 60 per cent of the output sold under long-term contracts, there is also some security of earnings.</p>

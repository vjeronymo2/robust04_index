			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Clinton still to reveal running-mate FIVE days before the start of the Democratic party convention in New York, one name is still missing from the programme: that of Governor Bill Clinton's vice-presidential running-mate. Mr Clinton yesterday met Mr Warren Christopher, the Washington lawyer leading his search committee. The Arkansas governor has succeeded in wrapping his choice in mystery - although he said last night 'we're getting very close'. Several names are circulated, but most tipsters are cautious enough to include the possibility of a surprise on their short-lists. Even the timing of Mr Clinton's announcement remains in doubt, with some pundits suggesting he might wait until the middle of next week's All Star baseball game to ensure a big TV audience. Three men are most widely mentioned: Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania, Congressman Lee Hamilton of Indiana and Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee. Senator Wofford leapt to the top of the list yesterday when he met Mr Clinton in Washington. A surprise victor in last year's Pennsylvania senate by-election, he would confirm an emphasis on domestic issues, especially health care reform. Mr Hamilton would bring some of the gravitas and foreign affairs experience that Mr Clinton is thought to lack. His odds lengthened this weekend when he distanced himself from Mr Clinton and the centre of the Democratic party on the issues of abortion and parental leave - although his reservations about abortion rights are similar to Mr Wofford's. Mr Gore would bring good credentials on environmental issues, but an all-southern ticket could be risky: Yankee prejudice is alive and well, as Mr Clinton himself discovered during the New York Democratic primary campaign. Also viewed as potential choices are three other senators: Mr Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Mr Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Mr Bob Graham of Florida. Of these six, only Mr Wofford and perhaps Mr Graham have the capacity to bring Mr Clinton a big state he might otherwise lose.</p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / South Africa's master of the strategic compromise: Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general, is instrumental in shaping a post-apartheid society THE African National Congress is willing to make major concessions on the issue of multi-racial power sharing in a post-apartheid South Africa, which could form the basis of an eventual deal on a new democratic constitution. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general, said in an interview that a post-apartheid ANC government would rule in coalition with the mainly white National Party, the current ruling party, even if the ANC won a large majority of votes. The 39-year-old Mr Ramaphosa is the most important black leader in South Africa apart from ANC President Nelson Mandela. When it comes to ANC policy, his influence not only rivals, but possibly exceeds, that of the septuagenarian Mr Mandela. It might be argued that South Africans would not now be pushing forward to all-party interim government if it were not for Mr Ramaphosa. When he took over as secretary-general last July, the ANC and Pretoria were locked in a fruitless dispute over violence. He insisted that talks on a new constitution begin immediately, dropping the pre-condition (imposed by Mr Mandela, among others) that certain obstacles first be removed. A man of easy charm and humour, he quickly won the trust of his interlocutors. As a former trade unionist, he is a master of the strategic compromise. True to form, he used an interview with the Financial Times to offer significant concessions to the ruling National Party. On a coalition with the National party, he concedes: 'We would agree, soon after a new constitution is adopted, you may well need to bring in people from other parties into government.' He speaks in the soft and deliberate voice, devoid of arrogance, which makes him such a favourite among senior Nationalists. He cites the example of Zimbabwe, where white ministers held key portfolios in the first post-independence government. Coalition government is the National party's bottom line, and he knows it. But the Nationalists are demanding much more than Mr Ramaphosa is willing to give: they want rule by coalition entrenched in the constitution; the ANC leader insists it should be voluntary. 'We would be quite vehemently opposed to a situation where we would be forced to get into a coalition government with any party ..our view is that forced marriages don't work.' He believes that coalitions will arise naturally out of South Africa's political and ethnic diversity. The Nationalists want more security than that, to prevent domination by the black population: South Africa, including the nominally independent 'homelands', has 28m blacks and only 5m whites. Mr Ramaphosa has an offer to make in this regard as well: 'You need a constitution which has sufficient checks and balances to prevent one dominant party exercising power all on its own.' But checks and balances are not all he is offering: 'you could have a system where you share power by saying that on certain clauses of the constitution - amending the constitution or taking particular decisions - you would require ..a majority which would need the agreement of other parties in parliament.' 'That could well be a permanent feature in a constitution  .. the type of feature that could give comfort to those parties that feel they could be marginalised by a majority party.' That would depend, of course, on the areas subject to joint decision-making. Here Mr Ramaphosa is surprisingly flexible: he suggests that the budget might be one such area. On the issue of devolution of power to the regions - one of the main planks in Nationalist strategy - Mr Ramaphosa is conciliatory; as a liberation movement, the ANC clings to the vision of a popular grassroots democracy requiring maximum devolution. But he knows that the Nationalists want devolution so that they can weaken a central government dominated by the ANC, and to enable them to retain what he calls 'pockets of apartheid' - white neighbourhoods where local regulations effectively keep out blacks. That would be 'completely out of the question,' he says. For the moment, forming an interim government is the priority. The ANC proposes a council of state to make policy, while ministers continue to run their departments; Pretoria could probably agree to this. But Mr Ramaphosa says an interim parliament/constituent assembly would have to be unicameral, with no special weighting for minorities; the government wants a bicameral body, with an upper house where minorities have veto power. 'That could well be the crunch point,' says Mr Ramaphosa. 'We can only think of one method of election, that is one person one vote on a common voters roll based on proportional representation.' On economic policy, there is likely to be even less common ground between Pretoria and the ANC - despite recent reassurances from Mr Mandela that the ANC has outgrown nationalisation. The ANC president may have realised the dangers of preaching nationalisation - foreign investors on his recent overseas trip clearly shocked him with the vehemence of their opposition - but other ANC leaders have learned no such lesson. Mr Ramaphosa could well prove Mr Mandela's sternest opponent on the issue when the ANC meets for an economic conference in April. He refuses to comment on economic questions - mindful, no doubt, that contradictory statements on debt repayments (from him and Mr Mandela) have hurt the ANC's image. But he is understood to describe himself privately as a socialist. However, Mr Ramaphosa is not without humour on the matter. He drew attention to a framed cartoon on his office wall: it shows him flogging a dead horse labelled 'investment' and shouting 'That'll teach you] Now giddup]'</p>

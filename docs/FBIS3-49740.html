			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Representatives of the Slovak delegation to the  Prague summit gave a news conference in the Hotel Praha at 1600  hours. Jarmila Tosecka, our reporter, was there and she compiled  the following report.    [Begin recording] [Tosecka] Questions put by many  journalists, including foreign ones, were answered by President  Michal Kovac, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, Foreign Minister  Jozef Moravcik, and Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak.    These questions could be summed up in the following basic  areas: prospects for the future cooperation among the Visegrad  four countries, the importance of the Partnership for Peace  project for the countries involved and specifically for the  Slovak Republic, Slovakia's relations with Hungary, the problem  of the Hungarian minority as well as Slovak relations with  Russia, and future contacts between Slovakia and the Czech  Republic.    In reply, Prime Minister Meciar again confirmed closeness of  views whether on the project "Partnership for Peace" where, as  the Czech side, Slovakia regarded individual approach as being  realistic. He also assessed positively other areas of mutual  relations. According to Meciar, Slovakia was interested in good  and useful cooperation among the Visegrad four countries, but  the existing course and results were not as we have expected.  It is necessary to intensify cooperation, otherwise this group  would disintegrate only to be replaced by bilateral relations.    Asked whether a visit to Bratislava by President Clinton was  discussed, President Michal Kovac replied: Yes, we have repeated  our invitation to the celebrations of the 50th anniversay of the  Slovak national uprising. We have presented to the U.S.  President an album containing documentary evidence. Bill  Clinton promised that if he himself could not come he would  certainly send his envoy to Bratislava.    Minister Jozef Moravcik confirmed, among other things, that  the Slovak Republic was ready to sign immediately a framework  agreement on Partnership for Peace. This was also confirmed by  Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak. Foreign Minister Moravcik  also replied to questions concerning the minorities problem.  After the news conference ended, I put to him the following  question: Before the Prague summit, the Hungarian daily  NEPSZABADSZAG said the meeting in Komarno of Hungarian minority  representatives last Saturday was taking place in the shadow of  the Prague summit. At the same time it cast a shadow on that  summit. During your talks with your Hungarian partner, could  you also detect this shadow?    [Moravcik] In my view, one should not overestimate the  importance of that event. In a democratic environment, it is on  the whole usual that somewhat more extreme views are presented.  We appreciate the way that event passed off, the fact no anti-  constitutional step was taken, and that everything is a subject  of discussion [passage indistinct].    [Tosecka] How would you characterize your talks today with  the Hungarian side?    [Moravcik] The talks were of a general character, as we had  little time. Problems raised were rather numerous. There was  not enough time to enable us to devote ourselves to individual  questions. Both sides, however, demonstrated strong political  will to reach a consensus very quickly so that we would not have  to spend too much energy on tackling certain problems and  instead concentrate rather on issues tackled here.    [Tosecka] As a government representative, how would you  assess the conclusions of this Prague summit. What does it  means for Slovakia?    [Moravcik] For Slovakia it means opportunity, and one has to  make use of that opportunity. [end recording]</p>

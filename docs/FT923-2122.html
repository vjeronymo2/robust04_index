			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc edges close to floor THE BANK OF FRANCE intervened heavily to support the franc yesterday after continuing tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism forced the currency close to its floor against the D-Mark, writes James Blitz. On Thursday, the franc touched its ERM floor of FFr3.4305, as the market continued to assume that Sunday's Maastricht referendum in France could produce a No vote, bringing European Monetary union to an end. Yesterday the Bank of France intervened in the foreign exchange markets for the second day running in an operation which dealers described as 'substantial.' The Bank also briefly suspended its 5-10 day lending facility, a move which pushed short term lending rates up to 20 per cent - although some dealers said that rates were as high as 80 per cent at one stage. The facility was later re-introduced. Analysts said that the French operation had been extremely successful. 'The French managed to hold the franc without pushing up bank lending rates, a move which would have produced more No votes in the referendum,' said Mr Jim Hall, an economist at Swiss Banking Corporation in London. The franc closed at FFr3.4230 to the D-Mark, 0.75 centimes above its floor. The Irish punt was also under pressure, trading close to its floor of DM2.6190 to the punt. As in France, market interest rates went up as pressure on the currency continued, with some dealers suggesting that overnight rates were being measured in 'thousands of percent.' In London, it closed at DM2.6525 to the punt. The fate of the mechanism probably depends on the result of the Maastricht referendum in France tomorrow. 'If there is a Yes, the French, the Germans and the Benelux countries will probably do their best to hold the ERM together,' said Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corp in London. But the market has seen how fragile the EMS is and it will be hard to restore credibility. Pressure on sterling was intense following an interview with Mr Norman Lamont, the UK Chancellor, in which he cast doubt about the prospects of an early return by sterling to the ERM. The pound is probably no longer overvalued against the D-Mark when trading competitiveness is taken into account. But there was heavy selling of sterling by big investment funds yesterday, and the trend could still be downward. 'If we get a total about turn in UK economic strategy, the pound will come under pressure, going perhaps as low as DM2.50,' said Mark Austin. Sterling closed 3.75 pfennigs down against the D-Mark at DM2.6125.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESEDA GIRLS TURN BACK NORTH HOLLYWOOD RALLY  </P> <P> History dictates that whenever the girls' basketball teams from Reseda and  North Hollywood highs meet, they must play a close,  keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat game. For the past 2 years, the teams have  met twice for league titles and twice for City Section championships.  </P> <P> But for the first 7 minutes of Wednesday's Mid-Valley League game -- which  Reseda won, 58-55, at North Hollywood -- Reseda's play dictated a much  different kind of game. Reseda led, 19-4, with a minute left in the first  quarter. Forget history. Had they wanted to, the Regents could have been  excused for thinking about what to do after the game.  </P> <P> "When you play North Hollywood, you never think anything," said forward  Jennifer Marzahl, who led Reseda (11-3, 6-0) with 22 points. "We can never let  up against North Hollywood."  </P> <P> The Regents, who beat the Huskies in the past 2 City 3-A Division finals, may  not have let up, but they did let the Huskies back in. North Hollywood closed  to within 2 late in the second quarter and led briefly during the fourth  quarter.  </P> <P> "I knew we'd get it together," North Hollywood Coach Rich Allen said.  </P> <P> But the Huskies watched their efforts go for naught in the fourth quarter. With  the score tied, 55-55, North Hollywood (11-4, 4-1) committed 4 consecutive  turnovers in the last minute and was unable to control the rebound on 2 missed  Reseda free throws.  </P> <P> "We have never had an opportunity where we could sit back and relax playing  them," Reseda Coach Andrea Francola said. "I would like to relax but . . ."  </P> <P> Michelle Cabaldon scored 17 points for North Hollywood; Denisha Jordan scored  12 for Reseda.  </P></p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Council joins in airports dispute LIVERPOOL Airport's attempts to block expansion of Manchester Airport and force airlines to fly to Merseyside has been attacked by Bolton Borough Council. Manchester plans to build a second runway in the Cheshire green belt and to expand capacity from 12.5m to 30m passengers a year. The plan, which will be subject to a public inquiry next year, is opposed by local and environmental groups. Liverpool Airport, which handles 400,000 passengers a year, is proposing its own underused runway as an alternative, with a 30-mile train link between the airports. Mr Bob Howarth, leader of Bolton council, and Mr Brian Collinge, its chief executive, said in a joint statement: 'If Liverpool were to deny Manchester a second runway, international traffic, particularly American, would transfer to Europe or London. 'Airlines are not prevented from operating to Liverpool now and it is wrong to assume denying Manchester a second runway will suddenly cause international traffic to be attracted to Liverpool.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>   [Text] Appearing before the special commission evaluating  the Military Code proposal on 17 June, Dr. Vilma Nunez,  president of the Nicaraguan Human Rights Center, Cenidh, made  valuable suggestions on the Military Code bill proposal as  relates to responsibilities, military jurisdiction, and military  social security.    Dr. Nunez proposes that no relative -- fourth degree of  consanguinity and second of affinity -- of the president, vice  president, or National Assembly president be appointed Armed  Forces chief.    Dr. Nunez stated that "to keep civilian and military power  from being concentrated in one family, we recommend adoption of  the exclusions we just mentioned."    The Cenidh representative expressed her concern over "the  broad and ambiguous" responsibilities given to the Army with the  purpose of "maintaining institutional stability,"  responsibilities which clearly belong to the police.    Nunez expressed her opposition to Army involvement in  actions  to "reestablish order" as relates to labor or social conflicts.  As an example, she pointed to the Sebaco events when several  casualties resulted from the Armed Forces' methods.    "In no case can the president of the Republic declare an  incident to be a mutiny, coup, or so forth and then proceed to  mobilize the Army. That is a power of the judicial branch,"  Nunez warned.    With respect to the president's power to order Nicaraguan  troops to leave the country or to allow foreign troops to enter  national territory, Dr. Nunez recalled the mercenaries going  through Puerto Cabezas on their way to the Bay of Pigs invasion  in Cuba.    The code must be modified so the president proposes but the  National Assembly authorizes.    On this issue, Dr. Nunez agrees with other experts who  believe the Constitution should have been reformed first and the  Military Code approved afterward.    The Cenidh also expressed opposition to including the  Information Directorate for the Defense (DID) as part of the  Armed Forces' structure.    Nunez warned that such actions "grant the Armed Forces a  level of authority that is not theirs and which is contrary to  their very nature. It encroaches upon the authority of the  police force as the institution responsible for crime prevention  and institutionalizes espionage to a dangerous degree."    In the area of penal jurisdiction, the Cenidh is opposed to  placing the military justice structure under the chief judge  advocate, as that office is subordinate to the Army General  Command.    The attorney said that "it must be immediately established  that all Armed Forces members charged of committing a common  crime are to be turned over to the civilian justice system."    Regarding social provisions, the Cenidh says this must be  accomplished "in accordance with the Constitution and the laws  governing the state's administrative functions."    The Cenidh proposed drafting a regulatory system for  providing social security benefits to Armed Forces members and  their families.    Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar and Deputy Police  Chief Eduardo Cuadra also appeared before the commission. The  extent of their participation regarding military justice was to  request that the police be allowed to go before the judge  advocate to have that person decide what justice system should  handle specific crimes committed by policemen.    During the hearings, about 200 Liberal Constitutionalist  Party activists protested outside the National Assembly building  to demand that the Military Code be rejected.</p>

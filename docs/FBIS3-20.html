			<p>In     an apparent effort to gain more influence over Polish TV and  Radio, President Lech Walesa fired Marek Markiewicz, the chairman  of the Polish Radio and TV Council whom he had selected a year  ago, after Markiewicz disregarded Walesa's objections to the  Council's candidate for exclusive national broadcasting rights.  Despite Walesa's repeated assertions that Zygmunt Solorz, an  emigre businessman and head of Polsat satellite television  network, was not a "suitable" candidate for an exclusive license  to broadcast nationally (26 February, Warsaw TV), the Council  formalized its agreement with Solorz on 1 March.  In stating his  objections, Walesa pointed to press reports raising questions  about what Rzeczpospolita called a Solorz biography "full of  mystery and insinuation" (Rzeczpospolita, 25 February).     Apparently referring to reports of Polsat employees' connections  with the former communist government, Walesa responded to the  Council's 27 January declaration that Polsat won the broadcasting  license by accusing the Council of placing private television  "into communist hands" (Gazeta Wyborcza, 29-30 January).  Gazeta  Wyborcza also cited a London Financial Times report asserting  that Polsat was heavily backed by British press mogul Rupert  Murdoch, contradicting Solorz's claim that his bid was "purely  Polish."  During a news conference following the signing of  Solorz's license, Markiewicz said that his conversation with the  president over the license had been "unpleasant" and that Walesa  had accused the Council of "accepting a bribe" (PAP, 1 March).     Walesa has often expressed his dissatisfaction with Markiewicz  and the the Council since the fall of 1993 and may be using the  selection of Solorz as an opportunity to create a Council more  disposed to accept his advice.  Walesa, who has the right by law  to appoint three members to the nine-member council, selected  Markiewicz, a leading member of the Solidarity trade union, last  March when the president was attempting to improve his relations  with the trade union (Rzeczpospolita, 10 March 1993).  However,  as his relations with Solidarity grew increasingly sour  (Rzeczpospolita, 28 June 1993) and after the Council had  apparently ignored Walesa's advice, Walesa began to criticize  Markiewicz and the Council.  For example, Walesa objected to  Markiewicz's announcement in June that the Council would crack  down on private stations that were broadcasting without the  Council's authority (PAP, 18 June 1993).  He became even more  critical of the Council in November, when the Council appointed a  former director of Solorz's Polsat to replace Walesa stalwart and  current presidential adviser Janusz Zaorski as head of public  television.  Walesa called the appointment a "major mistake"  (Rzeczpospolita, 16 November 1993) and, shortly thereafter,  forced the Council out of its office in the Belweder  (Rzeczpospolita, 16 December 1993), demanding that the three  members whom he had selected resign their posts immediately (PAP,  8 December 1993).  As yet, none of the three has complied.     (AUTHOR:  MIHAILOVICH.  QUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENTS, PLEASE CALL  CHIEF ANALYST/ELAG  (703) 733-6120)  ELAG/GILISON/CL 9/1952Z MAR</p>

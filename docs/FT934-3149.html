			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / World Trade News: President apologises for rice decision President Kim Young-sam yesterday apologised to the South Korean people for breaking a presidential campaign promise to protect rice farmers from imports and announced that the country had to open the market to avoid economic isolation. 'Are we to live as an orphan by rejecting the Gatt system, or lead our country toward globalisation and internationalisation by accepting the Gatt framework?' he asked. The government would draw up measures to compensate farmers for losses they would suffer as a result of the opening of the agricultural market, he said. South Korea is now negotiating in Geneva on terms governing the gradual opening of the market for rice and 14 other agricultural products as part of the Uruguay Round of trade talks. The rice issue has developed into a political crisis for the government, with farmers and students holding sometimes violent demonstrations in Seoul and other parts of the country this week to protest against the market-opening decision. One opinion poll yesterday reported that 60 per cent of Koreans were opposed to the opening of the rice market, while political analysts fault the president for having done little to prepare the public for the change in government policy. Criticism of the government's handling of the problem is likely to lead to a reshuffle of economic ministers and presidential advisers in the next few weeks. Japan's ruling coalition decided to delay until tomorrow or even later a decision on whether to remove a blanket ban on rice imports, the Kyodo news agency reported yesterday, Reuter adds from Tokyo. The postponement came after a meeting of the leaders of parties in the fragile coalition, Kyodo said. Earlier this week, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, had said he wanted to announce the formal decision by today to accept a Gatt compromise proposal to allow minimum imports of rice for six years in exchange for the scrapping of a Gatt demand to replace the blanket ban with tariffs.</p>

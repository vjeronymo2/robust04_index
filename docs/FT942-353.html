			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Italy hails success of Ina sell-off The Italian Treasury yesterday proclaimed the privatisation of Ina a success, and closed the public offer of shares in the Italian insurer three days ahead of schedule. More than 400,000 Italian investors were said to have applied for shares. The issue was more than fully subscribed by Monday night, defying recent turbulence on Italian and world stock markets. The Treasury, which is selling 51 per cent of its 100 per cent stake in Ina, opened the sale on Monday at a price of L2,400 a share. The issue, which includes an international offer, should raise more than L4,800bn (Dollars 3.1bn) to help cut Italian public debt. Most Italian newspapers announced yesterday morning that the Ina shares were 'sold out'. This unsettled Ina's advisers, who were afraid that small shareholders might not bother applying yesterday. As the first big privatisation by the new government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the outcome is being carefully watched by investors and political pundits. Any hint that it is less successful than preceding bank sell-offs could be construed as government inability to maintain popular momentum for the much larger sales expected within the next year. These include Stet, the telecommunications holding company; Enel, the electricity generator; and parts of Eni, the energy and chemicals group.</p>

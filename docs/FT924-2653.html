			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Letter: Statistical barrier to growth Sir, I was interested to read 'Difficult marriage of Customs' (December 7). My own business of 23 years' standing imports motor spares which are sold on the home market or exported. It is a small but very high-volume business operated by myself, my wife and one employee. During this recession we have been forced to work many hours each week, harder than ever before, just to stay in business. On top of this we now have to find extra time in order to produce statistical records for the government - on pain of criminal penalties. We are told to export our way out of the recession but the paperwork requirement for exporters will ensure that I keep well under the exporter's Intrastat limit even if it means losing business. Surely the idea of joining the EC was to make trading easier and not to stifle it. Ironically it will be far easier to export to countries outside the EC] David W Edgington, EB Spares, 31 Link Road, West Wilts Trading Estate, Westbury, Wiltshire BA 13 4JB</p>

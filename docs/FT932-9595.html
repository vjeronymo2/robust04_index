			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scottish Tories meet in upbeat mood SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVES gathering in Edinburgh yesterday were more cheerful than they usually are on the first day of their party conference. Usually the mood on the first day is nervous and tentative, with delegates conscious of being an unpopular minority which does badly in elections. But after last year's general election in which, against all predictions, the Tories won two seats and slightly increased their share of the vote in Scotland, there was a feeling that they were no longer an imperilled species. They found it difficult to comprehend fully the scale of anxiety sweeping their party at Westminster after the Newbury by-election and the drubbing the Tories suffered in the county council elections. There were no local elections last week in Scotland. For the first time in years a Conservative administration at the Scottish Office is not looking beleaguered. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, enjoys apparently effortless supremacy over his opponents in the Commons. The political storms which have shaken the government have largely passed Scotland by. Scotland has suffered recession, but not nearly as badly as the south. Its unemployment rate is still 9.6 per cent but, unprecedentedly, that is lower than in any other region of the UK except East Anglia. Yet important warnings were delivered to the ministers sitting on the platform yesterday. Apart from disquiet over Scottish water, speakers complained about the imposition of value added tax on home heating bills in the Budget, and on changes to petroleum revenue tax which are likely to reduce spending on exploration in the North Sea. Mr Adrian Shinwell, Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association president, referred to these criticisms when he said: 'There are certain policies and proposals which have caused disquiet among our membership, and as your president I would be failing in my responsibilities if I sought to deny that or ignore it.' The VAT increase will particularly affect Scotland because of its cold climate, while north-east Scotland depends heavily on the North Sea oil industry. Mr John Young, a Tory councillor from Glasgow, pointed out that the first 8 per cent tranche of the imposition of VAT would come next year just before elections for the European parliament, in which there are no Scottish Tory MPs. The second tranche would come the following year when elections might be held for new single-tier councils.</p>

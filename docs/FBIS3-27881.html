Thus,  our government is studying measures for this.    On 31 January, a relevant government official said that  "during the 1991 ROK-U.S. annual security consultative  conference, the ROK promised the United States that it would  take up an additional $10 million in defense expenses when  facilities are expanded in the event of Patriot missiles  deployment in the ROK." He added that "this amount, however,  was calculated on the condition that the missiles will be  deployed on a base in Osan that is already being used by U.S.  Forces in the ROK. Therefore, if the United States wants to use  another base, it is likely that the United States will demand  that the ROK be responsible for a considerable amount of  additional expenses."    The official noted that "it is not clear at this point  whether the United States will use the Osan base when it deploys  the missiles or not. However, there is a great possibility that  the United States will request a new base or a base in another  area to deploy the missiles."    The official said that "in that case, the afore-mentioned  agreement would be nullified. Therefore, the United States will  demand a drasticallly increased amount of defense burdensharing  by the ROK in the name of securing facilities and the like."</p>

"In connection with the fact that the world  around us is not nonnuclear, we are against signing an agreement  between Clinton, Kravchuk, and Yeltsin." Mr. Ratushnyy noted  that the Ukraine Republican Party considers the signing of an  agreement on depriving Ukraine of its nuclear arsenal to be a  betrayal of Ukrainian interests. "We do not believe American  promises. America looks after its own interests first and  foremost, and the Ukrainian Government should look after its  Ukrainian interests, which it does not do."</p>

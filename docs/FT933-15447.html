			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Global emerging markets reveal ascendant form EMERGING stock markets put in a strong showing in 1992, according to data released this week by the International Finance Corporation in its annual factbook*. The figures reveal that emerging markets took eight of the top 10 places in a list of 54 countries, including all of the mature equity markets in the world. The greatest gains, measured in dollar terms, came from Jamaica, Peru and China. Market liquidity and high performance do not exactly go hand in hand. None of the top three appear in the IFC's investable indices, launched earlier this year, which take into account restrictions on foreign investment. The data also confirm that emerging markets remain among the most volatile in the world, taking nine of the bottom 10 places. The IFC, a subsidiary of the World Bank, comments that there has been rapid growth among the world's emerging markets over the past decade. Taken as a group, market capitalisation has increased by about 11 times, and trading volume by 25 times, while the Mexican, Korean and Taiwanese markets are among the 15 largest markets in the world as measured by market capitalisation. The IFC notes a number of trends which have fuelled growth in emerging markets recently and are likely to maintain the momentum in the 1990s. These include: the adoption by many dev-eloping countries of more market-orientated policies; the opening of hitherto closed sectors, such as commercial banking, to overseas investors; the restructuring of the corporate sectors in many markets; privatisation of state-owned companies, especially in Latin America and south-east Asia. So far this year Turkey leads the field, showing a gain in dollar terms of more than 120 per cent; and in spite of a setback this week following a resurgence of violence by the Kurds, most analysts believe that its record run remains on course. The market has been encouraged by the election of Ms Tansu Ciller as prime minister on hopes that she will be able to push through economic reforms aimed at reducing inflation and controlling the budget deficit. A series of privatisations is also being anticipated. Schroder Securities in London, in its monthly commentary on the Turkish market, notes that during the week in which Ms Ciller was elected to office  -June 13 to June 18 - the composite index appreciated by some 18 per cent. 'Excess liquidity and Ms Ciller's success in forming a cabinet seems likely to keep the bull market running for at least the rest of the year; while the prospect of half-year results due out by the end of July is likely to create speculative buying this month,' the report observes. Given the more optimistic economic, political and corporate picture, the brokers forecast a level of between 14,000 to 15,000 for the composite index by the end of the year. Asian markets have generally performed positively this year. However, Asia Equity in its quarterly review cautions against excess enthusiasm. Mr Stephen Brown writes that while headline GDP growth among the Asian economies looks impressive, 'it is far from balanced within each economy and, as each country's equity market is far from being a representative cross-section of the respective underlying economies, this is translating into intermittent and sectorally orientated growth'. He favours Hong Kong and Singapore over the next quarter, underweighting Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. In Latin America, Peru eased back a little on profit-taking after reaching an historic high, according to Latin American Securities in London. The market has been encouraged by the recent launch of the first private pension funds, success in securing new international loans, the reduction of various import and luxury taxes and good economic data. In addition, the normalising of relations between Venezuela and Peru, says Latin American Securities, will ensure that Peru can now take part in regional trade discussions.

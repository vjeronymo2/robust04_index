			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Arts: 'Annie' gets it right - Theatre Modern musicals have become very sophisticated, so it takes a while to re-acclimatise to the simpler and more innocent world of Irving Berlin: perhaps five minutes. Annie Get Your Gun is a masterpiece. Roger Redfarn's wonderful production takes off with one of the early and least known songs, 'You Can't Get a Man with a Gun'. The song is both dramatic and prophetic, for it gives the full stage to Annie, allowing her to maraud around with a rifle, firing and singing at the same time, and the words turn out to be true since, as Annie realises at the end, indeed you can't get a man with a gun. In a shooting competition with a man, nice girls learn to finish second. Other songs come flowing back. Who would have thought it was possible to have 'There's No Business Like Show Business', 'Falling in Love is Wonderful', 'My Defences are Down', 'I Got the Sun in the Morning', and 'Anything You can Do' all in the same show? Moreover, those are only the most familiar numbers. Almost as much pleasure is to be had from the change in style to 'Moonshine Lullaby' and the simplicity of 'An Old Fashioned Wedding'. This is not an exercise in nostalgia for the over-40s. Annie is as fresh today as it can have ever been. It is based on the simplest of plots with a slight twist: not so much boy meets girl as girl meets boy. Few musicals can have told the story better. Here is a wild female spirit who decides to tame herself to get her man. It is also a story about the sheer joy as well as the grind of show business: hence the famous song. 'No Business' ought to be the marching song of the theatrical profession. Berlin had the genius to be sentimental without being soppy. I wonder if anyone can listen to 'Falling in Love is Wonderful' without being moved. He could do dramatic switches as well. The reprise of 'Falling in Love' comes immediately after the hugely raucous 'I Got the Sun in the Morning'. From the stage being packed with people dancing and singing in evening dress, we return suddenly to the simplicity of Annie and the man she loves. Above all, the piece abounds with self-confidence. The words are as good as the tunes. The diction is clear, nothing is slurred, and the songs do not repeat themselves. Some of them go on for verse after verse with new words. Nothing is overdone. Children on stage do not steal the show, and Chief Sitting Bull does not force any comments about the treatment of American Indians. Everyone is in this show together. If the original self-confidence came from Berlin's book and lyrics, Redfarn's direction and the choreography by Gillian Gregory pick up where Berlin left off. Seldom has one seen a production that gets so deliberately stronger and stronger as it goes on. The party scene in the second act is big theatre. So is the final shooting scene, but the smaller scenes in act one are needed in order to make the full impact. Annie is played by the American Kim Criswell. As the title suggests, it is the part in the show and she performs immaculately. She would not be able to do so with such conviction, however, without the total support of the rest of the cast from John Diedrich (the man she falls for) down to the extras. Diedrich is an impeccable straight male lead who can sing, shoot and act. Here is one of the most professional productions on a London stage. It has arrived in association with the Theatre Royal, Plymouth whose specialisation in musicals over the last few years is paying off many times over. Buddy, which also came from Plymouth, is still running in the West End. Barnum follows next month. Prince of Wales Theatre. (071) 839 5972</p>

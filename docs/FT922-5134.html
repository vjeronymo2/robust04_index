			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: CSR in the red after ADollars 558m write-down CSR, the Australian sugar and building products group, yesterday reported a net loss of ADollars 385m (USDollars 291.6m) for the year to the end of March, after taking account of a ADollars 558m write-down of asset values. Net profit before taking abnormal items into account fell by 46 per cent to ADollars 175m. The loss was in line with expectations following earlier profit warnings and the publication in April of a ruling by the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) on the accounting treatment of the write-down. CSR announced earlier this year it had written down the value of plant, equipment, goodwill and trademarks by ADollars 558m in order to comply with accounting standards requiring assets to be accounted at recoverable values. The directors reduced the final dividend to 10 cents, fully franked, from 16 cents last year. The total dividend will be 20 cents, fully franked, compared with 32 cents last year. Mr Ian Burgess, managing director, said conditions in CSR's main markets had deteriorated for the second successive year. Sugar prices fell 20 per cent, and construction activity fell 10 per cent in Australia and 12 per cent in the group's US markets. Mr Burgess said economic recovery in the US and Australia was patchy. There was little evidence that real strength would return before 1993. However, the group's prospects remained strong because of its low gearing and conservatively valued assets. The group had intended to treat the asset-value write-down as an extraordinary loss. This would have avoided the need to reduce 1991-92 net profits, which it had earlier forecast would fall to less than ADollars 200m. However, the ASC said the write-down should be treated as an abnormal loss, which required CSR to deduct the amount from trading profits. CSR was given court approval recently to transfer ADollars 558m from its share premium reserve to the profit and loss account to offset the impact of the write-down on retained profits. Bruce Jacques in Sydney writes: The Australian grocery group Davids Holdings has launched a Dollars A120m takeover offer for Queensland-based QIW Retailers. If successful, the bid would increase Davids' domination of the eastern states grocery business, lifting its national market share from around 15 to almost 18 per cent. Davids has annual revenues of about ADollars 3.3m. QIW is the largest grocery wholesaler in Queensland, with a 15 per cent share of that market. Davids is offering ADollars 6.75 cash a share, and intends to sell its holding down to 55 per cent and keep QIW listed, but the two companies' operations would be merged. Davids directors said the Trade Practices Commission had advised it would not oppose the QIW bid. The offer represents a change of tack for Davids, which was until yesterday concentrating its expansion in Western Australia and South Australia.</p>

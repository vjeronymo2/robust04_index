			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Gondusov and Mikhail </F> Shevtsov]    [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS -- Chechen officials have  described today's operation to localise and disarm rebellious  groups which led to bloodshed in Groznyy as "internal score  settling."    Chechen law enforcement bodies stormed the buildings seized  by rebels led by Labazanov and Suleymanov who organised a mutiny  against Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev's rule. Casualties  were reported on both sides.    Such an outcome had long been foreseen by Chechen leaders  who  repeatedly insisted on the disarmament of illegal groupings.  Last Saturday, Groznyy's military commandant ordered the  leaders of illegal armed groups to surrender and hand in their  arms.    The National Security Department officially charged one of  the most influential field commanders Ruslan Labazanov with  destabilising the situation in the republic. Labazanov once  served as Dudayev's adviser but later the Chechen leader  distanced himself from Labazanov who is now said to be in charge  of a group of several hundred people.    The rebels led by Labazanov and Suleymanov equipped with  firearms and seven armoured vehicles marched to the centre of  the city this past weekend and presented a list of demands to  Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev and his government. The  government unsuccessfully tried to settle the conflict through  negotiations, but after long and fruitless debates rebels opened  fire on the headquarters of the National Security Department and  attempted to stage a rally on the central square.    By 4 a.m. presidential forces sealed off the rebels in one  of  the districts of the city and after a long fight involving  armoured vehicles stormed four five-storey houses they occupied.    About 15 to 20 people were wounded on both sides. The  government troops lost eight people, including the commander of  a task-force unit, Khamzat Khankarov.    One of the rebel leaders, Suleymanov, was arrested and  hospitalised in a critical condition. The fate of Labazanov  remains unknown. The search for the rest is underway.    The Chechen Government is holding an emergency session to  discuss the situation and ways to normalise it.    Informed sources said that the opposition of the Nadterechny  and other "rebellious" districts was not involved in the  incident.    Commenting on the situation in the republic, Yaragi  Mamodayev, leader of the government of "Popular Trust" who was  recently banished from the republic, stressed that Dudayev has  no other alternative but national reconciliation.    Mamodayev calls for forming a coalition government which he  is ready to head and for the soonest Russian-Chechen talks.    "We do not want confrontation or opposition between the  Chechen people. We call for reconciliation and a political  dialogue," he said.</p>

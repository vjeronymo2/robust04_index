At the meeting provincial party Secretary Yin  Kesheng made an important speech on agriculture, rural and  pastoral area economic development, and on deepening reform in  rural and pastoral areas. Leading comrades from prefectures,  cities, and counties throughout the province seriously discussed  Comrade Yin Kesheng's speech and the provincial authorities'  proposals on implementing the party Central Committee's and the  State Council's policies concerning agricultural and rural  economic development. Governor Tian Chengping summed up the  meeting. Provincial party and government leaders Yin Keshing,  Wang Hanmin, and Yao Xiangcheng attended the meeting on 24  January. Vice Governor Ma Yuanbiao chaired the meeting.    After reviewing the province's achievements in agriculture  and animal husbandry and analyzing existing problems, Governor  Tian Chengping pointed out: More than 70 percent of the  province's population is in rural and pastoral areas, this is  Qinghai's basic situation. Strengthening the basic position of  agriculture and animal husbandry and bringing about overall  economic development in rural and pastoral areas will help  resolve the masses' inadequate food and clothing and enable them  to move toward moderate prosperity. This also serves as a basis  for social stability. [passage omitted]    Governor Tian Chengping pointed out: In the course of  developing the socialist market economy, we should help the  peasants and herdsmen with their production and operations  according to market demands. This is our basic task at present.  All levels of party committees and governments should help  optimize the distribution of resources, adjust the production  structure, develop rural and pastoral area economies, and  increase the peasants and herdmen's incomes. They should take  this as the departure point in their work.    Energetically developing township and town enterprises is a  strategic point in invigorating rural and pastoral area  economies. In development of township and town enterprises,  attention should be paid to two points: The first is increasing  the aggregate amount, and the second is improving economic  returns. In market competition, agriculture and animal  husbandry are very weak in withstanding the pressure of  competition. Therefore all levels of governments and  departments should work out measures to protect them, formulate  rational grain price protection policies, form a grain reserve  system and a grain risk-bearing fund, and control and regulate  markets by economic means.

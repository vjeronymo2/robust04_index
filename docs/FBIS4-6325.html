			<p>BFN     [Text] North Korea sent a telephone message today to our  side in the name of Paek In-chun, chairman of the North Side's  Headquarters of the Pannational Alliance for the Country's  Reunification [Pomminyon], informing us that it will send a  delegation to the 100-day memorial services for late Rev. Mun  Ik-hwan slated for 27 April. The telephone message proposed that  a working-level contact be held to discuss this matter on 22  April in Panmunjom.    The National Unification Board announced that it will not  respond to this proposal, claiming that Pomminyon has not only  been described in the domestic laws as a pro-enemy organization  but the proposal will not be conducive to alleviating today's  tense North-South relations created by the nuclear issue.</p>

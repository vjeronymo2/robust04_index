			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Denmark's MPs may decide on Maastricht pact DENMARK'S parliament may take responsibility for approving any new deal on the Maastricht treaty rather than putting the matter to another referendum. It suffered a humiliating defeat when Danish voters rejected the pact - which it had supported strongly - in a referendum early last month. However, several leading politicians said yesterday after a meeting of the Folketing's powerful Market Affairs Committee that when Denmark's future relationship with the European Community had been worked out, MPs might settle for approval by a qualified majority vote in the Folketing. Denmark is likely to seek a deal which enables it to opt out of those parts of the Maastricht treaty to which the electorate is thought to be most strongly opposed, while participating in other parts to which the electorate is thought to be less averse. For example, Denmark will not agree to participate in any form of European defence policy and will not commit itself to economic and monetary union (Emu) or to the treaty's clauses on police and legal co-operation. But there is no objection to the sections on environment policy or the so-called social dimension. The Danes' negotiating position with their partners is quite strong, as the treaty cannot be implemented without the signatures of all 12 member states. The exact shape of the agreement they are seeking is still very much a matter for speculation and discussions in the country are only in the early stages. The other 11 EC member states will begin to react only when they have seen what the Danes propose. However, two things can be ruled out. First, there will be no new referendum on an unchanged treaty text. Second, Denmark will not demand a completely new Maastricht treaty. An official of the prime minister's office denied yesterday a news agency report that the country would seek a new basis for the treaty. Since the referendum, the two-party conservative-liberal minority government headed by Mr Poul Schluter has closely involved all eight parties represented in the Folketing - including the two 'No-to-Maastricht' parties, the right-wing populist Progress Party and the left-wing Socialist People's Party - in the discussions on what Denmark's next step should be. A more precise idea of what Denmark wants will emerge when a white paper setting out the options is published in the autumn, after the French referendum on September 20. Significantly, The opposition Social Democratic Party (pro-Maastricht) and the Socialist People's Party (anti-Maastricht) do not rule out parliamentary, as opposed to popular, approval. Constitutionally, this would be in order. A treaty devolving sovereignty to an international organisation must be approved either by a five-sixths majority in the Folketing or by a referendum. As the kind of deal which Denmark will probably seek is unlikely to involve new devolution of sovereignty, even a majority of less than five-sixths would be sufficient. A RECORD 76 per cent of French voters believe they are badly governed, a level of discontent that could affect the September referendum on European union, according to an opinion poll published yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. The BVA-Paris Match poll did not ask about voting intentions in the September 20 referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, but Mr Pierre Giacometti, BVA political director, said the Socialist government's deep unpopularity could trigger a protest vote. Asked whether they were satisfied or discontented with the way France was governed, 30 per cent said they were very discontented and 46 per cent rather discontented.  Seventeen per cent said they were rather satisfied and only one per cent said they were very satisfied. The number of people with a good opinion of President Francois Mitterrand fell by three points to 35 per cent and Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy's rating fell by seven points to 41 per cent.

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: US example shows how to align executive pay with shareholder interests Sir, The issue of executive pay raised by BP's recent annual meeting (Management, April 15) goes beyond the immediate and emotive subject of the satisfactory renewal of a share option scheme. In the US, where executive pay generates equal controversy, there is a recognition that companies can, with careful planning, succeed in meeting investors' demands to align executive and shareholder interests. This works where the performance measures used to determine incentive awards at the end of the period are the same ones used by executives to make critical business decisions, such as capital allocation, as well as being the key indicators tracked by analysts when they are making share-price recommendations. In other words, the company and its investors clearly understand what drives shareholder value and efforts in that direction are appropriately rewarded. This way, shareholders see that incentives focus executives on the right things and executives are offered an opportunity to share in the wealth they create. I suspect companies which find themselves some way, but not all of the way, down this road will have a difficult relationship with their shareholders until these measures are identified, and are clearly spelt out. It is interesting to note that, if you were fortunate enough to invest in companies that manage their assets in this way and insist that remuneration of the decision-makers is highly sensitive to company share price, your portfolio would have significantly outperformed the stock market in recent years. Shareholders might wish to bear this in mind when the next AGM comes around. Simon Patterson, Strategic Compensation Associates, Regent Street Arcade, 19-25 Argyll Street, London W1V 1AA</p>

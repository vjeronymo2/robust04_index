			<p>BFN     [Text] The Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and Japan New  Party [JNP] agreed on 16 May that in order to solicit the  cooperation of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in  Diet affairs, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata should suggest during  his meeting with SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama on the  afternoon of 17 May the disbanding of the "Kaishin" group in the  House of Representatives, the formation of which triggered the  SDPJ's secession from the coalition government.    DSP Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa informed the prime  minister of this decision by phone.    Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which forms "Kaishin"  together with the DSP and JNP, is against the disbanding of the  group. Depending on Hata's decision on this matter, discord  among the ruling parties on the issue of whether or not to  retain "Kaishin" may be aggravated.    Since the SDPJ left the coalition, there has been an  increasing number of DSP and JNP members who support the opinion  that "the Kaishin issue should be reconsidered with a clean  slate to search for ways to bring the SDPJ back to the  coalition." In view of such a mood in their parties, Yonezawa  and JNP Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka met at the Diet  building on 16 May. They agreed to ask the prime minister to  state that "he is willing to consider disbanding Kaishin" at his  talks with Murayama on 17 May.    While the "Kaishin" group has been formally organized, it  has  not been functioning at all. Even if the prime minister  expresses his willingness to dissolve "Kaishin," it is nearly  impossible for the SDPJ to return to the coalition immediately.  It is believed that in return for disbanding "Kaishin," the  ruling parties would like to solicit the SDPJ's cooperation in  the deliberation on the fiscal 1994 budget, the handling of the  proposed resolution to dismiss the chairman of the House of  Representatives Committee on Rules and Administration, the issue  of summoning former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa (JNP head)  and his former secretary to testify in Diet, and other matters  of steering Diet affairs.    It has also been reported that during a telephone  conversation with Matsuoka [on the Kaishin issue], Hosokawa told  Matsuoka to "listen carefully to what the parties concerned  think."</p>

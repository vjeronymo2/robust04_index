			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: PRIZE-WINNING APPLE PIE WAS 35 YEARS IN THE MAKING  </P> <P> Lola Mefferd of Bellflower baked the best apple pie in the state this year,  according to judges at the Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona.  </P> <P> Mefferd was declared the 1990 blue-ribbon winner last month over 95 other  apple-pie entries in the American Pie Celebration contest. She won an  expense-paid trip for two and a chance to represent California in the national  finals in New Orleans next spring.  </P> <P> "I'm still four feet off the ground," she said. "It was such a pleasant day.  Everything just fell into place."  </P> <P> Mefferd said she and her husband, Richard, also celebrated their 38th wedding  anniversary Sept. 16, the day she won.  </P> <P> "I was also elated I won in Pomona, which is the city where I was born," said  Mefferd, 56.  </P> <P> Mefferd has been entering baking contests at the fair for more than 35 years  and has more than 100 ribbons and awards for her cooking. But this is the first  time she has won the big prize.  </P> <P> Mable Harris, 72, who has been judging pies, cakes and pickles for the last 46  years at the fair, said Mefferd's entry "was just a perfect pie. It was not too  tart nor too sweet. It was very attractive, and it tasted good."  </P> <P> Harris also gave Mefferd marks for originality. The golden crust of the 10-inch  pie was shaped like leaf petals. There was just the right combination of sugar  and spices, Harris said.  </P> <P> At the national Pie Bake Off contest, sponsored by Crisco, Mefferd will pit her  apple pie against varied pastries, including cherry, pecan and meat pies. "I  get nervous just thinking about it," said Mefferd, a receptionist for Kaiser  Permanente Medical Center in Bellflower.  </P> <P> But she need not fret, because she will be accompanied by her best critic and  supporter, her husband. "I always taste her food and tell her just how I feel  about it," said Richard Mefferd, 59, a mechanical engineer. "I knew her apple  pie would win. It was just right."  </P> <P> Bellflower City Council members also know a good pie when they taste one. After  she won, the council invited Mefferd to a meeting to receive a plaque in honor  of her achievement.  </P> <P> She baked an apple pie for the council, and they ate it all.  </P> <P> Danielle Thill, 12, of Long Beach was recently chosen to dance with the New  York City Ballet at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Thill was one of four girls selected to dance with the company during last  month's performance of George Balanchine's ballet "Mozartiana." Sixty-two  dancers auditioned.  </P> <P> "I was really excited. I never auditioned for anything," said Thill, who is a  seventh-grader at Hughes Middle School in Long Beach. She also is a student at  the Ballet Arts Center in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Longtime Santa Fe Springs resident Glen Bartunek will be inducted into the  Kearney State College Athletic Hall of Fame in Kearney, Neb., during the  school's homecoming banquet Friday.  </P> <P> Bartunek, 78, was a star athlete at the school in football, basketball and  track in 1935-41.  </P> <P> Bartunek and his wife, Ann, 74, will attend the college's football game  Saturday against New Mexico Highlands University.  </P> <P> The couple moved to Santa Fe Springs in 1952. Ann was one of the civic leaders  who helped incorporate the city in 1957.  </P> <P> Linda Parra has been hired as recreation supervisor for the Pico Rivera  Recreation and Community Services Department. In the newly created position,  Parra, 23, will develop anti-drug abuse and gang prevention programs for  youths.  </P> <P> Parra was born in Pico Rivera and graduated from El Rancho High School. She is  a graduate of UCLA with a bachelor's degree in psychology. Parra has worked as  a gang counselor with the county's Community Youth Gang Services.  </P> <P> * Long Beach dentist E.B.

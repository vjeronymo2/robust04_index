			<p>BFN     [Text] The massacre by Greek terrorists on Albanian  soldiers has caused outrage among the Albanian people of Kosova,  a telegram from President Rugova sent to Albanian President Dr.  Sali Berisha reads.    We strongly condemn this act of terror and ask the  international community to draw Greece's attention to it and  condemn the insurgency of terrorist groups in the Republic of  Albania, the telegram states.    We urge Greece and the Greek people -- who, along with the  Albanians, is the most ancient people in the Balkans -- to be  more reasonable and contribute to good neighborliness with the  Albanians.    Both personally and in the name of the people of the  Republic  of Kosova, President Rugova expressed his condolences and  support to the families of the deceased.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A REASONABLE PLAN FOR MASS TRANSIT IN COUNTY  </P> <P> Carl Schiermeyer in his Commentary (Jan. 15) produced some interesting data  regarding existing rail transportation through Orange County. Building more  sections of double track is a must and upgrading maintenance on the rolling  stock mandatory, but these measures are mere Band-Aids on an already crisis  transit situation. This is not to say that these measures should not be pursued  immediately but that additional rail corridors should be on the drawing boards  now.  </P> <P> The San Joaquin Freeway, which is estimated to cost $409 million, a portion of  which is to come from user fees in the form of tolls, can only exacerbate our  transportation woes. A rail system is the only user fee that can and will  relieve motorized congestion. If, indeed, the purpose of the San Joaquin Hills  Corridor is to forestall freeway gridlock and not, as many believe, open more  land for development, then let the planners seek some real solutions to the  transit mess.  </P> <P> What if we build a rail system in that corridor with depots only in the  populated areas? What if that system would ultimately link all the coastal  communities into Long Beach and beyond right into Los Angeles? Is it not  possible that many would give up those second cars?  </P> <P> Would it not be possible for business and industry to provide van service for  employees to and from the railroad stations? Turn some of the vast parking lots  needed to provide employee parking to better use as child-care centers or  parks. I would hope that the San Bernardino and Riverside communities would  join in the effort to link all those Orange County and Los Angeles working  people with an easier and more economical commute.  </P> <P> Is it too much to ask that if we must endure the haphazard growth that the  despoilers of the environment have inflicted on us and future generations, that  we must also be a party to their Neanderthal notion that more freeways are the  answer to the problems they have in part created?  </P> <P> MARY LOU RIPLEY  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

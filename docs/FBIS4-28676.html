			<p>BFN     [Text] These days, the South Korean puppet clique are all  the more running amok in the maneuvers to take sanctions on our  Republic by ganging up with international reactionary forces,  such as the United States and Japan.    According to a radio report from Seoul, traitor Kim Yong-sam  had a telephone dialogue with U.S. President Clinton on 10 June  and babbled that sanctions against North must be promoted  continuously, and in a telephone dialogue with Japanese Prime  Minister Hata on 9 June, he said that sanctions by the United  Nations against the North is inevitable.    On 11 June, the puppet National Unification Board Minister  Yi  Hong-ku and the puppet Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu separately  met U.S. Undersecretary of State Tarnoff who flew into Seoul and  babbled that the UN Security Council's sanctions against the  North are inevitable and so on.    Han Sung-chu also held talks with Japanese Foreign Minister  Kakizawa who crawled into South Korea on 11 June and said that  the current situation on the North's nuclear issue makes it  inevitable to make the UN Security Council promote sanctions.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are never-to-be condoned  nation sellers entrusting the nation's fate to the outside  forces through their acts, and all the more clearly showed that  it is a civilian fascist group pursuing only war by wearing the  mask of civilian rule.</p>

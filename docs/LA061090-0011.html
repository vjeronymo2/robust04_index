			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARTH FIRST  </P> <P> It was outstanding that the magazine would publish such an open-minded article  about Earth First! It is distressing, though, to learn how much effort was put  into pinning a case on Dave Foreman. I'm sure he was targeted only because he  is an effective spokesman for a popular cause threatening moneyed interests. I  hope nearly as much effort is being invested in investigating fraud and  criminal activity in all the savings-and-loan association failures.  </P> <P> THOMAS E.

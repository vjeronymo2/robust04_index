This project is a search for a  three-terminal device using high-temperature superconductivity  of oxides. The goal is to use superconductivity to realize  transistor operations that are the foundation of electronic  devices in use today.    Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corporation and Sumitomo Electric  Industries are individually doing research on devices with  compositions similar to field effective transistors (FET), which  control current by voltage applied at the gates.    Hitachi and Toshiba are considering devices with a structure  of a semiconductor or other normal conductor sandwiched between  superconductors. When joined together, the surface of the normal  conducting layer also becomes superconducting to some degree,  and superconductive current is exuded. This is called a  proximity effect. This effect is controlled by gate voltage or  charge input, and switching is carried out.    Research is at the stage of joining superconductor and  normal  conductor, then doing a detailed study of the resulting  performance. Hitachi is using a holmium-barium-copper oxide  superconductor and a praseodymium-barium-copper oxide (PBCO)  normal conductor, and is taking measurements at very low  temperatures. It learned that the travel distance between the  electron pair that carries superconducting current changes with  voltage or temperature, and is conducting theoretical studies to  explain this.    Toshiba is using yttrium-barium-copper oxide (YBCO) to  sandwich a PBCO layer. It is measuring performance when the  thickness of the PBCO layer is changed. It also is accumulating  techniques for joining the layers, such as lining up crystalline  orientation to make thin film.    Neither Hitachi nor Toshiba has realized operation of a  three-terminal device. It is difficult to make high quality thin  film from superconducting oxides, and, furthermore, fundamental  points such as how thick the film should be to make a good  device need to be discovered.    On the other hand, Sumitomo Electric Industries is not  studying the proximity effect; it is researching a device that  uses the superconductor itself as a channel (path for passing  current). It is looking for optimum design conditions based on  using YBCO for the superconductor, strontium titanic acid for  the substrate and insulation, and gold for electrodes.    The three terminal device was produced experimentally, and  experiments at extremely low temperatures confirmed that gate  voltage transforms superconducting current. Degree of  transformation is still too weak, but it is thought that  improvements can be made by raising the quality of the film or  making it thinner.  <H5>  [5 Nov 93 p 4] </H5>   A bipolar transistor is composed of three layers -- emitter,  base and collector. The center part, the base, holds the key to  performance. If resistance in this part is small, electrons flow  rapidly and high-speed operations are possible. A team from Oki  Electric's device technology laboratory produced an experimental  model of a transistor using a superconductor for the base layer,  and succeeded in amplifying current.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-61A>           Superconductivity </FIG>      On top of a crystalline substrate of strontium titanate  (STO)  to which 0.1% niobium had been added, a thin film of  barium-rubidium-bismuth oxide was layered, and then covered with  a film of indium. the STO substrate is the emitter, the BRBO is  the base and the indium is the collector.    BRBO beomes superconducting at absolute temperature 28  (-245C), so it was cooled slightly below that, to 20  (-253C) and then tested for operation. The current  amplification factor was 0.94 (the closer to 1 the better) at  base grounding and 10 (the bigger the better) at emitter  grounding, the first time that practical levels were achieved by  a superconducting transistor.    The thickness of the base layer was under 50 nanometers (1  nanometer is one-billionth of a meter). Although it is not easy  to make flat thin film with oxide superconductors, this was  achieved by free use of control technology in which the  molecular beam epitaxy method was used to vaporize  simultaneously four types of elements. Also, when indium was  layered onto BRBO, a thin oxide film formed on the boundary  surface, and it was found that this acted as a good link between  the base layer and the collector layer.    measurement and evaluation of performance, such as operating  speed and power consumption, are still to come. It is estimated  that operating frequency of the experimental model is about  10,000 hertz, but the goal is the high-speed operation of 1  billion hertz. It would not be worth using superconductors if  this performance level could not be achieved. The smaller the  base the better for high-speed operation, and the device  structure must be reduced from its present size of 0.5  millimeters (mm) square to 5 microns (1 micron is .001mm) square  in order to achieve this goal.    On the other hand, the Sanyo Electric Company also is doing  research on the same type of device. The difference with the Oki  Electric device is that a superconductor is used for the emitter  layer as well and an insulator is set up as a barrier between  this and the base layer to bring out sharpness.    A barium-potassium-bismuth oxide (BKBO) superconductor and  gold are layered onto a substrate of STO to which neodymium has  been added, and this is being used to confirm the basic  operation of a three-terminal device. The important point is the  insulation film between the BKBO and the gold. In the past, the  oxide film which forms naturally was used, but Sanyo is trying  to improve performance by artificially creating a thin film of  magnesium oxide.  <H5>  [8 Nov 93 p 5] </H5>   Research also is proceeding on combining superconductivity  with tunnels and other quantum effects.    The ``dielectric base transistor'' proposed by Fujitsu, Ltd.  is one of those. As expressed by the name, this uses the  superconductor STO for the base layer. The emitter and collector  layers are YBCO superconductors. Instead of simply layering  these three, thin interlayers made of other superconductors are  sandwiched between the emitter and base, and the base and  collector.    The purpose of adding interlayers is to create conditions  for  the resonant tunnel effect to occur and to bring out negative  resistance and other special qualities. Normally, quantum  devices have layers of compound semiconductor thin film, but in  this case, the same kind of device will be designed with oxide  thin film. Both the superconductor's very high-speed operation  and low power consumption and the quantum effect's multi  functionality are being sought, a very ambitious undertaking.    So far, a clear cut quantum effect has not been brought out,  but a transistor with neodymium-gallium oxide interlayers was  produced experimentally in FY90, and the basic operation of  transformation of the current flowing from the emitter to the  collector caused by the base layer's potential was confirmed at  extremely low temperatures.    However, only a small current flowed between the emitter and  the collector, even when strong voltage was applied, and the  change in current also was slight. Of course, this is only  natural since a dielectric, which does not pass electricity, is  being used, but dielectric interlayers are essential in order to  elicit the quantum effect. To solve this dilemma, the search has  continued for materials that facilitate electron permeation and  are compatible with YBCO.    Thin films of various types of oxides, such as  lanthanum-aluminum oxide and cerium oxide, were sandwiched  between STO and YBCO and tested for performance. It was found  that the same voltage increased current by 2-3 digits when  magnesium oxide was used.    With the latest test model, which has magnesium oxide thin  film interlayers that are 1 nanometer thick (a billionth of a  meter), current nearly at the practical level flowed when about  10 volts were applied at extremely low temperatures. It has a  long way to go when compared with a conventional transistor that  operates with millivolt-level voltage, but it can be said that  the shape of a usable device finally has come into view.    Whether the main goal of quantum effect can be elicited is a  problem for the future. Oxides are even more difficult than  compound semiconductors to laminate into thin film, and there is  also little research history on this subject. The process of  trial and error probably will continue in order to achieve the  goal of developing a peerless new device.  <H5>  [9 Nov 93 p 5] </H5>   In an effort to combine superconductivity and quantum  effect,  the NEC basic research laboratory is proposing to make a single  electron transistor (SET) with superconductors.    SET is a transistor that operates by controlling each  electron individually. It is one of the devices of the future on  which active research has intensified in recent years. When  extremely tiny ``islands'' are made with semiconductors, a  quantum effect called the coulomb blockade occurs, in which  electrons jump individually, not in groups, from one island to  the next. If memory or calculation functions are carried out  with the movement of one electron, the device can be extremely  small and consume almost no power.    What would be the advantage to combining this with  superconductors? It is believed that this would improve  operating speed, increase stability, etc., although there are no  definite prospects for realizing these. With superconductors,  two electrons form a pair to carry current. It would be  extremely difficult to handle electrons individually, but a  ``single electron pair transistor,'' in which groups of electron  pairs are controlled, may increase stability.    Of course, even the regular SET still is in the basic  research stage, and it would not do to skip ahead to a  superconducting SET. A team from NEC has made a tunnel junction  of aluminum and alumina (aluminum oxide) and its first goal was  to control a single electron in a normal conducting state.    A microstructure with 100 nanometer line width and 50  nanometer square junction area was cooled to extremely low  temperatures. One side was made the gate and electrons were fed  into the electrode on the opposite side. The team was able to  observe the change in potential that showed when each electron  entered the electrode. In the future, the group plans to raise  slightly the temperature at which experiments are conducted,  make a junction with superconductors and accumulate basic data.    On the other hand, Mitsubishi Electric's basic semiconductor  research laboratory is pursuing the possibility of a  micro-vacuum tube that uses superconductivity.    Thanks to advances in microprocessing technology, it has  become possible to use semiconductors to make small structures  resembling vacuum tubes. Although large-scale vacuum tubes are  anachronistic, micro-vacuum tubes are being looked at with  renewed interest because it is thought that operating functions  different from those of solid state components might be obtained  if electrons are released from the surface of a semiconductor  into a vacuum.    Mitsubishi Electric's goal is to make a tunnel junction with  superconductor and insulator layers so that vitality-filled  electrons are released sharply. As of now, basic studies are  being carried out, such as on the conditions needed to produce  high-quality, bismuth-based superconducting thin film surfaces  and on the characteristics of the experimentally produced  junctions. In the future, a micro-vacuum tube with the  capability of large current switching may be produced.</p>

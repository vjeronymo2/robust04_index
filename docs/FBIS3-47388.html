			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ramon Tomeldan] </F>   [Text] The country's balance of payments (BOP) ended with  a $92 billion deficit last year, a sharp reversal of the $353  million surplus it posted in 1992, Bangko Sentral [Central Bank]  Governor Gabriel Singson reported to President Ramos yesterday.    A burst of imports averaging 18.9 percent more than the  previous year mainly eroded the gains from financial and  non-trade dealings with the rest of the world, according to the  Bangko Sentral report.    Despite this negative turn of events, the Bangko Sentral  managed to beef up the gross international reserves (GIR) to  $5.6 billion thus boosting its capability to meet another surge  of importations this year, the report said.    Much of these dollar reserves came from foreign investments  proceeds exceeding $2 billion. A sizable portion of these  foreign funds had been placed -- in the stock market and the  high-yield, zero-risk government securities.    Last minute inflows of foreign loans, likewise, augmented  the  GIR which peaked at $6.7 billion in April, the report said.  Among these are the $480 million final tranche of a financial  sector adjustment loan from the World Bank, with Japan's  Export-Import Bank and Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF)  as co-financiers.    The Bangko Sentral also availed itself of $1.1 billion in  short-term loans using its gold holdings and securities as  collateral, to meet local dollar demand and discourage  speculations.    These borrowings caused the foreign debt stock to pile up to  $34.4 billion as of end-August, from $30.9 billion in 1992, the  report said.    The debt stock picture, however, "remained well within  acceptable international norms" considering that indicators  point to the country's sound capability to service its foreign  obligations, the report said.    The debt service ratio, for instance, reached 18.1 percent,  meaning annual payments for loan principal and interest rates  equalled that amount of dollar earned, according to the report.  That would be within the ideal ratio of 20 percent.    Singson said in the report that Bangko Sentral's operations  were marked by the following:    -- The financial restructuring of the defunct Central Bank,  giving rise to the Bangko Sentral as a well-capitalized monetary  agency;    -- Lifting of restrictions on dollar trade as part of the  continuing deregulation of the foreign exchange sector to  attract new investments;    -- A two percentage point reduction in the reserve  requirements to ease banks' cost of handling money, and bring  about a lower interest rate;    -- A sharp reduction in the loan rediscounting rate for  exporters, from 12.8 percent in March to 9.4 percent, coupled  with an increase in the loan fund to P10 billion [Philippine  pesos].</p>

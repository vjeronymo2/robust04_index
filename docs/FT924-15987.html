			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / EC pressure improves jobs rights THE government, under pressure from the European Commission, is to change the law to give more employment rights to some public-sector workers. The move follows the threat of legal action by the commission and will give more legal protection to workers who lose their jobs or are re-hired on worse terms when local-authority work is contracted out. Under the 1981 British transfer regulations, passed to comply with an EC directive, employers must honour the employment contracts they inherit when they take over or merge with other commercial ventures. However, when public-sector or other non-profit-making organisations change hands, contracts are considered terminated. The commission argues that the government is failing to enforce the directive fully and has begun proceedings to take the UK to the European court. The government has now agreed to add an amendment to its planned employment bill, due in the next parliamentary session, to extend the protection to all workers. The main effect is expected to be to benefit those employees who are adversely affected by the contracting-out of local-government work under the compulsory-tendering procedure. In some cases, companies have won contracts under which they have recruited many of the council's existing workers for lower pay, and others have been made redundant. Councils have lost 38,414 jobs as a result of tendering since March 1987, according to the Local Government Management Board. A further 2,000 jobs are expected to be removed from direct employment by March. The proposed law may deter some private contractors from bidding for contracts. Companies have been attracted by the contracts partly because they have been free to cut wage costs. The proposed law will compel employers to consult representatives of the workforce before any transfer of ownership or control. Employers do not have to consult workers unless they recognise unions. The government has agreed to strengthen the penalties employers face for breaking the law. Employers found to have breached the present regulations need pay only two weeks' wages in compensation.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: CONRAIL NAMES HILLMAN AS ITS ACTING CHIEF  </P> <P> Conrail has named Stanley E.G. Hillman acting chairman, chief executive and  president pending the selection of a permanent chief executive.  </P> <P> The move followed the death during the weekend of Chairman Richard D. Sanborn,  52, who became president of the Philadelphia-based freight railroad last March  and chief executive Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Hillman, 77, previously was president of Chicago-based IC Industries Inc. and  chief executive of its Illinois Central Gulf Railroad. IC later became Whitman  Corp. and the railroad was spun off.  </P> <P> As a director of Conrail since 1980, Hillman was chairman of the search  committee that selected Sanborn last year and served on the committee that  recommended Sanborn's predecessor, L. Stanley Crane, in 1981.  </P> <P> Conrail, the former Consolidated Rail Corp., was spun off by the government to  public shareholders in 1987.  </P> <P> Conrail said it would move as quickly as possible to find a permanent chief  executive, but added that there was no time frame for the selection. Some  analysts said the search could take several months.  </P> <P> "One of (Hillman's) major priorities, if not his major priority, will be to  look for a successor," said Provident National Bank analyst Andrew Geller.  </P> <P> Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst Burton Strauss said Conrail was in good shape  and could weather the sudden loss of Sanborn and the search for a permanent  successor.  </P> <P> "The company continues to be in fine shape," said Geller, citing Conrail's  solid freight traffic levels and productivity gains.  </P> <P> The company, whose routes cover the Northeast and Midwest, has been profitable  since 1981, and faces no major problems, analysts said.  </P> <P> Strauss said Hillman's selection gave no clue whether Conrail would select a  permanent chief from inside or outside the company. He declined to speculate on  possible contenders.  </P> <P> Several analysts have said candidates might include James Hagen, a former  Conrail senior vice president and now a senior executive at CSX Corp.; Santa Fe  Southern Pacific Corp. Vice Chairman Jonn Schwartz, and Conrail's four current  senior vice presidents.  </P></p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Smith to step up search for common ground: The opposition leader's uphill struggle for one-member-one-vote IT HAS not been a bad week for Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, whose Commons performance on Wednesday raised the flagging morale of his party and increased the government's discomfiture. But earlier in the week the three seaside union conferences which rejected the Smith plan for reforming the party's links with the unions were a rude reminder that his leadership still faces a critical summer-time test. The Smith camp, and other supporters of one-member-one-vote, are adamant that they can prevail in spite of the clear majority of votes at this year's Labour conference that will be committed against removing the unions from selection of political candidates. Mr Smith is said to be determined to have his way and, according to one official, is 'spitting blood' about the role of Mr John Edmonds, the general secretary of the GMB, in blocking his plans. If he could yet win he could boost his national leadership rating, much as Hugh Gaitskell boosted his in the 1950s by taking on the unions and the left. If he loses, some opponents and supporters believe it could be a fatal blow to his leadership. One sympathetic union official said: 'Having put the issue of union power into the limelight he cannot afford to lose. If he does lose he will not be able to say anything without being accused of being the mouthpiece of producer interests.' Over the weeks leading up to the September conference the possible compromises will no doubt be closely examined, and the committee which has examined Labour-union links may be recovened to try to find one. The trouble is that compromise between the two positions now staked out is hard to find. In order to repair some of the damage to union pride created by the anti-union tone of the debate in the immediate aftermath of election defeat, supporters of reform will emphasise how much they broadly approve of the union role in the Labour party and stress the plan to offer cut-price membership to union members. There is no obvious half-way house between one-member-one-vote and voting as a union member. GMB and Nupe officials say that political levy-payers who sign a Labour supporters register would be voting as associate members of the Labour party rather than just union members, and that the register is thus an acceptable compromise. But such a deal would be seen not as a compromise but as a victory for the union barons. The only realistic way out would be to postpone the issue for another year - but that merely leaves the problem unresolved and open to exploitation by political enemies. So how is Mr Smith going to win? Some supporters say that when the union leaders see how serious he is they will change their minds, or at least abstain, at the party conference and thus let one-member-one-vote prevail. Others suggest that although there might be a clear majority against the Smith position it will not unite around any alternative. The TGWU general union made this outcome more likely yesterday by deciding not just against the Smith position but also the GMB-Nupe register. A new system has to be established because the old one has been abolished. An impasse might give Mr Smith the opportunity to impose his own solution by default. According to some of his supporters he could make this a 'back me or sack me' issue. But would he do it? He is known more for conciliation than confrontation, and in spite of his attachment to the principle of one-member-one-vote he has never seemed convinced that a significant distancing from the trade unions is a necessary condition of a Labour victory. This could become as much a question of face as of principle for Mr Smith.</p>

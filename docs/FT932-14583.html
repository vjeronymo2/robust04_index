			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Travel Focus, Italy: To Sicily with a strawberry blonde - James Bentley is thoroughly upstaged 'WE NEED to promote Sicily,' said Dr Bevacqua, 'so I'm offering you and a friend two weeks' half-board there, plus a car.' It was October. That evening, I told my wife the good news. 'But who will pick our walnuts?' she asked. In vain I replied that this time the squirrels could have them. So then I rang my younger daughter, who lives in France. 'I'll be on the next plane from Toulouse,' she said. Her swift response was a bonus, for Emma-Jane is a strawberry blonde, and such hair drives Italian men into ecstasy. 'Che bella,' they would cry when she was little, signalling their affection by an affectionate, excruciatingly painful pinch of her cheek. I shall never forget the sight of her chubby infant legs pounding the sand as she tried to escape from yet another adoring Italiano. Immediately on our arrival in Sicily I realised that little has changed in the psyche of the Italian male since my daughter grew up. From the start, no-one spoke to me, not even the man at the car-hire, who asked her whether she or her 'grandfather' would be driving. As if I might not understand, Emma-Jane replied in Italian: 'Il mio nonno guidera.' Meanwhile, I was placing our baggage in the back seat. The car-hire attendant cautioned me. 'We are close to Catania,' he admonished. 'A couple of youths could ride by on a motorbike, smash your window and steal the cases.' So he kindly placed our luggage in the boot. As I drove away he called out: 'Be careful. They drive fast in Catania.' They certainly do. The moment we arrived there we stopped, to let my nerves calm down. Fish, meat and fruit markets abound in Catania. At the fruit stalls in little alleyways, stallholders were gingerly handling prickly pears with rubber gloves. Once you enter the inner city, the atmosphere is different, with an 18th century cathedral (it was founded seven centuries earlier), fountains and the 13th century Castello Ursino. It was time to drive north to Taormina, where our hotel was the Villa Riis. From the balcony of our room we gazed at lazily-smoking Mount Etna. I loved the hotel swimming pool and was disappointed in its food: excellently cooked, but German in style, for the hotel was filled with Germans. I prefer to eat German food in Germany, in Sicily, Sicilian food. Each evening Emma-Jane and I compensated by drinking copious quantities of Donnafugata, a wine named after the heroine of Lampedusa's Sicilian novel, The Leopard. As the citizens never fail to remind you, Guy de Maupassant once observed: 'If someone should spend one day in Sicily and ask, 'What must I see?', without hesitation I should answer Taormina.' A long narrow street guarded at both ends by a fortified gateway is flanked by crumbling buildings and centres on Piazza Duomo, which is cooled by a fountain dated 1635. The little Romanesque cathedral has a superb sculpted main doorway and another one, equally fine, on the north side. Opposite rises the town hall, above Tony's bar. Boutiques display videos depicting Etna erupting, accompanied by the strains of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. We decided to drive up the volcano. Emma-Jane collected bits of lava as presents - cheap gifts, as she put it. That evening my wife phoned. As we told her about our day, we could hear at the other end of the line the strangled sobs of one who had always wanted to climb Etna and had passed up the opportunity. On our last day in Taormina we explored the Greek theatre, rebuilt by the Romans and overlooking the sea. A guide was lecturing a group of Americans, so Emma-Jane and I free-loaded the tour. He was telling the Americans not about the theatre but about what they really relish hearing - the cost of hotels, including half-board at the Villa Riis. 'Half-board', he added, to our deathly horror, 'does not include wine.' That evening, as the waiter brought our accustomed bottle of Donnafugata, Emma-Jane declined it with the words: 'Papa has drunk a little too much today.' Lava helps to mark out the patterned walls of the finest Arabic-Romanesque building in Italy: Monreale cathedral, with its Benedictine cloister. 'To visit Sicily and not see Monreale', runs a local proverb, 'is to go as a donkey and return as a brute' (which rhymes in Italian). Among its splendours is a vast cycle of mosaics depicting scenes from the Old and New Testaments. William II, the third of the Norman kings of Sicily, founded this magnificent building in the 1170s. Who knows what else he might have commissioned had he not died at the age of 37? Sicily is a small island, and soon we reached Agrigento. Founded in 580 BC by colonists from Gela, its valley of the temples encompasses, in my view, finer buildings than Athens itself. Grooved sandstone pillars, pediments and broken columns speak of a long-dead civilisation. Under them dogs snoozed in the sun, and cats scurried where once ancient gods and goddesses were worshipped. At Agrigento, our hotel restaurant was closed, so we went to eat complex pizzas at a pizzeria along the coast. As ever, the proprietor took to a strawberry blonde, so we stayed drinking with him. The following morning he turned up at breakfast in our hotel, this time garbed as a waiter. It was time to leave for Siracusa. I was driving gently when a Catanian (recognisable by the number-plate of his car) shot past me, screeched to a crumping halt and then drove on again. He had struck a stray sheep as it wandered in the road. I drove cautiously past its flailing legs, while Emma-Jane urged me to stop and tend the dying beast. Usually she is stronger-willed than I am, but this time I resisted, and drove on to Siracusa, with its ramparts and a cathedral built on the site of a Greek temple. Siracusa is a port boasting architectural riches bequeathed by the Normans, the Aragonese, the Catalans, the Greeks and the Romans. Undoubtedly its Greek theatre is the most impressive in the western world. As a bonus, Siracusa also has a magnificent Roman amphitheatre. In the quarries that supplied the stone for these monuments are caverns in which tyrants imprisoned their enemies. One of them is an echo-chamber, where (so the guides tell you) the screams of the tortured would reverberate to terrorise other imprisoned unfortunates. I had fixed a meeting with Siracusa's head of tourism. Before we arrived I was not sure whether Vittorio Gallo had intended to give us lunch, but once he spotted my assistant he instantly suggested that we eat together. As they talked and I tucked into the fantastic fish caught off Siracusa (squids, oysters, smoked swordfish, king prawns, kippers, salmon), I congratulated myself on my foresight in arranging to be her father. James Bentley's visit to Sicily was arranged by Dr Aldo V Bevacqua of Italia nel Mondo, 6 Palace Street, London SW1E 5HY, tel: 071-828-9171.</p>

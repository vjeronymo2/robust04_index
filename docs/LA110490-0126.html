			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: SEA OF LOVE  </P> <P> The latest entry in Hollywood's environmental sweepstakes: "The Day of Two  Suns," an adventure film based on the life of Greenpeace co-founder and  chairman David McTaggart. Seattle-based producer Rick Stevenson ("Some Girls"),  who is raising hometown financing to make the feature, says that McTaggart "is  almost like a true-life Indiana Jones character."  </P> <P> Rupert Walters' script chronicles McTaggart's transformation from right-wing  tycoon to eco-activist. The film would re-create a series of confrontations  between his Rainbow Warrior trawler and the French navy, including one --  featuring an earlier Greenpeace boat -- that caused the French government to  stop atmospheric nuclear testing in 1975. McTaggart has script input, but not  approval, Stevenson says.  </P> <P> Carolco Pictures has rights to another Rainbow Warrior project, "Warriors of  the Rainbow," based on a book by Robert Hunter, a Greenpeace co-founder.  Stevenson, who's partnered with executive producer Danny Wilson, says he's not  concerned about competition.  </P> <P> "We support any project about the environment," he says. "It's too important an  issue to get territorial about." Patrick Goldstein  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The U.S. Chamber of Trade and Commerce [USCTC] in  Russia, uniting about 180 companies has recommended its members  to refrain from lending credit to juridical persons in Russia,  head of the USCTC Investment Committee George Reese said  speaking in Moscow on Tuesday.    He said that a number of Russian government officials were  informed about the move following the misinterpretation of  President Yeltsin's decree of last December by some members of  the Russian taxation bodies. They appear to interpret the  decree as a cancellation of a provision of the law on the value  added tax whereby credits are exempt from VAT. This enables tax  collectors to levy a 23 percent tax on foreign credits to  Russian juridical persons which is unacceptable to their foreign  partners, Reese said.    U.S. company officials taking part in a news conference  described the situation as extreme and demanded immediate  clarifications from the Russian government. Until then, we will  refrain from any investment here, member of the USCTC Board of  Directors Larry Anderson said.    For his part, Reese said that granting loans in conditions  of  such commercial uncertainty were fraught with dire implications  for U.S. companies. A refusal to provide credits will restrict  the flow of much-sought investment in the Russian economy, he  said.</p>

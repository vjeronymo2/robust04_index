			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Bush health care plans trouble insurers PRESIDENT George Bush's plan to reform the US health care system is creating concern among what should be his most fervent supporters: health insurance companies. Insurers have welcomed the broad outlines of the president's scheme, which would retain private insurance as the basic financing mechanism for US health care. But they are anxious over some details of the proposals, which could affect the way they conduct business. The Bush plan aims to help most of the 35m Americans who currently have no health insurance by giving them tax credits. But the plan would also prevent companies which sell group health insurance plans from refusing to cover any employer group or employee on the basis of their health status. In addition, the plan would restrict insurers' ability to vary the premiums they charge in line with their claims experience. In the longer term, the plan proposes setting up health risk pools in each state to compensate insurers who agree to cover individuals with poor health. The administration claims these and other insurance market reforms could allow businesses with fewer than 20 employees to save at least 10.9 per cent on health coverage for their employees. Some insurers worry, however, that this could turn into a state-administered welfare scheme - in fact, the kind of 'socialised' system that Mr Bush complains would result from the alternative proposals of the Democratic opposition. Insurers say that now about 3 per cent of the population could be defined as uninsurable on the basis of their past health problems. This percentage could grow, they warn, if companies are not allowed to attach waiting periods or other conditions to their coverage. However, Mr Carl Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, a Washington-based trade association, has welcomed the broad outlines of the Bush proposals. 'We agree with the president that only a strengthened private/public health insurance partnership can deliver the health care Americans need, at a price they can afford to pay, while retaining the cutting-edge quality they have grown to expect,' he said.</p>

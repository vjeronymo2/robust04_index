			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AQUINO ALLIES, FOES IN CONFRONTATION AT CONSULATE  </P> <P> As a military coup attempt unfolded in their homeland 7,000 miles away,  supporters of the rebellious soldiers engaged in a shouting match Thursday  night with supporters of President Corazon Aquino at the Philippine Consulate  in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> About 30 members of the Filipino-American Movement for a Better Philippines  held a candlelight vigil outside the consulate on Wilshire Boulevard to express  sympathy with the coup led by officers linked to renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio  Honasan.  </P> <P> "We are calling for Mrs. Aquino to step down immediately," said Milo Castelo,  45, a Los Angeles attorney. He said the Aquino government is "inept and  incompetent" and guilty of "rampant corruption."  </P> <P> Castelo and a handful of the protesters then entered the office building and  took the elevator to the 12th-floor consulate, where a coalition of four  Filipino groups in Los Angeles that support the Aquino government had just  completed a press conference.  </P> <P> Half a dozen television news crews watched as the anti-government protesters  confronted the acting consul general for the Philippines in Los Angeles, Willy  C. Gaa.  </P> <P> "We are in sympathy with the coup in the Philippines!" announced Eli Swing, 49,  a Los Angeles real estate agent.  </P> <P> The consul general remained silent, glaring at the protesters.  </P> <P> But Danny Lamila, a representative of the Philippines Liberal Party, loudly  defended the government.  </P> <P> "These people staging the coup are criminals," Lamila yelled. "They are  fugitives from justice!"  </P> <P> After a few minutes, the 20 Aquino supporters in the room began chanting "Cory!  Cory!" The anti-government protesters then left the consular offices and order  was restored.  </P> <P> Greg Santillas of the Campaign for Democracy and Independence said he believes  that most of the estimated 350,000 Filipinos living in Los Angeles County  oppose the military coup.  </P> <P> "We're here not only to support the president, but also the democratic  institutions," he said. "The military is a dangerous leftover from the  dictatorship (of Ferdinand Marcos). We don't want the government to be a  hostage to the military."  </P> <P> Also present at the press conference was Andrea Aquino, 50, the niece of  assassinated Marcos opponent Benigno Aquino, Cory Aquino's husband.  </P> <P> "I support democracy and the government against the coup," she said. "I think  it's about time these renegades are punished."  </P></p>

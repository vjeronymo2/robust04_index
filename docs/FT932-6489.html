			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Beijing to resume HK airport talks CHINA yesterday agreed to resume high-level talks with Britain about Hong Kong's airport project, ending an eight-month hiatus in negotiations for the financing of one of Asia's most ambitious infrastructure developments. The Hong Kong government said yesterday that the Airport Committee of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group would meet on Friday next week - the fourth anniversary of the suppression of the Beijing democracy movement on June 4, 1989. The committee last met in October. The prospect of the meeting buoyed the Hong Kong stock market, which rose nearly 100 points to close at a record of 7,447.24. The colony's financial markets interpreted earlier reports that a meeting would take place as heralding a possible solution to the impasse over financing the HKDollars 165bn (Pounds 13.9bn) project. Hong Kong government officials cautioned that it was unlikely the airport issue would be settled at the first meeting. But it comes at a critical time as funding for the Provisional Airport Authority's administrative expenses expires at the end of June. The Legislative Council, the colony's law making body, is due to reconsider voting the PAA more money shortly and many members will take their lead from China. In recent weeks, China has moved to improve the atmosphere surrounding Anglo-Chinese discussions about Hong Kong's economic development. Hitherto, Beijing had linked Hong Kong economic issues to Governor Chris Patten withdrawing his proposals for democratic development in Hong Kong. There have, however, been indications that China was prepared to resume talks about the airport. In what was seen as another positive development, last week Beijing approved three non-airport-related business franchises which span the 1997 transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China. The apparent willingness of Beijing to consider the financing of the airport and its connecting railway prompted the Hong Kong government, about a month ago, to put forward a portfolio of alternative financing proposals. They have been designed to allay China's concerns about the large amounts of debt that might have to be raised to pay for the project. British officials connected to the discussions said they had been encouraged by the Chinese insistence that the details of the most recent proposals be kept confidential. On two previous occasions last year when the Hong Kong government presented funding options to Beijing it insisted on publication and criticised the plans. '(Asking for confidentiality) is something they would do if they were serious about reaching an agreement, although it does not necessarily mean that they are,' one observed. Businessmen who are advisers to Beijing have said over recent days that China wants the airport issue settled although it still has concerns about the cost of the airport railway. The Hong Kong government believes that to build the airport without its connecting railway would not make economic sense. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

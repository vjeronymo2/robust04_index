			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANHATTAN'S TIMES SQUARE BOASTS ANOTHER ENTHUSIASTIC RENAISSANCE  </P> <P> The bozo on the billboard advertising cigarettes has long since stopped blowing  smoke rings across Broadway, but Times Square is glowing like never before.  </P> <P> New hotels have opened among the glass sky-scratchers, offering lofty rooms  adjacent to theaters, restaurants in assorted styles of cuisine, swimming pools  and health clubs, and conference centers equipped with every electronic marvel.  </P> <P> This activity includes places that just opened or will swing open doors in the  weeks ahead, many of them with special rates for weekend visitors. Even Sleaze  Alley, that tinsel stretch of 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues,  is marked for a $2.5-billion overhaul that will bring it new theaters, shops  and restaurants.  </P> <P> The Victory Theater built by Oscar Hammerstein, father of the late lyricist, in  1898 and the oldest theater on Broadway, has already reopened. The New  Amsterdam, which played "The Ziegfeld Follies" as well as Fred and Adele  Astaire, is expected to follow.  </P> <P> None of this reupholstering will affect the off-Broadway stretch between 9th  and 11th avenues that has become known as "Theater Row," a string of small  theaters that has attracted an assortment of modest restaurants such as the  West Bank Cafe and Chez Josephine, run by one of the adopted sons of Josephine  Baker, darling of Paris and New York City in the '20s.  </P> <P> The old Hudson Theater -- where Ethel Barrymore performed in 1903, where Ralph  Bellamy was the star of "Detective Story," where "Arsenic and Old Lace" ran  forever and where Jane Fonda and Geraldine Page were in "Strange Interlude" --  has been welded into the eye-popping Hotel Macklowe.  </P> <P> Once the home, too, of Jack Paar's TV show on NBC, the Hudson has become part  of the hotel's elaborate conference center that will occupy floors two to six,  embracing 38 meeting rooms.  </P> <P> A $250-million project, the Macklowe will have a gourmet restaurant off the  black Carrera marble lobby. African mahogany in striking patterns lines the  corridor walls, and from upper-floor rooms guests can look across to the Lyceum  Theater, built in 1903.  </P> <P> Also viewable is the huge Marriott Marquis, which started the Times Square  renaissance when it opened with 1,874 rooms, including 141 suites, five years  ago.  </P> <P> In view, also, is the huge Broadway State Building on the site of the old Loews  State Theater. It has a shopping mall and four movie theaters.  </P> <P> Atop the Palace Theater on Broadway, which was world-famous for its in-person  stars -- "playing the Palace" was a catch phrase among entertainers -- a  460-room hotel will open this fall. It will be an Embassy Suites project taking  up 36 floors of a 43-story tower rising above 47th Street.  </P> <P> Already open is the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, a 770-room sanctuary on Broadway  and 49th Street. It gets $175 to $195 for singles, $20 above that for doubles  and about $210 on the concierge level on the 46th floor.  </P> <P> From there, having breakfast or cocktails, one can look north to Central Park,  east to Rockefeller Center and to the Winter Garden at street level where  "Cats" is still playing.  </P> <P> This Holiday Inn has opened the largest hotel pool in town alongside its swim  and health club. Every imaginable exercise machine is on hand, including a  bicycle trainer that allows one to watch videotapes while pedaling nowhere.  </P> <P> Its Broadway Grill, operated by David Liederman (of David's Cookies), has an  open kitchen and a chalkboard menu. A "Broadway grill burger" costs $9.50, with  lunch or dinner for under $20. At Samplings, the other beanery, one can eat at  the bar or at a table next to the picture windows, with all of Times Square  erupting below.  </P> <P> Bronze plaques have been set into the sidewalk along Broadway's Walk of Stars,  which honors many luminaries of the stage and screen, among them Helen Hayes,  Ingrid Bergman, Jose Ferrer, Patricia Neal, David Wayne and director Elia  Kazan.  </P> <P> The Big Apple people like to say that Times Square stretches up to 59th Street  and wanders east and west on- and off-Broadway and Seventh Avenue. That brings  in the new Rihga Royal Hotel on 54th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues.  </P> <P> Japanese-owned and managed by a 10-hotel Nipponese chain with headquarters in  Osaka, it is thoroughly Western. Its 500 rooms have sitting areas that can be  closed off from the bedroom. It is full-service with a butler that can fetch  meals around the clock. A refrigerator, which makes ice cubes, is in every  room.  </P> <P> Standard suites go for $225 up to $375, with 20% off those rates until Labor  Day. It's a summer sale.  </P> <P> The Big Apple takes a bite out of visitors as things stand now with an 8 1/4%  sales tax on hotel bills, plus a 5% hotel tax and a $2-per-room occupancy tax.  A proposed additional 5% hotel tax is facing a stiff fight.  </P></p>

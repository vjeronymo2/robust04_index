			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ fish exports hurt by global recession after record 26% rise THE NEW Zealand fishing industry is being affected by world recessionary trends and is unlikely to repeat last year's record jump in exports, which rose 26 per cent to NZDollars 1.34bn (USDollars 734m), the chief executive, Mr Ray Dobson, said yesterday. However, the setback would be temporary, he suggested, adding that the industry was on target for sales of NZDollars 2bn by the year 2000. Mr Dobson, releasing the board's annual economic review, said that in addition to suffering softer world fish prices, the NZ industry had also been badly affected by the effects on shellfish of the toxic algal bloom, which forced this part of the industry to shut down for as long as five months. The last ban on harvesting shellfish was lifted on Wednesday. The board said 'everything came right' in 1992 - exchange and interest rates and catches. Seafood sales earned NZDollars 1.34bn, of which NZDollars 1.22bn came from exports. There was a 10.6 per cent rise to a total 657,266 tonnes in the catch in the economic zone around the country. Japan was the biggest customer, buying NZDollars 409m, followed by the United States NZDollars 291m, Australia NZDollars 122m and Europe NZDollars 120.5m. Sales of hoki, a whitefish thought valueless till the mid 1980s because it has a boney backbone and is difficult to fillet, were the biggest export earner, up from NZDollars 151m to NZDollars 233m. But Mr Dobson said prices for hoki had fallen by up to 20 per cent this year, partly as a result of black market Russian cod flooding the European market. Orange roughy, a mainstay of the US restaurant trade, saw a sales rise of 16 per cent to NZDollars 159m. Rock lobster (crayfish in New Zealand), earned NZDollars 101.8m. About 75 per cent of lobsters are exported live to Japan. Catches by foreign fishing boats chartered by New Zealand companies rose by 50,000 tonnes to 400,000 tonnes, mostly due to a big rise in trawling for southern blue whiting in the Pacific Ocean south of New Zealand.</p>

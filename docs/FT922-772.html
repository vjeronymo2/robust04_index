			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (16): Car industry has yet to prove potential - In spite of a recent decline in sales, Michael Smith finds grounds for optimism WHEN the Indian government eased controls on who could set up manufacturing bases in industry last year, it left the cars sector out of the liberalisation. Few were surprised. Although the Indian car industry is more than 40 years old, the government is still undecided whether it should be viewed as an important sector with potential for providing large-scale employment and export growth, or merely as a source for luxury products for the rich. To date, the view of Indian governments has been the latter. Cars have been seen as guzzlers of the foreign exchange needed to make and fuel them. As a result, the sector has been even more heavily regulated than others and taxes have been higher. Production licences have been refused to countless potential manufacturers and today there are only four companies making cars. Their combined domestic sales have never risen above the 175,000 achieved in 1989-90 and only one company exports cars to any considerable extent. The carmakers together employ fewer than 30,000 people. Those companies that have tried and failed to get in on the act can at least console themselves that market conditions in the past two years would hardly have provided the perfect launch pad for entry. After a quadrupling of domestic sales between 1983 and 1990, the total fell to about 142,000 last year and there are fears that it will be below 100,000 this year. A variety of factors accounts for the decline. The devaluation of the rupee has made component imports more expensive, and petrol price rises and the increased cost of consumer credit has lessened the attractions, and possibilities, of owning a car. More damaging still was the government's decision last year to raise excise duties on the price of cars to 60 per cent, compared to a previous 40 per cent and 6 per cent in the mid-1980s. 'Cars have become truly unaffordable,' says Premier Automobiles, the second largest car manufacturer. In spite of the gloom, there are grounds for optimism in the long term. The growing potential for foreign collaboration, and with it increased exports, improvements in the quality of indigenous components and better productivity will all aid the industry. The catalyst for much of the change has been Maruti Udyog, a joint venture between Suzuki of Japan and the Indian government. Prior to its emergence in its present form in 1983, consumers had to choose between Premier and Hindustan Motors, both producing 1950s models with outmoded equipment. Amid claims from its rivals that it was given favourable treatment in tax treatment and production quotas, Maruti has slowly built up its claimed share of the market to more than 60 per cent. Exports last year reached 22,900. Although that is not expected to increase significantly this year, the target for 1995 is 50,000 to 60,000. One reason for the expected rapid growth is that the Suzuki's new Alto 800cc model will be made exclusively in India. The company has this year raised its stake in the joint venture from 40 to 50 per cent. Mr R. C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti, says he cannot claim that the quality of the product is identical to that made in Japan, but he says it is not significantly lower. Labour costs 1.7 per cent of the total input of a car, whereas the equivalent figure for Japan is 12 per cent. 'Potentially we can get the price cheaper, providing we can get our act together in the components industry.' Maruti's growth has already stimulated a rapid improvement in the quality of components made in India. Partly as a result of collaboration with overseas, mainly Japanese companies, component makers are increasingly turning out products which can compete in international markets. The Automotive Components Manufacturers Association of India says its members increased exports last year from Dollars 100m to Dollars 140m and expect exports growth of 30 per cent annually. For India's components makers to become much larger players on the international market, they will need more expensive equipment which economies of scale would provide. That will only come with significantly increased domestic market share. Like Maruti and component manufacturers, Premier and Hindustan are looking to joint ventures for growth. Both companies are in need of revival. Premier is expected barely to make a profit in the current year. Mr Vinod Doshi, chairman, is resentful about the accusation, common in Indian business circles, that it has failed to satisfy the needs of the market. Although the most recent of its two car models was first manufactured in the mid-1980s, Mr Doshi points out that Premier has been trying unsuccessfully ever since to persuade the government to allow it to manufacture another. Previously, it collaborated with foreign companies but did not enter joint ventures. Now that is changing. 'We are looking for a long-term marriage, not just a technical licence.' Talks are under way with companies including Fiat, Peugeot and Nissan and Mr Doshi expects to have formed a relationship with one of them within three or four months. Meanwhile he and his son have shown that they mean business in revitalising the company by persuading 3,000 of the 9,500-strong workforce to take voluntary retirement. The package and the way it was negotiated has sparked considerable admiration in Bombay, where, as in the rest of Indian business, it is notoriously difficult to shed labour. The new entrant to car manufacturing is Tata, the large industrial and engineering group. Frustrated by the government's refusal to allow it to establish a carmaking collaboration with Honda in the late 1980s, the Tata subsidiary, Telco, recently started manufacture of what it claims is the first Indian car to be made without foreign collaboration. In spite of government restrictions on entering car manufacturing, under 'broad banding' policies a company which already makes four-wheel vehicles is able to diversify into cars. Tata developed a pick-up van; the Tata estate car and three-door Sierra are modifications of that. Tata plans to produce 10,000 of the cars this year and has orders for all of them already. Mr V. M. Raval, director of Telco, says interest has been shown from the UK, France and Egypt. The present car is built on a chassis and so is higher than a standard estate car. That could encounter resistance from potential export targets. Before it begins exports, Tata intends to change that, as well as develop a petrol version of what is now an exclusively diesel car and improve the finish. Mr Raval say exports are some way off. But he believes that it will be competitive because it will be lower-priced than rival products made in other countries. As with much of Indian car manufacturing, the promise has yet to be fulfilled.</p>

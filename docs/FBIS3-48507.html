			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- Veteran opposition  leader Kim Tae-chung hangs up the nameboard of his research  institute Thursday and sets sail as captain of a ship that he is  determined will provide the brainpower for Korean unification,  democratization and Asia-Pacific peace. After leaving politics  in 1992, Kim devoted himself to forming a  "strictly-non-political" foundation while waving aside a cloud  of rumors on his return to the political picture.    The KDJ (for Kim's initials) Peace Foundation has been in  the  public eye since Kim first spoke of it last year, not only  because of the influence he has in the political world but also  because of the list of political, religious, and scholastic  bigtimers at home and abroad who willingly took part in the  foundation.    Foreign advisers are former presidents Mikhail Gorbachev of  the Soviet Union and Corazon Aquino of the Philippines, and  former German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Advisers  from home are Cardinal Stephen Kim Su-hwan of the Roman Catholic  Church, the Ven. So We-hyon, head of the Chokye Order of the  Buddhism, the Rev. Kang Won-yong, president of the Institute of  Christian Academy, and Yi Tae-yong, president of the Family Law  Counseling Institute.    The 21-man committee of consultants that will be deeply  engaged in foundation activities, include poet Ko Un, Seoul  National University President Kim Chong-un, Korea University  President Kim Hui-chip, former Korea Broadcasting System General  Director So Yong-hun, Yi Se-chung, president of the Korea  Association of Lawyers, and former Vice Prime Minister Cho Sun.    Among the 10 foreign consultants are Moscow University  President Viktor Sadovnichi; Selig Harrison, senior research  fellow of the Carnegie Foundation of International Peace; Former  U.S. Ambassador to Seoul James Lilley; Harvard University  President Edward Baker; Former East German Prime Minister Lothar  de Maiziere; Mushakoji Kinhide, chairman of the Japanese Council  on International Affairs; and Smiya Mikiyo, an honorary  professor at Tokyo University.    Directors of the board under Kim's chairmanship are his  wife,  Yi Hui-ho; Yi Mun-yong, dean of the graduate school of Kyongki  University; Choe Yong-kun, a former member of the National  Assembly; and Cho Sung-hung, a lawyer. Dr. Cho Yung-hwan,  director of the Institute of Far Eastern Affairs, serves as  secretary-general of the foundation. Eight young permanent  researchers, who include six holders of political science  doctorates and one of administration science, were selected  after public screening and 18 professors were named  non-permanent researchers.    The foundation was founded on capital of 3 billion won by  selling real estate of Kim's wife and will financially depend on  public patronage for future management. As it first official  event, the foundation hosts an international seminar on  Wednesday on topics of changes of the world order and  democratization in Asia, prospects for inter-Korean relations,  and assessment and challenge of the future.    John Dunn, a professor at Cambridge University; Na Chong-il,  a professor of Kyonghee University; and former East German  Premier Lothar de Maiziere will speak.    On Thursday, at the founding ceremony, Cardinal Kim and  Aquino will make the opening speeches, and congratulatory  messages from former Presidents Jimmy Carter of the United  States and Gorbachev will be read. The foundation, located in a  commercial building near Kim's house in Tongkyo-tong, has  already agreed on partnership with the Gorbachev Foundation.  Gorbachev has promised to preside over a seminar in Seoul and  many Asian human rights and democracy leaders are lined up to  visit Korea, a foundation spokesman said.    Kim is to tour Denmark, Norway and Sweden from Sunday to  seek  cooperation with peace institutes there.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 30 (CTK) -- "The latest census  has shown the size of small ethnic minorities to be dwindling,"  Democratic Left Party Deputy Pavol Bogdan says in an interview  with the Slovak daily NARODNA OBRODA published today. A bill on  ethnic minorities should be passed, Bogdan says in the paper,  adding that reintroduction of small elementary schools with  mixed-age classes should be one of the regulations aimed at  stopping the declining use of the Ukrainian language. Mixed-age  classes were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s, the paper says.    Parliament is to resume a discussion on the question of  bilingual signs giving community names in Slovak and Hungarian,  whose approval is one of the conditions for Slovakia's entry  into the Council of Europe, the paper writes. The disagreement  over a percentage limit for minorities is the snag that has so  far prevented the passage of a bill saying that the existence in  communities of minorities of 20 percent or larger justifies the  use of dual-language signs.    This limit discriminates against Ukrainian, Ruthenian,  German, and other small minorities that are most threatened with  assimilation, leading to the loss of their national identity and  self-awareness, Bogdan says in the paper.</p>

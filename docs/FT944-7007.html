			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / International Company News: Few surprises from Deutsche Telekom The distribution of mandates for Deutsche Telekom's privatisation has been so heavily, and accurately, trailed that the actual announcement yesterday contained few surprises. That Deutsche Bank - whose chief executive is Hilmar Kopper - and Dresdner Bank would be in the key international consortium was never seriously in doubt. 'This is a great day for a German bank to have such a prominent role in such a significant issue,' said Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, director of Deutsche Bank's investment banking operations. The focus of international interest was on the choice of international investment bank to give a geographical balance to the global consortium. But nor was there any astonishment that the German government chose Goldman Sachs as the third member of the global consortium. Ever since Germany decided to go for SEC registration for Deutsche Telekom and a full US listing the participation of a US investment bank was well-nigh inevitable. Goldman is the pre-eminent US investment bank in Europe and has established close links with Deutsche Telekom over the past four years. It was always regarded as the investment bank to beat. Goldman's expression of the ritual investment bank 'delight' and 'honour' carried more conviction than that of many competitors who came in but with more humble roles. 'Winning this mandate is an important strategic development not only for our telecommunications effort and for our German operation,' said Mr Robert Morris, managing director of international telecommunications equity research at Goldman Sachs and one of a team of core executives for whom the deal has been a top priority for nearly four years. 'It goes to the roots of Goldman Sachs, which is built upon equity. We are proud to be involved in the world's largest equity offering.' This year Goldman tops a premier league of investment banks competing for growing volumes of international equity business. It has been 'book-runner' in eight separate deals, ranging from Den norske Bank to Tele Danmark, to huge Asian deals, such as Indosat, the Indonesian long-distance telecommunications concern. Sales from 11 separate tranches of shares in these deals amount to Dollars 3.27bn. Competitors conceded that Goldman's achievement was a testament to the US firm's long effort in positioning itself for the deal. But one London-based executive said: 'Goldman have got a great headline position but from their position the devil is in the detail.' A global co-ordinator generally takes a lead role in most regional markets. Goldman has such a position in the Americas, but as joint rather than sole lead. The firm has not won inclusion in the other areas: UK, the rest of Europe and Asia. 'Goldman is a global co-ordinator with a difference,' said one rival. The regional consortia matter because, as one investment banker said, 'sales are the guts of it'. Fees for investment bankers are expected to amount to 2.5-3 per cent of a total transaction that will at DM15bn (Dollars 9.6bn) be larger than all German IPOs of the past eight years combined. Of this commission pool of about DM450m, only about 20 per cent goes to the managers of the transaction, 20 per cent to the underwriters and a full 60 per cent to the sellers. Warburg had hoped for four banks in the global group and was disappointed only three were chosen. Mr Maurice Thompson, head of equity capital markets at S. G. Warburg of the UK, said: 'We had obviously hoped for a more crowded top line and a position in it.' So Warburg can regard its position as sole lead of the UK tranche as a generous consolation for its failure to win a place in the global group. Warburg was the only bank to gain a sole lead role in any region. The bank was buoyed too by indications from Deutsche Telekom, whose chief executive is Mr Helmut Ricke, that about 20 per cent of the total issue would be allotted to the UK, about the same as that earmarked for US investors. It is expected that 50-60 per cent of the issue will be sold in Germany by a consortium led by Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. As for other banks that pitched for work in the exhaustive and exhausting tender process, there is something for everyone, almost. One source close to the German government said over 100 banks would be involved. CS First Boston's tactic of concentrating its efforts on the role of government adviser has paid off. A CSFB executive said: 'The excitement of investment banking is all to do with moments like this.' He attributed the bank's success to the European character imparted by the link with Credit Suisse and a 'polyglot structure and mix of nationalities'. Other winners included NM Rothschild, which is to advise Deutsche Telekom itself. The losers are less easy to identify. Merrill Lynch had been tipped as a global co-ordinator and the government's, as opposed to the company's, favourite. It has had to make do with a place in the American consortium, a bitter pill sweetened by the fact that Merrill is joint lead with Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. Kleinwort Benson had lobbied hard for a lead role. The investment bank, which only three years ago was reeling after a series of defections and embarrassments, said it was disappointed not to have won a lead role but privately delighted to have an important role as co-lead of the UK tranche. NatWest is also co-lead but a surprising absence is Barclays de Zoete Wedd, which had competed strongly for the deal. 'The big prizes can't be given to everybody,' said Mr Andre Teeuw, head of BZW in Germany. The competition for Deutsche Telekom may have been fierce and the fees the largest on any privatisation issue. But some bankers said the work would not be particularly lucrative, after the work of pitching for a deal and executing it was accounted for. 'Privatisations when everything is considered are attractive but not very profitable,' said a CSFB executive. 'You hope it positions you for more private-sector business with the company and within the industry.' See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Embassy of the Kingdom of Cambodia in the  Kingdom of Thailand will open for business this June. This will  be the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two  countries after the embassy had been closed for more than two  decades because of endless civil war. However, sources at the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the  Kingdom of Cambodia have not specified the date the embassy will  officially be opened.    Eng Roland -- an official of FUNCINPEC [National United  Front  for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia]  and former minister of tourism in the provisional national  government of Cambodia, and who has been appointed ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Thailand --  has expressed his determination to improve the relations between  the two neighboring countries, and in particular to avoid mutual  misunderstanding. Roland also optimistically hopes that  relations between the two countries will improve once the  Cambodian Embassy is opened.    This first Cambodian diplomat did not elaborate on what he  called mutual misunderstanding. However, his statement was  thought to have referred to the war of words between the  Cambodian and Thai Governments at the end of April and early May  because of the Khmer Rouge issue.    It may be remembered that the Khmer Rouge problem caused a  fairly strong verbal exchange between government leaders and  foreign ministers of Cambodia and Thailand. The Cambodian  Government believed and had proof to show that Thailand did  indeed support the Khmer Rouge in attacks against government  troops in western Cambodia. As for Thailand, it affirmed that  it had never provided assistance as accused by the Cambodian  Government. Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister, used strong  words, even saying that the matter will be taken up with the UN  Security Council. Howver, the troubled atmosphere between  Cambodia and Thailand became relaxed through a diplomatic  settlement.    Eng Roland did not discuss how he will start his work with  Thailand. However, it is understood that diplomacy with  Thailand is very important to put pressure on the Khmer Rouge at  a time when the government wants to have something clear from  Thailand.    It is worth noting that the Cambodian Embassy in Thailand  has  suffered only slightly and repairs have already been made. The  embassy is located on Ratdamri Road in Bangkok.</p>

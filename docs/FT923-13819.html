			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Estonia hails troops pledge: Yeltsin pull-out promise seen as step forward ESTONIA has cautiously welcomed President Boris Yeltsin's promise to pull all ex - Soviet troops from the Baltics but criticised the Helsinki meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe for failing to force the pace of the withdrawal, Reuter reports. President Arnold Ruutel said yesterday he was satisfied that Mr Yeltsin, who made his public pledge in Munich before flying to Helsinki, had not named a fixed date far in the future. 'The real dates will be worked out in bilateral talks. But for the Baltic states it's an important step forward that Russia has made the real political decision to pull out all troops,' he said. Earlier, Mr Ruutel told the CSCE that Estonia had been disappointed in the conference's failure to phase out what he called a holdover from the Cold war. 'Ever since Estonia became a member of the CSCE in September of last year, we have hoped and believed in its ability to help resolve one of the most important problems facing our nation - the need for complete withdrawal of all ex-Soviet troops. Unfortunately, our expectations have yet to be fulfilled,' he said. The CSCE called for talks and an early withdrawal, but refused to back demands by the three Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) that the presence of some 130,000 ex - Soviet troops be declared a violation of international law. Speaking to local journalists afterwards, Mr Ruutel softened his tone. 'Maybe it could have be stronger,' he said of the CSCE position. But he said he understood the principles of the Helsinki summit required dialogue. 'No one tells anyone what to do.' Mr Yeltsin issued his promise after talks with Group of Seven leaders, and said Russia had already stopped sending new conscripts to the region. 'Since our period of service is two years, in practical terms after two years there will be no more rank-and - file soldiers left there,' he said. However, he added that Moscow could not yet give a deadline for completing the withdrawal because of the enormous problem of housing troops repatriated from Germany and the Baltics. On Wednesday the CIS naval commander-in - chief, Admiral Vladimir Chernavin, said that more than half the potential conscripts to the Commonwealth armed forces managed to dodge their military service.</p>

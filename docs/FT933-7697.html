			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Ford-Werke chief fights decision to move him FORD, the US carmaker, yesterday became embroiled in public conflict with one of its top executives in Germany, in its latest shake-up of the group's European management. Mr John Hardiman, who was dismissed this week as chairman of the Ford-Werke management board, is considering taking legal action for breach of contract. On Wednesday Ford of Europe announced that Mr Hardiman would return to the US to a position in Ford's international automotive operations. He was to be replaced immediately by Mr Albert Caspers, Ford of Europe manufacturing director, who was to add the chairmanship of the German subsidiary to his existing role. Mr Hardiman's lawyer announced yesterday that the Ford executive might seek a temporary injunction against his dismissal in order to force his reinstatement. 'Mr Hardiman's contract runs to the end of April 1995 and under German law such a contract can only be ended for gross misconduct, which nobody is claiming,' he said. Mr Hardiman had a written contract with Ford-Werke not with Ford of Europe or with Ford of the US. He said the first Mr Hardiman had heard of his impending dismissal was from newspaper reports in Germany last week. Ford of Europe is fighting to overcome its third year of heavy losses and is in the process of drastic restructuring including the cutting of around 10,000 jobs across its European operations. The company has run up heavy losses particularly in Britain and in Germany, where Ford-Werke suffered a net loss of DM469m last year. Mr Hardiman, 59, has worked for Ford in Europe for more than 30 years. He became chief executive of Ford-Werke in 1989.</p>

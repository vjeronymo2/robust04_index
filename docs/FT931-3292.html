			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Nike shares jump on record earnings SHARES in Nike climbed more than 5 per cent yesterday morningafter the company posted record third-quarter earnings. The shares advanced Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 75 3/4 at mid-day. Although the results were in line with expectations, investors were encouraged by a jump in 'futures' orders and news that Nike's US footwear business had its strongest quarter in two years. The company, based in Beaverton, Oregon, said orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for deliver between March and July climbed 21 per cent to Dollars 1.65bn. The company warned that these orders were not necessarily indicative of total revenues for successive periods. Nike's net income for the three months to February 28 rose 8.5 per cent to Dollars 89.5m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, from Dollars 82.5m, or Dollars 1.08. Revenues were 12.1 per cent higher at Dollars 972m, against Dollars 867m. For the first nine months, Nike's net earnings advanced 11.5 per cent to Dollars 288.1m, or Dollars 3.74, from Dollars 258.5m, or Dollars 3.38. Revenues grew 15.2 per cent to Dollars 2.95bn from Dollars 2.56bn. In the US, sales rose 14 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 655.7m, with growth led by footwear revenues, which were 15 per cent higher at Dollars 548.2m. The company's total international sales were 4 per cent higher at Dollars 265.2m. The company said international revenues would have been 11 per cent higher had dollar exchange rates remained constant. Although international footwear sales slid 1 per cent to Dollars 204.1m in the quarter, apparel sales rose 25 per cent to Dollars 61.1m. In Europe, Nike said it was investing aggressively in the Nike brand. The company expects its fully-integrated automated information systems to come on line this month. This should provide greater communication and co-ordination between European countries.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Letter: Threat to pits and environment from opencast mines Sir, In the debate about a possible subsidy to coal ('Rescue plans may fall foul of EC rules', January 20) it should be noted that one of the principal threats to deep mine production comes from the industry's own corporate backyard, in the form of opencast coal production. Opencast mining produced around 19m tonnes of coal in 1991, nearly one fifth of total coal production. With around 80 per cent of opencast production going to power generation, opencast and deep-mined coal are in direct competition with one another. Opencast mining is also one of the most environmentally destructive activities currently carried out in the UK, a view endorsed by the Commons Energy Committee in 1987. The government is currently revising its planning guidance to local authorities which determines the basis on which opencast planning applications are granted. In the CPRE's view this guidance is biased in favour of the industry. Revised guidance which reflected the environmental damage caused by opencasting would restrict the circumstances in which planning permission could be granted. This would quickly reduce opencast output. The securing of a market for at least 10m-15m tonnes of deep mined coal could thus be achieved quickly, simply and at little or no cost.

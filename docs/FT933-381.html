			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Towry Law to seek listing TOWRY LAW, one of the UK's largest chains of independent financial advisers, will today announce plans to place some 35 per cent of its shares with the public and list them on the Stock Exchange. The placing, to be underwritten by James Capel, will value the company at about Pounds 25m. The shares to be sold are those of the current directors, pension scheme and Law family interests. The sale will reduce the family's stake from 50 per cent to 40 per cent. The flotation comes just as the market for independent financial advice faces great changes brought on by new regulations and a restructuring of the insurance industry. The Treasury has said it will require sales agents from next year to disclose to prospective clients how much they will earn on each sale and the value of insurance contracts if they are surrendered early. Also, the leading insurance providers and IFAs face growing competition from banks and building societies which are setting up their own insurance operations and selling to their customers. Mr Alan Wesley, managing director of Towry Law, said the new regulations 'are all opportunity' which will squeeze the company's smaller competitors from the market. While the new regulations may cause insurance companies to either cut commissions - which form the bulk of Towry Law's revenues - or pay them over a longer period, the company is sufficiently well capitalised to stand the strain. According to research prepared by James Capel, in the five years to June 1993 turnover has grown at a compound rate of 15.4 per cent and pre-tax profits by 12.7 per cent.</p>

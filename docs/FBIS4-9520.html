			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 26 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav  Government's committee for cooperation with the U.N. Protection  Force in the former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) on Tuesday said the  U.N. peace-keepers coming from the countries with which  Yugoslavia has agreements on the elimination of visas would not  need visas to enter Yugoslavia as of May 15. The Yugoslav  Government had introduced entry visas and stay permits for all  UNPROFOR members in mid-April. The government committee for  cooperation with UNPROFOR took the stand that the mid-April  decision did not pertain to the above specified cases, and  instructed the Foreign and Interior Ministries to take the  necessary steps.    The Yugoslav Government also decided in mid-April that its  prior approval would have to be obtained for the entry and  movement of UNPROFOR transportation vehicles on Yugoslav  territory, and that UNPROFOR personnel carriers would have to  use only the roads designated by Yugoslav authorities. The  committee, for its part, decided that UNPROFOR in future pay for  all services on Yugoslav territory, including the use of  facilities, which Yugoslavia had covered so far.</p>

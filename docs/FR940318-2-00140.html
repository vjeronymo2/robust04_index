			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. [Reserved for Discussion of Comments in Final Notice]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> V. Eligible Grantees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following requirements, which have previously applied to TAP, would continue to apply with respect to FY 1994 awards: Eligible grantees are those agencies of State governments which are responsible for the refugee program under 45 CFR 400.5 in States containing counties which qualify for FY 1994 targeted assistance awards. The use of targeted assistance funds for services to Cuban and Haitian entrants is limited to States which have an approved State plan under the Cuban/Haitian Entrant Program (CHEP).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State agency will submit a single application on behalf of all county governments of the qualified counties in that State. Subsequent to the approval of the State's application by ORR, local targeted assistance plans will be developed by the county government or other designated entity and submitted to the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A State with more than one qualified county is permitted, but not required, to determine the allocation amount for each qualified county within the State. However, if a State chooses to determine county allocations differently from those set forth in this notice, the FY 1994 allocations proposed by the State must be included in the State's application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications submitted in response to this notice are not subject to review by State and areawide clearinghouses under Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Qualification and Allocation Formula  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Qualification Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The INA authorizes the Director at section 412(c)(2)(A) ``to make grants to States for assistance to counties and similar areas in the States where, because of factors such as unusually large refugee populations (including secondary migration), high refugee concentrations, and high use of public assistance by refugees, there exists and can be demonstrated a specific need for supplementation of available resources for services to refugees''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ORR is willing to consider data for the purpose of determining the eligibility of new counties to participate in TAP in FY 1994. Interested counties should submit the following written evidence: (a) A list of refugees identified by name, alien number, social security number, date of birth, and date of arrival; and (b) a description of the source of data. Listings of refugees who are not identified by their alien numbers will not be considered. Written evidence should be submitted separately from comments on the proposals in this notice no later than 30 days from date of publication of this notice and should be addressed to: Loren Bussert, Office of Refugee Resettlement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., Washington, DC 20447, Telephone: (202) 401&hyph;4732. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining whether a new county would be eligible to participate in the targeted assistance program, the same four criteria used previously will be used, including the same cutoff points. Updated information on refugee arrivals, concentrations, dependency rates, and receipt of cash assistance will be taken into account. To qualify for TAP funds, a county (or group of adjacent counties within the same Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, or SMSA) is required to be above the median or above a specified cutoff point of jurisdictions for which data are reviewed in three of the four following criteria: (1) The number of refugees placed in the county during FY 1983&hyph;1993; (2) the ratio of the overall county population to the refugees in item (1), above; (3) the number of refugees in the county who were receiving cash assistance under the programs of aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) and refugee cash assistance (RCA) on October 1, 1993; and (4) the ratio of refugees in item (3) to the number of refugees in item (1). A county which places above the cutoff point in any three of the above categories is determined to be qualified to apply for targeted assistance funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The median for Criterion 1, above, is 2,066.5. The median for Criterion 2 is 244.5. The cutoff point for Criterion 3 is 1,000. The cutoff point for Criterion 4 was established at 50%. Counties which meet three of the four criteria are qualified for the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Allocation Formula  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since current welfare dependency data on refugees are not available at the national level, the Director of ORR proposes to eliminate welfare dependency rates as a factor in calculating targeted assistance formula allocations to States in FY 1994. In all other respects, the FY 1994 TAP formula allocations would be based on the same formula as in FY 1993, updated to reflect arrivals through September 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this formula, one portion of the allocation is based on refugee and Cuban/Haitian entrant arrivals during FY 1980&hyph;1982; funds for this portion of the formula are allocated on the same proportionate basis among participating counties as in FY 1992. The second portion of the allocation is based on refugee and entrant placements in these counties during calendar year (CY) 1983_September 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the participating counties, the $25,457,300 which is proposed to be allocated by formula would be apportioned as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. $8,655,482 or 34%, would be allocated on the basis of the formula which has been used for all previous targeted assistance allocations (``old formula'') and which is based on initial placements during FY 1980&hyph;1982 and other factors as described under ``Formula Used to Date'' in the FY 1989 TAP notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 3, 1989 (54 FR 27944).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. $16,801,818 or 66%, would be allocated on the basis of arrivals during CY 1983_September 30, 1993 (``new formula'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The above percentages are based on the proportion of initial placements in these counties during the two periods: 338,247 refugee arrivals, or 34% of the total number of placements, during the old-formula period; and 658,930 or 66%, during the new-formula period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The old-formula allocation of $8,655,482 follows the same distribution among counties as in the past.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

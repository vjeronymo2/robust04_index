			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Coutts Consulting shares shed 25% on dim outlook Shares of Coutts Consulting yesterday shed 25 per cent of their value as the career consultancy, outplacement and residential training company reported disappointing first half figures. The shares closed 22p down at 67p after Mr Stephen Johnson, chief executive, said he expected operating profits for the full year would fall below expectations and would only match the Pounds 1.52m of 1993. Pre-tax profits emerged at Pounds 341,000 (losses Pounds 5.24m after exceptional costs of Pounds 6.41m). Turnover on continuing operations declined to Pounds 7.75m (Pounds 9.42m) with discontinued operations contributing a further Pounds 1.98m. Operating profit from continuing activities was sharply down at Pounds 569,000 (Pounds 1.13m); discontinued activities incurred losses of Pounds 802,000. Mr Johnson said the main cause of the decline was lower revenues from outplacement because of deferrals of large contracts. He added that revenue damage in the first half would not now be repaired in the second. Operating profits at the residential training division slid to Pounds 408,000 (Pounds 599,000). Nevertheless, dividends are resumed via an interim of 0.4p, payable from earnings of 1.2p (losses 21.43p) per share.</p>

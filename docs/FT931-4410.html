			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Political Notebook: At risk of sudden death FOR Mr Norman Lamont next Tuesday's Budget is a sudden-death affair. If it flops, the calls for a new chancellor will become deafening. Mr Lamont will be gone from the Treasury by the summer recess. A well judged and well received package would not guarantee his position - those close to Mr John Major insist he will not make up his mind until the summer. But with the prime minister weakened by the corrosive conflict over Maastricht Mr Lamont would have a fighting chance of holding on. It is an unenviable position for the chancellor, and is made no easier by the uncertainty which still surrounds the economy's emergence from recession. The prevailing view in the cabinet - shared incidentally by Mr Major - is that recovery is already under way. The drastic loosening in monetary policy since September's ERM debacle should deliver a significant boost to demand and incomes. Sterling's devaluation has given exporters a competitive edge in overseas markets. The US economy is growing strongly. The housing market shows signs of long-forgotten stability. But if it is rare now to find a cabinet minister who is anything but upbeat in private conversation, it is equally difficult to find one who is willing to be anything like as optimistic in public. No one is sure whether the recovery they believe is happening has more than shallow roots. No one quite knows what will be the impact of a slide into deeper recession in the rest of Europe. Unemployment casts a long and dark shadow. No one is inclined to be caught out by another false dawn. So the temptation for Mr Lamont is to do very little next Tuesday, to announce a distinctly modest increase in personal taxation and spend the money on a few eye-catching measures to help industry and cut the dole queues. Fiscal rectitude can be promised for a future occasion. In the judgment of most of his cabinet colleagues that would be a bad mistake for Mr Lamont, for the economy, and for the government's authority. In spite of their concern about the fragility of recovery there has been a decisive shift in the Lord Howe, the author of the austerity budget which marked the end in 1981 of an earlier recession, caught the flavour with his call in the Financial Times this week for a radical reform of the tax system to generate new revenues. Mr Lamont should choose virtue over instant popularity. The chancellor should not despair. Adversity brings its own opportunities. It is true that the FT's survey of pre-Budget opinion on the Tory back benches underlines his personal vulnerability. Nearly two thirds of Tory MPs judge his performance to be no better than fair or disappointing. In a comparable survey last year that figure was less than 40 per cent. But the survey underlines also their willingness to swallow some bitter pills. If Mr Lamont can project a coherent medium-term programme to get the government out of its present fiscal mess then Tory MPs will accept an austerity Budget. More than half actively support tax increases of one sort or another as part of a strategy to reduce the deficit. About half that number believe Mr Lamont must make a substantial down payment next week. Even those who would prefer him not to renege on the Conservatives' election pledges to reduce personal taxation appear ready now to accept some discreet increases. Not, of course, rises in income tax rates. Only a few brave souls suggest he should tamper with those. But more that half are willing to see Mr Lamont reduce the amount homeowners receive through mortgage interest relief. Not so long ago a threat to that particular tax distortion would have provoked a revolt of Maastricht proportions. Similar numbers are ready to see VAT extended to domestic fuel - dressed up, of course, as a 'green' tax - and to newspapers. They will acquiesce if Mr Lamont decides against indexing income tax allowances. Most are braced for much higher fuel - 'green' again - tobacco, and alcohol duties. The price the backbenchers are demanding is small. They want incentives to restore industrial confidence - through improved capital allowances and special measures to help small businesses. About half would like a post-Budget cut in interest rates - the rest still worry about the exchange rate. They want a renewed squeeze on public spending in the summer. But above all else the government's supporters want a signal that the chancellor has recovered his grip.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            WHAT TORY MPS WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE BUDGET  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (Results shown in rounded percentages.

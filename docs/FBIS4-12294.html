			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad has turned down an Iranian invitation to  visit Tehran later this month to discuss the Middle East peace  process.    Sources in Tehran said yesterday that the invitation came in  a written message from "Supreme Leader" 'Ali Khamene'i delivered  to al-Asad in Damascus by Iranian Majles Deputy Speaker Hasan  Ruhani.    Iranian media had reported that President al-Asad would  visit  Tehran this April to discuss "a new strategy for the Middle  East" with Khamene'i and his aides. But sources in Tehran said  yesterday that al-Asad accepted the invitation without setting a  date for it. Ruhani, who is also secretary general of the  Iranian National Security Council, also delivered a message from  President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. Khamene'i had openly  urged Syria to withdraw from the "American peace process" and  support the Palestinian factions which pledged to torpedo any  agreement with Israel.    While in Damascus, Ruhani received a number of Palestinian  radical leaders including Ahmad Jibril, Fathi Shaqaqi, and  Colonel Abu-Musa [Sa'id Musa]. He invited George Habash and  Nayif Hawatimah to meet with him but they sent representatives.    Ruhani, who is considered to be a member of the small circle  of mullahs at the center of power in Tehran, also met with  leaders of Lebanon's Hizballah.    The Iranian sources say that he asked the Hizballah leaders  to persuade the Shiite leaders in Lebanon to accept Khamene'i as  the highest Shiite authority. Senior Shiite leaders in Lebanon,  including Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah and Muhammad Mahdi  Shams-al-Din had expressed support for 'Ali Mohammad Sistani,  the Iranian mullah living in al-Najaf in Iraq.    Some reports indicate that the Palestinian radical groups  have expressed displeasure with Iran for failing so far to  provide the massive aid it had promised at a special conference  held in Tehran in February 1993.    Iranian sources attribute the delay in providing aid for  these groups to Tehran's cash flow problems, but in a recent  speech Khamene'i reaffirmed his government's commitment "to aid  the Palestinian struggle" against the PLO-Israel agreement.    Tehran analysts believe that the summit meeting between  Presidents al-Asad and Bill Clinton in Geneva last January was a  turning point of historic importance in relations between  Washington and Damascus. One of the results of that meeting is  perhaps Damascus's clear attempts to gradually distance itself  from Tehran's radical policies, according to the analysts.</p>

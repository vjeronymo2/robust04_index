			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> DEPARTMENTS SEEK HIGHER ALLOCATIONS  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors will be asked Tuesday to help bolster the budgets of  the county library, Fire Protection District and other agencies by reallocating  state funds.  </P> <P> The county's share of Special District Augmentation Funds in fiscal year  1990-91 is $23.7 million, $3.2 million more than the previous year.  </P> <P> The money has been allocated to various county departments already.  </P> <P> But Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg, as he has done  unsuccessfully before, is asking the supervisors to grant special help to some  districts at the expense of others.  </P> <P> According to Wittenberg, agencies that receive little or no money from fees and  other revenues deserve higher Special District Augmentation Fund allocations  than others.  </P> <P> County districts for which he will request special bailout funds include the  library, $3.9 million; fire protection, $18 million; and flood control,  $500,000.

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Producers' body to accuse BBC of unfair practices Pact, the main body representing independent television and film producers, will this week formally accuse the BBC of being guilty of a restraint of trade. Mr Tom Gutteridge, chairman of Pact - the Producers Alliance for Cinema and TV - will make the complaint of unfairness to Mr Will Wyatt, managing director of BBC Television. Pact, which represents more than 800 independent production companies, claims independents are denied fair access to programme proposals. In the ITV system, independent producers have the right to take their ideas directly to the Network Centre, the main programme-commissioning body for the national ITV network. This right is underpinned by an agreement monitored by the Office of Fair Trading, whose role was spelled out in the 1990 Broadcasting Act. No such formal rules govern the relations between the BBC and independents. The main complaint is that independents do not have guaranteed access to the BBC's channel controllers, Mr Alan Yentob at BBC 1 and Mr Michael Jackson at BBC 2. Ideas have to be filtered first through heads of department, who are at the same time promoting in-house ideas. Pact believes this amounts to a conflict of interest and fears many ideas from independents never reach the channel controllers. The alliance claims this lack of direct access amounts to a restraint of trade, and has communicated its worries to the government. The National Heritage Department is in the process of drawing up legislation for the renewal of the BBC's royal charter, which runs out at the end of 1996. Pact has not ruled out taking the issue to the OFT if the BBC does not change its procedures.</p>

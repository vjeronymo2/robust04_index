			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BOMB IN BANK SCATTERS CASH  </P> <P> A bomb exploded in a bank night deposit box early today, the second bank in the  area to be damaged in an overnight blast this month, authorities said.  </P> <P> A Riverside County sheriff's deputy on patrol heard the explosion at the  Provident Federal Savings Bank, on state Route 111 and Bob Hope Drive, about  2:30 a.m., Sgt. Keith Stinson said.  </P> <P> The blast caused damage to two walls and scattered money from the deposit box  outside the bank. There was no indication that anyone got inside the building  after the explosion, Stinson said.  </P> <P> The bank was closed for the day.  </P> <P> Stinson said agents were looking into similarities between the Provident bank  blast and one May 8 at a Bank of America branch in Palm Springs, several miles  to the northeast.  </P> <P> That bomb blew off the night deposit box door, littering the bank parking lot  with cash and causing about $100,000 in damage.  </P></p>

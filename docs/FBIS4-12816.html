Speaking at a banquet in his honor hosted by Senate Chairman  Wasim Sajjad in Islamabad yesterday, he said pooling the  resources of the ECO member-countries and increasing mutual  cooperation in all fields are very essential.

Speaking on the occasion, Senate Chairman Wasim Sajjad  called  upon Iran to use its influence to persuade India to fulfill its  pledge of granting the right of self-determination to the  Kashmiri people. He said the peaceful settlement of the Kashmir  problem will pave the way for peace and meaningful cooperation  among all countries of this region.

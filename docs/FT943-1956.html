			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (16): Authorities look for quality - Tougher listing restrictions in the Asia-Pacific region An increasingly restrictive mood has kept the cap on new issues in parts of the Asia-Pacific region, as stock exchange authorities have looked for quality, not quantity. However, business has been booming in Australia. 'In Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, the regulations governing new flotations have been tightened through tougher listing requirements,' says Mr Michael Franklin at James Capel. 'Typically, however, support for secondary issues has not generally been required, as new issue prices usually have been pitched below market levels so that a good market in the shares is established immediately.' Earlier this month in Seoul, an advisory group to the finance ministry urged wide-ranging financial reforms, paving the way for the country to modernise and internationalise its finance industry. The recommendations included removal of the current 10 per cent ceiling on foreign shareholdings in 1996 or 1997 and called on the ministry to allow foreigners to list shares and to issue depository receipts from next year. The group added that it would be desirable to give domestic companies more freedom in raising overseas funds, so that these could be obtained more easily, and proposed that South Korean companies should be able to list stocks on overseas bourses from next year. Kuala Lumpur saw some restraints on listing requirements introduced last year to inhibit back-door listing and reverse takeovers. More recently, the Malaysian securities and exchange commission has begun to reject applications for new listings if applicants are considered to be operating in the 'wrong' industry. For example, while a technology company might obtain listing approval quickly, a textile company may have to wait. The Bangkok authorities have also been making a concerted effort to raise the standard of companies listed on the exchange by taking a tougher attitude to screening new applicants for public offerings, particularly in the property sector where it used to be relatively easy for companies to be listed. In July, the SEC announced new rules governing initial public offerings in an attempt to broaden share ownership and end corrupt deals involving underpriced shares in newly listed companies. Major new equity issues have been mostly well-received and oversubscribed over the last year with Telecom Asia taking Bangkok to a high for the year when it made its debut last December, and the shares trading at Bt116 against an initial offer price of Bt55. In Singapore, the last major issue, the partial privatisation of Singapore Telecom in October last year, received official encouragement when local investors were allowed to tap into their Central Provident Fund accounts to finance applications for the issue. However, the terms of the issue were not attractive enough to appeal to foreign investors who judged that the prospective price-earnings ration was too high. The flotation, which raised about SDollars 4.4bn, saw 1.4m Singaporean investors acquiring shares, which more than tripled the number of shareholders in the country. A more recent successful issue was that of Petron in Manila earlier this month . The oil refiner surged 136 per cent above its offer price on the first day of trading, but the broad market fell as investors switched from other blue chips. In Taipei, which has rigid listing requirements, the chairman of the SEC, Tai Lih-ning has stressed that any increase in the number of listed companies would be permitted only as a last resort to narrow the imbalance between supply and demand for shares. However, Hung-Lung Yuan at Wardley James Capel in Taipei says that as a result of the rigid regulations, only 29 new listings were permitted during the whole of 1993 and another eight during the first seven months of this year, taking the total number of companies listed on the exchange to 293. 'Although the government is likely to push to expand market capitalisation through new listings and privatisation, it does act as a protector to the retail investor by scrutinising the companies which seek to float their shares on the market,' he says. Sydney, by contrast, has been enjoying a boom in new equity supply, as companies have taken advantage of rising markets to raise cash. Estimates from Macquarie Equities, the stockbroking division of Macquarie Bank, show that equity raisings by private enterprise and the federal and state governments were at an all-time high of ADollars 23.3bn in the year to the end of June this year, almost double the total of the previous 12 months. Of the 1993-94 total, rights issues and placements, totalling ADollars 8bn, and non-government floats at ADollars 6.3bn, were the dominant source of equity raised. However, Macquarie forecasts a 25 per cent fall in total equity raisings in the 12 months to next June, with federal and state government issues increasing to 31 per cent of the total from 12 per cent in the previous period. The broker adds that a sharp increase in the contribution from offshore funds marked a clear change of flows in 1993-94 with a stronger funds flow within Australia's wholesale investment institutions the other major contributor lifting demand for equities. Direct household investment has also increased, spurred by the increased number of government privatisations, such as State Insurance Offices, Commonwealth Bank and Commonwealth Serum Laboratories.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of  the National People's Congress (NPC) today adopted a decision to  grant legislative power to Xiamen, Fujian Province. Xiamen has  thus become the third special economic zone (SEZ) with  legislative power after Hainan Shenzhen [as received].    The move marks another significant step China has taken in  speeding up reforms and establishing a legal system for the SEZs.    Legislation is playing an increasingly important role in the  development of SEZs. With a legal framework basically built for  a market economy and for their economic convergence with the  international market, the SEZs serve as experimental sites for  not only economic restructuring, but also for local legislation.    Establishment of a legal system has been included in plans  for the development of the SEZs. In 1981, the NPC Standing  Committee authorized Guangdong and Fujian Provinces to formulate  regulations and statutes regarding SEZs under their jurisdiction.    In 1988, Hainan island became a province and a special  economic zone, and was also authorized to formulate local laws  and regulations.    In 1992, the NPC Standing Committee gave Shenzhen the same  right.    Granting Xiamen legislative power is a need posed by the  Xiamen SEZ to speed up reforms and open wider to the rest of the  world.    Separated from Taiwan by the sea, Xiamen plays an  irreplaceable role in increasing personnel and economic  exchanges across the Taiwan Straits and in promoting China's  reunification.    Since its establishment, Xiamen has developed rapidly.  Overseas- funded enterprises now account for more than 60  percent of Xiamen's industrial output value.    However, legislation in Xiamen proceeded at a slow pace,  making it impossible to set code of conduct for economic  activities. And the situation has already adversely affected  improvement in Xiamen's investment environment.    With the legislative power just granted, Xiamen will be able  to solve many problems that have cropped up.    Over the next few years, Xiamen plans to enact at least 50  local laws and regulations.</p>

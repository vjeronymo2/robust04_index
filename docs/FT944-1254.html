			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Costly miscalculations Intel's offer to replace all its latest Pentium microprocessors is a colossal embarrassment. Only a week ago, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer was vigorously disputing IBM's decision to withdraw shipments of the micro chip due to a minor flaw. Now, it is offering free replacement for all buyers of up to 6m systems containing the chip. The stock market reaction to the volte-face is curious. Intel's share price surged yesterday, adding Dollars 1bn to its market capitalisation. And yet the replacement programme is likely to cost anywhere between Dollars 100m to Dollars 500m, more than a snip even for a company expected to generate net earnings of Dollars 2.6bn this year. Investors' nonchalance in part reflects the financial strength of Intel, a group with around Dollars 4bn of net cash. However, it has sunk credibility and cash into what was supposed to be the world's most advanced mass produced micro chip. Some Dollars 1bn has been spent on developing the chip, a further Dollars 150m invested in a global advertising campaign to promote the brand. Sales were expected more than to double in 1995. After putting this wave of bad publicity behind it, Intel should still meet that target, as long as the replacement programme leaves customers satisfied. The share price reaction suggests that investors are giving Intel credit for biting the bullet and undertaking a drastic, if humiliating, exercise in damage limitation. But there must be concerns over their naivety in not addressing the problem earlier, and saving both money and face.</p>

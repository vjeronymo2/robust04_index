			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Historically,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pteris lidgatei  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was found at Olokui on Molokai (HHP 1992d4) and Waihee on West Maui (HHP 1992d5). The species was also recorded historically at three locations in the Koolau Mountains of Oahu: Waiahole, Lulumahu Stream, and Wailupe (HHP 1992d1, 1992d2, 1992d6). Only three populations totaling 26 individuals, have been seen within the past 50 years. One population, containing 13 plants, is on State-owned land in the Kaluanui Stream drainage on the windward side of the central Koolau Mountains at 530 to 590 m (1,750 to 1,930 ft) elevation (HHP 1992d3; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992). The Kaluanui population grows on steep stream banks in wet &ograve;hi&agrave; forest with mosses and other ferns, including  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cibotium chamissoi  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (hapu&ugrave; &igrave;&igrave;),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dicranopteris linearis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (uluhe),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Elaphoglossum crassifolium <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sadleria squarrosa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (&agrave;ma&ugrave;), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sphenomeris chusana  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (pala&aacute;) (HHP 1992d3). One additional plant was discovered on Oahu along the South Kaukonahua Stream (HHP 1993). One population of 12 plants was also discovered along the back wall of Kauaula Valley on Maui (Steve Perlman, National Tropical Botanical Garden, pers. comm., 1993). The primary threats to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pteris lidgatei  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are the alien plant  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Clidemia hirta  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Koster's curse), habitat destruction by feral pigs, and stochastic extinction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Federal Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal action on these plants began as a result of section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. In that document,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Asplenium fragile <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> insulare <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diplazium molokaiense <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pteris lidgatei <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  were considered to be endangered.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ctenitis squamigera  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was considered to be extinct. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. As a result of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant taxa, including all of the above taxa considered to be endangered or thought to be extinct. The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 94&hyph;51 and the July 1, 1975,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, including these four species, along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published updated notices of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82479), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183). In these three notices,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pteris lidgatei  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was treated as a category 1 candidate for Federal listing. Category 1 taxa are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. In the 1980 and 1985 notices,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Asplenium fragile  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> insulare <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ctenitis squamigera <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diplazium molokaiense  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> were considered category 1* species. Category 1* taxa are those which are possibly extinct. Because new information indicated their current existence,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Asplenium fragile  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> insulare  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Asplenium fragile <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diplazium molokaiense  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> were given category 1 status in the 1990 notice. In that notice,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ctenitis squamigera  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was still considered a category 1* species. However, because this species was rediscovered within the past 3 years, it is included in this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on petitions that present substantial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of these taxa was warranted, but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the Service to consider the petition as having been resubmitted, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Publication of the proposal to list the species constituted the final 1-year finding for these four taxa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 24, 1993, the Service published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 34231) a proposal to list these four ferns from the Hawaiian Islands as endangered. This proposal was based primarily on information supplied by the Hawaii Heritage Program and observations by botanists and naturalists. With the publication of this final rule, the Service determines these four ferns from the Hawaiian Islands to be endangered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>
